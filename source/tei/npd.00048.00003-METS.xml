Basinger, General Passenger Agent; W. D. Lincoln, Vice-President. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner: This complaint, which charges inadequate passenger train service on defendant's branch line from Columbus to Albion, was filed on July 10, 1915. Before the matter could be brought to hearing, a rehearing was asked for by defendant in Formal Complaint No. 243, wherein we had required the installation of a motor train between Columbus and Spalding. This 1 motion was granted and as the case involved many of the same factors as in the complaint herein, request was made for postponement of the hearing until the Spalding case was finally deter - mined. After a decision had been handed down in the Spalding case, reaffirming the original order for the installation of an additional train. the complaint herein was revived. Hearing was had at Albion on June XT, 1916. In the meantime, however, a third complaint (D. O. Nichol - son et al. vs. Union Pacific Railroad Co., Formal Complaint No. 335) was filed alleging inadequate passenger service on defendant's branch from Columbus to Norfolk. Inasmuch as the service on all three branches is more or less related through the common Junction at Columbus, a conference of all parties was called. As a result of this conference, defendant agreed to change the western terminus 1 of a main line local train from Grand Island to Albion, thus providing the patrons of the Albion branch with the service they desired. This service was installed and proved to meet all requirements of com - plainants. FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 283 </seg>

Commissioner This complaint charges defendant with discrimination in the appor - tionment of cars for hay loading at Elm Creek and Cozad, Nebraska. It was filed on January 12, 1917, and hearing was had on January 19, 1917. Relief was asked under the provisions of sections 5980, 5981, 5982, 5983, 5984 and 5984a, Revised Statutes of Nebraska. At the time of the filing of the complaint tbe legislature of 1917 was engaged in the consideration of legislation for the regulation of car distribution and shortly thereafter enacted a law which repealed all of the above named sections and completely changed the basis for the apportionment of care. (Chapter 221, Laws of Nebraska for 1917.) tThe pending legislation prompted the Commission to postpone &gt;n on this case, and tbe subsequent change in the law made a ng and order fruitless.

Delay was. for the most part, caused </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 by the fact that the country was engaged in war and its man power and finances were needed to draw it to a successful conclusion. At the time of the hearing stipulation was read into the record agreeable to both parties, the purport of which will be embodied in this 1 order. The order was not earlier entered because the stipulation was being com - plied with and because of the press of other work. Complainant asks that the defendants furnish the depot at Emerald with more suitable facilities for transacting business, properly heating at proper times, establishing and maintaining an agent during reason - able business hours and generally to improve the depot facilities. The original complaint was made against the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company alone. Afterwards the operation of the railroads by the federal government made it necessary that the director general representing the President of the United States be made a party and this was done February 15, 1919, on the Commission's own motion. The railroad company voluntarily proposed of record the fol - lowing compromise: "The railroad company offers to employ an agent, who will be Mr. Jarnis. who will be at the station to meet passenger trains and will be authorized to issue hilling and live stock contracts. For this purpose it may be necessary to go to his place of business, which is a half block distant. He will be authorized to make the irnal record of freight cars arriving and departing from the station and the loading and unloading record and attend to the sealing of cars and making such record that a proper demurrage account will bo made. This will not include the selling of tickets. He will be anpointed as express agent, with the usual duties attendant thereon. Tliis will not change the fact that Emerald is a prepaid station, but frright and express not prepaid will be unloaded. He will be authorized to collect charges. The night operator now maintained at paid station will be maintained in the future the same as in the past. As to the depot building, we will see that that is kept tn a sanitary condition and to accommodate the public." In the general discussion which followed, the complaint was brought out that the depot was left unheated even in the winter time, at least half the time, that it was impossible for those desiring to take the local passenger to know whether the train was 1 on time or late, that great discomfort resulted and that collect freight was usually carried past to the first agency station and an extra charge was made in send - ing it back to Emerald. The railroad company emphasized the points of the stipulation above to the effect that the depot would be properly heated at all proper times and that a positive order would be issued requiring freight to be unloaded whether prepaid or not, the charges to be col - lected by the representative of the company there located. It was finally agreed that complainants, who at the time of the hearing represented several business patrons at Emerald, would try out the offer of the company and that if carried out in good faith, the main objections to existing conditions would be relieved. </seg>

It is the county seat of Webster county. There are seven other cities and villages in the county of from 200 to 1,000 population each and the county is well settled with prosperous farmers. Telephone service was first estab - lished in the county at Red Cloud in 1899. The plant was built by the Nebraska Telephone company, hereinafter referred to as the Nebraska company, and was confined to the city, connected, however, with the toll line system of that company. Subsequently, and because of the </seg>
            <seg id="p138">TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT 138 EmI of the Nebraska company to build lines into the surrounding tory. the farmers built a system of their own with an exchange ted outside of the city. Negotiations with the Nebraska company switching service failed because of the refusal of the farmers to 1 their lines to the Nebraska company's exchange. In 1904 a number of the business men of Red Cloud co-operated with the farmers in establishing an exchange in the city for the pur - pose of giving switching service to the farmers' system and local serv - ice in the city. The company was incorporated under the name of the Farmers Independent Telephone company, hereinafter referred to as the Fanners company, and stockholders were permitted to furnish their own lines and instruments, and to receive service on a switching basis at a discount from the regular rates of fifty cents per month where both line and instrument were furnished and twenty-five cents in case of instrument only. Regular rates were fixed at $1.50 for business and fl.bo for residence without regard to individual or party service, of which there was a considerable mixture. The stockholders' private in - vestments in lines and instruments at the beginning amounted to an average of $8.00 for a line and drop and $15.00 for an instrument. The facilities thus privately owned were to be maintained by the owners, but this has been done only in the case of instruments' and batteries. The lines have been maintained by the company without any remuner - ation or reimbursement of cost. In 1910 the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, hereinafter referred to as the Lincoln company, extended its southern Nebraska toll line system into Red 'Cloud and connected it with the -Farmers company exchange under a written contract for an indefinite time con - taining various terms and conditions. In 1912 the Lincoln company purchased the Red Cloud exchage of the Nebraska company along with a number of other exchanges and all of the toll line system located in southern Nebraska. As this gave the Lincoln company two toll lines Into Red Cloud — one connected with the Farmers company exchanse and the other with the exchange bought by it from the Nebraska com - pany — the Lincoln company naturally sought to discontinue one of these lines, and because of the better construction of the line bought from the Nebraska company, it decided to dismantle the other. It offered to connect the two exchanges at Red Cloud with a trurk line in order to give the Farmers company long distance service, but this was not acceptable to the Farmers company. Recourse was then had to the Commission for permission to make the proposed substitution, which permission was granted. (L. T. &amp; T. Co. vs. Farmers Independent Telephone Co., 1915, N. S. R. C. Rep., p. 161). This left both of the companies with an exchange in Red Cloud, connected with each other by a trunk line to be used for long distance purposes only. The Lin - coln company had about 300 subscribers located in the city, and the Farmers company had about 165 subscribers similarly located The Farmers company had an advantage, however, in that it was connected </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NKBRAsSKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 139 with about 370 switching subscribers located in the surrounding terri - tory. The local facilities of both of the companies were of the grounded magneto type, and each went on its way taking on such business as came to it without much solicitation. Both of the exchanges had separate toll line connections with all of the remaining towns in the county, the exchanges in which were owned and operated by inde - pendent companies. In the latter part of 1917 the Lincoln company de - cided to change its plant to common battery metallic type and entered upon an active campaign for additional business. Its monthly rates were $2.00 to $2.50 per month for mercantile service and $1.00 to $1.50 for residence service. The Farmers company rates were $1.50 and $1.00 for mercantile and residence service respectively, with rebates of 25 cents and 50 cents per month to stockholders as previously shown. The Farmers company service was very poor and the Lincoln company's solicitor argued for the substitution of his company's service with considerable effect. The campaign appealed more strongly, however, to the general desire for but one exchange, and because of local ownership of the Farmers company, public sentiment settled on that company's plant as the one that ought to survive. The business men, who were the chief sufferers of the dual service, organized and offered to patronize the Farmers company exclusively if it would convert its system to common battery metallic. The Farmers company accepted the proposition and took the necessary preliminary steps to change its plant, whereupon eighty of the subscribers of the Lincoln company's service, who were paying approximately $1 800 in rentals annually, amounting to 40 per cent of the total revenues of the exchange, immediately discontinued the service. The Lincoln company then severed the trunk line con - nection between the two exchanges, thus depriving the Farmers com - pany subscribers of long distance service through their own instru - ments. The Farmers company thereupon asked the Commission for an order restoring this connection, which was granted on the showing that the action of the Lincoln company was without the authority of the Commission. The matter now before the Commission arose in connection with the Farmers company's complaint referred to. Two petitions in inter - vention were filed in that proceeding by subscribers to the service of both companies. The petitions alleged that the operation and mainte - nance of two telephone systems separate from each other as to local service was unreasonable and unjust to the public both as to service and rates. One of the petitioners prayed that an interchange of service be provided between the subscribers of both companies upon such terms as the Commission might find just and reasonable; the other prayed for a physical consolidation of the two systems under one owner - ship or management. The petitions in intervention were treated as original complaints and separate from the trunk line proceeding. The Farmers company </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 TWELFTH ANNl'AL REPORT Is answer to the petitions by denying the Jurisdiction of the Com- Ion to grant any of the relief sought for beyond the interchange of distance messages 1 which it was already giving and desired to con - i giving. It was alleged that to require more than a trunk line ection for long distance service would destroy its business and the ice of its property in contravention of the provisions of the state federal constitutions against the taking of private property with - compensation. The Lincoln company filed an answer and cross - ion which likewise denied the authority of the Commission to grant loner's prayers. In addition, it alleged that it had already suffered a considerable loss in its local exchange business by reason of the connection between the two exchanges and that If required to main - tain the connection in the future, it would suffer the loss of practically mil of its local business and depreciate the value of its local plant .to a scrap basis. The prayer of the cross-petition was for permission to discontinue the connection between the two exchanges. The Farmers company replied to the Lincoln company's cross-petition alleging an estoppel by the Lincoln company by reason of the Commission's order restoring the connection, and alleging further that the maintenance of the connection is protected by the written contract between the com - panies mentioned above. tThe matter went to a hearing, at which evidence was presented ring the entire history of the two plants and including accounting physical valuation studies of both properties by representatives of Commission. I Dealing first with the question of the maintenance of the trunk connection between the two exchanges: The objection that it is re« judicata Is not well taken for the rea - son that the only ground upon which the Commission ordered the con - nection restored was that the severance was made without first apply - ing to the Commission and securing its permission. The law does not permit common carriers under the Jurisdiction of the Commission to re - duce the service without the Commission's consent, and that not having been secured by the Lincoln company prior to the severance, the order to restore the connection followed as a matter of course; but this did not preclude the Lincoln company from applying to the Commission for the necessary consent, especially as it had complied with the Commission's order to restore the connection. The objection in this respect is, therefore, overruled. tThe further objection as to the existence of a valid contract be - m the two companies providing for the toll line connection is not ;rial In view of the position taken by the Commission that the lection shall continue. It should be said in passing, however, that contract referred to was made after the conferring of exclusive tnal jurisdiction over the service of common carriers upon the mission. The Commission's powers are not limited, therefore, by contract and insofar as the contract may be at variance with the </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 141 needs of the service as determined by the Commission, it may be superseded. The Lincoln company's objection that it should not be required to continue the connection between the exchanges for the reason that the effect is to confiscate its property, is of considerable importance. The evidence shows that the business lost by the Lincoln company in the latter part of 1917 would have been retained largely if it had been able to permanently deny long distance service over the trunk line connecting the two exchanges to the departing subscribers, and that a considerable portion of the company's remaining exchange business will be lost if the connection is maintained in the future without condition. As has been noted, the business lost in 1917 amounted to $1,800 annually. The revenues and expenses of the Lincoln company's ex- change since purchasing the plant in 1912 are as follows: Year Revenues Expenses' Net Income 1912 (11 mo.) $ 4.970 $ 3 800 $ 1,170 1913 5,328 4,442 886 1914 5,030 4,021 1,009 1915 4,920 4,253 667 • 1916 5,100 4,632 468 1917 4.862 6,462 1,600 Deficit Total $30,210 $27,610 $ 2.600 The apparently abnormal expenses 1 during 1917 were due to a partial reconstruction of the plant in that year. The company claims that allowance should be made for unrealized depreciation in each of the years noted in an amount equal to 7 per cent per annum of the cost of the plant, but inasmuch as the cost of defraying realized deprecia- tion is not shown separate from the other costs, the Commission is unable to determine what is a proper allowance for unrealized de- preciation. The expenditures for current repairs and replacements may have equaled or exceeded the normal amount required for mainte- nance and depreciation throughout the years, in which event no allow- ance should be made for future use; and the presumption from the age and condition of the plant prior to conversion is that the expenditures for this purpose were abnormally high. The cost of the plant to the Lincoln company during each of the years mentioned and up to June 1, 1918, was shown to be as follows: Purchase price February 1, 1912 $10,267.02 Net deductions in 1912 100.45 Cost January 1, 1913 10.166.57 Net additions in 1913 24.01 Cost January 1, 1914 10,190.58 Net additions in 1914 4.41 Cost January 1, 1915 10,194.99 </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT The Commission's engineer reported an original construction cost »of February, 1918, of $24,622.45, based on unit prices composed in t of the company's recent invoice prices and part of the invoice U of plants constructed contemporaneously with the older portion the Red Cloud plant. The additions reported by the company for 1918 were largely finished at the time of the valuation. The present depreciated value was reported as $19,964.95. The record does not show the whole amount of the investment of the Nebraska Telephone company in the plant during the period of its ownership, nor the sources of the Investment. It does show that the sum of $10,402.45 was expended from the beginning of the plant in 1899 to 1905, inclusive. Some additions and betterments were made Ithe plant subsequent to that time but the cost was commingled h. maintenance expenditures and could not be separated at this time. ) number of subscribers increased from two hundred in 1905 to three hundred in 1912, which indicates that the additions made during that period were considerable. The Nebraska company's investment was therefore more than the price for which the property was sold to the Lincoln company in 1912, and that it came from capital funds and not from surplus earnings is in accord with the general practice of that rpany as established in other matters before the Commission. The money expended by the Lincoln company for additions and Erments since it acquired the plant were not taken from surplus ngs as there have been none. The net income for the period a above did not yield a reasonable return upon the property. The iln company's investment is therefore shown correctly in the cost nent above bet forth. The total investment of $24,603.67, or at the present value of the property as found by the Commission's engineers, viz., $19,964.95, represents the property threatened with con- fiscation by the circumstances of this case. The evidence shows that the Lincoln company's revenues from the I petty have fallen below the expenses of operating and maintaining and taxes, to say nothing of a return. Present revenues amount to iut $3,500 per annum, while the expenses exceed $5,000. Revenues decreased at the rate of $1,800 annually in the latter part of 1918 rusly noted.

The increased cost of labor and materials since that period would considerably increase this average. There is a loss of property here beyond doubt. A portion of the investment is being lost every year. The question is: to what is it due? The immediate cause of the loss is the action of the company's patrons in discontinuing the service previously referred to. This boy - cott was not made on account of any fault in the Lincoln company's service but because the Farmers company, to whom alone these former patrons decided to give their local telephone business had a greater number of local subscribers than the Lincoln company and offered to give the same class of local service furnished by the Lincoln company, and in addition thereto long distance service over the wires of the Lin - coln company by means of a trunk line connection between the two exchanges at Red Cloud. It does not appear, however, that the Lincoln company would have lost any subscribers if all the Farmers company had to offer in the way of service was local to Red Cloud and vicinity. In fact, the retention of this long distance service was a material ele - ment of the agreement to patronize the Farmers company exclusively, and as previously noted the Farmers company invoked the power of the Commission to secure the service. The Lincoln company contends, and the Farmers company admitted through its secretary, that one of the effects of the retention of this long distance service in connection with the improved local service of the Farmers company will be to secure for the Farmers company practically all of the local telephone service in the community. It is apparent, therefore, that the Commission should not and cannot in law order the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company to continue to furnish long distance service to patrons of the Farmers company as such, unless it can prevent the Farmers company from furnishing local service to the Lincoln company's subscribers who dis - continue the latter service when it is available to them. Otherwise, the Lincoln company will be without much of its local business and its exchange property will greatly depreciate in value. The company would, under such circumstances, be required to contribute to its own undoing — to place part of its property at the service of a competing company and thus arm it to the destruction of the remainder of the property, and unless the Commission can effectively prevent such de - struction it must yield to the constitutional rights of the Lincoln com - pany and permit it to discontinue the trunk line connection between the two exchanges and thus terminate long distance service to all of the Farmers company subscribers. The Commission took cognizance of this situation early in these proceedings and issued an order on July 5, 1918, prohibiting the Farmers company from "furnishing or supplying telephone service by means of individual telephone instruments to any of the present local </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 subscribers of the Lincoln Telephone ft Telegraph company located In the city of Red Cloud, Nebraska, who may hereafter discontinue the individual telephone service now furnished to them by said Lincoln Telephone ft Telegraph company," and prohibiting the Lincoln Tele - phone ft Telegraph company from furnishing similar service to the subscribers of the Farmers company severing connection with that company other than "such persons or corporations as may have been subscribers to the local exchange service of the Lincoln company on and after September 15, 1917." This order was limited to the pendency of the matter before the Commission. The order went beyond protect - ing the Lincoln company alone and extended the same protection to the Farmers company, on the theory that both of the parties were entitled to the same treatment. It left the Lincoln company free to secure the return of the subscribers who had left It under the agree - ment to patronize the Farmers company exclusively, and it protected both companies in their former relationship; and it left both companies free to compete for wholly new business — new users of the service. The Farmers company objects to this order on the ground that it operates as a restraint upon competition and is, therefore, illegal. It does not agree, however, to a severance of the long distance service. The Commission is referred to no authority supporting the claim to free and unregulated competition between public service corporations' competing in the same field, but it is argued that the right is recog - nized by the genius and fundamental nature of our institutions. This is doubtless true in industries wherein experience has shown that competition gives the best results, but it Is now well established that public utilities do not lie in this field. Competition in the domain of public service failed and regulation came in response to public demand for better results; and regulation is succeeding. It may be slow but the work is laborious, dealing as it does with complex situations 1 and covering wide fields. I The limits of regulation are those of the public interest in the ty, subject to the constitutional guarantees relating to property, said by the Florida Supreme Court in State v. Atlantic Coast i R. Co., 56 Fla. 617, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 639: "The right to regulate extends to every phase of the service and to every act of the carrier corporation that affects the service, either as to its promptness and adequacy and equality to all under - lying circumstances, or as to the compensation for the service. Whatever affects the public is subject to reasonable regulation by governmental authority in the interest of the public. The limit of the regulation is the reasonable requirements of the public service undertaken or engaged in to meet the Just demands of the public to be served." In substance the Commission's power is limited only by the reason - able needs of the public and the resources of the utility. Every act necessary to reasonably accommodate the public may be ordered done, </seg>

The nection between the two exchange ascertain the identity of the party r entire body cf the Fanners comp called on to suffer a reduction in I may enlarge its business at will. T ny subscribers will therefore be ervice in order that the company record shows no consent by the subscribers to such a situation. In fact, the public demand is for a yet wider service. It is for an interchange of service locally betweon the two properties in addition to long distance service. There is even much support in the record for a physical consolidation of th" prop - erties, and there would doubtless be more but fir the antagonism of the Farmers company's sfcckholdr-rs numbering; over 300, and the legal obstacles in the way of completirg consolidation. The Commission is of the opinion that it lacks power to order a physical consolidation of the properties. It would require comparatively little material and labor to make the two plants one, as the two exchanges are less than five hundred feet apart. The Commission's engineer estimated the cost of running all of the wires into the Farmers company's exchange and providing additional switchboard facilities at $2,270 and the Lincoln company's exchange at $2,"il8. with no allow - ance for salvage values of property displaced. However, consolidation requires a single control and management of both properties in order to successfully operate them as a single system. It requires taking the control and possession of one of the properties from the owner and placing it with the owner of the other property, or placing the control and possession of both properties in a body of trustees or in a new corporation created for the purpose. There is precedent for some such disposition of the matter in the act of the New York legislature which took away the right of the stockholders of the Equitable Life Assurance Society and vested it in the policyholders. It was' done by amending the corporation's charter. The law was upheld by the courts and the decision is interesting as a possible addition to the public utility law governing competing utilities'. We quote as follows frcm the opinion: "Why. then, if the Legislature should deem It imprudent to trust these assets and the corporate business to the directors chosen by the representatives of the $100,000 of the original capital stock, should there be any question as to the authority of the sovereign power cf the state to change the method of electing directors? The stockholders would not be deprived of any prop - erty^ they would still have their stock; they would still have the </seg>
            <seg id="p146">TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT 146 right to participate in the assets of the corporation to the extent of their holding's in the event of the corporation going into dis - solution; they would still have a right to participate in the choice of directors; they would still have equitable rights which the courts might protect in the event of abuses in the management of the company; they would have all of the rights which they now have, except the right of the representatives of $100,000 of idle capital to control the millions of dollars of assets of the defendant which are dedicated to the interests of polieyholders. and in this they would have a voting power all out of proportion to the amount of their investment. What is there in this inconsistent with the right of the legislature to amend the charter and to take from the stockholders' a portion of their powers over the affairs of a cor - poration in which so many are vitally and financially interested? There is no presumption that directors elected by policyholders would be false to their trusts, or that they would arbitrarily exert their power, even though they constituted a majority of the board. They would still be charged with the duty of honestly managing the affairs of the corporation in the interests of the corporation; it would still be their duty to administer thp funds belonging to the corporation under the letter and the spirit of the law. and every dollar's worth of stock would be owned by the same persons who own it now, or their assigns, and the stockholders would have the same property interest in the corporation that they now have. Surely, it may not be said that it is not within the reserve power of the state to so regulate the internal affairs of one of its own creations that the creature may not be compelled to carry out in good faith the purposes for which it was creatnd. and what is necessary in this regard is within the discretion of the legislature." It is obvious that duplication of telephone utilities in a limited Held, such as we find here, is not desirable from any standpoint, even though an interchange of service be provided between the subscribers to the two services, and with monthly rates of pa7. There is the impediment to meesages due to passing through two switchboard? and If rates are to be made sufficient in amount to operate and maintain both plants, and pay a fair return on their value, many persons desir - ing: the service will be prevented from getting it because of financial inability. Such situations usually prove disastrous to the owners of the plants involved, as the rates necessary to financial success are greater than the traffic will bear. The additional limitation upon rates then comes into play, namely, the value of the service, measured not by its value to certain individual users, possibly few in number, but to the whole body of the people who are in reasonable need of the service, and rates established upon such a basis are not likely to be com - pensatory. A utility's first duty is to give service to those in the com - munity occupied by it that are in reasonable need of the service, and It will not be heard to say that the maximum rates such persons are able and willing to pay is not compensatory. The Commission regrets that it is unable to order a physical con - solidation of the properties involved herein, but it has the power to order an interchange of service between the two plants. The inter - change will require the installation of at least two additional trunk </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 lines between the two exchanges and the employment of at least one and possibly two additional operators by each company. The sub - scribers' rates will be increased sufficient to cover the cost of the unified service, including a return upon the additional plant necessary. The additional property necessary, according to the record, con - sists of four metallic circuits, five hundred feet long, with which to connect the two exchanges, and the Commission's engineer estimates the cost of these circuits, including connections with the switchboards, at $50. Nine per cent of this cost for maintenance and depreciation and 7 per cent for return, or $8.00, constitutes the annual charge on account of property. Assuming that four additional operators are necessary (two for each company), the allowance for this purpose is $480 per operator per annum, or $1,920. making the total annual cost of the unified service $1,528. This is for division among 124 business subscribers, 404 residence and farm subscribers and 361 switching sub - scribers of both companies, according to the value of the additional service. Doubtless a number of duplicate instruments will be discon - tinued under the new system and the estimates of revenues to be de - rived from the additional charge should be liberal. The new service will be of the most benefit to the business 1 subscribers because many of them are now subscribers of both companies and will be able to discontinue one of them, and because telephone service is practically indispensable in carrying on business. It will also be of more value to residence than to switching subscribers as the former live in town and the latter in the country; and the latter are now connected with the Farmers company almost altogether and are quite well satisfied with the present service. Additional rates of 75 cents per month for business, 20 cent? for residence and 10 cents for switching based on the present number of subscribers will yield $2,518.80 per annum. This is $590.80 in excess of the estimated cost of the consolidated service but the excess is not greater in all probability than the loss likely to result from the discontinuance of duplicate subscribers. The new rates are probably as high as the traffic will bear, however, and if any loss results it would have to be borne by the competing companies under this rule. The loss of subscribers due to the abandonment of duplicate telephones should be borne equally by the companies, so as to be in harmony with the order requiring long distance service.

For Complainant— J. W. Shorthill, H. A. Lindley and R. Y. Barnes. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner The original complaint in this case charged the Union Pacific with discrimination in the distribution of grain cars as between shippers at the station of Chappell. A hearing was had on February 7, 1918, and an order issued on March 2, 1918. This order provided for an appor - tionment of grain cars as between the Deuel County Elevator company and the Farmers Elevator company on the basis of 37.5 per cent to the former and 62.5 per cent to the latter. To this finding the Farmers Elevator company subsequently objected and on July 9, 1918, asked for a re-opening of the case. The matter was heard on July 22, 1918. At about the time this case was heard, or shortly thereafter, the federal government, through the Food Administration, took over the </seg>

The effect of this was to sus - pend all the normal methods of car distribution and to set aside for the time being the rules and regulations governing the same. In addi - tion to this, the anticipated shortage of cars did not materialize, owing to the small crop and other conditions. These causes made the issuance of an order in this case unnecessary and fruitless. I Conditions are constantly changing in the grain business, as in the nsportation situation. But little grain is moving at this time and &gt;re are plenty of cars for its transportation. The need for an order this record has, therefore, passed. Moreover, a finding made on the ts as they were presented at the time of the hearing in this case ?ht not meet conditions that may develop in the future, in the event another car shortage. For these reasons, the motion for a modifica - n of the original order will be denied.

He ires telephone service and has made application to defendant for nection with its lines, but has been refused. He now asks this nmission to require defendant to furnish him with telephone service the same conditions as it furnishes such service to the members of association. Defendant resists the complaint on the ground that it lot a common carrier within the meaning of that term and hence within the jurisdiction of this Commission, and for the further </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 151 reason that there are now ten people on the line involved and that no more should be added if good service is to be maintained. There is but little controversy as to the facts. It is shown by the record that Doxstader has made application for telephone service from defendant upon more than one occasion, offering to buy stock in the association and pay such assessments as are levied upnn the other members. As an alternative he has offered to pay rental for service and remain out of the company. The line with which he desires con - nection runs along two sides of his farm and within a few fset of his house, the poles for the same being placed in the public highway, and in some instances upon the property line. He was promised service at one time, but at the meeting of the company, held to act upon his application, his request was denied. Two of the present members of the company have been given service since he first applied, and In order to S3rve one of these the line was built past complainant's home. There are two other telephone lines in the neighborhood, but one i - two miles and the other one mile from his home. He has made appli - cation for service to both but the expense of building the greater dis - tance and the existence of a line so much closer has made it impossible for him to secure connection with either of these lines. Defendant is not an incorporated company, being merely an association of individuals with an informal organization consisting of a president, secretary and treasurer. The line was built by joint contributions and is maintained through annual assessments pro rated among the members. It Is con - nected with the exchange of the Nebraska Telephone company at Nor - folk, from which it secures switching service not only between its own members but with all of the patrons connected with that exchange. In addition, it has access to the extensive toll service of the Nebraska Telephone company. It pays the Nebraska Telephone company $3.00 per year per member for switching service, and the regular toll rates of that company for any long distance messages. As previously stated, defendant raises the question that it is net a common carrier under the law and that this Commif ;ion is without power for that reason to make an order requiring the furnishing of service to complainant. This precise question has been before the Com - nii-sion once before in Gardner vs. Archer Independent Telephone Asso - ciation, N. S. R. C. R. 1914. 111. In that case, we concluded that the Commibsion was without jurisdiction, basing our finding on a ruling of the attorney general to whem the question was referred. The opinion of the attorney general follows: "Gentlemen: Your communication of September 5th has here- tofore been answered by me orally, but a further request is made by you that the same be answered in writing. Your question is as follows: "'Does this Commission have authority to compel a miitti.nl telephone company, us distinguished from a common carrier, to ex - tend its lines within the limits of the territory which it prev.m- </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT ably occupies to the exclusion of other companies, upon demand of prospective patrons who are willing to comply with the governing rules of said mutual company?' "The record of the evidence, which you have furnished me, shows that this company does not purpose doing a business gen - erally, but it limits its busines to its own members and does not undertake to serve the public generally for hire. "On November 18, 1910. I advised your department that a tele phone company organized solely for private purposes, or for the purpose of accommodating its own members and which is prohibited by its articles of incorporation from renting telephones to the public or in any manner serving the public, does not come under the pro - visions of law which requires the State Railway Commission to au - thorize it to issue stock bonds, and other forms of indebtedness. "On April 11, 1911, I further advised your department that pri - vate telephone lines, constructed for the convenience of the owners and not for hire to the public, do not come within the requirements of the physical valuation act. "If the company referred to by you was undertaking to serve the public for hire, it would be amenable to both of the provisions 1 referred to in these two former communications. But, as I under - stand the record, it does not undertake to serve the public, and hence, is not a public carrier or a public service corporation in the sense in which these terms are used in the statutes. "The record shows that for this company to do what is required of it would entail an expenditure of several hundred dollars, and I know of no way by which this money could be raised except by compelling each member of this association of private lines to sub - mit to an assessment for that purpose. I have looked among the authorities for a case similar to this, and have been unable to find one. "I know it is argued that because some of the lines of this as - sociation occupy the public highways, this company ought to b« compelled to put in lines, connect up. and furnish service to any person located near by and wishing the same. But, on the other hand, this company has refused to offer its lines to the public for compensation. Having refused to do this, I know of no rule or au - thority by which I could advise that your Commission order this company to extend its lines upon the demands of prospective patrons. Should you make such an order, I know of no adjudica - tion which might sustain it or methods by which it might be en - forced. Yours very truly GRANT C. MARTIN, Attorney General." I In view of the circumstances of that case, which were in all re - acts similar to those involved here, the Commission was reluctant to &gt;pt the opinion of the attorney general, although feeling constrained that time to do so. We said: "While accepting this construction of the law. which exempts mutual organirations from the obligations imposed upon individuals and corporations who engage in the same class of business for profit, the Commission is convinced that its application in cases of this kind leads to substantial injustice. Whether the state should permit a certain number of Individuals In a community to associate themselves together for the purpose of securing telephone service, such association having unrestricted power to limit its number of </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 153 members, while at the same time it occupies the field to the exclu - sion of all other companies, is a broad question of public Interest which should command thoughtful consideration. If defendant were engaged in the business of furnishing telephone service for a com - pensation, the authority of the Commission to require it to furnish such service to all within the zone It covers would be unquestioned. The state permits a common carrier reasonable compensation for the service it performs, but in return demands that this service must be extended without discrimination to all who may apply, pro - vided the circumstances incident to the extension of such service do not entail an excessive expense or are not contrary to customary and reasonable practice. If the defendant in this case were a com - mon carrier it would not be a proper defense to this complaint to plead extra expense incident to the placing of cross-arms on the line in question, for the reason that such an improvement would be in line with the natural growth of the plant and a proper method. from an engineering standpoint, of meeting such development. The company would rebuild the line to accommodate the added business just as it would replace a small switchboard with a larger one if the traffic increased to a point where it became necessary to do so; and it would be within the discretion of the Commission to require it to do so if for any reason it declined. In the case under con - sideration, however, forty-four people join in an agreement to secure telephone service on certain terms and by so doing make it prac - tically impossible for any other individual or corporation to engage in the same business in the same territory. At the same time these forty-four citizens refuse to extend the service thus provided to other citizens, and the latter by reason of this fact are perma - nently cut off from the privileges and benefits of telephone com - munication. While the forty-four individuals have joined In a part - nership for the conduct of a private business, yet they have made use of the public highways and to that extent enjoy a franchise which subjei ts them to a gi eater or less degree of public control and supervision, the grant, at the same time, carrying with it an obligation to the public which should be satisfied in a manner that is without color of discrimination. "It Is without any desire to minimize the benefits that flow from the organization of mutual companies that the Commission directs attention to this condition. Community co-operation in enterprises of this character is frequently highly desirable. In fact, there la reason for believing that it has been beneficial in this particular community. It is only when the co-operation benefits a certain number of people to the exclusion of others that it becomes a matter for public regulation. The matter is of sufficient importance that the Commission is of the opinion that it should be called to the attention of the next legislature for such consideration and remedy as that body may deem proper and wise. "For the reasons referred to the complaint will be dismissed." Frequent informal complaints concerning this situation have kept the matter before the Commission Since that time. With the passing of time and the development of communities the situation becomes more aggravated. It appears, therefore, that a reconsideration of the juris - dictional question is advisable. This Commission was created by the people of the state through an amendment to the constitution, and its powers and duties are defined in </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT the following terms: "The powers and duties of such commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as th9 legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation the commission shall exercise the powers and per - form the duties enumerated in this provision." A "common carrier" is defined by Section 6124, Revised Statutes, 1913. as follows: "The term 'common carriers' as used herein shall be taken to include all corporations, companies, individuals and association of individuals, their lessees or receivers, appointed by any court what - soever, that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any railroad, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or electricity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of messages or trans - portation of passengers or freight for hire." This section of the statute has been construed by the supreme court In but one case. State vc. Union Stock Yards Co., 81 Neb. G7. The first paragraph of the syllabus of that case contains a condensed statement of the facts and is as follows: "A stock yards company has about 35 miles of railway track, in - cluding what is known as a 'transfer track,' constructed upon its own premises. Several private Industries are conducted adjacent to the premises of the company. The transfer track connects with the track of several railway lines running to the city where the stock yards are located. The stock yards company is engaged in the carrying of freight in carload lots. Cars billed to the stock yards, or to the industries adjacent thereto, are placed on the transfer track by the railway company over whose line the car is shipped, and from there are hauled by the stock yards company with its own engines to the pens or sheds in the yards or to the industries which are to receive the freight. Outgoing cars are hauled by the stock yards company to the transfer track, where they are received by the railway company. The railway companies for whom such serv - ice is- rendered are charged $1 a car therefor. It does not deal with the general public, but only with the railway companies whose lines connect with the transfer line and with the industries located upon its premises, and with the consignees and consignors of live stock who receive shipments or load shipments in its yards. It transports freight in cars over its own tracks from one industry upon its lines to another. It is not engaged in the production of commodities. Its vocation is purely one of service to others, and, with the ex - ception of feeding live stock in transit, the service rendered is the transportation of freight. Held, That such stock yard company is a common carrier within the meaning of the constitutional amend - ment adopted at the general election in 1906 and chapter 90 of the laws of 1907." After quoting the section of the statute above noted, the Court the phrase 'any other carrier engaged in the trans- mission of messages or transportation of freight for hire' means only such companies' as by their public profession hold themselves </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 155 out to the world as engaged in the vocation of transmitting mes - sages, or transporting passengers or freight for hire, and as willing to perform such services for any person who may have occasion to employ them." In further defining the term "common carrier" the Court adds: "Any person or corporation holding itself out to the public as 1 offering its services to all persons similarly situated, and perform - ing as its public vocation the services of transporting passengers, freight or intelligence, is a common carrier in the particular spheres of such employment." Having in mind the definition prescribed by the statute and its in - terpretation by the supreme court, it appears necessary to determine whether defendant is a common carrier "for hire." Counsel very ably contends that defendant performs no service of any nature for com - pensation. It was organized solely as a means of securing telephone service for its own members and with no thought of conducting its affairs for profit. Its members pay only the necessary fee to che Nebraska Telephone company for switching service and the actual cost of maintaining its lines, which expenses are divided equally among its members. While its members have connection with the toll system of the Nebraska company they receive no part of the direct charge for such service. They are, counsel urges, merely individual users of tele - phones without power of determining the cost of the service they re - ceive. They did not organize for the purpose of furnishing service to the public nor do they hold themselves out as willing to extend their service to those who may apply. On their face the reasons advanced by counsel are persuasive. A closer scrutiny into the nature of the service performed by defendant, however, and a study of the relationship between it and the Nebraska Telephone company casts doubt upon the soundness of counsel's con - clusion. The Nebraska Telephone company is a common carrier. On that point there is no controversy. It furnishes local exchange service to several hundred subscribers at Norfolk and undertakes to provide all of the local service required by that community. In addition its ex - change is connected with its extensive toll system reaching all sections of the I'nRed States. We are confronted, therefore, with this question: Can a private individual or a group of private individuals construct a telephone line, connect that line with a common carrier company en - gaged in the telephone business- and not become an integral part of the common carrier system, subject to all the obligations flowing from the public interest attaching thereto? If the intimate relationship estab - lished between the private individual and the common carrier does not have the effect of changing the essential character of the thing the private individual does, then that question can be answered in the affirmative and our problem is solved. On the other hand if the private individual establishes a relationship with a common carrier whereby there is a mutual interchange of service, the individual at the same time performing a duty that would otherwise devolve upon the </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT Eon carrier, there is good reason to believe that the thing that was led to be private has come to be a public interest and is charged all the obligations that attach to the common carrier. In State vs. Union Stock Yards Co., supra, the supreme court of this state finds that a stock yards company which does not deal with the general public, but only with the railway companies with whose lines it connects and with certain industries and certain livestock shippers, is a common carrier. In this instance the stock yards com - pany receives cars' that have been placed on a transfer track by the railroads and switches them to various points in its yards. It also per - forms the reverse service of taking cars from its yards to the transfer track where they are turned over to the railroad having the road haul. Let us see whether this service differs in its essential aspects from that performed by defendant. A subscriber on the Norfolk exchange of the Nebraska Telephone company desires to communicate with one of the farmers served by defendant. Tho message is conveyed to the switchboard of the Nebraska Telephone company and there transferred to the line of defendant by whom it is delivered to its destination. The only difference in the two acts is that in the one instance a car is transferred, while in the other it is a message. If a public interest at - taches to the movement of the car it attaches in the same degree to the transmission of the message, the compensation involved or its dis - tribution between the parties performing the service having nothing to do with the essential character of the act performed. The subscriber of the Nebraska Telephone company, for the rate he pays, is entitled to demand that his message be delivered to any person served by de - fendant, that obligation being assumed by defendant when it entered into the arrangement for switching service with the Nebraska company. It follows that the members of defendant association have the reciprocal right to secure connection with subscribers of the Nebraska company. Indeed, the chief value that attaches to the connection with the Ne - braska company lies, not in the transferring of messages between mem - bers of the association, but in the opportunity it affords for communi - cation with all the telephone users of that community. Complainant is not bo desirous of securing connection with his neighbors as he is to have communication with the business men of Norfolk. With respect to toll service the similarity to the service performed by the stock yards company is even more striking. Here the message may orig - inate upon some telephone exchange in another state. It is carried to Norfolk and there put upon. the line of defendant for delivery to the person for whom it is intended, the delivery being performed in exactly the same manner as though the receiving party was a rental subscriber of the Nebraska company. In like manner, a member of the associa - tion can have transmitted from his telephone over the line in question and to the Nebraska company's switchboard a message for any point on the toll system of the latter company. For each of these services </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 he pays the legal toll rate of the Nebraska company. Can it be said that the acts thus performed by defendant are essentially private and affect only the ten members who compose the association? Rather Is not the whole of the telephone public concerned with the extent and character of the service these ten people have agreed to furnish. It may have been the intent of these ten individuals 1 at the outset to secure service only for themselves, and had they merely connected their own homes by wires and installed telephones, their acts would have remained essentially private. When they established connection, however, with a public utility doing a common carrier business, they became to all intents and purposes part and parcel of that common carrier. In The Tap Line Cases, 234 U. S. 1, the court held that a tap line railroad, built originally for the purpose of hauling logs and lumber of a particular mill to the junction with a trunk line railroad, was a com - mon carrier, notwithstanding the principal traffic consisted of the logs and lumber shipped by the owners of the mill. On this point the court says (quoting syllabus) : "Although a railroad may have originally been a mere plant facility, after it has been acquired by a common carrier duly organ - ized under the law of the state and performing service as such and regulated and operated under competent authority, it is no longer a plant facility but a public institution, even though the owner of the industry of which it was formerly an appendage is the prin - cipal shipper of freight thereover. The extent to which a railroad is in fact used does not determine whether it is or is not a com - mon carrier, but the right of the public to demand service of it." Even more positively the same court in Union Lime Co. vs. Chicago A North Western Ry Co., 233 U. S. 211, expressed the same thought. In that case the supreme court of Wisconsin sustained the extension of a spur track to reach the quarries and lime kilns of a single com - pany as a public use authorizing the exercise of the right of eminent domain, and the Judgment was affirmed. Dealing with the contention that the Wisconsin statute was invalid because it authorized action ap - propriating property upon the exigency of a private business, the court said (p. 221): "A spur may, at the outset, lead only to a single industry or establishment; it may be constructed to furnish an outlet for the products of a particular plant ; its cost may be defrayed by those in special need of its service at the time. But none the less, by virtue of the conditions under which it is provided, the spur may consti - tute at all times a part of the transportation facilities of the carrier which are operated under the obligations ot public service and are subject to the regulation of public authority." The court quotes with aproval the opinion of the supreme court of Wisconsin in a similar case, the reasoning of the Wisconsin Jurist being so much in point that we repeat it here: "Such track when built becomes a portion of the trackage of the railroad. The fact that its initial cost is borne by the party </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT primarily to be served, with provisions for subsequent equitable division of such cost, does not make it a private track nor change the nature of its use. Over it the products of the industry find their way into the markets of the world, and every consumer is directly interested in the lessened cost of such products resulting from the building and operation thereof. That these products are supplied by a single owner, or by a limited number of owners, affects the extent and not the nature of its use — the track is none the less a part of the avenue through which the commodities reach the public. Subject to the equitable division of initial cost, the track is at the service of the public as much as any other, and it constitutes an integral part of the railroad system." The state courts have, with scarcely an exception, held that spur tracks whether built to serve one or several industries and regardless of whether paid for by the industry, become a part of the railroad system with which they are connected and are subject to all the rights and obligations of a common carrier. DeCamp vs. Hibernia Railroad Co., 47 N. J. Law 43; C. B. A Q. R. R. Co. vs. Parker, 43 Minn. 527; Ulmer vs. Lime Rock R. R. Co., 98 Maine 579; Chicago Dock &amp; Canal Co. vs. Garrity, 115 111. 155; Chicago A North Western Ry. Co. vs More - house, 112 Wis. 1; National Dock R. R. Co. vs. Central Ry. Co.. 32 N. J. Eq. 755. In the latter case Justice Dixon. speaking for the court, observes: "Whether the motives of the corporators is private con - venience, and whether the actual use is likely to be general, are of no more importance than the like considerations in the laying out of what are called private roads. It is the right which characterizes the enterprise, and that is public." It should be borne in mind in this con - nection that the industry first building a spur track very often does not participate in any earnings derived from its use. In some instances freight charges are refunded to the extent of the original cost, but this practice has now been abandoned and the industry pays the regular freight rates charged other shippers. He receives no compensation from the use of the facility even when it is used by the carrier for the benefit of other shippers. The question of compensation is not essential to the determination of the proposition as to whether the track is subject to a public use. As we have seen, the courts adhere to the principle that though a business may have been started for the sole purpose of private benefit, Its use may become such as to affect it with a public interest. This principle is reaffirmed by the supreme court of the United States in German Alliance Insurance Co. vs. Kansas, 233 U. S. 389, where the court had before it the question as to whether the business of fire in - surance was charged with a sufficient public interest to bring it within the field of regulation by the state. After a discussion of the funda - mental principles of regulation and a review of the leading cases, the court says: "The cases need no explanatory or fortifying comment. They demonstrate that a busiuess, by circumstances and its nature, may rise from private to be of public concern and be subject, in conse- </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 quence, to governmental regulation. And they demonstrate, to ap - ply the language of Judge Andrews in People vs. Budd, 117 N. V. 1 that the attempts made to place the right of public regulation in the cases in which it has been exerted, and of which we have given ex - amples, upon the ground of special privilege conferred by the public on those affected cannot be supported. 'The underlying principle is that business of certain kinds holds such a peculiar relation to the public interests that there is superinduced upon it the right of public regulation.' " Nor dues the fact that the original promoters of the enterprise had no intention of engaging in a common carrier business determine whether or not they are conducting such a business. Indeed, they may specifically disclaim any purpose to engage in the business of a public - service corporation and still be held to be such because of the nature of the things they do. Terminal Taxicab Co. vs. District of Columbia, 241 U. S. 252. In this case a company organized to do a taxicab busin m in the city of Washington incorporated in its charter a provision that it was not to exercise any of the powers of a public service corpora - tion. "The important thing," says the court, "is what it does, not what its charter says." The court held the company to be a common carrier, saying: "The service affects so considerable a fraction of the public that it is public in the same sense in which any other may be called so. * • • The public does not mean everybody all the time." r matters not that the farmers who built the line involved in this ca-;. had no thought of engaging in a public utility business. When they connected their line with a public utility and agreed to an unlimit^l interchange of local messages, and when they consented to the use of their line for the transmission of long distance messages, their business rose from "private to be of public concern." State courts and commissions, passing directly on the question haw quite generally held that telephone companies or associations similar to the one involved here are public utilities and subject to regulation. Four cases involving the question have been decided by the supreme court of Illinois — State P. U. Com. ex rel. vs eBthany Mutual Telephone Association, 110 N. E. 334; State Public Utilities Commission ex rel. Noble Telephone Co. vs. Noble Mutual Telephone Co., 268 III. 411; Bun - combe Metallic Telephone Co. vs. McGinnis. 268 111. 504; State Public Utilities Commission ex rel. Pike County Telephone Co. vs. Noble, et al , 113 N. E. 910. In the first case cited the Public Utilities Commission ordered the Bethany Mutual Telephone Association to cease from constructing or maintaining a telephone system because it had not obtained from the Commission a certificate of convenience and necessity as provided for by the Illinois statutes. On appeal the court held that under the statutes the authority of the Commission was confined to control and supervision of owners and operators of property devoted to a public use. In determining that the Bethany company was not a public utility, the court apparently relied on the terms of its charter, the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT vision in question stating that the purpose of the corporation was "to be for the private us« of the members of the said association only, for the purpose of telephonic communication between them, for their private and community interests, and not for the pecuniary profit of any person or persons connected with said association, and not for the profit of any stockholder interested as owner of any interest in said corporation." The court observes that under this charter the use of the telephone system is limited strictly and solely to the members of the corpora - tion, and it has no authority, under the same, to erect or mantaln any telephone line for the service of the public. In our opinion the find - ing of the court, based as it appears to be solely on the terms of the charter is in direct conflict with the holding of the supreme court of the United States in The Taxicab Case, supra wherein it is stated em - phatically that the important thing is what the corporation does and not what "its charter says." That the Illinois court had in mind, how - ever, the nature of the service of the Bethany company as well as its charter Is indicated by its reference to Its earlier opinion in State P. U. C. ex rel. Noble Telephone Co. vs. Noble Mutual Telephone Co., supra, In which case it found that the mutual company involved was a public utility "because its lines connected with country Iine3 and other ex - changes In Richlar.d and surrounding counties, and it obtained and en- Joyed a license conditioned that no person should be barred from mem - bership and use of its lines." The facts are not stated in detail as to the exact character of the service furnished by the Bethany company, but it is a fair inference to conclude that the members of the company had service only between themselves and were not connected in any manner with a commercial company, either for local or long distance service. In that respect it differed from the Noble Mutual Telephone company which was connected with "country lines and other exchanges." With respect to that company, however, the court in that case holds it to be a public utility, notwithstanding it was "not a commercial com - pany organized for profit, but renders Eervice to its members at cost, and does not hold itself out to render service to anyone except mem - bers of the company." In further describing the character of its serv - ice, the court says: "The only connection it makes with other tele - phone companies is upon the basis of a mutual exchange of free serv - ice. Whi!e it will connect any of its members with a toll line for long-distance service, it makes no charge fcr such action and collects no toll, leaving the matter of the adjustment of the toll charges be - tween the members seeking such service and the toll "companies ren - dering the same." Section 10 of the Illinois Public Utilities act defines a public utility to mean and include every corporation, company, etc., that now or hereafter "(a) may own, control, operate or manage, within the state, directly or indirectly, for public use, any plant, equipment or property used or to be used for or in connection with the transportation of persons or property or the transmission of telegraph or telephone </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 161 messages between points within this state; • • • or that (b) may own or control any franchise, license, permit or right to engage in any such business." The court finds that under this statute "the mere fact that the Noble Mutual Telephone company is not operated for profit does not determine that it is not a public utility." While it will be noted that the Illinois statute does not contain the words "for hire," thus relieving the court of the necessity of interpreting such a phase, It is important to observe that the company is held to be a public utility. With respect to that phase the court says: "So far as the residents of the village are concerned, the use to whi-h this company applies its plant is as oublic as it can be It is immaterial that it does not furnish as complete service as Is furnished by most commercial companies. So far as its business extends, its service is open under the provisions of this ordinance, to anyone who may demand it and is willing to pay the price Jrtated in the constitution and by-laws of the company for rendering such service. It is not necessary to constitute this a public use, that this service should be extended to the whole world, or to in - clude whoever might happen to be temporarily in the village of Noble or in that vicinity. A public use means public usefulness, utility, advantage or benefit. To be public the use must concern a community as distinguished from an individual or any particular number of individuals, but it is not essential that the entire com - munity or people of the state, or rmy political subdivision thereof, Fbould be benefited or assured In the use or enjoyment thereof. It may be confined to a particular district and still be public." In Buncombe Metallic Telephone Co. vt. McGinnis, supra, the court had before it the proposition as to whether a mutual company owning a line connected with a central exchange (the identical situation in this case) cou!d exercise the right of eminent domain. It was he'.d that such a company could exercise the right. It is fundamental, of course, that private property cannot be condemned unless the use for which it is taken is affected with a public interest hence the conclusion that the court assumed this company to be a public utility. The holding of the court is again reaffirmed in State ex rel vs. Noble, supra, the last case of the kind decided. Here a number of farmers constructed an exchange outside the village of Perry and con - nected with it a number of farm lines. They first proposed to build their exchange within the village, but after the Public Utilities Com - mission had held that such a system would be a public utility, they thought to evade the jurisdiction of the Commission by locating their exchange outside the village limits. Their organization was very similar to all mutual companies', the purpose being to pay the cost of operation and maintenance by assessments upon the members and to require all telephone users to be stockholders. Through an arrange - ment with other farm lines they established a connection with com - mercial exchanges at Mt. Sterling and Versailles where they also ef - fected connection with long-distance lines. In determining that the company was a public utility, the court said: </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT "A mutual telephone company may or may not be operating and managing a public utility, but when it is operating its line in con - nection with the exchange of a commercial telephone company and serving the public in the manner that, as shown here, appellants' lines are serving the public, there can be no escape from the con - clusion that the business is a public utility and is subject to the control of the Public Utilities Commission of this state." The Michigan statute giving jurisdiction of telephone companies to the Michigan Railroad Commission declares to be "common carriers" persons, etc., operating telephone lines or exchanges "doing a telephone business." In an order requiring the Fayette Rural Telephone company to accept long-distance messages offered it by the Reading Central Tele - phone company (Reading Central Telephone Co. vs. Fayette Rural Tele - phone Co., P. U. R 1915 A, 56) the Commission says: "A person, corporation or association which sets its poles and strings its wires upon the highways, which installs a central switch- board, and which gives means of communication between its im - mediate patrons and with those of distant organizations, cannot be said to be a private facility because the cost of its maintenance is apportioned in the form of an assessment. Such an organization is clearly 'doing a telephone business.' Although such an organization may be doing business upon the mutual basis, it is doing business affected with a public interest; its tendency is to monopolize its field of operation, for it would be economic waste to duplicate its facilities, aud even duplication of lines would give access to only a limited number of its telephone users. It is quite possible that the patrons of such a system may not desire to send messages be - yond the limits of their own exchange, but telephone users at a distance may desire to communicate with its patrons, and for that reason, if it occupies the public streets it must recognize the public character of its facilities. A railroad company that refused trans- portation for all freight and passengers except such as originated upon and that did not pass beyond its line would come far from discharging its public duty, and the same is true of a telephone utility." I In Re Brita Paulson, P. U. R. 1917 A, 672, the Minnesota Railroad Warehouse Commission decided a case in which the facts were so ly identical with the facts in the instant case that the findings are e than usually important. Brita Paulson resided on a farm nine s from the city of Anoka. The Clifton Rural Telephone company, isting of eleven members, was 1 organized on a mutual basis and was tected with the Northwestern Telephone company's exchange at ka, from which it secured both local and long-distance service. The on company's line passes on two sides of the Paulson farm only a rods from the house. Notwithstanding Brita Paulson made appli - &gt;n for service from the Clifton company and offered to pay the il membership fee and the assessments, she was denied service on ground that the addition of another telephone to the line would im - the service, and the cost of stringing another circuit would be issive. The Minnesota statute conferring jurisdiction of telephone panies upon the Railroad and Warehouse Commission provides that </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 "any person, firm, etc., owning or operating any telephone line or tele - phone exchange for hire * • • or furnishing any telephone service to the public" is subject to regulation. The Commission held that the form of the organization of a telephone company was not material, the real question being the kind of service performed. Under the facts of the case it was held to clearly appear that the Clifton company was "furnishing telephone service to the public," and it was ordered to ex - tend to the complainant the same telephone facilities' and service it provided to the other subscribers upon its line. Numerous other cases of similar import might be cited, but those reviewed are amply sufficient to support the conclusion that a telephone line or system, no matter what the form of its organization, that is connected with a public utility doing business as a commercial enter - prise and "for hire" becomes a part of such public utility or common carrier and is subject to regulation by the state in the same manner and to the same extent as the system of which it is a part. It may very well be said that a farm line such as we are considering in this case is a mere extension of the facilities of the common carrier system with which it is connected. So intimate, indeed, is the relationshp and so intermingled is the service rendered that it is next to impossible to separate the service performed from the charge that is made for it. For example, a person telephoning from Omaha to a farmer living on the line of defendant makes use, not only of the facilities of the Ne - braska Telephone company, but of the facilities of the Southern Elkhorn Telephone company, and the charge paid for the transmission of the message covers the use of the facilities thus jointly employed. As we have shown, the fact that the Southern Elkhorn Telephone company, under its present arrangement with the Nebraska Telephone company, receives no part of the direct charge is not material. It is sufficient that a charge is actually made to the person using the service and that the lines of defendant are involved in the performance of the service. The legislature of this state has apparently given recognition to the fact that all lines or exchanges participating in a long-distance call may likewise participate in the charge therefor. Section 7416, Re - vised Statutes, 1913, which is part of the so-called physical connection act, contains 1 the following: "All long-distance telephone rates in this state shall be based on air line mileage between points. Of any toll charge fifteen per cent shall go to the company where call originated and ten per cent to the company where message terminated, and the balance of such charge- shall be divided between the different com - panies over whose lines and through whose stations it passed * * •" This would seem to mean that any line or portion of a system used for the transmission of a toll message is entitled to compensation for such use. Through its arrangement with the Nebraska Telephone com - pany, defendant receives no compensation directly. As the arrange - ment appears to be satisfactory, however, having been renewed from </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 time to time, it is possible that it regards the advantages it derives from the connection for both local and long-distance service as suffi - cient consideration for the use of its property. Unquestionably, the re - lation is reciprocal. tUpon this consideration of the question, therefore, we conclude that Southern Elkhorn Telephone company is a common carrier within meaning of that term and that it is subject to the jurisdiction of Commission. It is urged that even if this Commission has the power to make an order in this case, it should not require defendant to extend its service to complainant for the reason that there are already ten tele - phone users on the line and the addition of another would seriously impair the service. While the Commission has held that ten subscrib - ers on a farm line are all under ordinary circumstances that should be permitted if the best of service is to be maintained, we have frequently authorized departures from this rule. Conditions sometimes make it Inadvisable to limit the number to ten. Recently, for example, we per - mitted the Platte County Telephone company to depart from an order previously issued in which a limit of ten had been fixed and to take on another farm subscriber, who otherwise could not have been served except at great expense to the company. Farm lines with from twelve to fifteen subscribers are by no means rare in the state. As stated by the Minnesota Commission in the Paulson case, supra: "Undoubtedly the service over rural lines is always 1 better on the line serving a few stations as compared with a line serving a large number, but the Commission finds that the addition of one member to this circuit will not materially impair the service. The company can easily, if it desires to do so, reduce the number of subscribers on a circuit, and improve the service, by stringing an additional wire from the city limits of Anoka far enough into the country to take off such subscribers as it may deem necessary to give the desired service. The expense of this additional wire would be nominal." An order will be entered in accordance with these findings ORDER tIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED hy the Nebraska State Railway mission that the Southern Elkhorn Telephone company be, and the e is, hereby ordered and directed to furnish to complainant, the said I Doxstader, telephone service on the same terms and conditions as ;w furnishes such service to the other members of its association, necessary equipment to be installed and such service to be com - ced on or before July 1. 1919.

            <seg id="p165">165 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 371 Tri-County Telephone Company, Complainant, v? Gandy Switchboard Company, Defendant. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing this 19th day of July, 1310. upon the motion of the complainant filed July 18. 1919, to require the re - spondent to state the matters complained of in the respondent's motion for supplementary order filed June 11, 1919, in the form of a formal complaint, to give the complainant a reasonable time in which to make answer to said matters and to dismiss 1 said motion of the respondent for the reason that the matters involved in the original complaint here - in have been finally determined by the Commission, and the Commis - sion is therefore without further Jurisdiction in the matter. The complainant also objects to proceeding with a further hearing upon respondent's motion for supplementary order above described on this date for the reason that it is unable to produce testimony material to said motion at this time and for the further reason its counsel has other engagements. Respondent's motion for supplementary order sets forth a different cause of action to that contained in the original pleadings herein which were disposed of by the Commission's order dated July 24, 1918. The motion complies with all the requirements of a formal complaint and is so treated by the Commission, notwithstanding its title. Due service of said motion has been made upon the complainant and there is no reason why it cannot fully answer thereto. The law does not prescribe the form of pleading before the Commission and the Commission is there - fore free to treat matters presented to it regardless of form. The motion will therefore be overruled with leave to the complainant to make answer thereto within thirty days, subject to a certain condition. It appears from the testimony already adduced herein and from the complainant's affidavit submitted in support of its motion that the tele - phone toll line owned by the complainant and erected for the purpose of a connecion with the respondent's switchboard at Gandy was severed by the complainant on June 13, 1919, without the consent of the Commis - sion. The severance is in violation of the order of the Commission dated July 24, 1918, from which no appeal was taken, and also an ap - parent violation of the order of the district court of Logan county, Nebraska, in the case of Tri-Cour.ty Telephone Company, complainant, vs. Gandy Switchboard company, defendant, dated April 8, 1919. Com - plainant gives as its reason for this severance a dispute over the divi - sion of toll charges arising out of communications originating and desti - nating at the Gandy switchboard and passing through other of com - planant's exchanges than the one located at Stapleton.

Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defendant Appearances: For Complainants — John E. Kavenaugh, Attorney; M. J. Keenan. Chris Weber. For Defendant — C. A. Magaw, Attorney; F. H. Hammill. General Su - perintendent; A. L. Craig. General Passenger Agent; W. D. Lin - coln. Car Service Agent. For Citizens of Albion — Geo. W. Williams and F. S Thompson. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: At the present time the Union Pacific Railroad Company operates over its two so-called Albion and Spalding branches train service as follows: No. 24, steam passenger train, leaving Albion at 6:40 a. m. and running to Omaha via Columbus, arriving at Omaha at 11:55 p. m.; returning, this train known as No. 23 leaves Omaha at 5:30 p. m. and arrives at Albion at 10:40 p. m. A similar train on the Spalding branch, known as Nos. 31 and 32. leaves Spalding at 9:00 a. m. reaching Columbus at 11:30 a. m. and making connection at that point with main line passenger trains. Returning, it leaves Columbus at 1:40 p. m. and arrives at Spalding at 4:15 p. m. In addition there is a motor car whic'n leaves Spalding in the morning at 5:50 and reaches Genoa at 7:35, where it makes connection with No. 24 coming down from Albion. Re - turning, this motor leaves Genoa at 9:45 p. m. after the arrival at Genoa of No. 23. Additional passenger train service is furnished to the Albion branch by means of an accommodation train which runs to Albion in the morning, the coaches and engine then returning to Genoa where connection is made with the Spalding steam train No. 32. This train returns to Albion after Spalding train No. 31 arrives from Colum - bus. In etfect. therefore, there are two passenger trains each way on each branch. In addition, passengers are carried on the local freights. This is a complaint filed by the citizens of Spalding and residents of other towns on the Spalding branch, in which it is asked that the motor car be transferred to the Albion branch and that the steam train, Nos. 23 and 24. now operating on the Albion branch, be transferred to the Spalding branch. It is alleged by the complainants that a very large proportion of the passengers arriving at Genoa on the steam train are now compelled to transfer to the motor for the trip up the Spalding branch. In his statement at the hearing Attorney Kavanaugh asserted that fully 90% of the tickets sold for points beyond Genoa are sold to </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT people going: to points on the Spalding branch. Other witnesses for the complainants stated that the ratio was as from three to one to seven to one in favor of the Spalding branch. No figures were submitted by complainants, the evidence consisting only of the opinions of witnesses who had ridden on the motor and who had made estimates of the pas- sengers riding in either direction. The case turns, therefore, on the proposition as to whether the Spalding branch has a preponderance of the traffic. If so, there might be good reason for going into the question M to a change of the service. As stated by Mr. Kavanaugh, however. unless the reports of the traffic "carry our idea of this matter out, why, of course we wouldn't be in position to ask for what we are asking." At the hearing defendant submitted a traffic study showing the number of passengers carried on each branch for the period April 25 to May 6 inclusive. The result of this study was as follows: Albion Branch Northbound, total 234 passengers Southbound, total 1C9 passengers 169 passengers Total 403 passengerar Average number of passengers daily, 28 11-14. Spalding Branch Northbound total 237 passengers Southbound, total 193 passengers Total 430 passenger* Average number of passengers daily, 30 10-14. This study shows that an average of approximately two passengers day more were carried on the Spalding branch than on the Albion branch. Complainants objected to these figures and asserted that they must be erroneous. At the conclusion of the hearing therefore the Commission asked the railroad company to make another count, which It did, covering the period from May 13 to May 26, inclusive, the result of which was as follows: Albion Branch Northbound, total 264 passengers Southbound, total 162 passengers Total 426 passengers Average number of passengers daily. 30 6-14 Spalding Branch Northbound, total 269 passengers Southbound, total 180 passengers Total 449 passengers Average number of passengers daily, 32 1-14. Again it is shown that there are only two passengers per day more ried on the Spalding branch than on the Albion branch. In addition to this study the Commission had one of its service in- spectors travel these trains for two days and make a count of the pas- </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 169 sengers. The result of his study was as follows: which was made on May 14 and 15, It will be seen that his study confirms the report made by the rail- road company. That these figures fairly reflect the relative business done by the two branches is indicated by the report of ticket sales made to the Commission for the calendar year 1918. The total ticket sales from all stations on the Albion branch for that year amounted to $33,604.95. The total ticket sales from all of the stations on the Spalding branch for the same period amounted to $38,966.20. The Spalding traffic therefore represented 54% of the total traffic from the two branches, as against 46&lt;7 C from Albion. The traffic on the two branches is so nearly equal that the Commission is at a loss to understand how complainants reach such erroneous conclusions with reference to the number of people served by the trains involved in this controversy. It would appear that their hopes and desires rather colored their good judgment. It was alleged by complainants that the motor on the Spalding branch seats but thirty people. A blue print showing tl&gt;e dimensions and capacity of the car is submitted by the railroad company, which discloses that the car is designed to peat fifty-six passengers. The Com- mission's representative found that it would seat fifty without crowd ing. The railroad company objects to the change asked for on the ground that it would add considerably to the expense of operation. The dis - tance from Genoa to Spalding is forty-four miles, whereas the distance from Genoa to Albion is but twenty-two miles. The additional distance would add to the wages of the passenger crew, increasing this item of cost to the amount of $1,877 per year. The company estimates also that the additional fuel required would amount to $1,398, or a total for the year of $3,266. Objection to the longer run is also made on the ground that it would be difficult during periods of storm or following accidents to comply with the federal sixteen-hour law. Under the circumstances as disclosed by this record, therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that there would be no justification at this time in requiring the Union Pacific to make the change demanded. The passenger service on these two branches has been under review by the Commission on numerous occasions. A great deal of study and thought has been given to establishing trains and schedules that would be satis- Jbion Branch Northbound, total 54 passengers Southbound, total 33 passengers Total 87 passengers palding Branch Northbound, total 59 passengers Southbound, total 32 passengers Total 91 passengers </seg>

Appearances : J. A. Dixon, Secretary Applicant Company. FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: This is an application for authority to sell and issue capital stock in the amount of $6,515 for the purpose of liquidating bills payable. The matter proceeded informally until it developed that the applicant had apparently paid dividends during its life of $9,607.27 in excess of r.even per cent per annum upon its capital stock, whereupon the Com - mission adopted an order directing the applicant to show cause why the Commission should not make and enter an order requiring it to assess and collect these excess dividends from its stockholders and why it should not be limited to dividends at the rate of seven per cent per annum in the future, and the entire matter was set down for hearing. In t!e meantime the Commission's experts made an investigation of ap - plicant's books and an inventory and valuation of the property for the information of the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 Applicant owns and operates a telephone system located in the village of Arlington and vicinity. It is 1 of the magneto-metallic type and serves approximately five hundred subscribers. The plant is in excel- lent condition and there is no complaint as to the character of the service. The stock is practically all of the enterprise, from a service as well as a financial standpoint. The plant was first established in 1901 and developed gradually for a period of about eight years to approximately its present size. The principal motive in erecting the plant was to prevent telephone com panies located in adjoining towns from establishing telephone connec- tions with farmers tributary in the way of trade to Arlington. A re- turn upon the investment was secondary. As a result there wa? a con- siderable contribution of time and labor in the early building of the plant for which no compensation was given. It was estimated that more than one-half of the material used during the first three years was hauled free and that quite a proportion of the poles were set without cost. The stockholders and directors gave freely of time in soliciting subscribers and no salaries were paid to officers or directors for a number of years. Directors were paid nothing until the year 1915 and the manager was paid only $60 per month as late as 1917. Director? now receive $3 for attending meetings monthly, the manager $100 per month, and a bookkeeper $40 per month. There was a single rervicc rate to begin with, — $1.00 per month. This was raised later to $1 25 per month. In 1909 the rates were again increased and were classified as follows: Individual line business $1.75 per month Two-party line business 1.50 per month Individual residence 1.25 per month Party line residence 1.00 per month Farm, residence 1.25 per month which rates have continued in effect until the present time, with the exception of the two-party business rate which has been abandoned. These rates are slightly lower than the average rate contemporaneously charged in plants similarly situated. The amounts of paid-up capital stock and the dividends paid thers on year by year from the beginning are as follows: Paid Up Year Capital Dividends Rate Stock Paid % 1901 $ 745.00 $ 157.50 50% 1902 2,000.00 none 1903 7,300.00 550.90 15%% 1904 9,915.00 990.20 12% 1905 10,000.00 none 1906 10,000 00 none 1907 13,945.00 3,929.94 39.3% 1908 16,085.00 2,370.65 17% 1909 18,485.00 2,895.30 18% 1910 18,485.00 1,848.50 10% 1911 18,485.00 1,848.50 10% </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT The only evidence offered by applicant at the hearing as to a rea- sonable rate of return during the life of the company was by a director and stockholder from the beginning, who testified that such a rate was from eight to ten per cent per annum. Calculating a return of ten per cent per annum upon the paidup capital until the time applicant appears to have fairly compensated all services rendered it, or for the years tto 1914 inclusive, and at eight per cent per annum since that tim;\ a total return of $24,005.20, which is $5,005.20 less than the total dividends paid. Applicant's asset and liability statement December 31, 1918, ia as follows : It will be noted that the company has no fund to cover unrealized depreciation and no surplus of any nature. The Commission's inventory and valuation of the physical property, made in July, 1918, shows an estimated original construction cost of $38,089 33. and a present fair value of $24,429.79. It includes allow - ances for stationery and printing, insurance, taxes and interest during construction and engineering and superintendence, amounting to $2,825.79 original construction cost and $1,808.51 present value, of which not more than $500 was actually incurred or paid, the items concerned being taxes, interest and superintendence. The valuation presupposed of course the construction of the entire plant at one time- and the period taken was six months. The original construction cost figure as to real estate, buildings and equipment was largely based upon the ex - perience of the company as disclosed by cost vouchers in its possession. It Is fair to assume therefore that the cost of the property in place is 1912 18,48b.OO .913 18.485.00 •14 18,485.00 •15 18,485.00 •16 18,485.00 tl7 18,485.00 »18 18,485.00 1.84S.&amp;U 2,957.60 1,848.50 1,848.50 1.848.50 2.773.25 1,293.96 iuy o 16% 10% 10% 10% 15% 7% Total ....$29,010.40 leal estate $ BOO.Oi buildings 820.01 Exchange central equipment 1, 345.01 Exchange aerial equipment and subscriber's stations 20,541.5: utility equipment 651.61 on hand 736. 9» Accounts receivable 305.

            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 In the neighborhood of $35,000; and aa only $18,485.00 of this amount was contributed by the stockholders, it is apparent that the remainder came from the operating revenues exclusive of dividends paid. The amount of assets as shown by applicant's books does not reflect their cost but rather applicant's opinion of present value. Practically no books of account have been kept, and it was impossible for the Com - mission's accountant to ascertain the receipts and expenditures for more than two years of the company's history. Applicant's necessity for additional funds was precipitated by a heavy sleet storm in 1915, which did considerable damage to it? pole lines. The rebuilding cost approximately $6,000. Had applicant con - tented itself with what it admits is a reasonable return from the be - ginning it would have had a surplus of over $5,000 with which to meet the contingency. The fact that it did not do so, however, does not alter its duty to the public. The law limited it to such a return all of the while and it must now amend the violation. We are of the opinion, under the circumstances of this case, that the return above described, viz., ten per cent during the first fourteen years of the enterprise and eight per cent thereafter, is a reasonable return and it will be taken as the measure of applicant's duty. We find therefore that the return paid to stockholders in the past in excess of a reasonable return is $5,000 and that the stockholders will have to forego the right to earn or receive dividends for such a period in the future, beginning with January 1, 1919, as eight per cent per annum upon the present paid-up capital stock of the company will require. The revenues remaining after meeting operating expenses, maintenance and depreciation, taxes, losses, damages and other operating costs should be credited to the depreciation reserve fund, until the amount so credited amounts to $5,000. The moneys represented by these credits are properly applicable to the liquidation of applicant's indebted - ness, as the indebtedness was in fact Incurred in maintaining the property. This disposes of all but $1,515 of the application to sell securities. The actual amount of bills payable on December 31, 1918, was $6,415.11. $4,915.11 of this amount is represented by promissory notes held by the stockholders and they can be liquidated through the depreciation re - serve fund without inconvenience. The remaining $1,500 is owing to a third party and is a proper charge to capitalization. The application should therefore be granted in that amount. Applicant Is criticised for its failure to keep proper books of ac - count, especially since the advent of public regulation, and the law will be invoked for further neglect along this line. Applicant should immediately install the system of accounts prescribed by the Commis - sion In General Order No. 45 and follow closely the directions therein given. The basis of credits to depreciation reserve shall be the orig - inal construction cost figure noted herein, less the real estate item, or </seg>

            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 FINDING AND OPINION TAYLOR, Commissioner: This company was organized in 1904 with an authorized capital of $10 000, which was later increased to $20,000. Stock was sold from time to time until at the present time there is outstanding $9,925. Dividends averaging slightly over eight per cent annually have been paid on the stock outstanding since the company was organized. Application is now made for authority to ipsue additional stock in the amount of $7,000 for the purpose of equalizing the outstanding capital with the actual in- vestment in the company, the new stock to be used as compensation for services performed in the past, but for which it is alleged no com- pensation was ever allowed by the company. The property investment as shown by the books of the company is now $15,617. The company submits an inventory of its property as of December 31, 1917, which shows a present value of physical prop- erty of $15,445.30. In addition to that the company has cash on hand of $2,200 and bills receivable of $2,050, making total assets of approxi- mately $20,000. The Commission's engineering department took the in- ventory submitted by the company and applying its units of cost to the fame finds a reproduction value of $20,011.20 and a present or de- preciated value of $12,722.36. The latter figure is reached without a personal inspection of the property by our engineers and is but an estimate. The company now makes application for stock to cover services performed by the various officers since the organization and for which services no compensation has been paid. It is shown that the salaries paid to directors and officers from the beginning down to the date of this application amounted in the aggregate to $3 520. the item ized statement being as follows: Paid to directors for attending meetings, at $1.00 each, from January 1, 1914, to June 30, 1918 $ 274.00 1904 Paid secretary 20c per hour for actual time 36.00 1905 Paid secretary for entire year 100.00 1906 Paid secretary $10 per month 120.00 1907 Paid secretary $15 per month 180.00 1908 Paid secretary $10 per month 120.00 1909 Paid secretary $10 per month 120.00 1910 Paid secretary $10 per month 120.00 1911 Paid secretary $10 per month 120.00 1912 Paid secretary $15 per month 180.00 1913 Paid secretary $15 per month 180.00 1914 Paid secretary $15 per month 180.00 1915 Paid secretary $15 per month to June 30th 90.00 1915 Paid Sec. and Pres. $25 each from July 1st, 1915. to June 30, 1918 1,500.00 In May, 1908, all directors received as payment for services rendered eight shares of company stock, par value $25, total 200.00 Total paid to all officers of company $3,520.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT As a basis for their claim for $7,000 the following claim as to salaries is submitted: It will be noted that applicant asks for compensation for the presi- dent and secretary at the rate of $30 per month from the date of the organization of the company down to the present time. To review the history of a telephone company such as this and attempt to accurately determine what should have been paid its officers for their services is a difficult task. Conditions today are greatly different than they were Em years ago when the company began business. Salaries adequate are entirely inadequate now. but before a definite determination is Ible a complete knowledge of all of the circumstances under which service was performed is essential. Such information is always ult to secure and equally difficult to measure ten or fifteen years Ethe service has been rendered. It is frequently urged in eonnec - with claims of this character that the best measure of the value man's service is the price which he himself sets upon it and for h he has been content to do the work. Ordinarily that is true, but in a case such as this it cannot be accepted as the sole guide. When this company was organized there was 1 no state regulation of rates and service nor were the fundamental principles of rate regula - tion established. The business of a public utility was looked upon very much as any other business. In the first stages of development, before the telephone had become a public necessity and when it was not known what the cost of operation would be, men were content to accept nominal compensation, or no compensation at all, letting the money to which they might be entitled go back into the property, confidently ex - pecting to recover in the future, either through sale or capitalization, the reward for their early sacrifices. So long as they were assured that the surplus earnings were going into the property they had no fear of being able to realize on their actual investment ultimately, nor were they very solicitous about keeping accurate records of these matters, trusting to the surplus In the property to finally reimburse ti. Now that this Commission has adopted the Investment basis as main factor In a valuation for rate or capitalization purposes, it has become highly essential to know how much of the surplus produced by the rates actually belongs to the stockholders and they, as well as the 'or nine month period from March 1, 1904, to January 1, 1905, salary for president and secretary at $30 each per month, $270. Total $ ialary of president and manager at $30 per month, or $360 per year, from January 1, 1905, to January 1, 1919 ialary of secretary and treasurer for same period, same salary 540.0&lt; 5,040.01 5,040.01 $1 'otal amount received for above specified time $10.620 0' ... 3,520.0' 10.620.0i 3,520.01 Balance due $ 7,100.0' 7,100.0' </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 177 Commission, are concerned in measuring it as definitely as possible. It goes without saying that had the same policy been in effect from the. first there probably would have been a different method of con - ducting many utilities. It is only possible now to make an allowance for these uncompensated services and obligations as in the judgment of the Commission appears to be fair and reasonable. S. A. Westing was the first president of the company and is now one of the principal stockholders. A. S. Howard, the present executive, succeeded Mr. Westing and has been in the office for several years. He owns 196 of the 397 shares. During the construction period Mr. Howard superintended the work and put in considerable time. For this, how - ever, he was paid a per diem and all of his expenses. This compensa - tion is not included in the $3,520. Claim is made by Mr. Howard for compensation for services in promoting the company and selling stock as farmer lines were projected. This claim is also made for the other directors, who performed a similar service. It is well to remember in thia connection, however, that in 1908 capital stock in the amount of $25 was issued to each of the eight directors in payment of services previously rendered. Whether this constituted full compensation for ;he work done is not disclosed by the record, but it is significant that the directors accepted it as such and made no further claim. While the president has always managed the company, it does not appear from the record that the duties of this position in the eaily days were very onerous, or required a great deal of time. At this time Mr. Howard was actively engaged in the mercantile business and Mr. Westing wae and still is interested in several large enterprises. There have been but two secretaries of the company, the present secretary, H. R. Coplin, serving since 1908. The secretary also acts as treasurer. He keeps the books, attends the directors' and stock - holders' meetings and assists with the collections. Mr. Coplin has been in the banking business and it is conceded has only given such time as was absolutely necessary to the telephone business. The system of bookkeeping has been very simple and in a business of this size the work has not been heavy. Upon consideration of all of these matters, the Commission is of the opinion that the claim for $7,000, as made by applicant, is not Justified by the record. We are of the opinion, however, that some allowance should be made for services performed and not paid for, and upon full consideration of all of the facts find that a sum of $3,500 be approved for this purpos* such stock, together with the stock now In force, to represent at the par value thereof the entire interest of the stockholders in and to the property held by the company. The Com - mission Is also of the opinion that the stockholders are entitled to no more than a reasonable return upon the par value of the shares of stock held by them and that a reasonable return at this time, and under the circumstances of this case, is 8% per annum.

            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 179 its exchange rates. That portion of the application covering the issue of additional stock will be taken up first. The company now has 110 business subscribers and 311 residence subscribers. It also performs switching service for 642 farm patrons who own their own lines. The company was organized in 1906 as a mutual concern. In 1907 it issued 487 shares of common stock of a par value of $10 each. In 1908 147 shares were issued, and in 1909 301 shares, making a total of 935 shares, representing an investment of $9,350. All of the stock issued was paid for in cash. Applicant now as-ks that it be psrmitted to double its stock issue. It bases its application on the ground that it has paid no dividends during the life of the company, and that all sur - plus earnings have been reinvested in the plant. A valuation by the Commission's engineers 1 shows an original cost of the property of $22,399.71 and a depreciated value of $14,483.12. The original cost as found by the engineers corresponds closely to the plant value as shown by the books of the company. It corresponds also to a valuation submitted by the company itself. The record discloses that no dividends have been paid since the company was first organized. If we compute dividends at seven per cent on the outstanding stock since the company began to do business in 1907, allowing interest at the same rate on the deferred dividends, we have a sum of $10,633.43. This represents an actual sacrifice by the stockholders, inasmuch as the money has been invested in the physical plant, devoted to the public use. It belongs to the stockholders fully as much as though it had been drawn out by them from year to year. Adding it to the stock already outstanding ($9,350), we have $19,983.43. The company asks for the approval of an additional issue of $9,350, making a total of $18,700. Under the circumstances 1 as stated, we are of the opinion that such an issue is well justified and is reasonably necessary for the pur - poses of the company. An order will issue accordingly. With respect to rates, the company has made no specific request, except as 1 to the business rate, which it is desired to increase from $1.50 to $2.00 per month. The prayer of the petition is that such rates may be fixed as the Commission may deem Just and reasonable. The resi - dence rate at the present time is $1.00 per month. The company owns no farm lines, but, as stated, switches 642 farm telephones, for which service it receives- 35 cents per station per month. In common with other companies, applicant has experienced greatly increased operating expenses during the past two years. The salary of its lineman has had to be increased from $75 per month to $125 per month. The wages of the operators have been increased to a minimum of $40 per month. Other expenses have increased in proportion, ma - terial prices having advanced from 60 per cent to 200 per cent. On January 1, the company found it necessary to hire a bookkeeper at a salary of $90 per month for the first three months and $100 per month thereafter. The operating condition at the present time is reflected by </seg>

We have analyzed the expenses and are of the opinion that they are all reasonably required for the proper operation of the business. It is ap- parent, therefore, that considerable additional revenue is required. If an increase of fifty cents per month on business, twenty-five cents per month on residence, and fifteen cents per month for switching service is allowed, the increased revenue would amount to $2,748.60 per year. This is about $200 more than the actual requirements of the company at this time. Such a margin of safety, however, is not excessive. The Commission is of the opinion, therefore, that the present rates are in- adequate and that the rates suggested are reasonable and should be approved ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Farmers Mutual Telephone Company of Ord be. and the same hereby is, authorized to issue and sell its common stock </seg>

Whitten, Secretary FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: tOn June 19, 1918, the Commission issued an order authorizing the m Pacific Railroad Company to discontinue certain passenger trains •ating_ on six of its branch lines in Nebraska until otherwise ordered the Commission. The reduction of service amounted to approxl - ely fifty per cent and affected 376. 6 miles? of railroad. The purpn-v he order was to permit of the utmost economy of equipment, labor, and materials during the war. I In February. 1919, several informal complaints wer" made to the imission by patrons on these lines alleging gross inadequicy of the r ice. and setting forth that the need of conservation in railway ope - on at the expense of service was now past. From this and other rmation the Commission was satisfied that conditions had so nged since the signing of the war armistice in November, 1918, that investigation should be made of the matter, and on February 19, I. adopted an order directing the railroad company and the director eral of railroads to show cause, if any there be on March 12. 1919. ■ the service should not be restored to the condition existing prior he 1918 order. Hearing was held on the order to show cause, at which the carrier appi-are»i by its general operating officials, and tie public by about forty representatives of municipal corporations and commercial rlubs. The carrier offered to restore the service as it existed prior to the 1918 order with the exception of two trains on the line running from Grand Island to Ord, Nebraska, and four trains on the line running from Lincoln to Beatrice, Nebraska. They maintained that the present service on these two lines was adequate. Patrons of the. Grand Island- Ord line protested vigorously at the exclusion of their line from the general resumption of service. The line is sixty-one miles in length and has eleven stations of varying Importance. The present service consists of one passenger train each way a day and one mixed freight train daily except Sunday. Two coaches are attached to the freight train for the use of passengers, baggage, mail and express, and it was shown that they are comfortably filled the greater part of the time. </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 The scheduled time of the train is four hours and thirty minutes from Grand Island to Ord and four hours and fifteen minutes from Ord to Grand Island. The train is subject to the proverbial delays of freight trains, however, and is frequently late from one to three hours. "th;is interfering seriously with connections at Grand Island and otherwise inconveniencing the public. The Commission is of the opinion that passenger traffic on this line warrants the restoration of the service as it existed prior to the 1918 order, viz., a motor passenger train in addi - tion to the present service, alternating with the steam train. Relative to the Lincoln-Beatrice line the record lllpwi it to be served by two passenger trains each way daily except Sund:iy atid thai the Burlington railroad also has two trains each way a day htt— W Lincoln and Beatrice. The distance over the Union Pacific ; s 39.7 miles and there are but three villages of any consequence on the line between Lincoln and Beatrice. The trains taken off under the 1318 order were composed of a single motor car which made two round trips 1 daily. The Commission recognizes that the carrier is being operated by the federal government, that all of its earnings go into a common fund with the earnings of all other carriers, that the com - pensaticn paid to the owners of the carriers is in nowise connected with present earnings, and that there is grave danger of the federal government suffering a deficit in railway operation. The situation is therefore different than it would be if the Commission wore dealing with an individual railroad company; the Commission cr.uld then con - sider all of the profit derived by the carrier from its intra^ta'e pas^n - ger business. I'nder these circumstances the Commission is of the opinion that the public affected by the Lincoln-Beatrice service is suffi- ciently served by the present trains. The old service on the Kearney-Stapleton line consisted of two motor passenger trains each way dally except Sunday. Considerable complaint was made to the Commission during the nistoM I of th's service that the seating capacity of the cars was fretaeatty exrc&gt;dpd and that the portion of the cars devoted to the handling of baggage. mail and express was insufficient. These protests were renewed at th hearing. From the evidence offered it is shown that the restoration of the former service alone will not properly accommodate the public The line serves a large territory. It is 102.3 miles Ions;. !MM ten v: corporated towns located on it, and serves a territory approximately fifteen miles wide on either side and as far as fifty miles beyond Stapleton, — the terminus. The present passenger service consists of a motor passenger car with a capacity of sixty passengers, and it was shown that it had carried at times as many as 130 passengers. Its mail capacity is forty sacks and it was shown that as hish as l?0 sacks had been carried at one time. Mail pouches are carried by des'i - nations frequently on account of the confusion due to overloading. Express facilities on the car are likewise inadequate and result in the </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 carrying of express matter by the tri-weekly freight train. The morn- Ing traffic out of Kearney appears to be especially heavy for two-third» of the way, and the return traffic in passengers and express (the latter being cream principally) is also considerable. It appears altogether out of the question to furnish adequate service on this line without the use of one steam train each way a day in addition to motor service alter - nating with the steam train. It is contended by the patrons that the motor service should be the largest of its class, viz., a seventy-five passenger motor as against a forty-five passenger. The particular class of motor service will be left to the carrier's option, however, until such time as it is shown to be inadequate under the new arrangement.

L. &amp; B. and the Lincoln Traction Company. The Lincoln Traction Company rates were increased September 1st between the points referred to herein from five cents straight to six cents. This apparently has set up a discrimination between the two lines, that is, parties can ride between the points referred to on the Lincoln Traction Company lines for six cents and for five cents on the applicant's lines. This has not resulted in an appreciable increase in the traffic on appli - cant's lines. The applicant has filed a complete showing as to all operating revenues and the disbursements of the some for the year 1918, which is as follows: Passenger revenue $19,237.10 Baggage revenue 20.50 Mail revenue 271.45 Freight revenue 1,031.73 Switching 991.19 Station and car privileges : 107.49 Car service 2.00 Rent of track and facilities 3,060.30 Rent of equipment 4.40 Rent of buildings and property 340.97 Light and power revenue 2S4.41 $25,351.54 Maintenance of way $ 5,529.47 Maintenance of electric line 127.72 Maintenance of cars 650.42 Maintenance of electric equipment cars 72.35 Conductors and motormen 10.379.40 Miscellaneous car service and Emp.

            <seg id="p188">188 SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER NO. 3 TAYLOR, Commissioner: The original order in this case authorized the Nebraska Telephone Company to increase its rates for exchange service throughout its sys - tem ten per cent, and its rates for toll or long distance service twenty - flye per cent. The increased rates were approved subject to certain conditions, among which was a requirement that the company should make a showing as to the reasonableness of all the rates involved, as to exchange rates on or before June 1, 1919, and as to toll rates on or before May 1, 1919. The rates superseded were to be restored on these dates' unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. I On April 17, 1919, the company made application to the Commls - l for a continuance of the order as to toll rates and for authority substitute for the exchange rates now in effect another schedule. »ring on this application was had in the office of the Commission April 28, 1919. Because of the differing dates of expiration as to toll and exchange rates, two orders are being issued, but both con - l the same conditions and both will have the same terminating date. The schedule of exchange rates proposed by the company as a sub - stitute for the rates now in effect and which will be considered in this report, constitutes a complete readjustment of all of the rates of the company for exchange service. Because of its length and complicated nature it will not be set forth here but will appear only in the order. When the ten per cent increase was applied to the old rates it produced a large number of odd cents charges which have been inconvenient to both the company and the public. It also interfered with the differen - tials between the various classes of service. The new schedule is de - signed to correct these defects. While many of the rates are reduced, the general effect of the schedule is to produce an increase over the present rates of between six and seven per cent, or an increase over the old rates of between sixteen and seventeen per cent. Under the proposed schedule the exchanges are divided into four classes, commenc - ing with the smaller and grading upward according to the population of the town, the number of subscribers, the extent of the zone of serv - ice and the kind of plant provided, whether grounded, metallic, mag - »o or common battery, etc. The rates 1 are uniform for all exchanges each group, classes of service considered. In the original order the Commission denied the application as to a twenty per cent increase over the rates as they then existed, but found a ten per cent increase necessary upon that record. As stated, however, the case was held open for any modification that changing conditions might require. The company now shows that not only have the increased expenses anticipated at that time been fully realized but they have been exceeded. Notwithstanding the substantial in - crease in revenue flowing from the new toll and exchange rates, the net Income is still insufficient to provide for the normal dividend on the </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 capital stock of the company. The net income in 1918 was $568,464, which was $75,536 Ies3 than the sum required to pay a seven per cent dividend on the $9,200,000 of capital stock. Increase in wages constitutes the greater part of the increased ope - rating cost, although advanced cost of materials is a large factor. All of the increased wages proposed at the time of the first hearing have been allowed and many others not anticipated at that time have had to be met. The record shows that the increase to operators alone for the months of January and February of 1919 as compared with the same months in 1918 amounts to $38,472. The increase in the traffic and commercial departments for the same period aggregates over $19,000, over 80 per cent of which i3 labor. The total increases for the^e three departments amount to over 458,907. The company has sought to econo - mize in other departments. Central office stationery and printing ex - pense, for example, was reduced in January and February, 1919, by $237.75, as compared to the same months of the year previous, while advertising was less by $792.81 and canvassing less by $380.13. The expenditures for maintenance and depreciation have likewise been curtailed, due to the shortage of labor and material. In the year 1918 the actual expenditures and allowances for these purix.ses amounted to 8.95 per cent of the value of the physical property, while in 1917 the expenditures for the same purpose amounted to 9.93 per cent. For the two-months period of this year the expenditures hnd dropped to 8.59 per cent. The figures indicate that only the more necessary mainte - nance and replacement work has been done and that the expenditures for the future will have to be increased if the property is to be kept in proper operating condition. In this connection, it is worthy of notice that 700 of the men who left the company to enter army service and who have been in the signal service in Europe, are expected to return within the next thirty days. Practically all of these men will re-enter the service of the company in its maintenance departments. Large demands for extensions are being made upon the company at this time and it is estimated that at least $2,000,000 will be required to finance these betterments in the next year. While this sum will come almost wholly from new capital, the expense for maintenance and operation will be correspondingly increased. The net income for the months of January and February of 1919 is short $28,549 of paying the regular dividends due for that period. If present conditions continue throughout the remainder of the year, and there appears no reason to believe that they will not, the annual de - ficit at this rate will aggregate $171,288. If the normal allowance of 9 per cent for maintenance and depreciation were to be expended or set aside, this deficit would be increased by at least $55,000, making a total of $226,288 for the year. The proposed schedule will produce an increase of approximately $150,000 per year, or $87,500 for the seven months from June 1 to December 31. This would leave a net to be </seg>

In view of this showing, there - fore, we find the rates as proposed for exchange service to be reason - able under present conditions and they will be approved, subject to all the conditions of the original order, including the provision as to a complete showing as to their reasonableness. The date for this show - ing will be changed from June 1, 1919, to December 31, 1919. The Com - mission will retain jurisdiction of the case and modifications of the order may be made if conditions warrant. ORDER I IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original order in this case and the same is, hereby extended and modified so that the Nebraska ?phone Company is authorized and directed on and after June 1, 1919, and until December 31, 1919, to charge, collect and receive the rates for regular local service at each and every of its exchanges as set forth in the sheets hereto attached, marked Exhibit "A" and made a part of this order. Such rates and schedules are to be subject to all the conditions as set forth in the original order herein, except as to the date on which the rates originally superseded shall again become effective, vihich date is hereby changed from June 1, 1919. to January 1, 1920, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission prior to said date. Jurisdiction of the instant matter is hereby retained for all purposes within the issues thereof. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all rates and rules applicable to the exchange service of the Nebraska Telephone Company now on file with this Commission, not specifically superseded or amended by the rates and rules as herein approved and shown in Exhibit "A" hereto attached, shall be and remain in effect.

            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 191 materials were seriously threatening the finances of applicant company and that relief was immediately necessary. An order was entered au - thorizing a flat increase of ten per cent of all exchange rates, which order became effective on December 1, 1918. In the same order, the company was authorized to increase toll rates twenty-five per cent horizontally. The toll rate order became effective November 1, 1918. Of these two temporary orders, that part referring to toll rates term - inated May 1, 1919, and the part referring to exchange rates on June 1, 1919. It was provided (1) that on or before May 1. 1919 the company should justify the reasonableness of the toll rates, in relation to the earning power compared with the property investment and total ex - penses; (2) that surpluses earned under those rates should be used to pay deficits in operation, maintenance, fixed charges and dividends not to exceed seven per cent, and (3) replacements in kind, regardless of cost, should be charged to depreciation account. Further showing was made by the company in April, 1919, as to the effect of these temporary rates, this showing being conclusive that the company was still running seriously behind. By order dated April 30, 1919, a temporary further increase in toll rates was authorized, effective May 1, to extend until December 31, 1919. This advance was twenty - five per cent over the original rates. On May 2 1919, an order was entered making further readjust - ments in exchange rates for two purposes: (1) to iron out certain inequalities, and (2) to provide additional revenues made necessary by conditions. These readjustments of exchange rates were estimated to increase the gross revenues six or seven per cent over the preceding temporary rate. Date of termination was December 31. 1919. That part of the original order referring to justification of the toll rates was postponed for the reason that time enough did not remain in which to make as complete a study as the Commission would like to make, and because there was at that time pending in United States supreme court a test of the right of the postmaster general to put into effect in Nebraska cerain toll rates he deemed proper. His right so to do was finally established in June and the toll rates authorized by the order of May 2 were superseded and other rates continued in effect until December 1. 1919. At that time a further continuance to January 31 on toll rates was granted. The .exchange rates came on for hearing on December 18, as per the terms of the previous order. The company asked that the existing rates be extended during the year 1920, and made showing in support of that application. The temporary increases in exchange rates authorized by the Com - mission had the effect of increasing the per station monthly revenue of telephone rentals from $2.28 in December, 1918, to $2,568 in November, 1919, an increase of 28.8 cents per station, or 12.6 per cent. The total revenues of the company from all sources, measured on a per station </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 Ei, increased from $3,334 In December, 1918, to $3,735 in November, , or an increase in total revenues per station of 40.1 cents per th. This amounts to 12.03 per cent increase. It will thus be seen the increases authorized by the Commission in April and May on and exchange rates actually furnished greater relief than had been aated when the orders were entered. IThe company's revenues were further increased by a growth In me of traffic, but this was more than off-set by increases in ex - litures. For example, the increase in gross revenues for eleven ths in 1919. as compared with eleven months in 1918, was 2G.19 cent. The increases in expenses, comparing the two periods, unted to 28.02 per cent. These figures include a development in of 3.08 per cent in total number of stations served, and a plant stment increase of 17.74 per cent. A considerable part of the in - se in plant was brought about by the construction of a large office ling in Omaha owned by the applicant, used largely by it and with Ions rented to affiliated Bell properties in the central west. During the year 1919 (eleven months), applicant passed to surplus $461,988, which at first blush would indicate that the rates authorized by the Commission had been much higher than required. Of this amount $103,474 was profit from the sale of certain office real estate in Omaha. By the practice of the company this profit inures to the benefit of the properties, but cannot be considered in the 1920 estimates because such profitable sale will not be repeated. The item also in - cludes $327,348 earned under contract with the federal government. This is the amount paid by the postmaster general for the privilege of ex perimenting with the operation of applicant's properties within the state of Nebraska. Indications are that this profit will not be repeated be - cause the experiment will not be repeated. Allowance for those two items reduce the total undivided profits to $31,166. of which $17,578 represents the undivided profits from the operation of the properties. I During the first six months of 1919, when present exchange rates j in effect for only one month, applicant operated at a net loss of &gt;36. Under the increased rates for the months of July to November, isive, this deficit was wiped out and a surplus of $17,578 created. i the company earned in five months under the rates now contem - ?d $71,114 more than sufficient to pay the costs of operation, main - nce, fixed charges and dividends on outstanding stock. Jf condi - s in 1920 remain comparable with those of the five months ending ember 30, 1919. the company will earn undivided profits approximat - $170,000. This will include the company's earnings from every sourcs. It em - braces earnings of more than $300,000 annually from non-operating Erties. It will represent about three and one-half per cent on total revenues of $4,500,000 estimated for 1920. Is this an excessive n of safety? In November, 1919, under existing rates, the com- </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 193 pany failed to meet its obligations by more than $2,000. The expenses of operation were $13,000 higher than the average for the five months ending in November. The company is unable to state whether this rate of expenditures would be permanent. Taxes charged in that month were $4,000 higher than the average, due to adjustments because of failure to accrue proper amounts in preceding months. If the November expenditures are to represent the 1920 monthly expenditures, the margin of safety above referred to will be insufficient. Viewed from another angle, this estimated undivided profits item which if realized would pass to corporate surplus, represents in part the earnings of surpluses accrued from all sources through many years of time. This applicant has never waived its right to this corporate surplus to do with as it saw fit, and to declare as extra dividends earn - ings accruing from such surplus. The question involved is of high im - portance, but fortunately need not be determined in this case. The company has not paid out dividends from earnings on this corporate surplus, nor has it parcelled out the surplus itself during its history. The practice of the company is to retain such surpluses for the benefit of the property. It has not capitalized nor sought to capitalize the sur - plus nor accretions in values of property units. It has not set up in its asset statement any such assumed accretions. So long as this 1 policy continues no injustice to the public arises from earning some margin of safety annually. Applicant has, however, invested in reasonably liquid securities a substantial amount of depreciation reserve, accrued for protection of the properties. It is within the realm of possibilities that all the earn - ings from such invested depreciation reserve and such parts of the company's surplus as are likewise invested, might appear at the end of 1920 as undivided profits which, by the practices of the company, would pass at once to corporate surplus. The question of whether actual earnings on invested depreciation reserve should accrue to the benefit of that account, is of enough Importance that the Commission will ask the company to define its method of handling this account in a hearing before the Commission at any convenient date within the next ninety days. It has heretofore been mentioned that the original order in this case required the handling of depreciation reserve so that replacements in kind, regardless of cost, should be charged against depreciation re - serve. It develops that thl: requirement of the Commission has not been complied with by the company. The company will be required either to comply with that provision in the original order, or to show cause on the same date as will be set for the preceding subject, why it should be permitted to continue its present method of handling depreci - ation reserve. It is readily a two-sided question, but this temporary order is no proper place to discuss it. </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT The complete financial statements of the company lead to no other conclusion than that existing rates for exchange service should be con - tinued in effect. The question as to how long an extension of these temporary rales, which are extremely high, should be authorized has received the careful consideration of the Commission. No modern prophet can now look into the future and foretell the financial condi - tions throughout 1920. It appears that the interest of the public will be properly safe-guarded if these rates are extended for twelve months if the company files complete monthly summaries of the business of the month. If conditions change materially, the effect will be reflected in such monthly statements. The Commission has the right at any time to call up for review the rates of a common carrier. It is not necessary to make such conditions a provision of this order, but the finding should ■how that it is the intention of the Commission to check carefully each month and to take such action at any time as circumstances may warrant. t Applicant occasionally purchases the properties of other companies consolidates them with its own system. It is of importance that Commission receive in each such instance a report from the com - t showing clearly the entries on the books of the company result - from such acquisitions. The Commission will ask that these re - &gt; be made from the original effective date of this order, December ORDER I IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway mission that the Nebraska Telephone Company be and it hereby is orized to continue the publication and collection of exchange rates as authorized by the Commission in its order dated May 2, 1919. em - bodying schedules now lawfully on file with the Commission.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3701 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Authority to Increase Rates on Cer - tain Classes of Service. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: The original order in this case was issued on October 1, 1918, and became effective November 1, 1918. It authorized increases in certain exchange rates and an advance of approximately 25 per cent in all toll rates of the company. The order was to remain in effect for six months, or until May 1, 1919, unless otherwise ordered by the Com - mission, the company on or before that date to make complete show - ing as to the reasonableness of the rates involved. Jurisdiction being retained of the matter for all purposes within the issues thereof. On April 17, 1919, the company filed with the Commission a farther application praying for an indefinite extension of the order herein, alleging that for the past eleven months it has operated at a deficit of more than $28,000. notwithstanding the increased revenue resulting from the rates made effective on November 1, 1918. Hearing on the application for an extension of the order was set for Saturday. April 26, 1919, in the offices of the Commission, and notice of the same was served upon the city of Lincoln and given to the public press. No per - son appeared to protest at the time of hearing and no written protests have been received by the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p196">196 TWELJTH ANNUAL REPORT In support of its application, the company submits a statement showing its entire revenue and expense for the year ending March 31, 1»18. This statement shows a deficit of 124,767.03 for the period The period thus shown includes five months under the new rates. The in - crease actually realized corresponds very closely to the estimate of the amount made at tbe first hearing. The total revenue, including both toll and exchange for the five months immediately preceding November 1, 1919, aggregated $690,100, while the revenue for the five months succeeding that date amounted to $784,990. This is an increase at the rate of $18,978 per month, or $227,736 for a year. Applicant's estimate of the probable annual revenue to be realized was $227,366. The In - crease in exchange revenue has not been as large as was anticipated, due very largely to a decrease in the number of subscribers' stations, the decrease for the year 1918 being approximately 1,800. This has been compensated for, however, by the receipts for the installation and con - nection charges', the sum received from this source being $18,056.50 sli.ee November 1, and $23,543.50 since September 1, when they first became effective. Approximately $1,500 should be deducted from the latter amount to show the net increase, as some connection charges were in effect prior to the order of the postmaster general. The loss in subscribers ceased in March and the company anticipates a net increase for the coming year of approximately 1,000. The increase in operating expenses as anticipated at the time of the first hearing has been realized. The greater portion of the in - crease has been due to advanced wages. It was estimated that wages would have to be increased to the extent of $150,000, whereas the actual increase has been nearer $160,000. The increase in taxes has not been as great as was expected although it is substantial. Costs of materials and supplies continue on the same high level. I From the showing made at this time, therefore, it is apparent that conditions which made an increase of rates necessary six months still continue, and that the present schedule of rates will be re - fd for some months to come. The company asks for an indefinite nsion of the original order. The Commission is of the opinion, ever, that a definite expiration date should be fixed. As in the orig - order, Jurisdiction of the matter will be retained so that the rates be modified as changing conditions Justify. In view of the fact the accounts of the company are closed at the end of the calendar •, we p-hall fix December 31, 1919, as the terminating date of the &gt;lemental order.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3706 In the Matter of the Application of the Bertrand Telephone Company for Author - ity to Increase Rates. FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: This matter came on for consideration by the Commission upon the oral motion of the applicant to set aside the order made herein on December 31, 1918, and to receive additional information as to the con - dition of the company. The motion was sustained. It now appears that the Commission was in error in finding that the dividends paid during the five years ending December 31, 1917. amounted to $11,199.08. This amount represented the surplus above costs of maintenance, taxes' and other expenses during the period. The dividends paid amounted to $6,292.26 only, and inasmuch as no dividend was paid during 1918 they constitute the return to the owner for six and one-half years ending December 31, 1918. The return averages 7% per annum during the period on the capitalization. The surplus remaining on December 31, 1918, amounted to $5,662.72, but there is due from this fund a salary claim of the owner for services during 1918 ;n the sum of $624.00. He devoted all of his time during the year to the business, as considerable reconstruction work was going on, and claims that be should be compensated at the rate of $100 a month. This is not unreasonable. The balance in the surplus account actually belonging thereto at the end of 1918 is therefore only $5,038.72. The company's experience in 1918 showed that all of this surplus was needed for the reconstruction of the plant. $4,062.73 was expended </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT for that purpose on the property located in Bertrand, and it is claimed that the reconstruction of the country lines to be done during 1919 will cost more than $1 000. Tbe question is, therefore, are the current revenues sufficient for all of the company's needs, including a fair re- turn upon the value of the property? The Commission found a value of $13,624.78 in the 1913 case. All the Commission has before it at this time concerning values are the 1913 valuation, tbe showing as to reconstruction expenditures above noted, and the fact that the present owner purchased a half interest in the property from his partner on May 1, 1918, for $6,500. This trans - action was, in fact, an exchange of properties, and the agreed price is therefore not controlling as to value; but considering the cost of re- pairs and replacements made in 1918 (in connection with the 1913 valuation) the present value cannot be far from $15,000, and that figure will be used for the purposes of this case. It results in an average of $56.60 per telephone owned by the company. The reproduction new value for use in estimating the requirements for maintenance and depre - ciation is fixed at $20,500, which is $1,613.50 in excess of the correspond- ing valuation in the 1913 case. Applicant was unable to show the experience of the company as to revenues and expenses for the entire year of 1918 because his former Eier (who was the manager previous to applicant's acquirement of whole plant) retained possession of the books and refuses to de - them to him. The showing was complete, however, for the latter eight months of the year. Extending this showing to cover the entire Iir (changing the owner's salary so as to represent the amount ned and allowing 50% of it as a charge against general expense), &gt;wing 10% per annum for maintenance and depreciation and a return 8% per annum on the value of the property, results in the following statement: EXPENSES Operative : &gt;perators" wages itationery and advertising &lt;ight, heat, water and power ■l .UtO.

The present monthly rates are as follows: Tlusiuees $2.00 One-party town residence 1.25 Pour-party town residence 1.00 Farm residence 1.25 Switching rate 45 with additional rates for desk and extension sets. An increase of 50 cents gross and 25 cents net per month in all of the rates, including switching, is asked for. No separate showing was made as to the cost of furnishing switching service, and inasmuch as the rate usually charged for such service does not exceed 50 cents a month, there is no justification for the increase of this rate above that amount. There are 158 users of switching service and an increase of five cents a month would yield $94.80 per annum. There are 26") reg- ular subscribers and an increase of twenty-five cents a month in their rate will yield $795.00 per annum, making a total increase in revenues of $889.80. This is approximately $500 per annum above current re- quirements. The excess would go to a surplus account for use in cover- ing deficits that may arise in the future. The creation of a surplus fund is justifiable as long as the fund does not becom? disproportionate to the probable variations in the cost of the service from year to year. The allowance for maintenance and depreciation should provide a re- serve sufficient to keep the property in good operating condition. Practically speaking, therefore, a surplus is necessary only for the pur- pose of insuring a reasonable return to the owner of the property. The insuring of one year's return in advance would seem to be sufficient for this protection and the surplus account should therefore never exceed that amount, or in this case $1,200, unless the owner's investment is in- creased. When the balance in the account exceeds this amount the rates should be correspondingly reduced. The principle of the gross and net rate has been repeatedly ap- proved by the Commission on the ground that it greatly reduces the work of making collections and is therefore economical. The switching </seg>

Howard, President; S. A. Westing, Vlce-Presi- TAYLOR, Commissioner This is an application for an increase of seventy-five cents per month on business telephones and fifty cents per month on farm and residence telephones, with a discount of twenty-five cents for prompt payment. The present rates are as follows Business $2.00 per month Residence 1.25 per month Farm 1.21 per month In Application No. 3451, considered simultaneously with this, a dis- cussion of the value of the plant and the investment in it is presented and it is unnecessary fo repeat that here, further than to say that we found the reproduction new value of the property to be $20,110 and the actual iiivcitment of the stockholders $ir&gt;,425. These figures will be used as a basis for the conclusions in this case. Applicant represents that operating costs of all kinds have ma - terially increased in recent years and that additional revenue is neces - sary if service is to be maintained and an earning returned to the stockholders. It is further contended that the president and secretary of the company are now inadequately paid. They receive $25 a month each and it is urged that these salaries should be increased to $75 or $100 per month each. Statements of the earnings and operating expenses are submitted for the years 1917 and 1918. In addition the Commission has the annual </seg>
            <seg id="p202">TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT 202 reports for the same and previous years. The showing for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1918, apparently reflects the conditions as they eziert at the present time, the annual report for the calendar year end- ing December 31. 1918, indicating that the expenses for the last six months of the year were not much in excess of those for the first half of the year. There ie a discrepancy as to the revenue, t'ae report for the fiscal year showing the rental receipts to be over $200 more than for the calendar year. This appears to be due partially to a difference in the number of subscribers reported, 553 being reported for the year ending June 30, 1918. and only 340 for the year ending December 31st Using the expenses as reported for the year ending June 30, 1918, readjusted as later explained, and the revenues for the year ending December 31st, we have the following statement REVENUES Toll Service $ 471.28 Subscribers' Service 33 Business (a $24 792.00 111 Residence @ $15 1,665.00 196 Farm (3 $15 2,940.00 Sale of material 88.52 Moving and installing 25.25 $5,982.05 $5,982.05 EXPENSES $1,789.35 $1,789.35 EXPENSES General : President's salary $ 300.00 Secretary's salary 500.00 $ 600.00 600.00 Maintenance and depreciation: (10% of $20,011) $2,001.00 2,001.00 $4,390.35 4,390.35 Net Income $1,591.70 1,074.00 Dividends (8% on $13,425).

            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 203 In the above statement we have substituted for the actual expendi - tures for maintenance an annual allowance of 107c of the reproduction value of the property, which is intended to cover both maintenance and depreciation. The company has been expending more than this in the past two years. It is evident, " however, that the property it, 1 going through a rather extensive reconstruction period and that the expendi - tures for that reason are somewhat above normal. It is apparent, also, that a portion of the expenditures should have been charged to addi - tions and betterments. We believe the sum allowed will be adequate, even under present material and labor costs. The operating expenses include an increase in pay to the three operators, but it is claimed that an additional increase of $7.."0 per month for the three will be necessary, making the annual charge of $90.00 to be included. With refernce to the claim that the salaries of the president and secretary should be increased, the Commission is of the opinion that some increase is necessary. We believe, however, that a combined salary cf $100.00 per month would provide adequate com - pensation. Such an amount compares favorably with the expenditures for this purpose by other companies of similar size. This would add $600 annually to the expense, making a total of $690 net included in the above statement. This is greater by $172.30 than the net surplus shown and would create a deficit to that amount. If the revenue figures for the year ending June 30th are used, however, there would still remain a surplus of $22.70. Expenses of all kinds have mounted rapidly in the past two years, but there is every reason to believe that the limit has been reached and that the changes if any, will be downward rather than upward in the future. While the number of subscribers appears to have ds - creased slightly in the last half of the year 1918, that is probably but a temporary condition. There has been a gradual increase for several years past and the increase should continue with the normal develop - ment of the territory served. The toll revenue has likewise shown a steady increase. Taking these things into consideration, the Commis - sion is of the opinion that the present revenue is adequate and that it will continue to be adequate for all purposes. It should be borne in mind that an allowance of 8% for dividends is made here, whereas in the majority of cases the Commission has found 7% to be reasonable. The increase of the capital securities (Application No. 3251, supra), to the extent of $3,500, also has a bearing. It increases the allowance for dividends in the amount of $280 and to that extent adds to the net in - come of the present owners, over what they have been receiving in the past. The rates asked for would produce additional revenue to the amount of approximately $1,200 annually. We can find no necessity for such a surplus. The application will therefore be denied. It is desired by the company to assess a penalty of 25c per month where rentals are not paid by the tenth of the month. In lieu of such </seg>

BROWNE, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3725 I the Matter of the Applicaton of the armers Telephone Company of Dodge ounty for an Increase of Rates. WIL8ON, Commissioner: Applicant owns and operates a telephone system which supplies service to approximately 1,325 regular subscribers and 180 switching subscribers. It has five exchanges located at Webster, North Bend, Scribner, Snyder and Dodge, and a few rural lines that are connected with the Nebraska Telephone Company's exchange at Fremont. The towns in which the exchanges are located are adjacent to each other r service is given over the whole The present rates are as follows system at flat rates. Per Month Business $1.75 Town residence, 1-party 1.25 Town residence, 2-party 1.00 Farm residence 1.25 Switching 25 Extension sets, additional 25 Interchange service with Purple Cane Telephone Co 75 The prayer of the application is for an increase of 25 cents per month in all regular rates and 10 cents per month in the switching </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 and interchange rates, and toll rates of from 10 cents to 25 cents per message between the exchanges. The toll rate feature was waived at the hearing. Applicant is a corporation of about 80 stockholders. It was organ - ized in 1901 and practically all of the operating income has been rein - vested in the property. The amount of capital contributed by the stockholders amounts to $22,885 while applicant claims that a cost new valuation of the property is $83,692.71 and that its present value is $54,215.69. Applicant furnished an inventory of the property in place describing the property in detail and showing the ages of the various units. The Commission's engineering department made a study of this inventory and, applying unit prices based on actual inventory made by the department of similar plants, found the reproduction new value to be $90,849.85 and present value to be $61,895.55. The difference between these values and those shown by applicant are accounted for largely by an addition of 10 per cent for general expenditures and contingencies by the department. The plant is in poor physical condition on the whole. This is evi - denced by the condition per cent shown by applicant's inventory and the engineering study which is from 65 per cent to 68 per cent, and by considerable parol testimony. About 60 per cent of the poles now in place have been reset and most of the remainder now require resetting. Considerable replacement of poles is necessary and at least one of the switchboards. The farm lines are heavily loaded, forty-two of the lines having an average of fifteen subscribers to each line. 62 out of a total number of farm subscribers of 781 are on these heavily loaded lines. There are also insufficient trunk lines between the exchanges. The service is, therefore, quite inferior on the whole and because a consider - able portion of the outside equipment needs to be replaced each year and the company has neglected to establish a depreciation reserve fund, the annual revenues are insufficient to provide the funds necessary to place the property in good operating condition. The capital contributions were made in point of time as follows: One dividend only has been paid during the life of the company — $1,601.95 in 1918. Applicant contends that deferred dividends should 7VX , * T.VVV 902 4,000 .903 3,805 904 560 .905 2,510 906 690 .907 1,410 908 2,330 .909 560 910 1.480 911 1.460 .912 80 Total $22,885 </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 I allowed on the capital invested beginning with the year following investment at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. The claim appears sonable under the circumstances. A computation of the deferred dends on this basis amounts to $22,735.25 up to January 1, 1919. ling this to the actual capital paid in gives a present capital invest - it of 145.620.25. Deducting this from the present value of the perty claimed by applicant of $54,215.69 leaves $8,595.44 as a surplus. ■ surplus is not available for the purposes of such a fund, however, reason of its investment in the property. The Commission suggested to applicant's officers at the hearing that the embarrassment of the company appeared to be due to the lack of capital, and inquired if the stockholders would not be willing to subscribe for additional stock. The reply was that by reason of practically no dividends having been paid upon the stock and the m eagerness of individual holdings, it would be impossible to make addi - tions to capital. Applicant estimated the cost of installing additional lines in rural territory so as to reduce the number of subscribers to no more than ten on a line at $8,729.50. This construction is necessary to the rendition of adequate service. It concerns not only the subscribers attached to the rural lines in question (some of whom, perhaps, prefer a heavily loaded line in order to speak with their neighbors without calling the exchange), but it affects all the other users of the service. They are entitled to reasonably prompt connections when calling subscribers everywhere on the system, and experience has shown this to be im - possible where a line has more than ten subscribers. tThe Webster exchange acts as a central station in all communica - s between the other exchanges, all such messages passing through exchange. The record shows that the trunk lines carrying this ness are overloaded and that additional lines are necessary, at t between North Bend and Webster, and Scribner and Webster, total cost of the new construction necessary will approximate MM. The obligation of providing funds for this purpose is upon the kholders and unless they provide the capital, they must forego the nent of dividends until the capital has been contributed in that ner. The cost of replacements necessary at this time appears to be In the neighborhood of $10,000 also. This is an obligation resting on the rate payers, but they have already contributed the greater portion of the amount. The surplus of $8,595.44 referred to came from the rate payers but it is invested in the property. The stockholders should con - tribute this amount in cash capital at this time so that the surplus would become available. In default of such contribution, the payment of dividends will be further postponed. Stockholders may not withdraw funds needed for the purpose of discharging the company's obligation to the public until such time as the obligation has been fully performed. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 207 An estimate of the revenues due from the rate payers at this time is as follows: ANNUAL COSTS OF SERVICE The allowance for operators' wages is based on the present scale of wages plus $600 for one additional operator deemed necessary at Web - ster to properly handle the trunk line business. Other allowances are based on the company's experience in 1918 with the exception of mis - cellaneous expenses, to which $650 is added owing to the considerable amount of replacement work necessary at this time. A return of 7 per cent upon the present value amounts to a trifle over 8 per cent upon the capital invested in the plant including deferred dividends. The revenues during 1918 amounted to $24,185.60. This does not include rentals earned and not collected, the exact amount of which could not be ascertained from the record. The revenue for that year is believed to be fairly representative, however, as the lowest amount of annual revenues during the last five years is $22,033.24 and the highest amount is $25,406.45. Current revenues are, therefore, short of the requirements approxi - mately $2,600 per annum. The increased rate prayed for will provide $4,167 additional revenue, or $1,567 more than appears to be necessary in view of the liberal allowances made for the costs of the service. The application will, therefore, not be granted entirely. The rela - tion between the several classes of rates does not appear to be wholly equitable as the business rates are too low measured by the extent and value of the service rendered such subscribers. The Commission finds, therefore, that the increase of 25 cents in the business rates should be gTanted but that 15 cents only should be added to the residence rates, and 10 cents to the switching rates. The relation will then be more in harmony with that existing in systems of similar size and character. In fact, the switching rate of 35 cents has rarely been shown to be compensatory for that class of service. Such an increase will provide $2,742.60 of additional revenue based on the present number of sub - scribers. No increase in the rates should be granted, however, unless the company undertakes forthwith to make the repairs and replace - ments described herein. Public utility concerns should discharge their duties to the public contemporaneously with the collection of rates which enable them to do so.

            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 209 Applicant protested strongly that the increase was insufficient and obtained leave to show cause why a greater increase should not be allowed. The Commission ordered further in connection with the rate in - crease that considerable repairs be made to the existing property and such additions as were necessary to reduce the number of its rural subscribers per line to no more than ten. It also required the con - struction of an additional metallic trunk line between applicant's ex - changes located in Webster, North Bend and Scribner, and that until such repairs and additions were made no cash dividends should be declared or paid to the stockholders. The cost of these ir pairs and additions was estimated at $20,000. Applicant now shows that it is proceeding diligently with the mak - ing of these repairs and additions and that by the time they are com - pleted approximately $10,000 of additional capital will be invested in the plant, this amount being the estimated cost of the additions and betterments. This calls for a greater allowance for maintenance and depreciation and for return than was allowed in the original order and we estimate the amount necessary for those purposes at $1.700 — $1,000 additional for maintenance and depreciation and $700 additional for return. Applicant now asks for gross and net rates to its regular subscrib- ers, the net rates to govern if paid on or before the tenth of the month for which they are made. No increase is asked of the switching and interchange service rates. The rates requested are as follows monthly: Gross Net Business $2.25 $2.00 Town residence, 1-party 1.75 1.50 Town residence, 2-party 1.50 1.25 Farm residence 1.75 1.50 The net rates are the same as those prayed for in the original ap - plication and it was found in the original opinion that they would probably provide $1,424.40 more revenue than the rates authorized at that time. The gross and net rate basis has been authorized in a great many matters 1 by the Commission as an aid in making collection. It results in prompt payment by all but a few subscribers on the whole and does not yield much additional revenue. It also operates to reduce expenses. We find, therefore, that the application should be granted, subject to the conditions contained in the original order, and to the further con - dition that the books of account shall be kept according to General Order No. 45 of the Commission prescribing a uniform system of ac - counts for telephone companies, the amount to be set aside monthly for maintenance and depreciation to be $783.33, or a total of $9,400 per annum. </seg>

The reproduction new value of the property as of May 15, 1917, was found to be $81,227.38 and the present fair value $59,341.71. The company, in default of accurate book - keeping accounts, adopted the Commission's findings of present value as the opening entries of new general accounts, except the allowance for general expenditures, which was omitted. Its assets and liability statement of December 31, 1918, is as follows: tThe company claims that at all of the times in its history it has i entitled to a return of 7% per annum upon stockholders' capital, to the same rate of return upon the moneys invested in the prop - in lieu of dividends. This appears to be fair and reasonable under circumstances of this case. In fact, this rate is below the prevail - rates of interest on good securities in the vicinity.

This will leave the sum of $5,980.22 due to stockholders on account of returns invested in the property. Under the title of advantageous bargains in purchases of company property, showing was made as follows: In 1907 the company pur - chased the competing telephone plant of the Nebraska Telephone Com - pany at Alma excepting the central office equipment for $225.00. The property consisted of poles and wires, the estimated cost of which in place was $1,200. The company claims a profit of $475 in the transac - tion, but inasmuch as most of the property had to be dismantled the profit cannot be said to be so great, and we find it to be $350. In 1908 the company purchased from the Nebraska Telephone Com - pany twenty-one miles of rural lines connected with its Alma exchange. It estimates that these lines could not have been built for less than $1,200 and placed their present value at $800. The lines were in good operating condition and the estimate of $400 benefit to the company is allowed. In 1917 the company purchased from the Nebraska Telephone Com - pany an old switchboard for $28.00, scrapped it, and sold the platinum and other materials at a profit of $545.46. Deducting the cost of dis - mantling, estimated at $45.46, leaves a profit of $500 due to this trans - action. 902 $ 360.00 903 1,175.00 904 5,379.00 905 9,188.00 .906 9,188.00 .908 12.189.00 .909 12,189.00 910 15,692.50 .911 15,692.50 912 15,692.50 .913 15,692.50 .914 15,692.50 .915 15,692.50 916 16,012.50 917 16,012.50 7 7 7 2 2 7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 $ 25.20 82.25 376.53 193.76 193.76 853.23 121.89 156.93 156.92 156.93 156.92 156.93 156.92 160.13 160.13 119 112 105 98 91 77 70 63 56 49 42 35 28 21 14 $ 29.98 92.12 395.36 189.83 176.32 665.52 85.33 98.82 87.86 76.85 65.90 54.91 43.93 33.60 22.40 </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT tin 1914 the company purchased the telephone property belonging to fund company at Alma and Huntley and added the materials after Landing to its stock of supplies. The profit on this transaction is nated at $250, which appears to be reasonable. Claim is also made for the collection of a disputed toll account with a connecting company which had refused for a considerable period to route messages over applicant's lines according to contract. If this were allowed the applicant should be charged with the costs of readi - ness to serve, maintenance and return of the lines, and all other ex - penses incurred in collecting the account; and as no showing was made in this respect the claim is disallowed. The sum of these benefits, including a return of 7% per annum thereon from the firs'! of the year following the transactions, amounts to $2,154.50, and is treated as a contribution by the stockholders, for which they should be compensated under the circumstances, otherwise there would be no incentive to thrift. We come next to the contributions of service by the officers and stockholders for which no compensation was made. The property was originated by the president of the company, Mr. Keester, in 1898. act - ing privately. A toll line was then built between Alma and the neigh - boring town of Orleans, said to be the first telephone line in western Nebraska. Public demand for local exchange service, and the need of financial assistance in establishing such facilities, led Mr. Keester in 1*01 to form the present company. Considerable difficulty was ex - perienced in securing additional stockholders, the stock selling in small lots only. There are now sixty-four stockholders and Mr. Keester has been the owner of a majority of the stock all of this time and presi - dent of the company. For these reasons Mr. Keester has been obliged to furnish his services considerably below their fair value to give the company the benefit of all transactions connected however remotely with the company's business, and when dealing directly with the com - pany to do so at sacrifice prices. He has also not sought to depreciate the value of the stock in order to purchase other holdings at a discount. and has on the other hand sought in every conceivable way to advance the interests of all of his associates. His successful conduct of the enterprise under adverse circumstances', and his consideration for those associated with him, are highly commendable, and it would be inequit - able and unjust to disallow the company to which he has been so loyal the benefits of his sacrifices. He does not ask them for himself alone but tor all of his associates according to their respective holdings. The toll line above mentioned cost originally $801.61. Subsequent additions increased the cost to $1,037.18. The net revenues from opera - tion during the two and a half years that it was owned by Mr. Keester amounted to $217.63, without setting anything aside for unrealized de - preciation. Mr. Keester himself assisted in the construction of this line, even to setting poles and stringing wires, for which nothing is in- </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION" 215 eluded in the cost. He also maintained the line without charge. The property was conveyed to the company in 1901 without any considera - tion at the time, but in 1903 Mr. Keester was issued $350 of capital stock for the property. Claim is made for an additional $4'&gt;n on this account and a return thereon at seven per cent from thi&gt; organization of the company, or a total of $1,017.00. which we find to b? rpa&lt;ona1&gt;le. Ever since the organization of the company Mr. Kee.ter has i» voted the major portion of his time to its service. For his services during the years 1901 to 1905 inclusive he was allowed $1.1100 of stock in 1915. In 1906 he was allowed $1,500 a year for the mm it— of him - self and office clerk and bookkeeper. Deducting the cost of the clerk Of from $360 to $600 a year left Mr. Keester from ptM "&gt; %1.UO a ye ir for his services. He makes no complaint of the compensation paid him following 1908, but the moderate increases thereafter did not compen - sate him for this sacrifice in the early years. Claim is mad.' for addi - tional compensation as follows: For the five years 1901 to MM in - clusive. $3,500; for the years 1906 to 1908 inclusive, $l,r&gt;oo. This is too much in view of the size of the company during the years in question. Taking into consideration the gradual development of the company dur - ing this period, we find the following allowances to be reasonable in addition to the $1,000 of stock issued in 1915, to-wit : the reason that the salary paid Mr. Keester dunn&lt;r tbis ported ap proaches the value of his services and that of the clerk's: and any de flcit was probably made up by subsequent increases. Other stockholders also contributed to the building of the properly during the early years without compensation, especially in the handling of materials and the construction of lines in rural territory. Th3 record shows that at least forty-three miles of line were thus built, and that poles and wire used in the construction of other lines were hauiei without cost. The company directors also served without charge during this period. The company makes claim in the amount of $5^0 to cover these services, which is very reasonable under the circumstances and is allowed together with a return thereon of 1% per annum from Janu - ary 1, 1906, or a total Bum of $955. A summary of the allowances is as follows: Return at " c ' c ppr Anmim to Year Amount Percentage J.in. 1. 1911* 1901 $ 400 119 $ 476 1902 500 112 560 1903 600 105 630 1904 700 98 686 1905 800 91 728 Total $3,000 $3,480 No increases were allowed for the years 1906 to lfios tachwlw for </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT I Viewing the contributions as a whole, however, and considering the llculty of making a fractional stock dividend, we are of the opinion it the sum of $16,012.50 (being the amount of capital stock now out - nding) will fully compensate the stockholders and enable the com - ]y to finance itself In accordance with its obligations. This will cor - •t that amount of the surplus into capital stock and leave $10,766.65 a balance in the surplus account under date of January 1, 1919. Ad - ional stock should be sold to cover the greater portion of this ar.ce. as the company neeis- funds at this time to replace portion - its property and to reduce outstanding indebtedness. This cannot be ie, however, without the authority of the Commission upon applica - n made for that purpose, and the Commission suggests thai the npany canvass its stockholders 1 and the investing public with a view selling from $5,000 to $10,000 additional stock. In the 1918 rate matter the Commission found that an investment of $12,715.46 of the company's funds in certain real estate located In Alma was unwarranted and prohibited the company from declaring or issuing any dividends to stockholders until the building was 1 so!&lt;l for that amount plus a net income thereon at 7% per annum from Janu - ary 1. 1917, or in lieu thereof until that amount had accumulated in unpaid or unissued dividends or in stock to stockholders on their con - tributions to the property of the company not compensated for. in which latter event "said property may be conveyed to the stockholders in lieu of such dividends or stock." The prayer of the company in the instant application is for permission to convey this real p?tate to its stockholders at the figure stated, in lieu of issuing to them stock in that amount, but this will Jeopardize the credit of the company unles.s its indebtedness represented by bills payable is refunded on a long time basis at a reasonable rate of interest. The bills payable run for a short time only and are largely secured by a mortgage upon all of the com - pany's property. If so large an item of property as the Alma real estate Is conveyed to the stockholders at this time without a cash considera - tion the holders' of these bills might demand payment at maturity and thus seriously embarrass the company. The Commission finds therefore that the conveyance of the Alma real estate to the stockholders, r provided in its order in the rate case, should not be made until the in - debtedness of the company on account of bills and accounts' payable Is reduced to no more than $5,000, or until the excess above $5,000 as near I may be sha.ll be refunded into bonds or bills payable maturing not i than ten yeari from date and bearing a rate of interest not in ex - ■ of 8% per annum, Return due on paid-up capital and invested returns $ 5,980.22 ienefits of advantageous bargains and return thereon 2,154.50 Ir.

The surplus revenues were ted in additions and betterments as soon as earned, and the cost e property now in place is close to $30,000. The company commenced business in 1904. The plant was of the grounded magneto type up to 1918, when it was converted to common battery metallic. Just previous to the conversion, to-wit: in February, 1918, the engineering department of the Commission made an inventory and valuation of the property and arrived at an original construction cost figure of $20,876.23 and a present value of $15,989.31. The Commis - sion requested applicant at the hearing to furnish inventories (1) of the property displaced by the conversion of the plant, and (2) the property substituted therefor, together with the salvage valuation of the property displaced, but this has not been done. Applicant simply reports a book value of property displaced amounting to $2,407.90, a salvage value of such property of $600, and a cost of property substituted of $14,310.35. Extending the inventory to include these changes would result in the construction cost figure of the property now in place of $32,788.68 and a present value (taking the betterments and additions at 100 per cent) of $27,901.76. The information is insufficient, however, for the Commis - sion to fix definite values of the property in place, but it is satisfied that the present value of the property is in excess of the capital invest - ment plus the indebtedness; and following the policy of the Commis - sion to take the capital investment as a basis for the return to owner Ee it is available, the precise value of the property is unnecessary, as of $30,000 for reproduction new value and $25,000 for present &gt; are, doubtless, conservative and will be used for the purposes of case. The borrowed funds invested in the plant were obtained during t conversion process of 1918, and the interest thereon has been ged as an expense of operation. The interest rate thereon is 7% annum.. The stockholders' payments on account of capital stock. The company appears to have earned considerably more than 8% per annum from the beginning, and contends that inasmuch us the earnings were invested in the property it is entitled to a return not only upon the capital investments but upon the earnings at that rate invested in the property. This appears reasonable in view of the fact that dividends at that rate could have been declared and paid each year and applied to the purchase of additional stock. The record also shows that interest rates on prime securities in Red Cloud during the exclusive of the 1918 assessment, were made in point of time as follows: J January, 1904 $1,216 July, 1907 1.818 December. 1907 1,905 June, 1908 573 Total J4.512 </seg>

A computation of 8% per annum upon the capital investments compounded annually amounted to tbe sum of $11,782.32 on January 1, 1919. The company also makes claim to certain benefits made by .sacri- fices on the part of its managing officials. It appears that the secretary of the company has served in that capacity from October. 191i&gt;. to date at a salary of $25 a month. He also carried on an abstract and insur - ance business and is reasonably competent in the position of company secretary. He testified that he had given at least one-third of hi: time to his duties as secretary and estimated the value of his services for the- whole pericd at $50 a month. It also appears that the manager of the company during the same period received only $10 a month. His duties were to superintend all of the work of the company outride of the clerical work and the handling of moneys, and claim is made for $40 additional a month on account of his services. The Commission is of the opinion that the company's claim on ac- count of these sacrifices should be allowed in the amount of $30 per month for both officials, or the sum of $2,970 from October 1. ISM, to January 1, 1919. This results in a total capital investment of $14. 750 in round numbers, and this amount will be taken as the basis for com- puting the return due the company The number of telephones now in use is 300, supplying 52 busin.ss houses and 218 residences 1 . Switching service is furnished to 361 farm- ers who own their own facilities outside of the corporate limits of Red Cloud. The present rates are Of the 300 users of the company's service exclusively, CO receive a rebate of 25 cents per month on account of the ownership of the tele- phone instruments us-ed by them and 48 receive a credit of 25 cents a month for constructing their own lines originally. The contract be - tween the rebaters and the company requires the former to maintain their own instruments and lines, but this has been performed only in case of instruments. The company has all along maintained the lines and has now replaced them with new lines. The original cost of these instruments to the rebaters was $15 each and for the line constructed by them $8.00 each. The rebate practice has been followed for up - wards of eleven years, and the rebate of $3.00 per year has amounted to a 20% maintenance cost and return on the investment in instru - ments and nearly 40% return on the investment in lines. The practice is unduly preferential to the rebaters 1 and unjustly discriminatory against the other subscribers. It must therefore be discontinued, and the order herein will so provide.

            <seg id="p220">220 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT The earnings and expenses of the company, exclusive of mainte- nance and new construction since October 1. 1910, are as follows: Year Ending Operating and October 1 Earnings General Expenses Remainder The amounts shown in the remainder column *»'&lt;&gt;re all expended for maintenance and new construction, and the book entries do not distinguish between the two. The earnings would have been increased approximately $360 per annum had no rebates been allowed. A con - siderable increase in the number of subscribers took place in 1918 and the estimate of gross revenues from present subscribers at existing rates, inclusive of net receipts from toll business, amounts to $6,678 per annum, not allowing for rebates. The company's expenses' increased materially in the latter part of 1918. All employes' wages were increased and the cost of purchasing materials was likewise much greater than in previous years. Five switchboard operators are required and the wages paid to them vary from $20 to $50 per month, and total $175. An increase of $25 per month in these wages is demanded and appears to be reasonable. Other employes include a treasurer and collector at $22.50 per month and a wire chief and one assistant at $140 and $90 per month, respectively. The treasurer and collector will not be necessary under the gross and net rates' to be allowed applicant, as subscribers with but few excep - tions pay their bills without personal demand under this system. The salary paid the treasurer and collector should be added to the secre - tary's salary or to the salaries of the secretary and president, if the latter officer is active. The company has manifestly suffered a loss of efficiency in the past, due to inadequate compensation to managing officers. Mechanics' wages will be covered in the allowance for main - tenance and depreciation, but not in the amount now being paid. One good telephone mechanic is all that is required in a plant of this size and the allowance for maintenance and depreciation will not permit of more. The amount of $30,000 as reproduction new value of the property will be taken as the basis of the allowance for maintenance and depreciation, and the annual rate will be that found sufficient in similar plants, viz., nine per cent.

(SEAL) In the Matter of the Supplementary Appli - cation of the Wyoming A. Nebraska Tele - phone Company for Authority to Increase Its Exchange Rates. Appearances: For Applicant — Philip E. Horan, Attorney FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: On December 31, 1918, the Commission granted an increase in ap - plicant's rates of approximately twenty per cent on subscribers' charges and exactly twenty-five per cent on toll. Applicant now alleges th.it the costs of operation, maintenance and taxes have continued to in - crease since that time and are yet increasing; that based upon its ex - perience under the increased rates in the first four months of 1919, under the increased rates, the deficit for the current year, including lie eight per cent return allowed by the Commission, will amount to $3,754.95, in addition to the deficit of $7,857.68 suffered in 1918; and that if it is not permitted to increase its rates its property will be con - fiscated in the amount of the deficit. Applicant prays a further in - crease of its subscribers' charges of twenty-five cents per month on in - dividual residence telephones and fifty cents per month on business tele - phones, excepting at the Gordon exchange where twenty-five cents on party residence, fifty cents on individual residence and $1.25 on business telephones is asked, subject to the conversion of the exchange from magneto to common battery, which work is now in progress. A new rate of twenty-five cents per month for desk sets is also requested. APPLICATION NO. 3736 </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 TWELFTH AJWUAL REPORT Applicant presented the following estimate of earnings and ex- penses for the year 1919, based on the results of the first four months of the year. Earnings: Subscriber's stations $51,240.30 Switching service 8,784.66 I Further increases in operators' wages since the four months' period increase this deficit by $1,020, and the prospects are that further eases of wages must be made. Much testimony was offered in support of the estimate, but it was deduced by the Commission on cross-examination of applicant's wit - nesses that eighty-five per cent of the general office expenses, including salaries, supplies and attorneys' fees is being charged against operating revenues as a current expense, whereas it is evident that the major portion of these expenses has been incurred on account of additions to the plant. t Applicant dates its existence from November 1, 1916, when it pur - ed and consolidated seven telephone exchanges of an estimated e of $183,000. It has practically doubled its plant since that time the work has required the close attention of the president and vice ident and general manager, whose combined salaries of $11,500 per im represents the greater part of the overhead expenses. The re - i of charging so large a proportion of these expenses to current nues would not be serious but for the fact that the company is y to expand for several years in the future and the total amounts considerable sum. We are of the opinion, therefore, that not less I Toll 36,850.32 Miscellaneous 2,200.00 Total Expenses: Maintenance and depreciation (9% of plant value) $28,576.17 Traffic 17,748.60 Commercial 10,357.59 General 10.252.13 $99,076.2: Total $66,934.4: Net operating revenue 'barges against net revenue: Taxes $ 4,500.00 Office rents 1,565.00 Rents on phantom coils 120.00 I Interest 8% on $160,244.28 for one year 12,819.54 Interest 8% on $13,000 for eight months 692.00 Interest 8% on $15,000 for five months 500.00 Uncollectible accounts 1.880 00 Dividends 8% on $172,740 of stock 13,819.20 $32,140.7!

            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 225 than forty per cent of the overhead expenses as now accounted for be charged to new construction and that the accounts reflecting these charges be corrected lrom the beginning. When this is done the com - pany's surplus will show a balance in place of a deficit as now. It was also shown that the item of uncollectible accounts, $1,880, represents an accumulation of such accounts from the beginning of the company, and that the annual allowance for that purpose need not be in excess of $600. If the balance now in the account represents a total loss it will of course diminish the surplus in that amount. Wjth these additions and exceptions applicant's estimate of 1919 re - sults is conservative and points clearly to the necessity for additional revenue. The revenues estimated to accrue from the increases in rates proposed amounts to $8 645.40 per annum, all of which will apparently be needed to overcome the deficit. Complaint was made to the Commission that rural telephone line No. 24 connected with the Chadron exchange was in very poor condition and an exception will be made to the general rate increase in favor of subscribers connected with this line until the line is placed in good operating condition. The attention of the company is again called to its method of financing so large a portion of the investment by means of short-time paper. This is objectionable for two reasons, namely, the higher in - terest rate that must be paid on such securities, and the danger of financial embarrassment in the event the company is called upon to pay the securities when due. It would appear that a long-time bond issue could be floated at seven per cent per annum and applicant is urged to effect such an issue as soon as possible. The same restrictions as to the payment of interest and dividends made in the Commission's order on December 31, 1918, will apply to all of the revenues' of the company as heretofore. Consideration -was given during the hearing to the relation of the switching rates to the regular subscribers' rates and in view of the great increase in the costs of operation, it was suggested that the switching rate of sixty cents per month was probably too low. Appli - cant was not prep.ired to offer testimony as to the exact cost of switch - ing service, but offered to do so within a reasonable time. As switch - ing rates are for the most part paid annually in advance and the rates for the current year have been collected, it would be unwise to increase them at this time. The Commission will retain jurisdiction of the case for the purpose of receiving this cost study, and the applicant is re - quested to furnish it on or before December 1, 1919, in order that higher rates found reasonable may take effect on January 1 following: ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Wyoming &amp; Nebraska Telephone Company be, and the same is hereby authorized and directed </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3748 In the Matter of the Application of the Kearney Telephone Company for Author - ity to Increase Its Rates for Business. Residence, and Switching Service and to Discontinue Certain Free Service. Appearances: For Applicant — E. M. Morsman, Attorney; W. S. Clapp, Secretary Warren Pratt, President. For City of Kearney— W. L. Hand. For City of Riverdale— G. H. Williams. For Village of Gibbon— H. S. Harris. For Fanners Home Telephone Company of Gibbon — C. M. Beck. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant operates a telephone system in Buffalo county consisting of three exchanges, viz.: Kearney, Riverdale and Sumner. It serves a total of 2,346 stations, 368 of which are on lines owned by farmers and switched by the company. The application is for authority to increase business rates fifty cents per month, residence rates twenty-five cent^ per month, and switching charges fifteen cents per month. The com - pany also desires to discontinue free service from the subscribers on its Riverdale exchange to the subscribers on the Kearney exchange re - siding within the city limits of Kearney, and the free service furnished between the Kearney exchange and the Gibbon exchange of the Farmers Home Telephone Company. Notices of this application and the hearing to be held thereon were furnished to all of the papers of Kearney, the chairman of the village </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 board at Riverdale and at Gibbon, the Union Valley Telephone Com - pany, and the Farmers Home Telephone Company of Gibbon. At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for the city of Kearney asked for a continuance, which request was joined in by the representatives of the patrons of Riverdale. At that time it was arranged &lt;hat a second hear - ing would be held at Kearney. Subsequently, however, the company withdrew that portion of its application regarding the discontinuance of free service from Riverdale. This prompted the Riverdale patrons to abandon their request for a second hearing, although they desired to be registered as protesting against the arrangement of the lines of the company and against the service now being rendered. Upon with - drawal of the request of the Riverdale patrons for a second hearing, the matter was taken up by telephone by the Commission with the city at - torney of Kearney, who, after consulting with the mayor, advised that they did not desire a further hearing and were content to have the matter submitted on the record as it stood. The matter was- then taken up with the commercial club and the vice president of that organization Joined in the conclusion reached by the city authorities. The represent - ative of the village of Gibbon stated at the hearing that he was not authorized to ask for further hearing, although he requested that such hearing be had. tWe recite the above facts with reference to the second hearing in r that it may be made clear that action is not being taken by this mission without full notice being had by the parties at interest, thus proceed to the consideration of the record as it stands. In support of its application for an increase in its rates, the com - pany alleges that its operating expenses have been materially increased in the past eighteen months and that they are likely to be further in - creased within the next year. In support of this contention they sub - mitted a number of statements. The largest increase in expenses has been in wages paid to employees and as evidence of that increase, the following comparison of wages paid during the month of July, 1916, and the month of November, 1918, is offered: r- c July 1, 1916 November 1. 1918 Increase Manager lrfi $125.00 $ Accountant ....l(n 40.00 Cashier l(ff 50.00 Billing clerk. .1^57 40.00 Chief op'r'tor.lrrT 40.00 Aust.

It is claimed further by the company that still further increases must neces- sarily be made. Companies operating in near-by territory have granted increases to their employes so that the wages paid exceed thoso now paid to certain classes of employes of applicant. Applicant expects to have to bring its wages to the level of that in the surrounding terri- tory, and it is estimated that the increase will reach at least $2,000 a year. Materials entering into the construction and repair of telephone property have very materially increased, the increase running from five to sixty per cent. The Commission has taken cognizance of this in- crease in other cases by increasing the allowance permitted to be charged against earnings for maintenance and depreciation. In normal times this allowance was fixed at eight or nine per cent of the repro- duction value of the property. In this instance we are of the opinion that an allowance of ten per cent should be made. The operating statement of the company as to revenues and ex- penses for the month of September, 1918, is as follows: REVENUES Subscribers station? $3,372.00 Toll revenue 710.00 Total $4.08200 EXPENSES Operators $1,694.61 Taxes 110.00 Total $1,804.61 Maintenance: Current maintenance $ 497.61 Depreciation 752.39 Total $1,250.00 Total $3,054.61 Total Net income $1,027.39 The company has outstanding common stock in the amount of $89,650, preferred stock in the amount of $50,000, and bonds in the amount of $80,000. Allowing interest on the bonds in the amount of $413.34 for the month of September and dividends on preferred stock at the rate of six per cent, or $250 for the month, we have remaining a surplus of $364.05 for the month, or $4,368 for the year. This will </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT amount to about four and one-half per cent on the outstanding c^mimn stock. As stated in the foregoing, however, the allowance for main - tenance and depreciation should be increased to the basis cf ten per c«nt on the reproduction new value of the property, which, for the pur - pose cf this care we find is $222,130.75 . On this basis there hould be set aide annually from the earnings of the company $22,213 for the purpose cf maintenance and depreciation. This amounts to $1,8"&gt;2 per month, cr approximately $600 more than was allowed by the company in the ircntn cf September. This much alone is sufficient to overcome the surrlus and create a deficit. It does not take into account the in - crease in wages of $2,000, which is a practical certainty, nor does it take into account a number of other expenses in the form of increased federal taxes, increases in insurance, and a number of items not shown in the expense statement, but which appear to be legitimate charges against revenues'. It is further to be noted that the statement of ex - pense for September does not include an increase of wages granted to the employes in the month of November. This increase was substantial and would materially reduce the surplus as shown for the month. tit is not necessary for the purposes of this case, in view of the ring presented, to determine the investment value in the common k of the company. There can be no question that the bonds and erred stock represent an actual investment in the property by the ers, and it is altogether probable that the sacrifice of the stock - erg is sufficiently large to represent a considerable portion, if not of the outstanding common stock. I The increases proposed will produce additional revenue from ex - ige subscribers in the amount of approximately $5,090 annually, increase of twenty-five per cent in toll will be approximately $2,000 lally, making a total increase of slightly over $7,000 per year. In connection it should be said that the Nebraska Telephone Com - r, with which the applicant is 1 connected for toll service, was re - ly granted an increase of twenty-five per cent in it3 toll rates, so at the present time rates charged by the Kearney company on out - g messages from its exchanges do not correspond with the incoming sages for the same distance to these exchanges. This conflict of b should be removed pnd the rates be made uniform, as they will iy the increase proposed by applicant. From the showing, as submitted, it would apoear that the i*&gt;cmse asked for is necessary in order to pay the increased operating expenses of the company and its interest on the bends and dividends on its pre - ferred stock. The Commission, therefore, finds the rates proposed to be reasonable. In view of the present abnormal conditions as- to labor and material, however, the Commission is of the opinion that the rates to be approved should be temporary only and that before any rate:; are made permanent a further investigation should be made. For that reason these rates will be made effective for six months only, the order to be extended upon proper showing by the company. </seg>
            <seg id="p231">231 As previously stated, applicant desires to discontinue free service between Kearney and Gibbon. Protest against the discontinuance of this service was registered by the people of Gibbon. The Farmsrs Home Telephone Company, however, which operates th3 exchange at Gibbon and with which connection with Kearney is established, offers no objection to the change in service. It is urged on behalf of the Gibbon patrons that the free service to Kearney is very much desired for the reason that Kearney is the county seat of the county in which Gibbon is located and that it is necessary for business men to frequently trans - act business over the telephone with the county authorities. It is also urged that people living midway between Kearney and Gibbon, and trading at both towns, desire service with both exchanges-, and that farmers residing in the same neighborhood, some of whom are on the Kearney exchange and some on the Gibbon exchange, desire free com - munication with each other. There is force to these objections, particu - larly to the one with reference to neighboring fanners. It appears to the Commission, however, that the disadvantages to the public outweigh the advantages. There are two trunk lines operated between Kearney and Gibbon, one owned by the applicant and the other by the Nebraska Telephone Company, the latter being used as a toll line. Applicant, however, has an arrangement with the Nebraska company whereby it makes use of the toll line between Kearney and Gibbon whenever it de - sires. This line is quite frequently used to transmit frea messages when the other line is overloaded and this use of the through toll line seriously interferes with toll service furnished in and out of Kearney. The other trunk line is overloaded all the time so that service over it is slow and greatly delayed. As usual in such instances, the traffic con - sists very largely of unimportant visiting calls, which the operating companies are unable to prevent or police. So long as unlimited free service is furnished, prompt transmission of messages will be impos - sible. Because of these service conditions, the Commission is of the opinion that the traffic should be put upon the regular message basis. It is suggested, however, that the two companies' involved establish a zone covering the farm neighborhoods referred to so that fanners living contiguous to each other can have communication between them - selves without paying a toll rate. This doubtless can be arranged by selecting certain farm lines running out from either exchange and ex - tending the free service to them.

Had the full 10 per cent been set aside, the surplus- as shown would have been decreased to the figure of $754.88. This amounts to but 1 7-10 per cent on the outstanding common stock of the company. It is apparent, therefore, that the rates approved are not producing an excess of revenue. It is equally apparent that they should be continued in effect for some time at least.

BROWNE, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3755 In the Matter of the Application of the Hooper Telephone Company to Increase Rate*. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner: The Hooper Telephone Company was organized in February. 1901, and during that year a telephone system was installed within the town of Hooper consisting of 58 phones and a small switchboard. Stock was wold to the amount of $1,250.00 During succeeding years stock was sold as follows 21,737.50 Total stock sales for cash $22,987.50 This is all that has been put into the plant from stock sales. No dividends were paid until 1913 when one at six per cent was declared, another in 1914 at six per cent, and a third in 1917 at three per cent, making a total of fifteen per cent, amounting to $3,448.00. All earnings above this amount has been spent in operation, maintenance, and ex- tensions. The company operated practically as a mutual for approximately three years and had few rented phones. That Is, the stockholders were 1902 $2,225.01 1903 2,782.51 1904 6,225.01 1905 3,737.51 1906 2,242.51 1907 l,152.5i 1908 2,260.5i 1909 962.0i 1910 150.0i </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 237 phone users. The company charged fifty cents for residence and seven- ty-five cents for business phones, per month. During this period it be- came evident that the company could not continue to restrict its service to stockholders and at the end of the period phones were rented and a charge was made to renters who were non-stockholders of $1.25 for rural, $1.00 for town residence, and $1.50 for business, while the stock- holders continued to pay fifty cents for residence and seventy-five cents for business phones. This schedule of rates continued down to January, 1910, when, by order of the Commission, the company discon- tinued this discrimination and charged all phone users the same rate for similar class of service. The company then charged all farm sub- scribers $1.25, town residence subscribers $1.00, and business subscrib- ers $1.50. These rates have continued as the base rates until the pres- ent time, but as the company's business developed and demand for spe- cial classes of service increased, a more detailed classification had to be made. To illustrate: Town residence party line wall phones were $1.00. A demand developed for "party line desk," "party line wall." "individual line wall," and "individual line desk," so it was necessary to make an extra charge for the particular, or higher class of service, which gradually developed into the following schedule of raiM, which are now in effect, to which, however, has been added the gross rate of twenty-five cents per month, upon which there is a discount of that amount provided the rent is paid within a specified time.

We find that the net toll revenue for the ye.ir is ap- proximately $ 1.438.67 and rentals on buildings and miscellaneous earnings 668.22 making a total from these sources of $ 2,106.89 </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 The amount as shown above earned from phone rentals 11,619.60 making a total earning for the year of $13,726.49 The company asks for an Increase on all phone rentals of seventy- fire cents per month, which applied to the phones in service, as shown above, amounts to a total increase of $5,652.00, or approximately forty- nine per cent. It iff not particularly difficult to ascertain the total operating revenues of any company when its books are kept In the ordinary manner, but in reaching conclusions as to how the disbursements were re in the past, we are confronted with problems very complex. The applicant company entered into the public service in 1901. It made an investment of $1,250 during that year, and installed fifty- eight phones and a small switchboard in the town of Hooper. It charged its members fifty and seventy-five cents for service. The property was new and it was not necessary to spend much money in maintaining it, but the life of the property was running towards its close just the same. The second year the company increased its capital stock at par $2,225.00, the third year $2,782.50, and so on down to 1910, as shown above, when a total of cash for stock had been paid In of $22,9S7.50. The stockholders did not pay themselves any divi- dends, but they paid for their phone service fifty and seventy-five cents per month, while the non-stockholders paid $1.00, $1.25 and $1.50 per month, depending upon the class of service received. The following tabulation shows the results of such a system of rate rebating: TABLE NO. II No. of Rebate Total phones per yr.

By Table No. II the rebate amounted to $1,593.00, resulting in a rebate above ten per cent on the stock for the year of $344.75. The following tabulation will show the result of the system down to the end of 1909 when, by order of the Commission, all subscribers for similar classes of service were charged alike: TABLE NO.

During 1910 $150 was paid in on new stock, making total stock $22, 987. HO. This amount of stock has remained constant to the present time. As stated above. from January, 1910. all subscribers having similar classes of service were charged the same rate, but the plant was of light construction and during the first nine year period very little was spent upon it for two reasons', first, the plant was new and required but little to be spent on it as maintenance; and second, the rates were not sufficient to set aside a depreciation reserve fund. What little there was was in- vested in extensions and is shown in a surplus account amounting to $3,833.75. It therefore became necessary to begin an extensive recon- struction program. When the reconstruction was determined upon, it was also decided to reconstruct with standard materials, which made a much more expensive plant than the original and which, in ihe opinion of the Commission, was the wise thing to do. This reconstruc- tion has been done entirely out of the rates. Of course money was- borrowed from time to time, but was in turn paid off out of the operat- ing revenues, the result of which was that no dividends could be paid to the stockholders, with the following exceptions: 1913, dividends at six per cent $1,379.25 1914, dividends at six per cent 1,379.25 1917. dividends at three per cent 689.62 Total cash dividends for the entire period $3,448.12 Now starting with 1910 and allowing eight per cent for dividends, we hare the following: </seg>

The Commis- sion undertakes to make due allowance for services rendered, based ri the history of the company as nearly as it can be ascertained. In checking the expenditures of the operating revenues of the past. prior to a proper method of bookkeeping, it is impossible to deter- mine how much was spent for operation, how much for maintenance and replacements, and how much actually went into new properties. The annual reports showing the amount of money collected and the ex- penditures' by it indicate that between $50,000 and $60,000 has gone into the plant for new construction from all sources, including proceeds from the sales of stock. The engineers of the Commission have made inventories and depre- ciation studies of the properties, and have made a return to the Com- mission on the original cost basis of $72,992.02 and a depreciated value of $47,495.77, which shows the plant to be in a condition per cent of •lxty-five. As shown hereinbefore, the Commission has found that the total sacrifice by the stockholders is $33,650.46, making a difference be- tween this figure and the present value of the property, as shown by </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 241 the engineers, of $13,845.31. The engineers' return, however, includes not only the property put in place as the result of capital contribution. but also includes material and labor donated by subscribers, both stock- holders and non-stockholders, during the early years of the company's existence. It also includes a considerable amount for engineering ex- penses, cost of organization, superintendence, interest during construc- tion, etc., which were not probably paid for in full by the company, but were largely provided without compensation. Regardless as to what the figure of $13,845.31 actually stands for. whether tangible or intangible properties, the Commission is of the opinion that after a company has operated for a period of seventeen years a reasonable surplus should have been provided for, not only for the protection of the stockholders, but for the protection of the prop- erties themselves, and the Commission is of the opinion that whatever may be actually represented by this figure, it should stand as a surplus not to be capitalized or used as a basis for a return in profits to the stockholders. The Commission will therefore take the $33,650.46 as a basis, to which shall be added the proceeds of the sale of an additional security of $3,349.54. This will bring the total fair value for capitaliza- tion and return to the company up to $37,000. We therefore find that the $37,000 is a fair value of the property to be used for capitalization purposes and the basis for a return. The Commission is also of the opinion that the company should be allowed a stock dividend of $10,662.96, subject to conditions of the order herein. We then have the following as capital liability: Present stock $22,987.50 Stock dividend 10.662.96 Additional stock for cash 3 349.54 Total stock $37,000.00 This means that $14,012.50 of stock at par must be sold for cash. $3,349.54 to be used in building up the plant, and $10,662.96 to be dis- tributed to the stockholders for dividends foregone in the past. It must be remembered that the present stockholders have the first option on the stock to be issued. If they do not care to take it. it must then be offered to the general public. In the opinion of the Commission this stock will always be worth par on the basis of a seven per cent return The Commission is also of the opinion that it is better for the people of local communities to own the stock in their own local public utilities. After a careful and painstaking study and analysis of the operating expense for 1919 and comparing it with the immediate preceding year we find operating expenses to be $ 4,989.40 taxes 277.27 maintenance and depreciation, ten per cent on $68.000 6,800.00 dividends on $37,000 at seven per cent 2.590.00 Total disbursements $14,656.67 </seg>

Not so. Extensions and betterments must be pro- vided for out of the proceeds of the sale of stock or other liabilities, and of course the rate-paying public must pay rates sufficient to pay fair profits'. Nor does the Commission look with favor upon the withholding of dividends from the stockholders and investing the same in more prop- erties. Many of the small stockholders do not understand that just in rortion as this is done they are entitled to a stock dividend. We are of the opinion fr6m a study of the stock transferred that many stockholders who have sold their stock would not have done so for the price they received had they known that later, in the year 1920, $10,662.96 would be paid out in cash for past dividends that had been invested In the properties. We do not charge wrong motives in this particular instance, but we do say that in principle it is wrong frcm an economic standpoint. There is a general feeling throughout the United States that public utilities securities are far below par and that in- </seg>

This applicant has said that no one wants its securities. Certainly not when only three dividends have been paid in cash in seventeen years. The Commission is therefore of the opinion and so finds that the applicant shall pay annually a dividend at the rate of seven per cent. The first of such dividends shall be paid as of this date, December 31, 1919. This can be taken care of at the time of its stock readjustment. It will be for the year 1919. This will result in a small deficit which will be taken care of out of the surplus which is provided for.

By request applicant the hearing upon the application for the Increase in the I rates is postponed to some future date, the application to remain file. Applicant owns and operates ten exchanges, seven of which are in Nebraska, viz.: Seottsbluff. Gering, Bayard, Melbeta, Minatare, Mitchell and Merrill. 'With the exchanges of Torrington, Lingle and Guernsey, Wyomiig. we are not concerned. At the present time free service is furnished between the following exchangee, to-wit; Morrill and Mitchell, </seg>

Minatare and Melbeta, and SCOttSblUff and Gering. It i5 proposed to continue the tree service be - tween Minatare and Melbeta and Scottsbluff and Gering. Between the other exchanges mentioned the proposal is to eliminate the free service and apply a rate of ten cents, this rate to be applicable where the mes - sage originates on one exchange and terminates on another without going through an intermediate exchange. Where the message goes through an intermediate exchange the regular toll rates now on file are to apply. Notices of this application were sent by the Commission to the chairman of the village board in each town affected and to all of the newspapers in that territory. Only one protest was received. A peti - tion, numerously signed, by citizens of Gering and vicinity was received, the burden of the protest being directed at the service now furnished by the applicant. In support of its application for the elimination of the free service applicant states that notwithstanding it miuntnins tnm two to six trunk lines between the various exchanges the traffic is so heavy that messages are seriously delayed and interfered with. While the service under the rules of the company is presumed to be extended only to sub - scribers of the company, the fact is that it is used indiscriminately by Subscribers and the general public. It is impossible for the company to properly police this service and prevent non-subscribers from making use of its lines. It is further contended— and the contention is borne out by the experience of the Commission — that the greater portion of the traffic consists of other than business or necessary calls. The re - sult is that the lines are held for lengthy visits between those making use of the lines, to the general detriment of the service. It is asserted that the application of a ten-cent message rate win eliminate very largely the trivial and unimportant traffic and permit those who have business or important messages to secure prompt service. It iS further Contended by the company that the constantly in - creasing costs of operation compel it to either adopt certain economies or apply for an increase of rates. It was felt that the elimination ot the free service would be a step in the direction of the economy de - sired. A statement of the operating revenues nnd expensos of tile com - pany for the month Of October, 1918, and a comparison with .he same month of the year previous confirms this contention. It Is the opinion of the Commission that the application of the Com - pany is reasonable. The Situation described with reference to the over - loading of the trunk lines is an invariable accompaniment of unlimited free service. It is impossible for a company to maintain prompt and efficient Service between exchanges where it is operated on a free basis. The company proposes to continue a free exchange of service between the towns of Gering and Scottsbluff and Melbeta and Min a tan. These </seg>

On February 9, 1919. however, the application was renewed. t Applicant does a large amount of toll business with the two com - es named. These companies quote through rates to points on ap - int's system, while on messages originating on applicant's system old rate filed with this Commission is assessed. This produces a •iminatory condition which should be corrected. The toll rate to from any point on applicant's system should be the same. The iplication should therefore be granted, to remain in effect so long as </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3758 In the Matter of the Application of the Lawrence Telephone Company for Au - thority to Increase Certain of Its Ex - change Rates. Appearances: For Applicant — Henry Gilsdorf, President OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR. Commissioner: Applicant operates a telephone system at Lawrence having 2G9 sub - scribers at the time the application was filed. In addition to these, there are 14 subscribers who own their own instrunipnts but who re ceive switching service and whose lines are maintained by the com - pany. It is desired by applicant to increase its present busings frcm $1.50 to $2.00 per month, residence rates from $l.oo to $].;."&gt; per month, and farm rates from $1.25 to $1.50 per month, the lattat nito to be subject to a discount of 25 cents per month in the event of pay - ment three months 1 in advance. The application was later amended so as to provide for a rate of $2.50 per month for business subscribers living in the town of Mt. Clare and connected with the Lawrence ex - change by a metallic circuit. This company was first organized in 1903. Mr. Gilsdorf. the present president of the company, has been connected with the organization since its Inception. He has acquired the stock of the company from time to time until he owns today $9,100 of, the $10,000 of capital stock </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 Itanding. All of the outstanding capital stock was paid for in cash. »st of reproduction value as of the year 1912 produced a figure of M)0. The depreciated value at that time was found to be $12,000. i contended by applicant that the present value of the property Is ewhat in excess of $12,000. During the life of the company, divi- Is have been paid amounting to an average of about 10 per cent ar for the entire period. In addition to that, interest in the amount bout $2,000 for the entire period has been paid on borrowed money. he present time, in addition to the outstanding stock of $10,000, the pany has borrowed $3,900. I While Mr. Gilsdorf has been active in the management of the com - ly since its organization, he has never drawn any salary. Were he be allowed a salary of $50 a month since 1904, this would have re - ■ed the amount available for dividends to an average of between four I five per cent. Mr. Gilsdorf now makes claim to a salary allowance $100 per month, and this amount is reported in the annual report of company to this Commission for 1918 although not actually charged &gt; the expenses for that year. $403.22 was actually paid out, however, 1918 for bookkeeping and clerical hire. In the opinion of the Com - mission, not to exceed $100 per month should be allowed for book - keeping and salary to Mr. Gilsdorf. An increase in the rates to the amount named is asked for on the ground that all the expenses of operation have materially increased in the last two or three years and it is- no longer possible to operate on the old basis. It is shown that the salary of the lineman has had to be increased from time to time, starting with $65 per month, until now it is $100 per month. The operators' salaries have also been increased. Following the practice of the Commission to make an allowance for both maintenance and depreciation, and accepting the valuation of 1912 as a basis, we find that ten per cent on this figure of $19,000 should be set asidf; annually for maintenance and depreciation. This is slightly in excess of the amount actually expended for that purpose in 1918. In our opinion, it should be sufficient to properly maintain the property even under the increase of labor and materials. Allowing this amount for maintenance and depreciation, and taking into account the increase in the operators' salaries, and allowing $1,200 for the salary of the manager and bookkeeper, the statement for the year ending December 31, 1918, would be as follows: HAKJN1INUB roll service * 427.20 Jubscribers 1 service 5,026.05 3witchine service 180.90 miscellaneous service 140.75 $5,774.9 EXPENSES Maintenance and depreciation: 10% on $19.000) $1,900.00 </seg>

Interest (6% on $3,900) 800.00 234.00 Deficit $ 408.95 While this shows an apparent deficit of $408.95, the deficit is not as large as would appear for the reason that the earnings from subscribers' service are reported by the company as the amount actually collected and not the amount actually earned. Should the latter figure be us?d. the earnings would be increased $367.95. However, allowance must be made for uncollectible accounts, so that a considerable defleM is shown for the year's operation. With the increased expenses likely to affect the 1919 operations', this deficit would be somewhat increased. We are of the opinion, however, that the increase asked for is not needed by the company at this time. About $1,200 additional revenue would be produced and, as we have shown, that amount would exceed the actual requirements of the company. We are of the opinion, however, that some increase is necessary. The company faces considerable recon - struction in order to keep its plant in condition, and we find that it has a number of farm lines that are overloaded and should be rebuilt 80 as to reduce the number of subscribers on the line. An increase of fifteen cents per subscriber per month would produce added revenue to the amount of $664.20. This revenue, in our opinion, will be amply sufficient to meet the needs of the company at this time. With reference to the application for a rate of $2.50 for business subscribers at Mt. Clare, the Commission is of the opinion that in view of the service rendered by a party line, even though metallic, such a rate is hardly reasonable and, in our opinion, should not exceed $2.00 per month. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings.

APPLICATION NO. 3766 In the Matter of the Application of the Shell Creek Mutual Telephone Company of Petersburg, Nebraska, for Authority to Increase Its Rates From $12 to $13 Per Year. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant is a stock company operating a switchboard at Peters - burg, Nebraska. It has 247 subscribers. It was organized in 1908 and has outstanding $9,480 of stock which was paid for in cash at a par value of $60 per share. For the past eight years the company has paid dividends of $5.00 per s'hare, which is slightly over eight per cent. The record is not clear as to what was paid prior to that time, although it gives the inference that no dividends were distributed. The company makes application to increase its rates,' from $12 to $13 per year. It received in revenue during 1918 $S4.65 from toll, $2,976 from subscribers rentals, and $46.10 from miscellaneous sources 1 , making a total of $3,106.75. The expenditure for maintenance for the year 1918 was $955.45. Inasmuch as the book value of the property is pproxi - mately $10,000, it is apparent that this sum is too small to properly maintain the plant so that it can give efficient service. In the opinion </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 251 of the Commission this amount should not be less than $1,200.00 a year. The expenses for 1919 have been larger than for 1918, when operators' salaries amounted to $827.90. This sum is a division of the salary paid to a lineman who received $1,500 a year and whose family does the operating work. It is contended by the company that this man has demanded a raise in salary and -that it will have to be paid him. It is very probable that the operating expens* for the year 1918 will reach $1,000, but for the purposes of this case we will use the figure of $900. Stationery, advertising and incidental expense, together with salaries, traveling expense, and taxes, make a total of $2,411.84. which repre - sents the total operating expense of the company. This leaves a net income of $694.91. If dividends at eight per cent on $9,480 are allowed, there will be a deficit of $63.49. The total increase asked for would amount to $247.00 per year. It is apparent the company has been operating on a very econom - ical basis and that its expenses are certain to be increased to keep pace with the increase in the cost of labor and materials. The *mall surplus, therefore, is none too large to protect the service as it s-hould be rendered. The rates as asked for will therefore be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Shell (reek Muu-ul Tele - phone Company of Petersburg, Nebraska, be, and the same hereby is authorized to increase its rates for exchange service from $12 to $13 per year. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall set up an al - lowance out of the earnings of the company equal to $100 per month, which sum shall be used for the purpose of maintenance and deprecia - tion and for no other purpose. Out of this amount shall be paid the salary of the lineman and the cost of all repairs ana replacements to the property, no part of which shall be used for constructing extsnsions, additions and betterments to the property. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any surplus remaining after the operating expenses and the above allowance for maintenance and de - preciation and dividends of eight per cent upon $9,480 have been paid shall be held subject to the further order of this Commission.

            <seg id="p252">252 &gt;the Matter of the Application of the allaway Telephone Company for Author - y to Increase Business Service Rates. FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: Applicant owns and operates a telephone system that furnishes service to approximately 234 of its own subscribers and approximately 400 switching subscribers. The regular subscribers are located wholly within the town of Callaway with one exception. The switching patrons tie outside of the town and are organized into farmers' companies. The system was of the grounded magneto type until recently but that part of it directly serving business subscribers is now being con- verted to a metallic basis. The present rates are as follows: Business $1.50 per month Residence, one and two-party 1.00 per month Switching 25 per month The village franchise under which applicant operates provided for business rate of $2.00 per month and a residence rate of $1.50 per Eh, provided full metallic service was given. It was shown that the less subscribers would be supplied with metallic service within t thirty days, and applicant requests approval of this rate when that is done. Applicant makes claim of a present value of the property of $12,000 and contends that all of it has been contributed by the owners of the property in cash contributions and donations of services. The plant was instituted Jn 1902. The present secretary and manager, Mr. Andrews, served in the capacity of secretary and manager from the latter date to the present time with the exception of two years and two and one-half months. He devoted about one-third of his time to the company's affairs as secretary, and practically all of his time when occupying the position of secretary and manager. He has received the sum of $2,523.50 for his services. The manager from August 21, 1902, to November 23, 1909, who was one of the owners, devoted all of his time to building and maintaining the plant. He received the sum of $483.34 for hia services. None of the other officers 1 of the company, including the president, the treasurer and three directors, received any compensation for their services. Values are claimed for these services as follows: Mr. Adams, as secretary and manager, $500 per annum for the first three years, and $900 per annum for the remaining twelve years; Mr. McConnell, as 1 manager. $500 per annum from the date of applicant's incorporation, June 13, 1909; treasurer, $25 per annum; three directors, each $15 per annum for eight years, two directors at $15 each per annum for one year, and one director at $15 per annum for one year; or a total of $16,430 less $3,006.84 received in cash. APPLICATION NO. 3775 </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 253 The Commission is unable to make a finding as to the value of these services owing to the absence of an inventory and valuation, but such finding is unnecessary for the purpose of the application. It is apparent that at least the greater part of the value claimed for the property belongs to the owners, and that the revenues to be rterived from the increased rates are insufficient to yield an abnormal return upon that value. The property is in need of considerable repairs, and it is quite probable that its reproduction new value is in the neighborhood of 115,000. Current expenditures for maintenance and the number of telephones in place appear to justify such valuation. A lineman is now being employed all of the time at $85 per month, and an allowance of $1,500 for maintenance and depreciation seems to be required. The Commission has found in a number of matters that the allowance for maintenance and depreciation should be ten per cent of the reproduc - tion new value of the property. It has also noted that the cost of similar plants is in the neighborhood of $60 per telephone; all of which indicates a reproduction new value in the amount stated. On the subject of operating expenses: Three operators are now em - ployed at a total expense of $100 per month, and the night operator receives in addition an extra charge of 25 cents for each night call made between the hours of 10:30 p. m. and 5:30 a. m. of the following day. Other expenses will be increased in the future by reason of the Commission's order prescribing a uniform system of bookkeeping for this class of companies, and it was shown that a bookkeeper would cost $50 per month. Mr. Andrews estimates the value of his services 1 at $100 per month, but this is considered excessive in view of the size of the plant and the annual revenues. Fifty dollars per month would seem to be a liberal allowance per month under the circumstances. Other items in the annual budget are basvd upon the company's experience in 1917. We estimate the cost of operation per annum as follows Maintenance and depreciation $1 500.00 Operating expenses: Return upon estimated value of $10,000 at 8%. 800.00 Total $5,412.65 Operators $1,200.00 Stationery and advertising 10.00 Light, heat, water and power 85.00 Rent 96.00 1,391.00 eneral expenses: Manager's salary $ 600.00 Bookkeeper's salary 600.00 Insurance 50.00 Taxes 271.65 Incidentals 200.00 1,721.65 </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT The revenues under the proposed rates are estimated as follows: Applicant asks validation of the b as hereinbefore described ; also delinquent dues aggregating $50 charge of 25 cents made for night a charge of 10 per cent per annum and over. The night call charge Iiars excessive, but inasmuch as it has been in effect throughout the re operation of the plant and the Commission is in receipt of no ction thereto, it is approved subject to complaint. The charge on lquent accounts is certainly reasonable from the standpoint of the lquent subscriber. It may, however, amount to a discrimination nst subscribers who meet their accounts promptly. However appli - proposes to apply for a revision of its rates generally in the near re and the charge will be allowed to stand. I We find, therefore, that the application should be granted as prayed but that jurisdiction of the matter should be retained for the pur - i of making an inventory and valuation of the property. ORDER I IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway nmission that the Callaway Telephone Company, of Callaway. Ne - ska, be and the same hereby is authorized and directed to charge, lect and receive a monthly rate of $2.00 for local telephone service nished to its regular subscribers beginning with the fir ; t day of the nth following the conversion of that part of its system directly serv - such subscribers to a metallic basis, due showing of such eomple - l to be made to the Commission prior to the going into effect of said e, and to charge, collect and receive 25 cents per call made between hours of 10:30 p. m. and 5:30 a. m. of the following day and interest the rate of 10 per cent per annum on delinquent accounts of $50 more. tIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that jurisdiction of this matter be re - ?d for the purpose of making an inventory and valuation of appli - 's property and such modification of its rates of charge as may be d necessary after a hearing on said valuation.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner Applicant operates an exchange at Wynot, Nebraska, consisting of twenty-eight business subscribers, forty-three residence subscribers and one hundred thirty farm line subscribers. It also switches for one hun - dred nine stations independently owned. Its 1 rates for many years have been $2.00 per month for the business subscribers, $1.50 per month for the residence subscribers. $1.00 per month for farm line subscribers and 40c per month per station for switching service. Its petition requests authority to publish and collect a rate of $2.50 for business service, $1.75 for residence service, $1.25 for farm line service, and 50c a month for switching service. Applicant company- appears always to have been independently owned. In 1914 the present owner purchased the property for $8,500 of which $3,000 is still carried as bills payable, or notes payable. It has 1 been extremely difficult to ascertain the actual financial conditions of the company for the reason that in keeping its accounts the com - pany has had hardly the first idea of proper methods to be followed. Its annual reports made to the Commission have been more mere esti - mates rather than actual facts. Hence it has taken many weeks of effort on the part of the Commission to ascertain whether the applicant really needed the relief it sought, an effort which ought not to have been imposed upon the Commission. It was the applicant's duty to present its case in a manner to be understood but this has not been done, largely, apparently, because of the inability of the officers of the company to do so. The Commission has undertaken the task reluctantly, but has done so in the interests of the general public and of the Wynot public in particular. It will not do to have a company operating at a loss and at the same time it is neces - sa"ry to see that such operation is used in handling this property as to render it more efficient. A careful check of the property by the engineering department of the Commission shows an original cost of $10,050.00 including the betterments which have been put on the property by the present owner. This does not include all the value of a substantial brick residence, a small portion of which is used for the telephone business and the re - mainder as the residence for the owner and his family. This property was originally worth $2,360 according to the engineer and in his total valuation he allows one-fourth of that total value for telephone pur - poses. </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 The present worth of the property, including the portion of the resi - dence building allocated to telephone business, is $6,071.51. Thus it will be seen that when the present owner purchased the property in 1914 he evidently paid as much as the property was worth. The owne»- in his application and supporting evidence figured the property as worth $20,000. which estimate indicates how erroneous are his conclusions on valuation. The public cannot be asked to pay a return on a rather commodious brick residence and on the barn in connection therewith, which is not used for telephone purposes. The Commission will, therefore, remove from the total valuation the residence and the barn and will allow the company to pay a rental to the owner for that portion of the residence used as office and switchboard quarters. In his application the owner desired to include the residence in his property account and also charge rent for the quarters used by the telephone company. This is. of course, very erroneous. This order will provide that the owner may pay in dividends not more than 8 per cent per annum on a value of $6,000, which figure gives a margin in favor of the owner over the figures of the engineering department. I The company's maximum earnings under the present rates including commissions are $3,950 per annum. This is not enough under the ent conditions to enable the owner to keep his property in repair to pay such reasonable wages as are necessary. The three inters of the owner operate the switchboard for $40 per month each, le this is a liberal figure it is not unreasonable under present con - ins in the light of the experience of other companies in the state, owner has been allowing himself $150 a month for keeping the is. acting as lineman to the extent that he is able to do so, and in g general manager. From this 1 salary he maintains a small touring It is evident from the showing made by the applicant that the amount of bookkeeping done is worth very little. It !s also quite prob - able that not all the cost of operating the automobile should be charged to the telephone company because with only one hundred thirty farm line subscribers, even though scattered as they appear to be, it will not require the steady use of an automobile. No deduction will, however, in this temporary order be made on this account. Applicant puts in his 1 taxes at $150. This has not been checked, but in the light of the experience of other companies it appears ab - normal and probably includes the federal taxes on toll messages. In estimating the expense the Commission will not allow so much for taxes. It will figure $25 a month for collecting and bookkeeping as not exces - sive and other figures somewhat more liberal than the average experi - ence of the company for the past year or so. It is not the duty of the Commission to say how much must be spent for each portion of the operation of any telephone company, but in figuring rates the Commis - sion can, and should, reach conclusions as to a reasonable expenditure </seg>
            <seg id="p257">257 on all these items and allow rates which will furnish a total revenue commensurate therewith. The Commission will, however, limit the rate of return and will require that a certain portion of total revenues be used exclusively for current maintenance and for replacements of exist- ing property. The normal figure used by the Commission at this time for current maintenance and depreciation reserve is 10 per cent of the original cost, but this telephone property falls in the class of those too small for such a percentage figure to be adequate and in arriving at reasonable ex - penditures in this case it is estimated that $1,350 per annum is required to pay for material for upkeep of lines, instruments and switchboard, for the labor of the lineman, or that portion of the manager's time de - voted to line work, extra labor for maintenance, batteries, freight, and express on materials 1 and sundries of like nature. The company will be required in this order to use that amount of money on its present plant, but none of this should be used for betterments such as additional cabling and extension of lines. Such expenditures must come from additional property investment and not from the rates paid by the public. Applicant indicated a desire to increase the cable capacity within the town, but that portion representing the difference between the cost of the cable which is taken out and the cost of the larger cable in - stalled is a capital charge and should represent additional investment either of the dividend allowance or actual additional money put in by the owner. The company owes $3,000 which was borrowed and put into the property. The proper investment of the owner is the difference be - tween this debt and the value of the property. During the temporary period of this order applicant will be required to pay the interest on the outstanding indebtedness out of the dividend allowance. The estimated expenditures of the company based on the discussion above and on the experience of the company is placed at $4,300 per annum. It may cost slightly more than this or it may cost less. Because of the uncertainty of the company's records the Commission will allow rates for a period of six months as follows: All bills due and payable for city service before the 10th of the month during which service is given. Farm line service due and payable during the first month of the quarter during which the service is rendered. Switching service payable by the switched company semi-annually in advance. The company asks for a rate of $1.25 for farm line service. Its lines are, however, very long, averaging only one and a half subscribers Business service $2.50 per month [Residence service 1.50 per month farm line service, where company owns the tele- phone instrument 1.50 per month Farm line service, where subscriber owns the tele- phone instrument 1.25 per month Switching service, per station 50 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT per mile of pole line. This scattered condition increases the main - tenance cost of farm line service and in the opinion of the Commission applicant's proposed rate is not a proper share of the burden. However, the engineer's inventory indicates that a large portion of the farm line subscribers own their own instruments. A difference is, therefore, made In the rate for those who own their own instruments and those who do not. but it will be presumed that the subscriber owning his own in - strument pays for his batteries and all repairs on the instrument. If such repairs are made by applicant company proper record of the labor and material cost should be kept and charged against the owner of the instrument ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway mission that, effective October 1st, 1919, due to an emergency exist - the Wynot Telephone Company be and it is hereby authorized to publish and collect the following schedule of rates: All bills due and payable for city service before the 10th of the month during which service is given. Farm line service due and payable during the first month of the quarter during which the service is rendered. Switching service payable by the switched company semi-annually in advance.

OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: This company Is owned by M. R. Dutcher. It consists of a well constructed metallic magneto plant at Pierce, serving 213 subscribers within the city of Pierce. It has no farm lines, but switches 412 farm - ers who own and maintain their lines. This plant was bought by Mr. Dutcher in 1911 for $11,000. Subsequent to that date, he put in $4,300 in improvements and betterments. No valuation of the plant has been made, but the books of applicant indicate that the plant owned is worth approximately $18,000. In 1917, Mr. Dutcher sold the plant for $15,000, but repurchased it in less than a year for $25,000. There had been no material increase in value of the plant or of the business, the premium of $10,000 appearing to measure the desire of Mr. Dutcher to get back into the telephone business in Pierce. He realizes that the price of $25,000 does not represent the value of the plant and carries the invest - ment on his books at a little more than $18,000. The Commission reaches the opinion from all the circumstances surrounding the case, as indicated by the record, that the price of $15,000, for which Mr. Dutcher sold the plant in 1917, probably fairly represents his real investment in the property. For the purposes of this case, that figure will be used as a basis for a return. Application is now made to increase the rates for exchange service and for switching service on the ground that expenses have so increased that the revenues are inadequate at the present time. The present and proposed rates are as follows: Business, desk $2.25 per month Business, wall 2.00 per month Party business 1.75 per month Residence, desk 1.65 per month Residence, wall 1.50 per month Party residence 1.25 per month Switching 25 per month PROPOSED RATES Business $2.50 per month Individual residence 1.75 per month Fwo-party residence 1.50 per month ""our-party residence 1.25 per month Desk sets 25 per month extra </seg>

Subsequent to the hearing a repre- sentative of the Commission visited Pierce and secured further actual figures from the books of the company. Instead of using the actual figures for maintenance, the Commission will apply its practice of the percentage allowance, based on the physical valuation of the property. In our opinion, at least $2,000 a year, or slightly over ten per cent on ihe physical value of the property, will be required to maintain this property and provide a proper reserve for depreciation. At the present time M. R. Dutcher, owner of the property, receives a salary of $150 a month as manager. In addition he lives in the house owned by the company and also receives $50 a month as night operator. This makes a total income to Mr. Dutcher of approximately $220 per month. Mrs. R. E. Dutcher, daughter-in-law of the owner, receives a salary of $75 per month as bookkeeper. R. E. Dutcher, son of the owner, receives a salary of $125 per month as lineman. Other members of the family have from time to time been on the salary list as operators. In the opinion of the Commission, the salary paid to Mr. Dutcher as manager is excessive. One hundred seventy dollars 1 per month for managing the exchange which owns but 213 subscribers sta- tions is above the average compensation for such service. It is stated on behalf of Mr. Dutcher that he did not receive a salary for a few years, but in the opinion of the Commission if he is to be properly com- pensated for his service and his investment, the better method is to establish a return for his investment rather than pay out excessive salaries. It seems also that the salary of $75 per month paid to the bookkeeper is larger than necessary in a plant of this size. It is urged on behalf of Mrs. Dutcher that she has a position open at $140 per month, and while that may represent in a fair measure the value of her services to other institutions, it cannot be used as a sole measure of what this telephone company should pay for such work. In the opinion of the Commission a salary of $100 per month covering the services of both manager and bookkeeper is ample and the expenses will be readjusted to such a basis. With the readjustment suggested. the operation revenue and expenses for the first eight months of 1919 are as follows: STATEMENT FOR EIGHT MONTHS— 1919 EARNINGS House rental $ 160.00 Subscribers' revenue 3,117.38 Toll revenue 688.87 Switching revenue 824.00 Miscellaneous revenue 137.50 $4,927.75 </seg>

Operating income (12 months). Taxes Deficit Dividends Total annual deficit. It will be seen that on this basis the company is operating at an annual deficit of over $1,200 per year. Applicant has had great diffi - culty In securing and retaining competent operators. It is contended that at least $75 per month will have to be paid to two of the operators if efficient help Is to be maintained. Five operators are required to furnish the service and the experience of the Commission with other companies Indicates that such a number is necessary- We are of the opinion, however, that under the present circumstances $50 per month per operator should provide money enough to secure the help necessary to operate the plant. This allowance will have to be adjusted between the various operators according to their experience and ability. The revenue that would be secured from the rates asked for by applicant would produce added income in the amount of $3,556.20. This is more than twice as much as 1 is reasonably required by the company. At the present time the adjustment between the business and residence subscribers is out of line with the customary practice, the residence rates being higher than they should be in relation to the business rates. In the opinion of the Commission, therefore, the residence rates should not be increased. The increase of the business rates, as asked for, would bring them to a point where the proper relationship would be established between these two classes of service. We are of the opinion that the business rates as applied for should be approved. Applicant asks for a switching rate of 80 cents per month. Such a rate is higher than is in effect on any exchange of like character, and in the opinion of the Commission is not justified by the showing presented by the com- </seg>

An allocation of the cost properly chargeable to switching re sultg In the following statement: Dividing this total cost of switching by the total number of sub- ftere served by the exchange, or 645, we have a cost per subscriber year of $6.85. This is slightly over fifty cents per month. Such a is commonly in effect over the state and has been approved by Commission in a number of cases. We find it to be reasonable in this case. Applying the business rate as asked for and a switching rate of I per month to the subscribers affected would produce an increase of )8.00 in revenue. Deducing from this amount the deficit as shown i the operating statement would leave a surplus of $;&lt;65.36 This is not excessive under the circumstances of this case. One hundred or more farmers who are served by applicant through t switched lines appeared at the hearing to protest against a switch - rate of 80c per month. They indicated a willingness to pay some ease ar.d conceded that higher operating costs justified a somewhat er rate. They vigorously protested, however, to paying the rate rf for. Complaints as to service were lodged by these farmers, jugh it was admitted by them that the condition of their own lines it be largely responsible for the poor service complained of. The i lines are in most instances separately owned and there is no or- ised method for their maintenance, each line being maintained by rmer selected for that purpore. It was suggested, and this sugges - received the approval of the presiding commissioner, that it prob - would result in a more satisfactory service if the farm lines d organize into one company and hire a competent lineman to te his full time to the maintenance work. In the opinion of the mission, proper service will not be secured until some arrangement ils kind is perfected. The Pierce Telephone Company makes every t to keep its own lines and its central office in good operating con - n. It also maintains an apparatus for testing farm lines by which r possible to locate much of the trouble on these lines.

All companies labored under similar handicaps and the service during this period was generally more inefficient than during normal times. The plant of applicant is in good condition and there is no reason why prompt and efficient service can - not be rendered. If in the future proper servlte is not maintained the Commission will be prcmpt to investigate and see that the condition is corrected. Applicant asks that a rate of ten cents be approved, to be charged non-subscribers who desire to communicate with farm line subscribers. Such a rate is in effect on many exchanges of the state and is an equitable charge in that the party using the service is required to pay for its cost. In the absence of such a rate, the cost of furnishing such service is borne by the rental subscribers. Applicant asks for a gross rate of twenty-five cents, in addition to the rates applied for. which twenty-five cents may be discounted for payment by the 10th of each month. This' practice Is becoming almost universal in the state and has had the approval of this Commission in a large number of cases. It stimulates prompt payment and reduces the cost of collection to the company. It will be approved as a reasonable provision in this case. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Pierce Telephone Company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to charge and collect the follow- ing schedule of rates for its exchange at Pierce: Where payment is made on or before the 10th of the month, a dis- count of twenty-five cents will be given from the above rates on busi ness and residence service. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall set up for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation the sum of $2,000 annually, which sum shall be used for the purpose of paying the salary of the lineman, the cost of current repairs and replacements and to provide a reserve for depreciation. This money shall not be used to defray the cost of new construction nor for any purpose except the one specified. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that after all operating expenses have been paid, including the $2,000 herein provided for, and dividends at eight per cent on $15,000, any surplus remaining shall be held in trust pending the further order of this Commission.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. HALL, Chairman. Attest: D. M. TAYLOR. Acting Secretary. APPLICATION NO. 3802 tthe Matter of the Application of the fauneta Telephone Company for Author - y to Issue $3,374.65 of Common Stock. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: This company is the result of a consolidation of twelve or fourteen farm lines that converged on a Jointly owned switchboard in the town of Wauneta. Consolidation was effected in 1913 and the Wauneta Tele - phone Company organized at that time. The consolidation was super - vised by this Commission and stock in the amount of $7,645 was author - ised. Of the stock thus approved, $6,312 has been issued and sold, leaving $1,332 in the treasury. Application is now made to issue addi - tional stock in the amount of $3,374. Applicant submits a detailed statement showing that $3,374.65 has been expended by the company since 1913 for additions and better - ments to the plant. While the records are not complete Mr. Person, president of the company, states that a careful effort was made to separate the expenditures as between maintenance and betterments. Tbe book value of the physical plant is $10,750. No dividends have been paid by the company since the incorpora - tion. The stockholders are entitled to $2,396 as a return on their in - vestment and stock to this amount should be issued to them in lieu of the cash. The company has never set aside any depreciation reserve because the revenues were not sufficient to permit of it and at the same time make the necessary additions to the plant. If to the $6,312 of stock now outstanding we add the $2,396 for deferred dividends, we have $8,708, which probably represents the stockholders' investment in the property. There would appear to be a surplus in the property, therefore, of approximately $2,000 over and above the actual invest - ment. As stated, there is now $1,332 of stock in the treasury of the company. Deducting this from the amount applied for leaves $2,042, which may properly be approved at this time. After the stockholders have received $2,396 for deferred dividends there will remain $978 unsold. The proceeds 1 from the sale of this stock should be used to replenish the depreciation reserve and for no other </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3803 In the Matter of the Application of the Wauneta Telephone Company for Author- ity to Increase Its Exchange Rates. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: In 1913 some twelve or fourteen farm companies owning telephone lines converging on a switchboard in the town of Wauneta formed a corporation to take over all the properties. Stock in the amount of $7,645 has been approved by this Commission, but only $6312 has been Issued. Under Application No. 3802, considered concurrently with the application herein, an additional issue of $2,042 is authorized, making the total authorized $9,687. Since the organization of the corporation the company has been rather indifferently managed and the service has been poor. The property has not been properly maintained and con - siderable rebuilding is now necessary. About a year ago the stock - holders concluded that a more efficient management of the property was necessary and Mr. J. A. Person was elected president with author - ity to take the required steps to put the plant in condition to render first-class service. After a year's experience Mr. Person has found the revenues to be insufficient and the company now comes to the Commis - sion for permission to increase the rates. The present rates are as follows : Residence and farm (subscriber owning phone) $ .75 per month Residence and farm (company owning phone) 1.00 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 Business (company owning phone) „ 1.50 per month Business (subscriber owning phone) 1.25 per month Switching service 25 per month The rates proposed by applicant are as follows 1 : Residence and farm (subscriber owning phone) $1.50 per month Residence and farm (company owning phone) 1.75 per month Business (company owning phone) 2.75 per month Business (subscriber owning phone) 2.50 per month Business extension 1.00 per month Residence extension 50 per month Two business firms using same telephone and both names listed in directory 1.00 per month New installation charge, to include removal (not refundable) 2.50 Moving charges — actual cost to company of labor and material. Change in directory listing 50 Switching service 60 per month A discount of 25c will be allowed from the above residence, farm and business rates when the bill is paid on or before the 10th of the month. At the date set for the hearing — March 11, 1919 — no one appeared Mr. Person, representing the company, had visited the Commission sev- eral times and has- submitted detailed data concerning the operating and financial condition of the company. In view of that fact he did not feel justified in putting the company to the expense of another trip. Notwithstanding ample notice of the hearing was' given, only one pro- test was received and this is based solely on an objection to paying an increased rate The company at the present time has 246 subscribers and switches 90 farmers who own their lines. A second exchange at the town of Enders is being opened. The figures hereafter given cover the revenue and expenses for both exchanges. After a careful study of the situation. Mr. Person submits an estimate of the expense that may be realized in the future. This is based on past experience and on increases in labor and material actually paid or promised. This estimate, somewhat modified by the Commission to correspond with expenditures by other companies, is as follows: EARNINGS Subscribers stations $2,805.00 Switching 270.00 Toll 94.42 $3,169.42 $3,169.42 EXPENSES Operation : Operators $1,820.00 Stationery and advertising 60.00 Light, heat, water and power 75.00 Messenger service ~ 7.35 Incidental 20.00 $1,982.35 $1,982.35 </seg>

If this item is large it is probably offset by the allowance made by the Commission for maintenance and depre - ciation, which for seme time to come promises to be insufficient for the needs of the company. The other items of expense appear to be reason - able if not below the normal. It is plain from this sho-Ain.&lt;; that the company must have more revenue. Without the payment of any dividends it will have a deficit of over $700. The rates proposed will produce approximately $2,000 additional revenue. In the opinion of the Commission this is not only more than is required at the present time, but the schedule proposed is somewhat inequitable. The rates f or busi - ness 1 asked for are rather high, as are the residence rates. The farm rates proposed, however, appear to be reasonable in view of t*ie un - usual length of lines, the average being one and one-halt miles per subscriber. The switching rate of sixty cents per month is high. While an allocation of the direct operating costs would appear to justify the rate, as 1 we have stated, these costs are somewhat high, and when the number of subscribers is increased as it will be with the improve - ment of the property and the service, the average cost will be some - what reduced. Under the conditions as they exist at this exchange, we are of the opinion that a rate of $6.00 per year, with a discount of $1.00 if paid a year in advance, will be reasonable. This is a standard rate and we believe will be equitable in this case. As will be noted by the rate schedule, the company has a number of subscribers who own their telephone instruments and who, by reason of that fact, are given a lower rate. This is an outgrowth of the con - ditions that existed when the (armers owned the lines. It is not a de - sirable situation from a service standpoint. The company should own the equipment over which it renders service to its own subscribers. In 1.487.89 1,542.00 Possible surplus $ 55.11 </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 the absence of such ownership it is helpless at times to keep the equipment In serviceable condition or to completely renew it when it wears out. As soon, therefore, as it can be accomplished the company should purchase the instruments involved and thereafter maintain them. This does not apply, of course, to the property owned by the inde- pendent farm lines. The rates suggested by us will produce added revenue to the i)unt of 11,542.00, based on the number of subscribers now in serv- This leaves a very small surplus. The rehabilitation of this plant tes the expense for the next two or three years somewhat uncertain, in our opinion the revenue produced by the rates as we fix them be sufficient. If any considerable surplus is accumulated it should held pending the further order of the Commission, and in no case aid it be expended for any purpose other than the improvement of property. Dividends on the stock authorized should be limited to eight per cent.

Appearances : For Applicant — W. C. May For Protestants— F. J. Byrd, C. L. Baskins, Attorneys OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant operates a telephone system with headquarters at Gothenburg, its principal exchange being at that point. It operates a small exchange at Willow Island, a neighboring town to the west, which is connected with the remainder of the system. In addition, it owns and operates toll lines between Cozad and Brady Island and owns a half interest in a toll line to Farnam. The plant is of the grounded magneto type. The property is owned by W. C. May and is not incorporated. It was purchased by Mr. May in 1905 for $5,000. At that time about one hundred subscribers were being served, practically all of them within the city of Gothenburg. The plant has since been extended until 742 subscribers were served in 1918, which number has increased to 775 at the pres«nt time. Being sole owner and thus relieved of the necessity of reporting to stockholders or others financially interested, Mr. May has never attempted to keep an accurate record of his invest - ment, but testified that he is sure he has put $30,000 into the property in addition to the original purchase price of $5,000. In the early days of the business, he also conducted a drug store and the funds of the two concerns were intermingled, thus adding to the difficulty of deter - mining the exact measure of his investment in the telephone property. At the close of the first hearing on this application, an adjourn - ment was taken to permit the Commission's engineer to make a valua - tion of the property. This was done with the result that an original cost of $45,269.16 and a present or depreciated cost of $27,862.14 were reported. By the use of the original cost method, which involved an analysis of the invoices and other records of applicant by the engineer, but little allowance is made in the final figures for the present high cost of material and labor, due to the fact that but a slight portion of the property has been put in place in recent years. According to the testimony of Mr. Couch, the engineer directly in charge of the valua - tion, a valuation made on the basis of reproduction of the property at the present time would result in a figure at least seventy-five per cent greater than the original cost as found. This would produce a value of approximately $78,000. In the judgment of the engineering department if cost units covering an average for the past five years were used, the valuation would be increased by approximately seventy per cent, result- </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT ing in a figure of $76,500. If a ten year average were to be used, the increase would be not less than thirty-five per cent, producing a value of $60,750. In this connection it is very important to bear in mind that the engineer in making his original cost study used actual cost figures as he found them without readjustment for any purpose. He readily ad - mitted on examination that Mr. May had been a very judicious buyer and that in a number of instances had secured bargains in the purchase of property, his testimony on this point being as follows: 'Here is another thing about this valuation. The business ability that Mr. May had to buy a good telephone at a little less price than his neighbors was really not to his benefit in this case because I have only allowed him what he actually paid and that element of bargain in there doesn't stand to his credit, and that is the way it is all through here. Wherever he was shrewd in buying something that was good at a less price I took that less price; for example, he has over three thousand iron poles and he bought them in a manner so that they didn't cost him much and I have allowed him only what he paid. Now, I might have gone and paid four or five times as much for an iron pole because I wouldn't know where to buy them, but I didn't allow him what I probably would have to pay. I allowed him only what he paid. Q. (By Mr. Baskins). In other words, you were attempting to get at the actual values he placed in this plant? A. This might have been said to have been his sacrifice and any wit and any exceptional ability which he might have displayed in acquiring this property at this price he isn't compensated for." tHad Mr. May in his purchase of equipment paid substantially more the equipment was worth or could be bought for on the market. Commission would have no hesitation in reducing the figure to normal basis. In other words, in seeking to establish the orig - cost of a property, an attempt is made to measure the cost of property by the normal prices prevailing at the time the property ut into place. It follows, therefore, that if the owner of a prop - is to be penalized for injudicious purchases, he should be re - led for the exercise of good Judgment. In this particular case, (stated, it would appear some consideration should be given to the t and Judgment used by Mr. May in the purchase of tht various ts of his 1 plant now in use. I As stated. Mr. May contends that he has invested out of his own is and services $35,000 in this property. This claim, however, is supported by any definite records. Mr. May relies on his recol - ion for the figure used. He is inclined to the opinion that the re is conservative. In the absence of positive supporting data, rever, the Commission is reluctant to accept the figure as a basis the investment, notwithstanding the absence of any other evi - ce to the contrary. It seems necessary, therefore, to rely on a sical valuation, modified to meet the conditions as outlined above, determining the present or depreciated value of the property on original cost basis, the engineer found a figure of $27,852.14. This </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 271 represents an average condition percentage of approximately 61.5 per cent. The evidence shows that the property has been well main - tained and is now in excellent operating condition. In reaching his present or depreciated value, the engineer has relied almost ex - clusively on the age of the various units in place. While this is al - ways a prime factor in determining the amount of depreciation in a property, it is subject to modification by the amount of repairs that may have been made. It is probable, therefore, that the exclusive use of the age basis for ascertaining the present value does an in - justice because of the excellent maintenance. The engineer found the property in a high state of operating efficiency and was careful to differentiate between the structural depreciation and the condi - tion of the property for service purposes. We are of the opinion, therefore, that a 61.5 per cent condition percentage is probably too low. Taking that fact into consideration in connection with an al - lowance that should be made to Mr. May for his judicious pur - chases, as heretofore referred to, we are of the further opinion that the present value of the property should be approximately seventy per cent of the original cost figure as shown by the engineer Thi3 produces a value of 131,688.30. Under all the circumstances of this case, therefore, we are con vinced that this figure represents the present fair value of this prop- erty and should be used as a basis for a rate of return. Affected by the present high cost of labor and material, Mr. May has applied to the Commission for increased rates. At the present time the rates in effect are as follows: At the last hearing, however, application so as to provide for permission was asked to amend the a rate of $1.50 per month for indi- vidual residence service and $1.25 for two party residence service. The operating statement for 1918 discloses a deficit of considerable proportions. In 1918 for the first time in the history of the company the owner set aside an allowance for depreciation in the sum of $2,628, which amounts to approximately six per cent on a valuation of $45,000. During the same year, however, $3,897.99 was expended for mainte - nance, making a total of $6,525.99, which is considerably more than was ever before expended or set aside for these purposes. This serves to distort the showing for the year and to make the deficit appear larger than it realty was. Following our customary practice of allowing ten per cent of the original cost of the property for the purpose of both Individual business $1.50 per montl Individual residence 1.00 per montl Farm line service 1.00 per montl It was proposed in the original application to increase thesi ates as follows: Individual business $2.00 per montl Individual residence 1.25 per montl Farm line service 1.25 per montl </seg>

There will be a substantial deficit, however, if the present rates are continued. If the rates proposed by applicant are allowed, the Increase in revenue should amount to about $3,600 per year. This is more than is required. Of the S62 residence subscribers, about 22 now take two-party service.

This will leave a net surplus on the showing made of less than $500. This is by no means excessive and we find the rates pro - posed with the exception thus noted to be reasonable and they will be approved. Some complaint was offered by subscribers as to the quality of s«rvice furnished, but in the opinion of the Commission these com - plaints were not substantiated. On the contrary, it is of the opinion that an excellent standard of service for a system of this type is being maintained. It is contended by protestants that if any increase la allowed, applicant should be required to convert his exchange Into a metallic system. On the showing made, however, it is obvious that the present system cannot be operated on the present rates. Should a metallic system be installed, a much higher level of rates would have to be charged than is proposed by this order. Reference was made by protestants to the metallic system at Lexington, the county s«at of the county in which Gothenburg is situated. It is well to bear in mind, however, that for the metallic service furnished at Lexington the Ne - braska Telephone Company has been authorized to charge rates as follows : Eventually, the Gothenburg plant should be converted into a metallic plant but it is a serious question whether such a change should be made at this time when construction costs are higher than they have ever been in the telephone business. The farm lines of this company are heavily loaded, there being an average of eighteen subscribers to the line. This is a larger number than is proper for good service, but it Is necessary to bear in mind that the farm lines are unusually long, the average being fourteen miles. This greatly exceeds the length in the average exchange in the central and eastern sections of the state. The company is covering a very large farm territory. The cost of in - creasing the number of circuits and reducing the number of subscribers would, therefore, be heavy under normal conditions, but it would be practically prohibitive under present costs of material and labor. The owner of the property should be looking forward, however, to the time when he can make such improvement, as the best farm line service cannot be rendered under present conditions. It is the practice at the present time to make a charge for batteries where more than one set is used within a year. In the opinion of the Commission, this charge should be discontinued when the new rates become effective. ndividual business |3.50 per month Pwo-party line business 3.00 per month ndividual residence 1.75 per month Pwo-party line residence 1.50 per month •'arm service 1.75 per month </seg>

            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 275 419 subscribers. At the time of the hearing this number had been in - creased to 433. It is interesting to note in this connection that in 1915 when the Commission had under consideration an application similar to this, the number was 458. The the sole ownership is vested in Mr. are as follows: business is not incorporated, but Bruce Brown. The present rates A discount of 25c per month is allowed to farm subscribers where payment is made six months in advance It is proposed by this application to increase the business rate to $2.00 per month and the farm line rate to $1.75 per month. At the time of the hearing Mr. Brown asked leave to amend his petition to provide for an increase of farm line rate to $2.00 per month, the dis - count of twenty-five cents to apply, making the net rate $1.75. Ae indicated above the Commission investigated the financial af - fairs of this system in 1915. At that time the business was owned by George L. Swancutt. The rates, as a result of that hearing, were in - creased twenty-five cents per month for residence and farm service. It is important. In connection with this case, to again refer to con - ditions which distinguish this plant from that of any other in the state. Wo refer to the topography of the country served. North of Brady is a strip of rough sandy country used only for grazing purposes. In order to reach a farming section beyond. It Is necessary to cros-s this sandy section with seven miles of line. In this s'even miles, there are but two subscribers. South of Brady it is necessary to cross five channels of the Platte river and go a mile beyond before reaching the settled territory, this territory being very limited in extent. Thence, the lines go into the hills and follow the canyon through some of the roughest country in the state of Nebraska. It is impossible to follow section lines and the circuitous routes not only greatly increase the length of line, but render maintenance work expensive and difficult. At Maxwell the country north is such that there is no telephone develop - ment whatever. It is all sand hilis, held in large tracts for grazing purposes. South of Maxwell, after crossing the various channels of the Platte river, there is a small strip of prosperous territory which is com - pletely served by the system and beyond which there is a hilly country similar to that south of Brady and in which there are a number of long lines. Several of the lines maintained by the company exceed twenty miles in length, one or two being as much as twenty-four miles long. According to the testimony of some of the farmers present at the hear - ing, it is impossible to reach portions of the line by team. This situation makes the furnishing of telephone service so expen - sive and difficult that the suggestion has been made several times to the farmers served that they purchase the lines and maintain them Business Residence i"arm line Switching service ....$1.50 per mont .... 1.50 per mont .... 1.50 per montl .... 6.00 per year </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 themselves. For this purpose, at the original hearing Mr. Swancutt asked to have established a switching rate in the hope that he might Induce the farmers to purchase some of the longer lines and furnish them switching service only. He was never able to persuade his farm subscribers however, to purchase the lines and at the hearing held on this application the suggestion made by the presiding commissioner that the lines be taken over by the farmers 1 was disregarded. It is ap - parent, therefore, that the furnishing of telephone service to the fanners ■erred by this system is a problem. It is probable that first class modern service could not be furnished except at a rate which would be higher than the patrons could afford to pay. It is equally apparent, ■however, that the owner of the property cannot be expected to continue furnishing any kind of telephone service at a loss. There can be but little question that the farm lines are in need of extensive repairs 1 . In fact, it is the opinion of the owner that they should be completely rebuilt within the next five years. The revenues of the company have never been sufficient to establish a depreciation reserve from which such reconstruction could be paid, notwithstanding dividends have never been paid on the actual investment in the property. I As stated in the opinion rendered in Application No. 2192, hereto - i referred to, it is impossible for the Commission to determine the ct amount of the sacrifice of the investors in this property. At that e we assumed that the capital obligations would aggregate approxl - tely $10,000. This was without any consideration being given to un - d dividends. When Mr. Brown purchased the plant of Mr. Swancutt 1916, he paid $18,000. This probably exceeds the stockholders' in - tments. A valuation made by the engineers of the Commission in nection with this application shows an original cost of the physical perty of $27,312.68 and a present or depreciated value of $16,034.14. ce Mr. Brown purchased the property, he has received no return on money he has had invested. In the absence, therefore, of any dif - ent or satisfactory evidence as to the actual sacrifice of the various ners in the property, it seems necessary to accept the present rsical value as found by the engineers. For that purpose $16,034.00 1 be used as a basis for determining dividends. tin his statement of operating expenses for the year 1918, the owner ws that he expended $2,223.03 for maintenance of the property. In ition to that he set up an arbitrary amount of $1,200 to cover de - ed depreciation, making a total for the combined properties of 23.03. In numerous other cases the Commission has recently made allowance of ten per cent on the original cost of the physical prop - r for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation. Owing to the ormal condition affecting this property, it is possible that such an &gt;wance may not be adequate, and it is possible that the total ex - ded and set aside by the owner, amounting to better than twelve cent, may be reasonably required. For the purpose of an operating </seg>
            <seg id="p277">277 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' statement, however, we will use the ten per cent figure. The operating revenues and expenses for the year 1918, as taken from the books of applicant, are as follows: $2,112.01 General : Salaries of officers $1,200.00 Salaries of clerks 607.00 Insurance 27.57 Other general 262.95 For the year 1918 Mr. Brown paid his four operators an average of $30.00 per month each. At the time of the hearing, however, he had in - creased these salaries to $35 per month and since the hearing has been compelled to again increase the salaries to $40 per month each. This amounts to an increase of practically $480 per year for operators' salaries. As shown, therefore, the operating deficit for that year amounts to $905.98. It is probable that a statement of the expenses for the first six months of 1919 would show other increases, which would increase the deficit. As stated, If the allowance for maintenance and depreciation were to be fixed at twelve per cent, the sum fixed for this purpose would be increased by $700 or $800 The Increase in rates, proposed by applicant, would produce in - creased gross revenue to the amount of $1,900. In the opinion of the Commission, this added revenue is required by applicant and the rates asked for should be approved. The rate of $1.75 per month for farm service is twenty-five cents per month higher than that charged by many other companies giving a similar class of service. In our opinion, ubscribers stations (419) $6,687.41 'oil 1,110.06 $7,797.47 EXPENSES &gt;perators $1,468.99 itationery and advertising 68.88 ,ight, heat, water and power 225.25 tent of buildings 116.95 * j *_t OO1 Ci A ncidental - 231.94 t .D4 Maintenance and depreciation (10% on $27,312) 12,731.20 $2,731.20 $6,940.73 *Jet operating income Dividends (8% on $16,034) ■% 856.74 1,282.72 Deficit ncrease of $10 per month to each of four operators $ 425.98 480.00 $ 425.98 480.00 1905.9 </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT Eever, this added rate of twenty-five cents is amply justified by the &gt;rmal conditions under which farm service is being rendered. If farmers affected feel that they can purchase the lines and maintain 1 for a less rate, they should avail themselves of the opportunity for it is the understanding of the Commission that Mr. Brown stands ready to sell the lines at a reasonable price at any time.

            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 279 It asks permission to increase this rate to $1.50 per month. The com - pany was organized in 1911 as the result of consolidation of some fifteen farm lines entering that town. At the time of the consolidation, stock in the amount of $7,950 was issued, this being $50 per share for each stockholder entering the company. The property of the farm lines was taken over by the new company and stock issued to the owners in the amount named. It was considered at the time of the consolidation that the property was worth considerably more than th-; $r,o per station as that represented only the actual cash outlay. In addition there was contributed a considerable amount of labor by the fanners when they built their lines. The plant is operated in a very economical manner. Aside from the secretary who receives $100 a year, there are no salaried officers, the only persons regularly employed being two operators 1 . During Ibl8 a lineman was hired for the entire year, but for the future it is pro - posed to have the work done by occasional labor, and it is not con - templated that a man will be employed for more than five or six months of the year. The affairs of the company are managed by a board of directors who meet two or three times a year. It is obvious that with no lineman regularly employed, the service is certain to be of inferior quality. The plan for repairs is to have a number of extra telephone instruments on hand which will be installed in place of instruments found to be out of order. The instruments' needing repair will be he'd until such time as some person can be found to repair them. Breaks in the line or interruption in the service for any cause will be looked after by such labor as can be temporarily employed for the purpose. In the past, the larmers themselves have done considerable repair work upon the lines. During the past two years' the maintenance ex - penditures have been much larger than formerly, amounting to over 20 per cent of the reproduction value of the property. On a basis of $50 per station, this value would be $11,750. On a basis of 10 per cent for maintenance and depreciation, which is the amount now regarded by the Commission as reasonable for the purpose, there should be set aside annually $1,175. Because of the unusual maintenance expense incurred in the last two years, the company was compelled to borrow $1,450 during 1918. Two hundred fifty dollars of this amount was borrowed to invest in Liberty bonds. The remaining $1,200 went to operating ex - penses and. as stated, was largely used for maintenance purposes. Mr. Miltonberger, secretary of the company, states that the lines are in good condition, in his opinion, and will not require extensive replacements in the near future. For that reason, he does not antici - pate as large expenditures during the next two or three years. A statement of the operating expenses of the company for the year 1918, adjusted as to maintenance and depreciation to the ten per cent basis above referred to. Is as follows: </seg>

This is an average of 3 8-10 per cent for the eight years. To it should be added, however, $350, an amount taken from the earnings to repur- chase seven shares of the stock of the company, which represents a net surplus. Adding this, the net earnings of the company have amounted in eight years to 4 4-10 per cent. If we compute the earnings on a basis of 8 per cent, there would be deferred dividends to the amount of $1,558.50. If this amount is added to the outstanding capital of the company as a part of the investment upon which the stockholders are entitled to return, the dividends at 8 per cent would amount to $760.68. This would reduce the net surplus for the year 1918 to $95.67. While the surplus is small, it would appear to be sufficient to protect the company if the present method of operation is to be continued. Mr Mlltonberger anticipates that the expenses for 1919 will be slightly less than for 1918. On this showing, therefore, there is no need for an in- crease in rates'. It should be stated, however, that in the opinion of the Commission, this company is not operating in a manner to give modern, up-to-date telephone service. It seems, however to be giving a service satisfactory to the people concerned. So long as that is true and the earnings are sufficient to meet the operating expenses and pay a return on the investment, there is no need for an increase of rates. Good telephone service cannot be furnished where a lineman is em- ployed only occasionally. Defects in the equipment and breaks in the lines are certain to occur, and unless the company is in position to give prompt attention to their repair, interruptions and impairment of the •ervice are equally certain to follow. As long, however, as the com- </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 281 pany prefers that method of doing business, and as long as the officers are willing to serve without compensation, the company can operate within its present revenues and an increase of rates is not necessary.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3825 In the Matter of the Application of the Arnold Telephone Company for Author - ity to Increase Rate*. Appearances : For Applicant — G. N. Nansel, President. For Callaway &amp; Arnold Telephone Co. — A. G. Schreyer. Secretary. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This application is made by the Arnold &amp; Tallin Telephone Com - pany, a rural organization, owning an undivided two-thirds interest in the Arnold Telephone Company, with properties entirely within the town of Arnold. The owners of the remaining one-third, viz.. the Callaway &amp; Arnold Telephone Company, did not Join in the application and object informally to that part of it which calls for an increase in switching charges. Hearing on this case was held at Arnold on October 10, 1919. Applicant company has approximately 175 subscribers within the town, the testimony being slightly contradictory in this respect. It has 13 residence subscribers and two business subscribers who own their own telephones, buy their own batteries, and pay for all repairs on the instruments. It has 110 residence subscribers and 37 business subscribers who do not own their own instruments. It is a strategic point for short line toll service and toll service in connection with the Kearney Telephone Company, its total revenues at the present time are slightly better than $3,600 per annum and it sets up expenditures considerably in excess of that amount. The company's expenditures are complicated by the fact that it has been extensively rebuilding its town exchange, has installed a new switchboard and some cable, and has not kept the new construction </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT separate from other maintenance expenses. It does, however, set up definite expenses at the present time approximately as 1 follows: with no figure furnished as to taxes. Although this company switches for 218 farm line subscribers ob - viouEly it is a rather small exchange to bear such heavy wages burdens. Testyuflflj- was that it was impossible to hire competent operators for less than $60 per month and the company had been forced to that basis. This testimony was not challenged by any subscriber present. The company pays a liberal salary to its lineman, who appears to be very competent for all classes of work required. Obviously it would be im - possible to retain this lineman at the wages which the company could pay if it did not hire put his services to the farm lines and secure revenue therefrom. Testimony showed that of the $140 paid to the lineman, approximately $40 is received from these outside lines for labor performed. They also pay for the livery hire when the lineman must leave town. The lineman furnishes his own vehicle in town, but this is not a large item. I Years ago when labor conditions were entirely different, the com - r made a charge of thirty cents per hour and vehicle hire for the ice of a lineman on the farm lines. This is entirely inadequate at present time and has the effect of burdening town subscribers for k on the farm lines. The company agreed to readjust this service •ge to not less than fifty cents per hour, which would approximate amount being paid by the company to its lineman. On such a basis, actual expense of the lineman to the applicant company will be it $80 per month. The company cannot hope to have proper atten - to its system for less money than that. {Because of the manner in which the records have been kept, it is ssary for the Commission to make an allowance for maintenance d on the experience of similar companies, and it will provide tem - rily that $1,400 per annum be set aside on a proper monthly basis, of which the wages of the lineman up to $80 per month shall be less his time on new construction, the cost of extra labor when [ed and not supplied by the manager himself, the cost of batteries other materials used in current maintenance, freight and express ges on maintenance materials and similar items shall be paid, with the surplus, if any. remaining to take care of replacements. The re - mainder of the lineman's wages shall be paid from outside earnings. The revenues of the company at the present time may be said toj be made up as follows: L&lt;lneman $140.00 per month rhree operators 160.00 per month Manager bookkeeper and collector combined 60.00 per month fuel 70.00 per annum Lights 40.00 per annum Insurance 15.00 per annum </seg>

If the switching service is increased to $5.00 per annum and an allowance of a slight increase in toll com- missions made, the total possible revenue from the present raehang will be $4,520. This allows nothing for the collection from nisht calls and only partly takes into account the slight discrepancy in the testi- mony as to the number of phones actually in service. Nor doos it allow for the growth of the system in the near future. It is apparent that Arnold is a growing town and revenues will constantly increase. From the testimony and from the Commission's experience wi:h other companies, the following estimates are made of expenditures: Maintenance and depreciation reserve $1,400.00 per annum Operators 1,920.00 per annum Fuel and light 110.00 per annum Blank books, postage and printing 60.00 per annum Insurance 15.00 per annum Incidentals 50.00 per annum Manager, bookkeeper, collector, etc., combined.... 720.00 per annum Directors 27.00 per annum Total $4,322.00 per annum This does not include the item of taxes which was not furnished. nor does it take into account return on the investment. The only valuable and concrete evidence as to the investment in this property was from Mr. Alf Schreyer, whose records appeared to be accurate and whose testimony was that $3,900 in cash had b^en put into the property by the various owners after the original plant had been sold to the country lines. How much property was acquired in the first small deal, no one appeared to know. The Commission has not had time to have a physical valuation made of the plant, but it is quite certain that the present value of the property exceeds the amount of the original investment considerably. The owners figure that they have $4,800 invested, but the testimony did not quite bear that out. Dividends have been paid the country line \ owners from time to time until an average of eight per cent without Interest on the deferred payments has actually been paid out. The in- vestments have partly been by assessment of country line owners and by the use of net toll earnings belonging to the owners of the toll lines. Applicant company owns no toll lines, but the country line owners have 'a network of toll lines which are revenue producers. This company is undoubtedly running far behind under present ex- penditures and relief must be furnished. No permanent solution of the </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3835 In the Matter of the Application of the Union Telephone Company of Wausa for Authority to Increase Switching Rates for Farm Lines and for the Addison Tele - phone Company.

For Addison Telephone Company — John Thompson, President. For Farmers Telephone Company, Wausa — C. A. Holmquist, Secre - tary. </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant herein operates three exchanges, namely, Wausa, Bloom - field and Crofton. At Wausa it has 200 subscribers of its own and ■witches approximately 350 farm patrons who own and maintain their lines. At Bloomfield it has 600 subscribers of its own with 20 switched patrons, and at Crofton it has 400 of its own subscribers and switches 122. Addison is a small inland town midway between Blocmfleld and Crofton. A mutual company operates an exchange at Addison with ap - proximately 100 subscribers. This exchange is connected at both the Crofton and Bloomfield exchanges of applicant, and hitherto has re - ceived switching service at these exchanges for a rate of $1.75 per year at each exchange. Applicant desires to increase its regular switch- Ing rate of 25 cents per month to 40 cents per month, and to increase the rate charged the subscribers of the Addison Telephone Company from $1.75 per year to $2.50 per year. A hearing on this application was held at Wausa at which most of the farm lines involved were represented. A showing as to the switching cost was presented by the applicant at that time, but the Commission called for a more detailed showing, which was later submitted as a part of the record in the case. Applicant has gone very carefully into a separation of the expenses Incident to the furnishing of switching service. Studies were made to determine the amount of time devoted by officers and operators to the ■witching service. While a more careful study might modify these figures to some extent, the Commission is of the opinion that they are approximately correct. In the tabulation submitted, we have eliminated two or three items. A charge is made at Wausa and Crofton for "collections." In view of the fact that switching rates are paid by the treasurer or secretary of the farm lines and no expenses of collection is involved, such expense should not be included in the switching charge. Substantial items' are also included for insurance of buildings at Wausa and Crofton. On each of these exchanges, however, office rent at the rate of $25 per month Is included in the tabulation. This rental should cover all costs of maintenance of the building, including insurance, and to approve a sep - arate allowance for insurance is to duplicate the item. The Comrais 1  - sion has substituted for the figures given by applicant for maintenance and depreciation an allowance of 10 per cent of the original cost of the central office equipment. This results in a lower figure than that sub - mitted by applicant. It is possible that the allowance of 10 per cent in this 1 case is not sufficient under present prices of labor and material and because it is based on the original cost of the equipment involved, but for the purposes of this application the figures will be used. With reference to certain items, applicant has made a deduction to cover toll expense. This is particularly true as to salaries of officers </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 287 and operators and stationery and printing expense. On other items we have made an additional deduction of 20 per cent to cover toll expense. At the request of the Commission, applicant separated its exp?n3e for the three exchanges. Wausa, being the headquarters of the com pany, shows a somewhat larger expense than does either of the other exchanges. The statement for Wausa, however, is submitted as typical of the method of apportioning the expense, and is as follow Total Less Toll Assigned Expense Officers' salaries $1,562.80 $1,562.80 $3,530.26 Total number of subscribers. 524 Switching expense per subscriber per year $6.73 Switching expense per subscriber per month M On the same basis of apportionment, the switching expense at Bloomfield amounts to 41 cents per month per subscriber and at Crofton to 42 cents per month per subscriber. It is 1 important to bear in mind that the figures given are for the year 1917. Since that time, all of the expenses incident to switching have materially increased, this being particularly true with reference to the wages of operators. In the above calculation it should be noted also that nothing is charged tut taxes. It is apparent, therefore, that the rate of 25 cents per mon'h is entirely inadequate, and that the rate of 40 cents- as asked for is by no means unreasonable under present circumstances. It will, there - fore, be approved. With reference to the rate of $2.50 per subscriber per year to be applied to the subscribers of the Addison Telephone Company, no spe ciflc figures are given. In view of the fact, however, that the subscrib - ers of the Addison company have access to between 1,200 and 1 300 sub - scribers at Bloomfield and Crofton, and in view of the showing made as to the cost of switching at the three exchanges involved, it is quite clear that the rate of approximately 20 cents per month per subscriber is not unreasonable. In this connection it should be said that appli - cant owns' and maintains sixteen miles of circuit that is used exclusively by the Addison company. The rate of $2.50 per year will, therefore, be approved.

OPINION AND FINDING WILSON, Commissioner: The application concerns a branch line 72 miles in length and serv - ing ten stations, including the terminal. The present service consists of one freight train and one passenger train each way daily except Sunday, the freight train leaving Lincoln in the morning and the passenger train in the evening. Returning to Lincoln, the freight train leaves Columbus at 12:15 p. m. and the passenger train at 7:20 a. m. Applicant requests permission to reduce the freight train service to a triweekly basis. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION* 289 Practically all of the communities affected protested the reduction. Of the eight stations intermediate between Lincoln and Columbus, only two have any other railway service — Seward and David City. Applicant showed that the locomotives used in the freight service had a capacity of about ten loaded cars from Lincoln to Garland and about twenty-live from Garland to Columbus. The maximum grade from Lincoln to Garland — 18 miles — is 1 1-4 per cent and from Garland to Columbus 8-10 of 1 per cent. The average train tonnage westbound from Lincoln to Columbus during December, 1918, January, 1919, and the first twelve days of February, 1919, respectively, were as follows: Applicant admitted having occasionally doubled up locomotive power in making the Garland grades with present tonnage, but claimed that it could send surplus tonnage by the low grade line between Lin - coln and Seward via Milford without affecting the service. Applicant also showed that the proposed reduction did not af'-ri the movement of merchandise in L. C. L. lots inasmuch as such ship - ments now move on a sailing day basis of three days in the wrek. The saving in expense to applicant was estimated at $1000 a month, consisting of employees' wages, fuel and maintenance of equipment. Protestants showed that the present freight service was very much slower than it used to be two and three years ago, that it requires a week for many shipments from Lincoln to reach destination on this branch, that the sailing day plan is very unsatisfactory, that the trains in question run behind their scheduled times frequently, that the re - duced service would greatly embarrass the marketing of live stock !&gt;y confining it practically to two days a week, and that a brick manufac - turing plant and other industries located in Columbus were dependent for success on the daily movement of clay and sand from banks adja - cent to the road about seven miles south of Columbus. It was also shown that the present service does 1 not permit any switching to be done at stations by the westbound train on merchandise sailing days, and that if the service were confined to those days (as contemplated by the application), all of the switching would have to be done by the eastbound train to the serious inconvenience of shippers. The freight train also carries considerable passengers between some stations, the average per train in and out of David City during January, 1919, being ten passengers. The Commission on its* own motion included in the record appli - cant's station reports as to the business done on the line in question during the year 1918.

The revenue due from this traffic amounted to $183,147.75, or an average of over $30,000 per month. I Applicant admits that the falling off in tonnage is due to the par - failure of crops in the vicinity of the line, and that the service will ■ to be restored by July 1 next when the new crop begins to move. We are of the opinion, upon the whole record, that the showing does not Justify any reduction in the present service. There is no evi - dence that the revenues derived from the service are not compensatory and no attempt was made to justify the discrimination that would result against the shippers located on this line and in favor o; competitor.. located on applicant's main line and on the lines of other railroads. The shippers affected are against the reduction to a man and public demands as to service are important, especially where the rates paid are fairly remunerative. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the United States Railroad Admin - istration in charge of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Com - pany for permission to reduce the freight train service on the Lincoln- Columbus branch of said railroad be and the same hereby is denied.

            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 The company formerly operated a toll line to Pleasanton from which it received net earnings of $175 to $200 per year. Some two years ago this toll line was discontinued, since which time the com- pany has been without this revenue. In addition to this, applicant has experienced the same increased costs that apply to other companies operating in the state. As a part of this increase the switching rate charged by the Kearney Telephone Company has been increased, with the approval of the Commission, from twenty-five cents per month per subscriber to fifty cents per month per subscriber. The salary of a lineman was formerly $60 per month, but that has been increased to $70 per month during the past year. The company has outstanding $3,220 worth of capital stock, upon which it has paid dividends during the ten years of the company's existence an average of six and three- fourths per cent annually. It has paid no dividends during 1917 and 1918. The earnings and expenses for 1918 were as follows EARNINGS Subscribers' service $2,044.50 EXPENSES Maintenance $1,094.61 Operation : Switching service at Kearney, $6 per subscriber $1,002.00 Printing, postage, etc 34.89 1,036.89 General: Secretary's salary 50.00 Taxes 38.20 88.20 2.219.70 Operating deficit $ 175.20 Dividends (8% on $3,220) 257.60 Total deficit _ _ $ 432.80 It will be seen from this statement that the company is operating at a deficit without the payment of any dividends, or without allowance for uncollectible accounts. It should be noted, moreover, that the state- ment as shown does not include the increased salary to the lineman The maintenance expenditure for 1918 was $1,094.61. It is altogether probable that for 1918, if the lines are properly maintained, the ex- penditure will reach $1,200. The company will be required in the near future to Install the Commission's accounting system, which will doubt- less add somewhat to the expense as but $50 is now allowed the secre- tary for all of the work i erformed by him.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3910 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company for Authority to Continue In - definitely Operation of the "Skip-Stop" System. Appearances: For Applicant— John L. Webster, Attorney; R. A. Leussler, Assistant General Manager. FINDINGS AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: On October 8, 1918. the Commission granted applicant's request to inaugurate what is known as the "skip-stop" system in the operation of its street cars. Formerly the cars were required to stop at all street intersections when necessary to take on or discharge passengers. Under the skip-stop system the cars pass by, or "skip," every alternate intersection in the rasidential districts of a city, with certain excep - tions limited to transfer points, railroad and boulevard crossings, churches, halls and other places of public assemblage. Applicant's re - quest was endorsed by the United States Fuel Administration as a war measure to conserve fuel, and was concurred in by the city authorities of Omaha. The Commission treated it as an emergency matter and made the order without a hearing. The time of the order was limited, however, to six months, as the Commission felt that so great a change in the service should not be permanently made without affording the public an opportunity to be heard. On April 3, 1919, before the expiration of the order, applicant filed its petition to continue the system indefinitely, alleging greater public convenience, as well as a pronounced economy of operation "over the old method. No protests were filed, but the matter was set down for hearing In the court house In Omaha and due notice of the same given to the city authorities and also to the public through the press. The testimony was surprisingly strong in favor of the new system. There wag considerable criticism when it was first inaugurated, but very little developed at the hearing. City Commissioner Butler spoke informally against the method, but one of his colleagues. Commissioner Zimn:an, favored it, and the Commission as a body remained silent. Several representatives of the traveling public who chanced to be </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT P testified in favor of the system, and all of the witnesses. In number, gave as their opinion that the public was largely d with the rule. The opposition came mottly frcm people contiguous to the carlines, "on the line" in common parlance, e denied the privilege of waiting at home for the Hff to appear it before going to the stopping place. Walking an additional )&gt;• people located off the line, appear:, to be of li tie concern to The car men were unanimously in favor of it. The public advantages appear to be quicker transit, amounting to about ten per cent; greater regularity of service; a move comfortable movement of the cars, due to less hurry in starting and stopping when heah.d time; less danger to passengers in getting on and off, and lass tu pedestrians and vehicles upon the streets; and less blocking of otiier traffic upon the streets, particularly of automobiles going in the same direction with the car. The greater distance between stops enables automobilists tc pass the car before it gets to the next stop. The yystem results in the elimination of about one-third of the stops. The number of stops under the old system was 1,856 and it will be 1,246 under the new plan, as modified by the six months ex iknce. The company's superintendent of transportation studied the Meat ion of the system closely during the six months' period with a «v to adjusting traffic conditions as much as possible, with the ult that changes in some of the stops and the addition of others, par - ilarly in the edges of the business district, are now recommended, irts were filed with the Commission showing all street intersections which stops are now proposed to be made, and they appear to ac - nmodate the traffic very well. I Considerable testimony was received as to the economical results the system. The saving in coal and direct operating costs alone junted to $59,059.19 per annum, based upon the six-months' period — rly four per cent of the total annual expenses including maintenance i depreciation. The saving in repairs and replacements to the road - f and power plant, not included in this figure, would materially in - ase the saving. Actually more power is consumed in starting the s and bringing them up to normal speed than in moving them after y ati^n that speed. Reliable tens show that the power required by ar on a level grade in the first instance will keep the car going on li a grade twelve hundred feet at normal spaed. The extra power id on up-grades is considerably offset by the reduction on down - iles, and with actual stops under the new system averaging only tut nine hundred feet apart, the importance of the rule is apparent. is also recognized that the wear and tear upon the roadway is great - in stopping and starting the cars. The plan commends itself therefore as a conservation measure of first importance in these days of advancing rates. It also appears to be in the direction of progress. Slow and uncomfortable travel is a </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 nuisance in these days, and the people are willing to forego MM con - venience if necessary to the abatement of the greater evil. Other cities adopted the skip-stop plan even prior to the war, notably Cleveland where the city practically operates the street railways, and additional ones In which the system was inaugurated as a war measure, are con - tinuing it. And when one thinks of the popularity of the elevated and subway lines 1 in the larger cities, with stations three to eight blocks apart, it seems strange that longer stops did not appear earlier among surface lines. The Commission is therefore of the opinion and so finds that ap - plicant's petition .hould be granted, subject to the specifications as to the location of car stops contained in Exhibit 10 of the record herein, and to the requirement that all stopping points be marked by appro - priate signs. ORDER IT IS ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company be and it hereby is authorized to continue in effect the skip-stop plan of operating care upon its lines located in Nebraska, according to the specifications set forth in Exhibit 10 of the record herein, subject to change by the Com - mission at any time as provided by law. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the said company shall place and maintain .-. sign at each and every of the street intersections- in the districts of the city of Omaha in which the system is applied, contain - ing the words "Cars stop here," or their equivalent.

            <seg id="p296">296 divide the accounts into three groups, according to sub-exchanges, with discount periods ending on the tenth, fourteenth and eighteenth days of the month, respectively. There are approximately 24,000 subscribers' accounts on the books of the Omaha exchange. The number of subscribers connected with sub-exchanges are as follows: Kit Is proposed to group the subscribers for the purpose of applying discount as follows: Group 1 — Harney and Colfax, numbering 8,700 subscribers. Group 2 — Walnut-Benson and Webster, numbering 9.100 subscribers Group 3— Douglas and Tyler, numbering 6,200 subscribers. It was shown that from twenty-five to thirty-six per cent of the month's payments are made on the tenth of the month, resulting in serious inconvenience to both company and public. A three-group sys - tem of discounts in Minneapolis results in no more than twelve per cent of the month's business being done on any one day. iThe Commission finds, therefore, that the application is reasonable should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Nebraska Telephone Company be and the same is hereby authorized and directed to group its subscriber accounts at the Omaha exchange for the purpose of applying the discount permitted by the rates of exchange on file with the Commission as follows: Group 1 shall consist of the accounts of the subscribers connected with the Harney and Colfax sub-exchanges.

OPINION AND FINDING WILSON, Commissioner: Applicant owns a telephone exchange building, central office equip - ment, and a line of poles upon the main streets in Avoca. It owns no distributing lines or substations, and performs a switching service for both town and rural telephone users, of which there are 72 in town and 186 in the country. The distributing lines and substations belong to the users who also maintain them. The average cost of these facilities is estimated at $25 per user in town and $49 in the country. The country lines are owned by corpora - tions or partnerships, one to each line, and because some lines are longer than others, the cost of maintenance per subscriber varies, giv - ing rise to some complaint. The present rates are 50 cents a month to town users and 25 cents a month to country users. The increase asked for originally was 10 cents a month in town and 15 cents a month in the country. This was amended at the time of the hearing to 25 cents in town and 25 cents in the country. The revenues of the company in 1918 amounted to $1,353.57 and the actual expenses to $1,336.75, the net operating income being $16.82. Ex - penses have since increased $380 on account of operators' wages, and it is maintained that a bookkeeper must be employed at an estimated salary of $300 per year. This will result in a deficit of more than $600 without any allowance for probable increases in the costs of other labor and of material. The proposed rates will yield an annual revenue of $1,764 which will be augmented by the net receipts from toll estimated at $264, or a total of $2,024. This about equals the estimated expenses and will not provide any reserve for unrealized depreciation nor for a return. A return is not asked for as the company is owned by the country users. The cost of the company's property was estimated at $1,150, and the Commission's engineer valued it at $1,559.22, exclusive of about twenty telephone poles which were not shown separately. The facilities in town are largely metallic. Those in the country are grounded. The service is of the party character altogether, even in town. The company is now negotiating for the purchase of all of the users' lines and equipment with the idea of merging the property into a single telephone ownership, and thus* more nearly equalize the costs of the service. The service is now quite poor, due to failure on the part of many individuals and companies to maintain their lines properly.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION T. L. HALL, Chairman Attest: T. A BROWNE, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3936 (the Matter of the Application of the rownover Telephone Company for Au - lonty to Increase Its Exchange and Toll Rates. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: I This application covers the request of the Crownover Telephone pany to be permitted to increase its toll rates twenty-five per cent its exchange rates in amounts' hereafter to be set forth. After ; its application, it asked leave to amend to increase its switching i from 40 cents per month to 50 cents per month and to assess a ge of 25 cents per month to non-subscribers who us« the system reen the hours of 10:00 p. m. and 6:00 a. m. Notice of the pending ication was served on the mayor of Sargent, the postmaster, the Kly newspaper, and a number of citizens. They were advised that 88 the Commission received protest within ten days from the mail - of the notice that the application would be considered on the rds in the possession of the Commission. No such protests were ived and no hearing was held. The affairs of this company have been before the Commission a number of times. In Application No. 2153, filed In 1915, the company </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 asked authority to increase its exchange rates. The application at that time was denied because of the healthy condition of the company's finances, due largely to its toll revenue. The company was ordered to separate its toll and exchange property expenses and to improve its service. The company has complied with all of the requirements set out in that order and has shown a very commandable spirit in respond - ing to all suggestions made by the Commission with reierence to the management of its business. In Application No. 28G0, the switching rates of the company were increased from 25 cents per month to 40 cents per month, or $4.00 per year if paid annually in advance. In Ap - plication No. 3208, the capital stock of the company was increased by an additional issue of $1,009.08. Another application. No. 3718, is now pending before the Commission ior a stock allowance to cover uncom - pensated service performed by J. E. Grint, president of the company. In the investigation made under Application No. 2153, a valuation of the property was made by the Commission which showed that the reproduction new value of the property was $2. r &gt;.832.98, and the present, or depreciated value $20,531.12. Pursuant to the order of the Commis - sion made in that case, these values were divided as between exchange and toll property on the basis of $20,812.97 for exchange, and $5,020.11 for toll. Readjustments in the exchange value, made by reason of addi - tions and betterments to the property and sale of property, resulted, according to showing of applicant made in this case, in a reproduction value for the exchange property of $21,826.74. Applicant includes an item of $1,573.52, however, for "replacements and betterments." To whatever extent this sum of $1,573.52 represents replacements, it should not be added to the value. It would be a proper charge to maintenance and depreciation reserve. The company should make a study of this figure to determine as nearly as may be the amount that should be charged to replacements and readjust its books accordingly. This, of course, is important in this particular case only in determining the allowance for maintenance and depreciation. Under our order in Application No. 2153, we provided that nine per cent of the reproduction cost should be set aside for both maintenance and depreciation, this being one per cent higher than the allowance made at that time by the Commission for the reason that the company has many long farm lines, the cost of maintenance being for that reason above the normal. In the order referred to, the present, or depreciated value of the property was accepted as a basis for a rate of return and as a fair representation of the actual investment in the property. This- figure, less the value of the toll property, has been used as a basis for this purpose since that time and has been modified only by the additions and betterments to the property. The figure at the present tims is $16,660.63. This will be increased to some extent by the capitalization of certain additions and betterments and by any allowance the Com- </seg>

Subsequent to the order issued In Application No. 2153, the com - pany, upon the suggestion of the Commission, installed a system of accounting, by which it has been able to comply with all the Com - mission's requirements, and from which it is able to submit a very ac - curate statement of its operating expenses for 1918. The earnings and expenses for that year are as follows: Incidentals (general) 35.80 Taxes accrued 177.98 Interest accrued 44.60 2,385.68 Total operating expense. $5,914.73 Net operating income. 118.51 Dividends (7% on $16,660.63). 1.166.24 Deficit $1,047.73 P above, the allowance for depreciation, as previously ap- Commission, was nine per cent upon the reproduction le property. With the advent of greatly increased prices 1 labor, the Commission has found it necessary to make i the allowance for these purposes. With companies r average conditions, an allowance of ten per cent has be reasonable, although this amount is subject to re - meet changing conditions. As previously determined by in, however, the company under consideration operates Rentals $4,910.60 Switching 757.25 Miscellaneous 365.39 $6,033.24 EXPENSES Maintenance and depreciation (9% on physical value) $1,828.36 $1,828.36 Exchange operators 1,080.50 Stationery 161.15 Light and heat 239.52 ilent 72.00 Incidentals (operation) 147.52 1,700.69 Salaries of officers 1,668.20 3alary of clerk 350.00 Legal expenses 2.50 Insurance 87.60 Discounts 19.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 under rather abnormal conditions and in our opinion the allowance should continue to be at least one per cent above the normal, making for this company during the present high level of prices eleven per cent. This would increase the allowance for these purposes $572.58. The company estimates that the salaries of operators will increase during 1919 to at least $1,500; legal expense? $47.50; traveling expenses $150, and taxes $175.22. The increase in dividends, due to additions in capital investment of $1,473.40, will amount to $103.18. The Commission questions the allowance of $150 for traveling expenses and doubts whether the tax item will be double, as is indicated by the estimate. If we eliminate these two items, however, we have a total increase in expenses for 1919 of approximately $1,100, which added to the deficit of 1918 of $1,047.73 would produce a deficit for 1919 of approximately $2,180.00. The present and proposed rates are as follows: PROPOSED RATES Individual business wall phones $2.75 per month Individual business desk phones 3.00 per month Individual residence wall phones 1.75 per month Individual residence desk phones 2.00 per month Two-party residence wall phones 1.50 per month Individual farm 2.25 per month Multi-party farm 1.75 per month Switching 50 per month Non-subscribers using system between 10:00 p. m and 6:00 a. m 25 per month PRESENT RATES Individual business wall $1.75 per month Individual business desk 2.00 per month Individual residence wall 1.50 per month Individual residence desk 1.75 per month Two-party residence wall 1.25 per month Business extension sets 1.25 per month Business extension bells 50 per month Residence extension bells 50 per montn Individual farm phones (not to exceed two mile? from city limits) 1.75 per month Multi-party farm phones 1.25 per month Both the present and proposed rates are subject to a discount of 25 cents per month on business, residence and farm telephones where payment is made by the 10th of the month. The revenue from the rates as proposed will be increased to the extent of $2,500.00 per year. There would thus be a surplus over the 1919 operation of approximately $300. Inasmuch as eleven months of the year 1919 will have passed before the new rates can be made effective, the deficits for 1918 and 1919 will be actually experienced by the company before relief can be applied. The company makes a complete separation on its books of its toll property and its toll revenue and expense, the method of separating the expenses being exactly the same as for the exchange. Under this show- </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT ing, the total expense for 1918 of toll operation, including dividends at seven per cent, was $2,129.49. The gross income from tolls was $2,914.34. This left a net surplus for 1918 of $784.85. The same in - crease in expenses, including the increased allowance for maintenance and depreciation, as 1 affects exchange operation will likewise affect the toll business. But in this department, the revenues are sufficient to leave a substantial surplus even after the increased expenses are taken Into account. For instance, the total toll revenue estimated for 1919 without any increase is $2,914.34. Allowing for the increase in expenses and in the allowance for maintenance and depreciation, the total ex - pense would be $2,430.71, leaving a net surplus, after paying dividends of sev*n per cent, of $428.59. If the rates were increased, a full twenty - five per cent additional revenue in the amount of approximately $700 would be realized, which would Increase the net surplus to between $1,100 and $1,200. There appears to be no need for such an increase of revenue, the net surplus for 1919 being amply sufficient to take care of any unforeseen expenses not already accounted for. For that reason the proposed advance in the toll rates will not be approved. t Adding the surplus of $428.00, derived from toll, to the surplus of oximately $300 to be realized from the new exchange rates, the pany will have a total net surplus of about $800. This should be cient to protect the company against any unforeseen conditions, a it any expenses not already provided for may be paid, and the in - sed dividends as suggested may be met from the margin thus Applicant asks that an allowance of eight per cent for dividends be granted Instead of the seven per cent approved by the Commission in previous cases. Claim for this is based on the fact that interest rates at Sargent and tributary territory are eight per cent or greater. The Commission has held that in determining the rate of return to a utility the prevailing rates of interest in the community in which the utility is located should be taken into consideration. This Commission would not increase rates solely for the purpose of increasing dividends during this period of high prices. However, this company is constantly having to dispose of its stock and its inability to pay all of its dividends during the past year will somewhat handicap it in properly financing ltaelf. We are of the opinion that it should be permitted, for a time at least to pay eight per cent on its outstanding capital. In the light of all the circumstances, the rates as asked for for ex - change service are not excessive and will be approved, subject, how - ever, to a showing by the company on or before July 1, 1920, as to their reasonableness. If at that time the revenues* produced are greater than are necessary for the needs of the company, some reduction can be made. If, in the meantime, prices of material and labor decrease, that tact can be taken Into consideration at the time of the showing. </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: An order increasing the exchange rates of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company was entered by this Commission on October 1. 1918, effective November 1, 1918. This order, by its terms, expired on May 1, 1919. Prior to that date, however, application for its continu - ance was made by the company and, after hearing and investigation of the financial condition of the company, an order was issued continuing the rates until December 31. 1919, such rates being subject to all the conditions of the original order. At the time of the last hearing in April, the company anticipated that the rates prescribed in the order and in effect at that time would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the future. The Commission was .also of the opinion that conditions would change so as to produce a lower price level for labor and materials and that the rates prescribed could be reduced at the expiration of the limit fixed in the order. These anticipations have not been realized, however. Applicant has ex - perienced serious difficulty in securing men sufficient to keep up its plant and maintain its service. While it raised its wages very material - ly in November, 1918, the amount for the system approximating $160,000 for the year, the increase was not as great as that made by the Ne - braska Telephone Company to its employes. This has resulted in the employes of applicant company going to the Nebraska Telephone Com - pany. Higher wages paid in other industries have also made it im - ponible for this company to retain its employes. The condition became so acute with the approach of June 1 that applicant, without waiting for another increase of revenue, made effective on June 1, 1919, another large increase In wages, the principal part of the increase going to the men engaged In the maintenance of the physical plant. The shortage of labor, due to the conditions described and to the general war condi - tions, resulted in greatly reducing maintenance and replacement work </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATB RAILWAY COMMISSION 305 during the past eighteen months, to an extent seriously affecting the service. In its detailed estimate of the force necessary to completely and adequately man the system and restore normal conditions, the company shows that 193 additional employes will be required. Follow - ing the notice to its employes of the increase in wages June 1. the company made application to the Commission for approval of a schedule of exchange rates that is approximately ten per cent higher than the present scale. The increase is not spread uniformly over the existing schedule, but specific rates are named, an effort being made to adjust the relationship between the various classes of service and the various exchange?. Because of the number of rates involved and the complex character of the schedule, they will not be quoted here. At the time of the hearing on June 2, 1919, attorneys for certain of the protestants objected to the consideration of the application by the Commission on the ground that the application had been brought in the name of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and not in the name of the postmaster general, who had control of the telephone com - panies for the United States government. If that objection had force at the time it was stated, and we do not pass upon that point, decision of the question is rendered unnecessary by an order of the postmaster general. No. 3178, dated June 5, 1919, in which "all telegraph and tele - phone companies, including individuals and partnerships, whose prop - erties were taken over by the President under authority of the Joint Resolution of the Congress, approved July 16. 1918. will hereafter operate and manage their properties 1 during the remainder of the period of Federal control, as under Order No. 1783. free from direct Federal operation." Under this order it is manifest that the companies are directed by the postmaster general to manage their affairs in the same manner as before the federal government assumed control. Full notice of the hearing on June 2 was given to all parties In the territory served by the company. A number of protestants were present in person or by counsel. Their objections go c'-.iefly to the character of the service furnished by the company in the past eighteen months. Vigorous complaints as fo service were registered by subscribers from Crab Orchard, Fairmont, Syracuse, Ashland, Tecumseh, and other points. At practically all the points at which complaints were reported, how - ever, it was the farm service that was the most criticised. In most in - stances the poor service was found to be due to the lack of proper maintenance. This was explained by the company on the ground that during the war and since it has been impossible to secure sufficient labor and as* a consequence repair work had to be neglected. Indeed, the complaints as to service tend to corroborate the claims of the com - pany that it has an Insufficient number of employes. Assurances were given that the plants in the poorest condition would be given immediate attention so as to restore the service to normal at the earliest possible </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 moment. Reports received by the Commission indicate that much of this work is already under way. We are of the opinion, however, that the increased rates for the service complained of should not be made effective until such time as the equipment is repaired. For that reason thes"e rates will be ap - proved, to go into effect after the engineer of the Commission ha" made an inspection of the properties in question and pronounced them in proper copdition. This condition will likewise apply to certain rates which the company itself has suggested should be held in abeyance until certain improvements and reconstruction can be completed. The Commission is of the opinion that th; physical plant of applicant has been neglected to such an extent that practically all the appropriation (or maintenance and depreciation accruing during the summ?r and fall months should be expended. This applies particularly to the farm lines. It is rendered even more necessary because o( the destructive sleet storm which visited a large portion of the system early in the spring and destroyed or impaired many miles 1 of line. In support of its allegation that the force of employee must neces- Ily be increased, the company submits several exhibits showing the ises of employes required, the wages to be paid each class, and the *3 to which employes will be assigned. For example, it is stated : thirteen exchange managers must be added, the points without ti managers being Louisville, Mead, Waverly. Tamor.i, Nehawka, ims, Talmage, Brock, Garland, Octavia. Shelby. Carle; on and line. It has been necessary for several months to have managers neighboring exchanges 1 look after these exchanges in addition to r regular duties. This method, of course, has not resulted in ade - te attention to the needs of the public. In like manner, it has been essary to spread the work of a lineman over two or three exchanges. when he should have devoted his full time to one. Gangs for heavy construction work have had to be entirely reassembled, the largest shortage of men being in this department. The survey by the company shows, as stated, that a total of 193 additional employes will be re - quired, this number including several operators. In order to verify this estimate by the company, the Commission called for a report as of June 25, showing the number of new employes added since the first of the month This report shows 76 to have been added during that period, divided among the various departments as follows I In addition, ten or more have been employed whose classification not yet reached the head office. It would appear from this report, efore, that the company is making an earnest effort to complete its ! and that the increased wages are an aid to that effort.

            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 307 The increase in the number of employes and the added expense, be - cause of the increase in wages, amounts to a total increased expense of 130,049.29 per month. Over fifty per cent of this amount is properly chargeable to new construction and to the reserve for depreciation al - ready set aside from the earnings. According to the apportionment made by the company, which apportionment we find to be reasonable, 114,551.29 of this amount is properly chargeable to operating expense. Increased taxes will amount to $680. ?2 per month and transportation of men needed for operation and current repairs amounts to $1,380.00 per month, making a total increase of $16,611.61. On the basis of the year, this would amount to $199,339.32. From a detailed study of the stations in service, it is calculated that the increase in revenue from the pro - posed rates, allowing for a loss in stations, due to increased rates, will be $10,551.05 per month. For the first three months of the year the company operated with an average monthly surplus of $2,257.17. As this surplus showed a slight upward tendency, we are of the opinion that $30(i(i per month would probably be a more fair figure for the year as a whole. Adding this to the revenue produced by the increased rates and deducting $610.89 as the probable monthly loss of forfeited discounts, we have $12,940.16 as the total surplus and increase in revenue that may be expected after the new schedule goes into eff:ct. This lacks $3,671.45 per month of meeting the anticipated requirements. During 1918 the company lost 1,800 subscribers. It is gaining now, however, and will doubtless show a net gain for the year of over 1,000. This revenue, together with the fact that the anticipated expense will not be realized at once through the inability of the company to secure the necessary employes, should make it possible for the company to operate without any considerable deficit. The rates proposed by the company are in many instan.es ab - normally high and the Commission would not approve them were it not for the fact that we are now in the midst of abnormal price conditions, both as to labor and material, which make it imperative to grant ap - plicant emergency relief. The public is entitled to adequate service. This the company cannot furnish without the necessary number of em - ployes, and it is evident these employes cannot be secured and retained without the payment of increased wages. These increased wages are already in effect. As shown, every dollar of the added revenue will go to the employes. No part of it is to be used for increased return on the capital investment. Under the circumstances, therefore, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the schedule should be approved, subject to certain conditions, among them being that the order shall remain in effect only until December 31, 1919, at which time the company shall be required to make a full and complete showing as to the reasonable - ness of the rates approved. The Commission will retain jurisdiction of all the issues so that, if at any time conditions change, modification of the order may be made. All the conditions embodied in our order </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 of October 1, 1918, and renewed on May 1, 1919, will be made to apply to these rates. As a part of the proposed schedule, applicant asks for the approval of the so-called Burleson installation charges. Figures purporting to support these charges were submitted in this record. We made no find- Ing, however, as to the reasonableness of these rates. They will be temporarily approved until such time as the Commission can make In- vestigation of the whole matter of installation and removal charges. It is planned to make that investigation at an early date. In the opinion of the Commission, the facts and circumstances as set out In this record, constitute an emergency and justify an applica tlon of these rates as of July 1, 1919.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3953 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone A. Telegraph Company for Authority to Increase Rates at Its Various Exchange* in Order to Provide Necessary Wage Increases. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: An order was entered by this Commission on October 1, 1918, and effective November 1, 1918, increasing the exchange rates of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. This order expired by its terms on May 1, 1919. On proper showing it was extended to December 31 1919. In June, 1919, however, the company made an application for another increase, alleging still further advances in wages paid to all classes of employee. The rates as applied for In this application were approved, subject to all of the conditions 1 contained in the previous orders and to certain new conditions as set forth in the order of approval. The rates as thus approved were made to terminate on December 31, 1919. The company now comes with an application for an indefinite extension of the present rate*, alleging that labor and material costs are as high at present as they were at the time the rate* were made effective and </seg>
            <seg id="p313">313 with the prospect that they will continue on the same level for some time to come, indications pointing even to a higher basis for the future. The last order contained a provision suspending the application of certain rates for certain exchanges where material rebuilding was necessary in order to provide efficient service. The increased rates were to go into effect upon the completion of this rebuilding program. As thia work has progressed, it has been reported by the company and an engineer of the Commission has made an inspection, and upon his report that the service conditions were satisfactory, the rates were made effective. All of this work has not been accomplished so that In a few instances the rates approved are not yet effective. Most of the improvements have been completed, however, in a manner satisfactory to the Commission. At the hearing held on the present application, the Company sub- mitted exhaustive figures as to its operating revenues and expenses and other data bearing on its financial condition and on present and antici - pated prices for material and labor. In this connection it should be said that the company has filed a complete monthly statement covering all of its operations since the first order issued in this case, so that the Commission has 1 been kept constantly advised of its condition. In its showing made in June the company submitted certain estimates of anticipated increase in expenses. On the basis of this estimate it was expected that expenses would increase in the amount of $199,339.32 per year. The actual experience for the eleven months' ending November 30, 1919, shows that the increase in expenses for the year will ba $217,468. It is apparent, therefore, that the estimates made six months ago were conservative and have been more than realized. The same applies to the revenues except that the increase in the number of sub - scribers has 1 been somewhat larger than was anticipated. In our opinion we stated that the number of subscribers will doubtless "show a net gain for the year of over 1,000." The gain, in fact, has been approxi - mately 1,300. In this number, however, is represented subscribers' sta - tions acquired by purchase. It is probable, therefore, that the gain due to the normal growth of the system is in the neighborhood of 900 to 1,000. The Increased revenue from this source has only been sufficient to keep pace with the increased expenses. A condensed statement of the earnings and expenses for the five months from July 1, 1919. to November 30, 1919, together with an estimate for the year 1920, based on this five months' experience, is as follows: Actual 5 mos. 7-1-1919 to Estimated 11-30-1919 Next year— 1920 Exchange revenues $635,519 Toll revenues 285,199 $1,520,052.64 683.953.08 ,520.052.64 683 953.08 Total telephone revenues $920,718 Operation expenses $300,139 Current maintenance 207,726 $2,204,005.72 $ 718,447.93 496,708.88 </seg>
            <seg id="p314">314 As stated, the estimate made for 1920 is based on the actual ex perience for the past five months and, barring the item of taxes, con - tains no allowance for any increase in cost of labor and material tor the next year. It should be remarked in this connection that the antici - pated increase in taxes was estimated by the company at the hearing six months ago at $680 per month. The actual increase for the five months was $l,37o per month. Due to very heavy increases in vtate taxes for the ensuing year, it is expected that the aprqpriation for this purpose must still be increased. The company has outlined a very extensive rebuilding progr.-.m for the year 1920 and has prepared a tentative budget involving the ex - penditure of approximately $1,500,000. It is very probable, however. that this amount will have to be reduced to not to exceed $1,000,000, owing to a lack of funds. This money is to be expended in necessary replacements and improvements. A considerable portion of it can be charged to the depreciation reserve already accumulated and to the capital account bo that no part of it will be directly chargeable to operating expense. However, the amount properly chargeable to the capital account will ultimately be capitalized and to that extent will in- crease the allowance necessary for interest and dividends. As shown by our brief history of the various orders increasing the Ei of this company, the Commission has approved the rates only wrarily. Our previous orders hare been based on six months &gt;ds. Basing our conclusion on conditions as they have existed for past eighteen months, and on indications for the future, we are of opinion that it will be at least a year before any material change le cost of operation is realised. There is no prospect at this time ta reduction in wages or does there appear to be any possibility in immediate lowering of prices on materials and supplies. We ?re the opinion and so find that the schedule of rates now in effect uld be extended for the period of one year from January 1, 1920, Ject to any modification the Commission may find necessary and ad- tble in the meantime. As stated above, the company is required to monthly reporter, showing in great detail all its operating revenues tepreciation 189,127 'axes 52,757 452,753.00 125,164.84 452,753.00 125,164.84 Total telephone expenses $749,749 $1793,074.65 let telephone earnings. 170,969 lundry net earnings 11,704 410,931.07 28,092.00 410,931.07 28,092.00 Total net earnings $182,673 teduct interest 30,243 $ 439,023.07 72,588.00 lalance net profits $152,430 teduct dividends (paid and accrued) 146,076 $ 366.435.07 350,580.00 Undivided profits - $ 6,354 $ 15,855.07 15.855.07 </seg>
            <seg id="p315">315 and expenses so that the Commission is able to know at any time its exact condition. If a sudden reduction in prices occurs, the Commis - sion will be able from this information to measure the effect and to make such readjustments in the rates as are justified by the new con - ditions. The rates, therefore, will be made effective until December 31, 1920, at which time the company will be required to make another showing as to their reasonableness. In the original order issued in this case (Application No. 3701). the following provision appeared: "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the basis of all charge* to applicant's 'Reserve for Accrued Depreciation' fund shall be the full cost of replacements made in kind, less salvage values of the property displaced. Where replacements are not made in kind the basis of charge shall be the reproduction new value of the property displaced as of the time of the purchase of the property installed; and the difference between that cost and the cost of the property installed shall be debited or credited to plant account according as the cost of the property installed shall be above or below the esti - mated reproduction new value of the property displaced. No other charges of any nature shall be made to said fund, and particularly, no costs incurred in the consolidation of plants' or properties other than replacement costs of property constituting a part of the prop - erty owned by applicant in the first instance." Applicant objects to this provision on the ground that if complied with it would require a very much larger charge for depreciation, and because of its impracticability. The matter was not gone into at the time of the hearing and the Commission is not prepared to pass' defi - nitely upon the question at this time. The company very frankly ad - mits that it has not complied with this one provision of the ord-r. It will be required to show cause, at a date to be fixed in this order, why it should not do so. At the same time it should be required to show cause why earnings derived from the investment of the deprecia - tion reserve should not be credited to that reserve. No definite policy to that effect is now followed by the company. This company from time to time purchases the property of other telephone companies and consolidates them with its own system. Heretofore no report as to the purchase price or the terms and condi - tions of sale have been made to the Commission. We are of the opinion that the company should be required to at least submit to the Commission, following such purchase, a statement showing clearly its method of entering such transactions upon its books. Such information is esrential to the Commission if we are to intelligently follow and analyze the financial reports filed by the company.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3984 In the Matter of the Application of the Antelope County Mutual Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Increase Its Ex - change Rate*. Appearances For Applicant— William H. Cratty, Presi; C. B. Kinney, Secretary; August Schultz, Treasurer; William H. Campbell, Fiscal Agent. </seg>
            <seg id="p317">317 OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: At the time the application herein was filed the system of the Ante - lope County Mutual Telephone Company consisted of two exchanges. One located at Elgin served 274 subscribers and 126 farmers who own and operate their lines. The other located at Clearwater served 164 subscribers and an indefinite number of switched farmers. The com - pany was organized in 1902 or 1903 and at first operated on what ap - pears to have been a sort of tontine plan. In other words, it was pro - posed at the outset that each shareholder would contribute $60 to con - struct the system, after which the contributions by new subscribers would be sufficient to operate and maintain the plant. This plan was followed for three or four years when it reached the point which such enterprises usually reach. The company had to be put on an assess - ment or a rate basis and after one or two assessments a rate schedule was adopted and put into effect. Nine thousand nine hundred dollars of stock was outstanding at the time the application was filed, which rep - resented cash paid into the treasury of the company. According to the testimony, it does not represent all of the contributions to the property because the farmers at the outset gave of their own time and service in building lines, the money contributions representing only the actual cost of the material. The company has never paid any dividends except as the stockholders received free service in the early years. In recent years the Clearwater exchange has been operated under a lease. For three years the lessee paid $300 per year and for the past year has paid $400 per year for the use of the exchange property. The company pays the taxes on the property and furnishes all of the ma - terials necessary in the maintenance of the Clearwater exchange. The loieo, a Mr. R. Bennett, collects and retains the entire revenues of the exchange. It appears that the lease has not been compensatory to the company, although it does not appear from the showing made that Mr. Bennett has made more than a reasonable salary out of the arrange - ment The Elgin exchange, while under general supervision of the board of directors and officers of the company, has been operated by a man who received a lump sum for furnishing the operators and doing all of the maintenance work. Up until last fall the company paid $200 per Eh for this service. On August 1 a change was made in the man - r aud the salary increased to $250 per month. In addition to this y, the company pays the taxes and rent and furnishes all of the rial necessary in the maintenance of the plant. At the time of the Hearing the officers and directors presented to the presiding commissioner the proposition of dividing the company, the Antelope County Mutual Telephone Company to retain the Elgin ex - change with the farm lines naturally tributary to that town. Another company was to be organized to take over the Clearwater exchange. </seg>
            <seg id="p318">318 In view of the fact that there appears to be no reason why the two exchanges, which are eighteen miles apart, should be operated by one company and from the further fact that the organization as it has been constituted was so loose and inefficient as to make it difficult to handle a large system, the Commission advised that the separation be effected. It was thereupon agreed that a physical valuation would be made by the engineers of the Commission and that valuation used as a basis for the division of the property. The Commission has since been advised that the division has now been effected. The valuation as made by the engi - neers shows an original cost for the property as a whole of $24,875.28, Of which $15,028.70 is credited to Elgin and $9,846 "&gt;S to Olearwater. The present or depreciated value of the plant is $11,706 .91, $7,284 77 of which is applicable to the Elgin exchange and $4,422.14 to the Clear - water exchange. It will be observed from these figures that the plant as a whole is in a very poor physical condition. Indeed it would ap - pear from this showing that both exchanges will have to be almost com - pletely rebuilt if adequate and satisfactory service is to be given to the public. The poor condition of the property is further attested by the testimony of the officers of the company and its patrons. It is ad - mitted that the service is very poor. Undoubtedly, therefore, steps should be taken to rehabilitate both plants. Inasmuch, however, as the Clearwater exchange has now been taken out of this company we are concerned in this order only with the affairs of that portion of the property now owned by the Antelope County Mutual Telephone Com- Pali J . Because of the loose and inefficient manner of handling the busi - ness, the company was' unable to make any adequate showing as to its operating costs. As stated, it is paying $250 per month for the operat - ing and labor expense of maintenance at Elgin, but the figure as to the cost of material as applicable to the Elgin exchange is not ascertain - able. In the opinion of the Commission this method of operating an exchange will not produce efficient result*. It results in a divided re - sponsibility. In addition, the incentive on the part of the person having the contract is to operate at as low cost as possible so that his margin of profit may be large. The company should discontinue this "farming out" process and should conduct directly all of its own afTairs. It ■bould hire a competent manager and intrust to him the details of the management and hold him responsible for the success or failure of the business. Until this plan is adopted, it will be impossible to furnish the service which this community is entitled to. It should he added also that the central office at the present time is located in an under - ground room, which is unsanitary and inadequate for the purpose.

It is admitted by the officers of the company that these conditions arise from the fact that the management has been in the hands of farmers and business men whose other interests have prevented them from giving the necessary attention to the affairs of the company. It is time to recognize, how - ever, that the furnishing of telephone service is a business of itself and that if a progressive community like Elgin is to be adequately served, the business must be conducted on modern lines. As stated, the figures submitted by the company have not been very enlightening as to the cost of operation, but it is apparent that any figures representing conditions such as we have described would not reflect a proper cost of operation under normally efficient conditions. The Commission has taken the revenues of the company, which can be definitely ascertained, and has adopted figures for operating, which should be applicable to an exchange of this size and character, with the following results: STATEMENT OF OPERATION ON ESTIMATED BASIS EARNINGS Rentals $4,194.00 Switching 799.00 Toll (estimated) 300.00 $5,293.00 $5,293.00 EXPENSES Mtc. and Dep.

Deficit 498.96 $ 397.01 On this showing the company would operate at a deficit of approxi - mately $400 per year. In figuring the dividends we have allocated to the Elgin property that proportion of $9,900 of capital stock as would be represented by the relative number of subscribers served by the two exchanges. The company asks for authority to increase all of its rates </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 twenty-five cents per month, which rates at the present time are as follows: Business $2.25 per month Residence 1.25 per month Farm 1.50 per month With a discount of twenty-five cents if paid by the tenth of the month. Such an increase would produce a total Increase of approximately E00 per year, which is more than appears to be necessary under the instances Some increase will be necessary, however, and we are e opinion that an increase of fifteen cents per month on each class of telephones is reasonably required. A schedule to this effect will be roved subject to conditions to be set out in the order. The company has filed and has In effect a rate for switching farm lines of fifty cents per month. We find, however, that it has a different rate in effect for two farm line companies for which it furnishes service. The Cedar Mutual Telephone Company of Oakdale has lines extending Into Elgin, some of which are connected to the Elgin switchboard. These lines are switched by applicant at a flat rate of $100 per year. The company is uncertain as to the number of subscribers served in this manner, but estimates that it is- about fifty. On this basis, these subscribers would be receiving service at the rate of $2.00 per year or leas than twenty cents per month. The company switches another line known as the German Mutual (old line), which is likewise connected at Petersburg with another company. The farmers on this line receive service from the Elgin exchange on the basis of twenty-five cents per month. In the opinion of the Commission, the practice the company has followed of charging the subscribers of these two companies a less rate than it charges to other subscribers, results in discrimination and should be discontinued by increasing the rates to these two companies to the regular basis of fifty cents per month. As we have shown, the plant is in a poor physical condition and needs extensive rebuilding. It cannot be expected that the entire re - construction of this property can be accomplished out of an increase of rates. As a further remedy the company should properly dispose of more stock aud put the proceeds thereof in its depreciation reserve. It should be entitled to capitalize such portion of the difference between Its present outstanding capital of approximately $6,300 and the original cost of the property, or $15,028, as may be required for the reconstruc - tion of the plant. There can be no question but that several thousand dollars will be needed and the company should make application (or the authorization of such additional capital as, in its judgment, it may reasonably require.

            <seg id="p321">321 A discount of twenty-five cents per month will be allowed on business and residence service if payment is made on or before the tenth of the month. On farm service a discount of twenty-five cents per month will be allowed where payment 1b made three months in advance, if said payment is made before the thirtieth of the first month of the quarter. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the schedule of rates as herein approved shall become effective upon the condition that the board of directors file a statement in writing with the Commission to the effect that the central office shall be removed from the basement in which it is now located to more sanitary and convenient quarters, and that the operation of the exchange shall be placed under the supervision of a manager whose duty it shall be to have executive charge of all em - ployes, collect all revenues, superintend construction and maintenance work, keep the books of the company after a system to be prescribed by this Commission, and to perform such other duties as ordinarily de - volve upon a manager. Upon receipt of such statement from the directors, the Commission will fix a date upon which the rates pro - vided for herein shall become effective. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant herein, irrespective of whether the rates provided have become effective, shall set aside for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation a sum equal to twelve per cent of the original cost, as shown in this report, plus such addi - tions and betterments as may be made from time to time. Such fund shall be used for the payment of all maintenance costs, including that portion of the lineman's salary covering work done in repairing and re - placing the property, all extra labor for the same purpose, the cost of batteries, the cost of all materials used in maintenance, livery or auto - mobile hire and to create a reserve for deferred depreciation.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3992 In the Matter of the Application of the Sutherland Telephone Company for Au - thority to Increase Rates and Issue Securities. Appearances For Applicant — Philip E. Horan, Attorney; Eben D. Warner, Presi - dent, and George C. White, Secretary and Treasurer. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Petitioner is a corporation operating a telephone exchange, with headquarters at Sutherland and serving the town and a portion of the country tributary thereto. The company is owned by Eben D. Warner, George C. White and Mrs. Elisabeth J. White. At the present time it has capital stock outstanding in the amount of $6,000. There is an in - debtedness of $4,245.96, incurred a few years ago by the purchase of the farm line extending to Paxton and beyond and the complete rebuild - ing of the same. This is an application for authority to increase the capital stork to the extent of $10,141 and to increase all of the exchange rate? of the company. We will consider first the application to in - crease the capital stock. The company bases its application for an issue of $10,141 of capital stock on the indebtedness outstanding and on a claim for services per - forated by Messrs. White and Warner which have never been com - pensated for. In the opinion of the Commission the expenditure of the funds derived from the money borrowed is a legitimate charge to capital account and may very properly be capitalized. In behalf of Mr. White It Is claimed that he has worked for the company for the eight years rl911, at which time he and Mr. Warner acquired the company, for al of $8,304. This 1 is an average of $1,038 per annum. During this time he has been manager of the company, kept its books, and attended to Its business affairs, and in addition has looked after all of the repair and maintenance and construction work, maintaining at his own ex - pense throughout the entire period an automobile. In this connection it should be stated that the company has paid annually dividends on t outstanding capital stock in the amount of 12 per cent. In the Ion of this Commission this exceeds a reasonable return by at ; 4 per cent. If we add 4 per cent on the $4,800 of stock owned by </seg>
            <seg id="p323">323 Mr. White to the amount he has received in salary we have $9,840. This is an average of 11,220 per year. Mr. White asks for an allowance of $150 per month, or $1,800 per year. In our opinion such an allow - ance would be excessive. The company, as stated, serves but 220 sub - scribers, all but fifty of these being located within the town of Suther - land. Such a business is not sufficient to justify the salary claimed, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. White furnished an automobile in ad - dition to the labor he performed. We are of the opinion, however, that a salary of $125 a month would have been reasonable under the cir - cumstances. On this basis, making allowance for the excess dividends received by Mr. White, he would be entitled to an allowance of $2,160, which in our opinion it would be proper to capitalize. Mr. Warner makes claim for compensation in the form of stock to the amount of $1,600 which represents compensation at the rate of $200 per year. Mr. Warner has never received any money in the form of a salary, nor has be drawn anything from the treasury of the company for expenses incurred in visiting the property from time to time. He has, however, been paid dividends at the rate of 12 per cent on the $1,200 he had in - vested in the company. Mr. Warner has visited the Sutherland plant from time to time and performed certain work in connection with the installation of a portion of the equipment. He is a heavy stockholder and the active executive officer of the Wyoming &amp; Nebraska Telephone System and receives his regular salary from that company while per - forming his work for the Sutherland company. At the present time Mr. Warner is located at Chadron, and Sutherland is difficult to reach from that point. It is probable that the work he has done for the Sutherland company might have been more cheaply handled by a line - man from the nearby town of North Platte. We are of the opinion that Mr. Warner has been fairly well compensated for his Investment and services from the dividends he has received during his connection with the company. The valuation submitted by applicant shows a reproduction new value of the property, including allowance for general expenditures, of $16,623.39 'reproduction new and $14,701.18 present value. If we capital - ize at this time the $4,245 of indebtedness and $2,160 allowance to Mr. White there will be a total stock outstanding of $12,405. This very likely closely approximates the present value of the property. In the valuation referred to the property is reported to be in 88 per cent con - dition. Such a high standard of condition is unusual, the average of plants, as found by the Commission's engineer, being in the neighbor - hood of 70 to 75 per cent. While this property has been well main - tained it is doubtful whether it is in an S8 per cent condition. As stated, it is very probable, therefore, that the capital stock as thus in - creased very nearly equals the present value of the physical property. An order approving the additional stock as suggested will be issued accordingly. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">324 The present rates of the company are as follows Business metallic $2.00 per month Business grounded 1.50 per month Business extension 50 per month Residence telephone 1.00 per month Residence extension 50 per month Private farm lines 75 per month Party farm lines 1.50 per month Switching service 35 per month The company now asks permission to increase these rates to the following schedule: Business metallic $4.00 per month Business grounded 3.25 per month Business extension „ 2.00 per month Residence telephone 2.00 per month Residence extension 50 per month Private farm lines 1.50 per month Party farm lines 2.25 per month Desk telephones 25 per month Switching service 75 per month From the above business and residence rates a discount of 25 cents per month is proposed where the rental is paid by the tenth of the month. It will be noted that a very substantial increase in the rates is proposed. As stated, the company has but 220 rental subscribers and performs switching service for 118 farmers, making a total of about 330 patrons served by the exchange. With the exception of ten business telephones, the system is entirely grounded. It is not proposed at this time to change from a grounded to a metallic system. In support of its claim for increased revenue the company submits its operating revenues and expenses for the first four months of 1919. Unfortunately these expenses are not complete in some items and it is necessary for the Commission to make some estimates. Since the first of the year Mr. White has been receiving a salary of $160 pnr month as lineman and manager, out of which he pays for the maintenance and operation of an automobile. No allocation of his salary as between his work as manager and as lineman is made by the company in the ex- penses. We have made an arbitrary division on the basis of $60.00 per month for managerial services and $100 per month as lineman. In the following statement, covering four months' operation, the Commission has made its usual allowance of ten per cent on the reproduction new value of the property. The salary of $100 per month as lineman will be included in the sum thus provided for maintenance and depreciation. It is claimed by applicant that it is necessary at this time to add a third operator at a salary of not less than $50.00 per month. For some time two operators have been performing the service, but one has been required to work sixteen hours per day. At the present time the two operators are being paid on the basis of $50.00 per month to one and house rent and $50.00 to the other. Operators are not paid the full </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 325 salary until after they have become experienced. It is probable that a basis of $50.00 per month for each of the three operators will represent fairly accurately the actual expenditures of the company for this pur - pose. The operating statement, adjusted in these particulars, is as follows : STATEMENT OF EARNINGS AND EXPENSES, COVERING FOUR MONTHS OF OPERATION EARNINGS Miscellaneous 131.50 The rates as proposed would produce additional revenue of slightly less than $3,000 per year. The above statement shows that such an amount is not necessary at this time. An exchange serving only 330 patrons does not give sufficient service to justify such rates, particu - larly where the service is practically all grounded. The operating statement discloses that approximately $1,500 added revenue will provide for the operating expense as it has been during the past few months and as it will very likely be after the expected in - creases are realized. With that figure as a guide, we have determined upon the following scale of rates as being reasonably necessary under the circumstances. Rentals $1,078.00 Company tolls 181.64 Commission on tolls 169.84 Switching service 165.20 $1,594.6 EXPENSES 3peration : Operators, 3(ff$50.00 $ 600.00 Light 10.00 Heat 20.00 Rent 60.00 $690.00 General: Manager $ 240.00 Bookkeeper 100.00 Taxes 60.00 531.50 [aintenance and depreciation (10% on $16,623) 554.08 1,775.5: Operating deficit $ 180.* Annual deficit Ividends (8% on $12,405) $ 542.71 992.41 Total deficit $1,535.11 </seg>

These rates, basing the calculation upon the number of subscribers now in service, will produce slightly over $1,500 more revenue. This sum we believe to be sufficient at this time. For that reason the schedule as stated will be approved.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Attest: T. A. BROWNE, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3998 In the Matter of the Application of the Buffalo County Telephone Company of Pleasanton for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances : M. S. Booher, Secretary. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant operates a telephone exchange in Pleasanton and Poole. Nebraska, and adjacent territory, serving approximately 350 subscribers, of which 20 are business subscribers. 51 residence subscribers, and the remainder farm line subscribers. It has 112 stockholders scattered among its subscribers with the exception of three considerable holdings. This company was organized in 1903 as an association in conjunc - tion with what is now the Union Valley Telephone Company at Kearney. It operated as an association until 1909 or 1910, during which period a total of $5,000 of capital was paid in and an exchange of 225 subscrib - ers was built up. During this period only one small dividend was paid. The earnings of the company were put into extensions. In the year 1909 sharp differences of opinion led to division of prop - erty, approximately three-fifths of the outstanding capital and propor - tionate property Joining in the formation of a corporation known as the Buffalo County Telephone Company. The remainder of the property drew off into the Union Valley Telephone Company, taking a proper share of the property with it and surrendering the stock. This stock was held in the treasury of applicant company and soon thereafter re - issued for cash at the par value of $10 per share. The money thus received was used in extensions' and betterments. Since the formation of the corporation, regular dividends at ten per cent have been paid to the stockholders and in 1918 a cash dividend of fifty per cent additional thereto was declared. There is some contradiction in the testimony of applicant's witness. Secretary M. S. Booher, and the annual reports as to whether a dividend was actually declared as a result of the first year's operation of the corporation. Applicant's rates at present are $1.50 for business service at Pleasanton, $1.25 for party line business service at Poole. and $1.00 per T. L. HALL, Chairman </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 iith for residence and farm service. It desires to increase these s 25 cents per month, to establish a gross and net system of collec - , and to make certain other adjustments. In defense of the applica - the company alleges that its property is growing old, that it has proper depreciation reserve in liquid form, that an extensive re - ding program will soon be necessary and that the increase in rates equired to meet this unusual expenditure. At the time of the hearing on this application in the Commission's offices July 31, 1919, applicant was asked to justify the fifty per cent cash dividend. The Justification given was that between 1903 and 1910 no dividends were paid with the single exception of one five per cent dividend; that the company had had the use of these deferred dividends through all the years and that the fifty per cent cash dividend was fully necessary to square the account. IThe extraordinary cash dividend was paid in July. 1918. The Com - ;ion finds it extremely difficult to get the logic which governed the kholders in declaring this dividend. That the stockholders were .led to compensation for the deferred dividends is certain. Liquida - of this indebtedness had been deferred from time to time in normal 3ds and the money used for other purposes, yet at a moment when as well known that operation was facing a period of excessive s and when accrued surpluses were likely to be drawn on to meet e excessive costs, most of the cash on hand was taken out of the sury and paid to the stockholders. The company's first duty was to it* depreciation reserve, to take care of the very exigency, which leads the company at this time to apply for higher rates. That depreciation reserve was either this cash which was paid out as a special dividend or it had been spent in ex - tensions represented now by property in excess of the value of the out - standing stock. In fact, both the deferred dividends and the deprecia - tion reserve were represented by cash on hand and extensions of prop erty not capitalized. If the company elected to consider that the de - preciation reserve had been Invested in property and the deferred divi - dends were held in cash, it was not proper for it to pay the deferred dividend out until it had made arrangements to provide a liquid de - preciation reserve fund to care for the rebuilding program, the neces - sity for which was rapidly approaching. This could have been done by the sale of additional stock against the uncapitalized extensions and the patting of that money in the fund from which originally borrowed, namely, the depreciation reserve. If such action had been taken, a proper dividend to cover the deferred dividends could not have been criticised. It may be paid that there was no market for the stock. In that case it was the company's duty to consider this cash as the depre - dation reserve and to have paid the deferred dividends as a stock dividend. In lieu of that, the stockholders, whose duty it is to properly </seg>
            <seg id="p329">329 care for tho property, should have bought this stock themselves and have paid therefor prior to the declaration of the cash dividends. The Commission does not want to intimate that the stockholders were deliberately imposing on the company. They, however, did make a serious mistake. They can hardly now ask for higher rates to pro - vide a depreciation reserve or for any other purpose than plain operat - ing expenses until they shall have corrected these past errors. It is the duty of these stockholders to provide a liquid depreciation reserve in a proper amount by the sale of stock against the uncapitalized prop - erty, or, failing in this, to recover into the treasury the extraordinary dividend paid and to issue in lieu thereof a stock dividend covering the amount of the deferred dividends on the proper stock entitled thereto and in proper amount. In figuring the amount due the stockholders the company has evi - dently fallen into another error. It has paid the extra dividend on all outstanding stock to cover a period when a portion of the property now separate was a part of the exchange. When the property was divided there went to the present Union Valley Telephone Company whatever rights to deferred dividends existed in that portion of the property. Those who have bought stock since the division are not entitled to any compensation for the period prior to the division when no dividends were paid. They have been compensated from year to year. Before relief in the increased rates will be considered, the company will be required to Justify this extraordinary dividend. The dividends of ten per cent since the division of the property and the incorporation of applicant have in the opinion of the Commission been somewhat more than reasonable. The rates, however have not been unduly high. The company has operated economically. In order to pay the ten per cent dividends it has underpaid its manager, for which he is partly responsible, and has underpaid its operators until recently, who were in no position to protest successfully. The testi - mony shows that for years operators were paid fifty cents a day and were required to pay all their own expenses. The stockholders should feel some sense of regret that they should have demanded loyal services from employes on this compensation and at the same time have paid out the amount of dividends which were paid. The present revenues from all sources furnish the company a maximum of $4,750 per annum. Reasonable expenditures under present conditions, including an average expenditure for current maintenance and normal depreciation reserve, the extra cost to the company for keeping the uniform and necessary system of accounts, the present more nearly proper wages of operators and all other necessary present expenses will not exceed the amount of revenue. This revenue will not Klde the needed depreciation reserve to take care of the rebuilding ram that is either immediately necessary or will be necessary in the near future </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 The company will be required herein to make a further showing on or before December 20, in Justification of the exceptional fifty per cent cash dividend. If it fails so to do, a supplemental order will be issued, requiring a correction of the errors, which, in the light of the present record appear to have occurred in dealing with this matter by the board of directors. By a supplemental application the company asks to be permitted to publish gross and net rates. The record shows' that the collection-; are not promptly made and payments of rentals are unduly in arrears. The Commission will, therefore, authorize the publication of gross and net rates. I Business men at Poole pay a rate of $1.25 per month, although the serving them requires considerable maintenance. The Commission ;ves that the rate for these business phones should be increased to level of the business rates in Pleasanton The company has some individual lines outside of the exchange Es of Pleasanton and desires to make an extra charge covering the itenance of those individual lines. This is in accordance with the mission's rulings and the company will be authorized to charge 25 cents per month additional for each quarter of a mile of extra wire outside the corporate limits of the village of Pleasanton, serving Indi - vidual subscribers and not party line subscribers. The distance will be Kured air line from the nearest point of the town limits to the in involved.

Taylor, Acting Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO 3998 In the Matter of the Application of the Buffalo County Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: In the original opinion herein the Commission found that no neces - sity was shown for the increase in rates and the application was denied. An error occurred in the computation which a further check discloses. The item of dividends on $6,580 of stock outstanding was omitted. When this item is included and an additional allowance as a trust fund of approximately $225 is permitted to be earned, the com - pany will require under present conditions approximately $5,500 annu - ally. Rates will be adjusted to provide this amount. By its own showing, the company needs a depreciation reserve both for immediate use in replacements and a certain amount to carry in liquid form for emergencies which may arise. Ample depreciation re - serve, as shown in the original order, exists in the properties, having been borrowed by the company for extension purposes. The company has 1 Indicated that it can dispose of a limited amount of stock for the purpose of replacing enough of the depreciation reserve to care for the replacements now essential to put the property Into such operating con - dition as both the company and the Commission desire, and to provide a limited liquid assets item to care for unforeseen emergencies of main - tenance and replacements. </seg>
            <seg id="p332">332 I The surplus of $225, figured herein by the Commission, is in part the purpose of paying dividends on any such stock as may be Issued h the aproval of tha Commission, the proceeds of such stock sale to used for replacement purposes. If the company desires to build any ther extensions or to improve the property in such manner as to call capital investment, it can, on proper showing, secure authority to I said stock and to promptly pay the dividends at eight per cent on stock. In a brief filed November 12, 1919, the company attempts to justify a fifty per cent cash dividend paid in 1918. The Commission is unable to make the Justification fit the situation as it understands it. No suspicion exists in the minds of the Commission that the officers and stockholders of the company did not act in perfect good faith, but the payment of the cash dividend did embarrass it very much and from present information before the Commission it appears that this dividend exceeded very materially the amount justified by the passed dividends in the earlier years of the history of the company. It is, however, only fair to the company that it be given further opportunity to make a ■bowing in this regard and the Commission is setting down the matter for consideration in its offices in Lincoln on Wednesday, January 21, ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Buffalo County Telephone Company be and it here - by is authorized, effective January 1, 1920, to publish and collect the following schedule of rates: IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the provisions of the original order herein, relative to the spread between gross and net rates, re - main in full force and effect when changed to meet the altered rates; that the rates for special equipment and for night calls remain un - changed; and that the rule relative to collection of gross and net rates - remain as heretofore. tIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall set aside thly such amount as will total $1,900 annually as a maintenance depreciation reserve, out of which shall be paid the cost of ma - il and extra labor for current maintenance, one-half of the line - 's salary where lineman acts as manager, as per the present rule, cost of batteries, automobile running expense and upkeep, and tar items, the remainder to be carried in this account as a replace - t fund when such replacements become necessary.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. HALL, Chairman. Attest: JOHN E. CURTISS, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4027 In the Matter of the Application of the Amherst Telephone Company for Author - ity to Increase Rate*. Appearances : For Applicant — A. R. Green, Sec; A. T. Reynolds. Treas.; Mr. Jor - dan, Pres, ; J. E. Harris, Member Board of Directors. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates an exchange of approximately 275 subscrib - ers in the village of Amherst, Buffalo county, Nebraska, and in the farming community adjacent. It has asked authority to increase present rates of $1.00 per month for all classes of service to $1.25 per month and to continue its present practice of writing off from bills of stock - holders 50 cents per month each as an offset for investment and divers other special expenses borne by the stockholders. An inventory was taken of applicant's property by the engineering department of the Commission and the present worth of the different classes of property found by it. This inventory shows that the orig - inal construction cost was $16,895.82 or a cost per station of $53.30. The property is only in 60 per cent condition, making the present worth based on original cost, $10,257. The system is grounded and there is approximately 360 feet of cable. The company owns its own central office building, which is an approximately new brick structure. Hearing on the application was held at Amher&amp;t on October 8th, made necessary by the very meager records of most of the life of the company and because of the ruinous practice of rebating to stockhold - ers,- a practice which many of the stockholders and some of the officers still consider a good policy. This company was organized in 1905 and extended rapidly from that date. Each stockholder originally put in $35, which it was esti - mated would pay the cost of materials and for a telephone instrument. </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 Ek of par ralue of $10 per share was issued. In 1912 an assessment 115 per share was made on all stockholders for the purpose of iring funds with which to build needed extensions and to do certain ir improving. Stock certificates were called in and new ones Issued five shares to each stockholder. Some certificates have never been ented for exchange because the practice of the company did not e it worth while to see that the proper stock record was made. Originally only stockholders were served, but in the course of three years it was found necessary to break over tbis rule. The number of renters between 1908 and 1912 was not large, although the records are unavailable. Even at the time of the hearing the secretary was not sure how many renters were securing service. Testimony of witnesses who had been in the company since its origin was that for a number of years 75 cents out of each dollar of rental from stockholders was cancelled off each year to cover the sacri - fice of the preceding year. Since 1912 the amount thus rebated ranged from 50 cents to 75 cents per month per stockholder. It would thus appear that the company has allowed its desire to i heavy rebates tempt it away from proper maintenance of its ?rties inasmuch as the practice has continued to date and the srties are not in good condition. The testimony, however, showed in extenuating circumstances. Each stockholder buys hi? own ries and has from the beginning. He repairs his own telephone pays for repair parts. He takes care of his own drop and house ig and has always been supposed to make any main line repairs is immediate neighborhood. In recent years a large per cent e stockholders have become very careless about donated labor on repairing and this has Increased poor operation. All country lines were built by donated labor of stockholders only. The town lines were built with hired labor. President Jordan testified that in his estimation this labor plus the $50 cash invested by each Stockholder would make the actual investment in the neighborhood of $90. This appears to the Commission to be too high an estimate. By figuring the labor Item at $15 per stockholder and allowing $2.50 par annum for batteries, repairs and labor on repairing drop and in - strument, it would appear that the stockholders have in the rebates 1 secured a return on their investment, the return of their special ex - penses, and enough more to offset the labor item donated at the time of construction. tThat this ill-advised rebating system has been no bonanza to the tholders in the opinion of citizens of the localities is shown from fact that every effort is made to induce phone users to become kholders. The effort is ordinarily unsuccessful. A rule has been ited by the board of directors that not more than five shares of lury stock may be on hand at any one time. This rule was made </seg>
            <seg id="p335">335 to discourage the sale of stock by stockholders, who preferred to be renters. The Commission will, therefore, consider the past record as adjusted to date, that the present Investment of stockholders i«p the amount of the outstanding stock, namely $9,880, and that the difference between this outstanding stock and the present worth of the property represents invested depreciation reserve. It is the opinion of the Commisvion that not less than $1,750 shall be £et aside annually pro rata on a monthly basis. This sum shall be used tor no other purpose than paying the wages of lineman, extra help, materials for current repairs, and materials for replacements of existing property. No part of this amount shall be used for extending lines into new territory or for paying the cost of improvements beyond 100 per cent condition of present property. If demand exists to enter new territory and to add to the total number of subscribers, the cost of labor and materials for such purpose must be defrayed by additional sale of authorized stock, although the company must not make it a condition of furnishing telephone service, that the proposed subscriber be the purchaser of the stock. In estimating other expenses of the company, the Commission h"»s taken the present expense and rates of expenditures, has made an addi - tional allowance of $200 per annum to properly compensate for the keeping of accurate accounts, $50 per annum for directors per diem, if the company desires to pay it, dividends of 8 per cent on the present outstanding stock, and a margin of safety of $200 to meet proper ex - penditures not now foreseen and to pay dividends on any additional stock issued after proper authorization by this Commission. The total maximum proper expenditures and margin of safety per annum, includ - ing the amount mentioned above for maintenance and depreciation re - serve, is thus found to be $4,450. This amount will be earned if the rates for business service are fixed at $1.50 per month net and rates for residence and farm service at $1.25 per month net. These rates will be authorized. The company does not hire a regular lineman, which partly ac - counts for the poor condition of its property. The board of directors expressed themselves as willing to take a liberal attitude, although in the past they have been handicapped by inability to hire. They think that problem can be solved and the rates here authorized will supply the funds for proper maintenance. The company will, of course, take the most economical course possible, but must not sacrifice the service to an undue economy. The switchboard, although not old, is in very poor state of repair. The Commission will expect the company to give it immediate attention and to replace worn out parts at an early date. Report will be made to the Commission, at the time the next annual Krt is filed, as to the extent of replacements and repairs made be - n date of this order and the time of the report. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4034 In the Matter of the Application of the Platte Valley Telephone Company of Scottsbluff for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances: E. M. Morsman, Jr., Attorney; F. Alexander. President OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Petitioner operates a telephone system consisting of ten exchanges. with headquarters at Scottsbluff. The ten exchanges are as follows: Bayard, Minatare, Melbeta, Gering, Scottsbluff. Mitchell, Morrill, Tor- rington, Wyoming, Lingle. Wyoming, and Guernsey, Wyoming. As will be noticed, seven of these exchanges are in Nebraska and three in Wyoming. In connection with these exchanges a toll system of con- siderable extent Is owned and operated. The company now makes ap- plication for permission to increase the exchange rates for all of its Nebraska exchanges. The present and proposed rates are as follows: Bayard Present Proposed Individual business $2.75 $3 25 Individual residence 1.75 2.00 Farm businesg 2.50 2.50 Farm residence 1.75 2.00 Switching service 36 .50 </seg>

Rural subscribers billed quarterly in advance subject to 75 cents discount on the quarterly bill if paid on or before the tenth of the first month of the quarter. tThe rates for the Wyoming exchanges are higher by fifty cents per ltb in each class of service than the rates in Nebraska. On April 1, I, the Commission granted approval to applicant of an increase of toll rates to the extent of 25 per cent. This increase was made for purpose of covering increased operating expenses experienced up to t time and anticipated for the future, and also to bring the rates of company in line with similar rates of the other toll companies rating in the state.

The statement of operating revenues and expenses for the first six months of 1919 is as follows: REVENUES Subscriber's station $28,686.85 Miscellaneous exchange revenue 2,864.48 Toll service 12,058.90 Miscellaneous 2,458.59 $46,068.82 $46,068 82 EXPENSES Operation : Operators $ 9,248.33 Central office supplies and ex - penses 1,463.37 Central office superintendence.... 706.54 Commercial administration 2,458.06 Promotion expense 139.67 Revenue accounting 1,160.45 Collection expense 1,360.77 Directory expense 455.09 Other commercial expenses 25.00 $17,017.28 General : Office salaries $ 3,806.22 Office supplies and expenses 628.44 Law expenses 167.00 Insurance 349.72 Miscellaneous 67.00 5,018.38 Maintenance and depreciation (8% on $271,503) „ $10,860.00 10,860.00 32,895.66 Net operating income $13,173.16 1'ncollectible revenue $ 213.80 Taxes 1,250.00 Rent deductions 1,521.75 2,985.55 Net income $10,187.61 Interest $ 3,000.00 Net income Dividends (8% on $150,000) 6,000.00 9,000.00 Net surplus . $ 1,187.61 From this it will be observed that after paying Interest on its bonds and allowing for dividends on its outstanding stock the company had a </seg>
            <seg id="p340">340 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT net surplus of $1,187 for the six months period. In this connection, however, it is necessary to bear in mind that the increases in wages referred to became effective in April, and hence the full effect is not shown in the six months period covered. The surplus would have been changed into a deficit had the increases become effective January 1st. Moreover, during this period there was set up on the books only eight per cent for maintenance and depreciation. Under the prevailing costs of material and labor this is an insufficient allowance if the properties are to be kept in serviceable condition. The Commission has found not lets than ten per cent to be necessary at the present time and is of the opinion that this allowance should be made by applicant company. The increases made to employes in July are as follows: Scottsbluff Bayard Addition of manager and increases to operators aggre Total Increases in six months _ $4,100.00 If to this amount we add the increase in the maintenance and de - preciation allowance of $2,715 we would have a total increased expense for the six months period of $6,815. This would result in an increase of $13,630 for twelve months. The rates as proposed would produce addi - tional revenue in the amount of $13,287. It is apparent, therefore, that the revenue asked for will be required if service is to be maintained. As a matter of fact, the officers of the company anticipate further in - creases in wages within the next six months. tThe system in Nebraska is metallic with magneto central office pment. It is proposed to install at Melbeta, the equipment having idy been ordered, an automatic plant. This plant is being installed tally as an experiment and if found satisfactory the automatic pment may be adopted for the other exchanges. Because of the in - ation of the automatic plant at Melbeta the application was tided to provide for a further increase of 25 cents on each class of ice on that exchange. The Commission has given this amendment ful consideration and has reached the conclusion that a further in- 3ne new man @ $160 per month, six months $ Additional woman supervisor @ $100, six months Increases in operators' wages, six months 960.0&lt; 600.0&lt; 840.01 gating ..._ 1,050.00 [elbeta Increase to operator 60.00 [lnatare Rent increase 50.00 itchell Increases of $55 per month 330.00 rorrill Increases to operators 120.00 ering Increases to operators 90.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA STATK RAILWAY COMMISSION 341 crease of the rate at this time would be inadvisable. Melbeta has but sixty-three subscribers at the present time. It has free service with the Minatare exchange, having 185 subscribers. It has, therefore, access to but 248 subscribers. The exchange is too small to De operated at a profit amd it must of necessity be somewhat of a burden on the rest of the system. The Commission questions whether it is advisable to charge the patrons of the Melbeta exchange twenty-five cents per month more than is charged to the subscribers at Minatare when they will, from the very nature of things, receive a more limited service. If the automatic equipment proves to be satisfactory in every way the company may be justified in asking for an additional rate for auto - matic service, although it is being installed there in order to reduce central office expense. The exchanges at Gering and Scottsbluff, as previously stated, arr of the magneto type. The plants at these towns are completely cable/ out the switchboards are old and need to be replaced in the nea\ future. There is a demand on the part of the public for central energy plants and the size of the towns and the character of the country served justifies such a demand. The company has in mind the reconstruction of its plants at these points and proposes to install modern, up-to-date central energy equipment at both points as soon as price conditions justify the expenditure. Indeed, the improvements would have been made before this had not prices of material and labor become so ab - normal. In the opinion of the Commission the company should make the change as soon as conditions will warrant it. It is admitted by Mr. Alexander, president of the company, that the service at the present time is not as good as it should be and that it is impossible to furnish good service with the present equipment. He agrees that the improve - ment proposed is necessary and has 1 plans under way for bringing about that result. With the exception as noted, therefore, the rates as applied for will be approved.

FINDING AND ORDER WILSON, Commissioner: Applicant is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Delaware with an authorized capital of $2,000,000. divided into common stock of $750,000 and preferred stock of $1,250,000. The preferred stock is non-voting but it is preferred to the common stock as to assets in the event of the dissolution of the corporation and as to dividends up ti eight per cent per annum. It is also entitled to share in the profits after eight per cent has been paid upon both the preferred and the common stock up to fifty per cent of such remaining profits. The incorporators of the company are officers of the American State i-ank of Omaha, which bank will lease a portion of the ground floor for its quarters, and the necessity for a permanent home for the bank is given as the reason for retaining the sole right to vote in the com - mon stockholders. This is a sound reason for such preference, and the laws of Delaware permitting the preference, the Commission finds no objection to this provision of the articles of incorporation. Applicant's incorporators have purchased real estate located at the southwest corner of Nineteenth and Farnam streets in the city of Omaha, with a frontage of ninety feet on Farnam and one hundred and thirty-three feet on Nineteenth street, at a cost of $380,000, and intend to erect thereon a twenty-story bank and office building. There is a small building now upon the property which will be wrecked and the material salvaged for the use of the company. It was shown within the district between Sixteenth and Twentieth streets' on Farnam street are located financial institutions with resources of $125,000,000; that there is a great scarcity of business and office facilities in the city of Omaha; that ground floor space within the district rents readily at $4 per square foot per annum, office floor space at $2 per square foot per annum and basement space at $1.50 per square foot per annum, and that the space on four floors of the proposed building has already been spoken for by prospective tenants. The building will be of modern flre-proof construction and equipped with up-to-date appoint - ments throughout. Architects estimate the cost of the building at $1,500,000. Including the cost of the site and the allowance for omis - sions in the architects' estimate a total cost of $2,000,000 may reason - ably be anticipated. It is proposed to finance the cost of the property by an issue of • * aaa A Afi f\f si y npp pnn ♦ hnnHfl ATiri T\Tt*f pitpcI DTiii prim mnn stew* W for </seg>
            <seg id="p344">344 the remainder in the ratio of two shares of preferred to one share of common. The bond issue may be in a somewhat greater amount, in which event the amounts of stock will be correspondingly reduced and the ratio between the preferred and common stock will be as indicated. It is also proposed to gradually retire the bonds out of the earnings of the corporation and for that purpose to set aside out of earnings ap - proximately $50,000 per annum. A statement of the earning capacity of the property is as follows: I The taxes based upon existing assessments against similar proper - are estimated at $20,000 per annum and all of the remaining annual snses at $65,000. This leaves the sum of $263,000 available for the nent of interest and dividends. Given an annual Interest charge of 000 there remains $203,000 for the payment of dividends, or more i twenty per cent per annum upon the stock, both preferred and raon. Assuming that $1,000,000 is issued in stock, two-thirds in pre- Bd and one-third in common, and that $50,000 is set aside annually the purpose of retiring the company's bonds, there yet remains the of $153,000 available for dividends on the stock, or approximately en per cent, assuming that the building is rented to capacity. If bonds are not retired, it is proposed to set aside the same amount per annum to a depreciation reserve fund until the fund amounts to $500,000. The Commission therefore finds that the invest - ment promises a fair return and that the application should be granted, subject to the conditions set forth in the following order. ORDER IT IS ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that a permit issue to the American Bank Building Company of Omaha, Nebraska, to sell its capital securities in such an amount as is neces - sary to the carrying on of its business, but not to exceed $750,000 par value of common stock and $1,250,000 of preferred stock at not less than par, the consideration therefor to be cash, sound securities or property of a fair value, subject to the following conditions: (1) That common stock be sold concurrently with the sale of the preferred stock, in the ratio of not less than one share of common to two shares of preferred. (2) After the payment of interest on indebtedness and dividends on preferred stock there shall be set aside annually from the earnings the turn of $50,000 to a fund for the purpose of either retiring the bonds to such fund or held in trust for the purpose of covering the un - realized depreciation in applicant's property. 8,000 feet of ground floor space (5 M per annum. 52,000 feet of upper floor space @ $2 per annum 8,000 feet of basement floor space @ $1.50 per annum... — * i)L,yy ... 304,00 ... 12,00i Total 348.001 </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4073 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Traction Company for Authority to Issue Certain Trust Notes. FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: On June 26, 1919, this Commission approved the request of the Lin - coln Traction Company for permission to install fifteen single-end safety motor cars on its system. Pursuant to that action the company has purchased of the American Car Company of St. Louis ten such cars at a cost of $4,862.50 each, this being the lowest price submitted by the companies making bids. It now applies to the Commission for authority, under section 75S, Revised Statutes of Nebraska of 1913, to issue its notes to the American Car Company in part payment for this equipment. Under the terms of its contract it will pay the said American Car Company $8,625 in cash and in addition thereto thirty-six other pay - ments, each represented by note of applicant, which said notes shall be and call for the amounts and maturities respectively as follows: One thereof for Thirteen hundred eleven and 11-100 dollars ($1,311.11) maturing in one month.

            <seg id="p348">348 APPLICATION NO. 4076 In the Matter of the Application of the Ashland Electric Light, Mill A Power Com - pany for Authority to Issue Securities. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: tThis applicant operates an electric light plant, serving the city of land and community and securing a major portion of its power from use of the water of Wahoo creek. It has outstanding at the present I $15,000 common stock, issued in 1904. Its bonded debt is $10,000. Iso owes extensive bills payable, due to a building program carried during the present year. It desires to issue at this time $15,000 of common stock as a stock dividend, $10,000 of preferred stock to be sold, and $25,000 of bonds, with the proceeds from the Bale of which to refund the present bonded indebtedness and together with the proceeds from the sales of preferred stock to eliminate the bills and notes payable now outstanding. The history of this corporation is as follows: Flowage and pondage rights, at present enjoyed by applicant, were secured by ad quod damnum proceedings in 1873. The present permanent dam was put in In 1889. The manufacturers of electricity for sale in connection with the operation of a mill was begun in 1890. The milling business was practically abandoned In 1896. The business got into financial entangle - ments to such extent that in 1904 creditors foreclosed and acquired the property at a cost of $18,000, including the cost of proceedings. The present corporation was formed, with approximately the same stock - holders as at present, to take over the business. Stock was issued and paid for in the amount of $15,000 and the creditor bank was paid this amount. The additional cost to creditors was written off as loss. The old mill wag torn down, part of the lumber sold, and part used in the construction of buildings to house the power machinery. A fire occurred in 1907 which burned the power house and wheel pit. This disaster was made the occasion for reconstruction on an improved scale. The $10,000 present bonded indebtedness was incurred at this time. Insurance col - lected and salvage of machinery from the ruined power house enabled the company to escape, according to testimony of officers, with a net loss of approximately $2,000. The liabilities of the cumpany from that date until recently remained at $25 000. I An Inventory of the physical property was taken in 1916 by engi - srs hired by the owners and that inventory, set forth in great detail, a part of the evidence in the case now under consideration. Officers the company testified that this inventory was made on the basis of ginal cost where possible of ascertainment, and on modified 1916 ces where original cost was unobtainable. The Commission's engi - ;r testified that in a number of instances he checked the prices that </seg>
            <seg id="p349">349 were as high as the inflated 1916 prices. The inventory itself shows that the contract price of large machinery units was used. These machinery units were installed in 1907 and form a considerable portion of the in- ventory. Prices of poles were somewhat above the normal. Copper wire was listed at a high price, but a reduction of twenty per cent was made to offset the abnormal price of 1916. The power house built in 1907 was listed nine years 1 later as being in one hundred per cent condi tion. These facts are borne in mind in considering the details ar- rived at. From this inventory the value of the physical property was found to be $35,401.56. The rock dam seventy by sixteen by thirty-five feet wm listed at $5,000, while witnesses for the company say it would take $10,000 to reproduce it. The mill race, head-gates, tail-gates, and sub- sidiary equipment was listed at $4,576, while the company's witnesses testified it would take $8,000 to $10,000 to replace them. The building in the inventory was listed at $2,670. The company's witnesses placed their value at $2,000. The machinery, mostly listed at original cost, was placed at $6,954. The distribution system shows in the in- ventory at $11,754. It is known to be more expensive construction than would be necessary if built now. Stores and supplies were listed at $1,100. Testimony of witnesses was that about $1,000 is now carried in stock. The company testified that since the inventory was made, $2,554 had been expended in betterments. It was shown in the testimony, how- ever, that no allowance was made, generally speaking, for displaced property at the time betterments were installed. Arbitrary allowance being made for displacements by the betterments involved between 1916 and 1919 would place the physical value of the property on the unit prices used by the company at $37,500 in round numbers. New construction, as the result of the 1919 program. Involved the following expenditures, most of which are shown by contracts: New generators, switchboard, and voltage reg - ulator $5,725.00 Two water wheels 3,870.00 Freight and installation of machinery 866.00 Power house for new generators, concrete wheel pit in connection, etc 9,500.00 Hydraulic engineer _ 1,000.00 Total $20,961.00 In addition to this is the change of a single phase generator to three phase $ 850.00 New coils for generator and installation 455.00 Rearrangement of pole lines 2,000.00 Total $ 3,305.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 r mating roughly one-half of this cost as replace - ments and one-half as betterments 1,650.00 Total new construction $22,610.00 Allowance for replacements, as per estimate 3,000.00 Improvements, subject to capitalization.. 119,610.00 Company's estimate of property 37,500.00 Total physical property after building pro- gram is completed $57, 110.00 Total subject to capitalization on this basis. .$62 110.00 Total liabilities set forth in application $65,000.00 The physical property has not been examined by the Commission's engineer with any detail and no report has been made to the Com - mission as a check upon the inventory submitted by applicant and on I prices attached. No reason exists to doubt the accuracy of the in - ory and for the purposes of this case it will not be deemed essen - to make a careful check of present condition as a basis for this rities authorization, if the margin of physical and intangible prop - entitled to be capitalized is sufficiently above the amount asked o create an adequate margin of safety. It is true that the stand-by pment is probably not the most efficient equipment the company 1 have in place, but it is the sort of equipment which would natural - e found where a plant had grown from small proportions through ries of years. The Commssion knows of no reason why investment nits of this 1 kind should not be given full consideration under the l instances. t There remain certain intangible factors in capitalization to be con - ?red. No allowance has been made for the cost of engineering and aniz&amp;tion. The Commission has been accustomed to add ten per t of the cost of physical properties covering these various points, this instance, if the company's inventory is approximately correct, re would be added $3,500 as a preliminary expense. Consideration must be given to the equitable capitalization of the right of flowage enjoyed by this corporation. The record does not dis - close the original cost of the ad quod damnum proceedings in 1873, which were however small, but it does show that this corporation was required to spend $3,500 to defend its property rights in this dam site and attendant rights. These items are, beyond question, subject to be company desires $5,000 additional for an addi- tional oil-burning engine, or for construction of a high tension tranmission line in amount of 5,000.0 </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 351 But is applicant to be confined to a capitalization of the actual cost of these rights? They could not be secured again at any price. The company's rights to the use of the water power of Wahoo creek at this point have been established for such indeterminate period as the users shall continue to employ the waters for public service. It has been frequently contended, and some courts have held, that the measure of the value of a water power shall be the capitalization of the net return measured by the difference in the cost of the output, as manufactured by steam power, and the cost of the output as manu - factured by water power. Applicant's engineers declared that the cost of generating current by the modern equipment, now complete, will be about two cents per K. W. H., whereas the minimum cost if made by steam will be four cents per K. W. H. If the principle is sound that the difference in this cost laid on the full output shall be the measure for capitalization, the water right is extremely valuable, for the output is now in the neighborhood of 20,000 K. W. H. per month. Various objections to such a measure immediately present them - selves, among them: (a) The measure would shrink or expand, according to the vary ing cost of fuel. (b) The public secures no reward for having loaned its powers of eminent domain to the utility which seeks to obstruct the stream and over the protest of riparian proprietors, to flood their lands. It is not deemed necessary in passing upon this application, to go extensively into the complicated question of ownership of running waters and the rights to the use of the water by any one in pos - session of the right of flowage and the right to construct a dam Our court has said that a riparian owner has a right to the use of the flow of the stream passing through or by his land, that it is a right inseparably attached to the soil, and that it is not an easement but a property right. (Crawford vs. Hathaway, 67 Neb. 328). In the same case, however, the court indicated that this natural flow, which is part and parcel of the land, is such as would insure use for domestic pur - poses in a manner not greatly impeding its flow. By statute the state has. ?.t various times, indicated its purpose to retain an interest in flowing streams. It does not allow the construc - tion of dams across* running streams, nor use of waters for irrigation without the consent of the state. Hence it would appear that in such a use of the waters as is now being considered, the public retains an interest. The interest acquired against adverse riparian proprietors is equivalent to a right of way. It is- contended by no one that the proper Emre of the value of the right of way of a common carrier is the rence in the cost of service over such common carrier's property the cost of similar service by any substitute means of transports- </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 I The successful derelopment of water power at any particular loca - i is always speculative. If the investor is to secure from such de - &gt;pment, the right to earn only on the cost of the project, he will ter to utilize steam power where the table of experience shows accu - »ly the results to be obtained. Money would not be put into water r er development and the public would be deprived of the advantages a such development by private capital. On the other hand, if the lie is to gain no advantage by way of reduced price for the products irater power, it will hive no reason to assign the use of its power eminent domain, a necessary power where any. extensive water r er development is to be secured. These conclusions lead the Commission to the opinion that the value for capital purposes of a water power, exclusive of the artificial units involved, lies somewhere between: (a) The measure of the difference in the cost of the production by water power and by steam power in the same locality, and (b) The actual cost of securing the right to construct the dam project and to flow the riparian lands of other people. I In the cate under consideration, the value of this water power for ital purposes need not be closely ascertained. If the value of sical properties, and intangibles heretofore mentioned, are taken at present worth as found by the company's engineers, and submitted evidence, no value in the water rights is necessary to make the ftts equal the liabilities proposed. If the assumption is used that the ipany's engineers were too liberal in their unit prices, the addition i reasonable value of the water power and rights attached will offset Erp reduction in the present worth of the physical properties. It rs that the company is entitled to the full measure of its appli- Other methods are available to check this conclusion. The com - pany invested $15,000 in 1904 in these properties and in 1907 assessed the stockholders twenty-five per cent. Simple interest on this invest - ment through the years when no dividends were paid and all net earn - ings went back into property would, together with the actual cash in - verted during 1919, indicate a sacrifice of investors well in advance of the stotV. dividend proposed. The books of the company show that there was earned since 1905 $25,529, none of which was paid out in dividends. The books also show a careful account of betterments and additions since the requisition of the property and a total expenditure of $21,837 up to the point when the final $20,000 was invested. This, to - gether with the original cost and the recent expenditures, would indi - cate a value only slightly under the capital liabilities requested. t Certain corrections to title should be made, as indicated by the at- By general to applicant's counsel, before the issuance of the common Ic dividend. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4083 In the Matter of the Application of the Dlller Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rate*. Appearances: For Applicant — E. L. Loock, Pres.; F. E. Hale. Treas OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates exchanges at Dlller, Harbine and Linham. with 528 subscribers on the three exchanges combined, divided into 46 business, 92 residence and 390 rural. The town service at Diller and Harbine is on metallic lines and approximately one-third of the farm line service is metallic. Applicant's rates for many years past have been, for town service and farm grounded $12.00 gross, $11.00 net, for farm line metallic serv- </seg>
            <seg id="p354">354 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT ice 113.20 gross, $12.00 net. The net rates are charged where paid annually in advance The company prays authority to publish gross and net rates as Net rates to be charged where bills for town service are paid on or before the 10th of the month in which the service is rendered and on farm service where paid quarterly in advance during the first month of the quarter. A further discount of $1.00 per annum to be given where bills are paid annually in advance. Hearing on the application of this company was held at Lincoln on October 3rd, at which no protestants appeared although notices nad been sent to respective citizens in the territory affected. The story told by witnesses for the company is the usual one of increasing costs of labor and material, the inability on the part of the company to take care of current maintenance under existing conditions, and anxiety as to the future of the property in the light of evident rapid depreciation. All the evidence points to most economical and careful operation of the properties by the officers and they are to be commended for the results obtained. The community served has been mofct fortunate in securing service of so good a quality through the years past at a rate below the normal rates for similar classes of service throughout the state. The company has $19,000 of stock outstanding, all paid for in cash at par. The history of the company shows that during the first seven years of its existence, dividends were paid to the stockholders averag - ing 9 per cent, but during this period all officers donated their work with the exception of one year, when a total of $150 in salaries was paid. In the light of the fact that these services were donated, the company electing to give the advantage of such generosity to the stock - holders' as a whole, the dividends paid were not excessive. Since 1907 modest salaries have been paid to officers and dividends averaging T'-j per cent have been paid. In the years 1907, 190S and 1909 more than normal dividends were paid. This was a prosperous period, and, as the officers testified, they had not yet learned of the persistent but hidden approaches of deferred maintenance. The full force of hidden deteriora - tion in plant was not appreciated until the last two or three years, hence the anxiety on the part of the officers. Offsetting the higher divi - dends mentioned above, the company paid only 5 per cent as earned in 1917 and 1918 with prospects of paying none in 1919. The temptation to pay some dividends was too great to be resisted, although during these two years when 5 per cent was paid no dividends should have been declared, for the company was not taking care of its depreciation.

            <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 355 Testimony shows that for almost tea years no new poles and wire were purchased and no fund was set aside to care for replacements nor during this period did the company expand to any considerable extent. No valuation of the properties of the company has been made by the Commission but for this purpose, the original cost of all the prop - erties of the company is estimated at $30,000. This figure is subject to correction upon inventory by the Commission's engineers. There can be no question that the company has built a considerable amount of property out of the rates and in doing so has borrowed the replace - ment fund in order to meet the demand for extensions rather than to secure the funds for such extension by additional sales of stock. An extensive rebuilding program is planned and is undoubtedly necessary. In the testimony, officers of the company desirnd the rates increased to a point where funds could be secured therefrom for rebuilding over o - id above a normal replacement rate. This the Commission does not think proper. The company has used its surplus funds for extensions and should at this time make every effort to dispose of a reasonable amount of additional stock and to use the funds derived therefrom in its rebuilding program. This in no sense depreciates the value of the stock, but merely corrects an error of the past. Rates' allowed will be sufficient to pay a reasonable dividend on any such stock. Witnesses for the company were carefully examined as to the rate of return necessary in order to dispose of additional stock and the weight of testimony was that a reasonable amount or such slock could be sold on a 7 per cent basis, if stockholders were assured of that re - turn. The company has paid better than 7 per cent in the past. The Commission purposes that its earnings shall be sufficient to pay that much in the future and to prevent deterioration of the properties. Rates granted will take care of current maintenance and other ex - penses and normal depreciation. The abnormal building program of the company must be cared for by an infusion of additional capital. It is suggested that th,- company make application for authority to sell some additional stock and to proceed at once *o find a market therefor. Present revenues 1 of the company approximate $6,400 per annum. This is almost $2,000 per year below the necessities of present condi - tions. The Commission believes that 10 per cent per annum on the original cost of properties is sufficient to care for current maintenance and normal depreciation. For the pres«nt, that figure is $3,000 per annum for applicant. The company will be required in this order to set aside that amount of money for current maintenance and normal depreciation reserve. Out of this fund the company shall pay that por - tion of the lineman's salary properly belonging to current repair and normal replacement work, extra help used for the same purposes, the Costs of all materials for current repairs and for normal replacement*, </seg>
            <seg id="p356">356 Eling the batteries, all freight and express on materials, automobile se and depreciation on the vehicle. From this fund shall not be the excess expenditures of the rebuilding program, which, it has pointed out, should be cared for by additional capital. From the company's 1 testimony, it is estimated that the cost of operators, fuel, light, rent, postage, stationery, blank books, Insurance and incidentals will cost approximately $2,200 per annum. The company now pays $225 to its officers. Additional bookkeeping required by the uniform system of accounting would warrant paying the officer, who has charge of such books, an additional compensation of $15 or $20 per month. It is estimated that the general expenses, made up of officers' salaries, that portion of the lineman's wages devoted to general duties, bookkeeping, and collecting, legal expense, traveling expense, and taxes, will cost the company $1,000 more per annum. Dividends on the pres - ent Etock at 7 per cent will amount to $1,530 per annum. The Commis - sion will also allow a contingent fund per annum of $400 to cover any changes in wages made necessary, any other operating expenses not now foreseen and dividends on any additional stock that may be sold within the next year. It Is thus estimated that the reasonable requirements of this com - pany per annum under existing high cost will be $8,150, Including a normal depreciation reserve, which ordinarily would not be spent, but would be held until needed. Very likely the company will expend such depreciation reserve temporarily during its rebuilding program. tThe rates asked for will earn the company $7,S58 per annum as a [Imum. If the additional discount for payment one year In advance tot given, the maximum earnings will be slightly under $8,400 with allowance for bad accounts. The testimony is that bad accounts not numerous, although frequently payments of rentals are long The order will provide for the rates prayed for with the exception of the additional discount for payment one year in advance.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4087 In the Matter of the Application of the Wakefleld Electric Company for Valida - tion of an Issue of Stock. Appearances : Thomas Rawlings, President. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: In the latter part of 1918 a group of citizens of Wakefleld organ - ized for the purpose of acquiring the electric property of the Nebraska Gas &amp; Electric Company at Wakefield. Investigation by the Commission disclosed that the company had, through erroneous advice of counsel, proceeded to dispose of stock in the amount of $17,000 to secure funds to purchase the plant and repair it and that this stock was issued with - out authority of law. That investigation convinced the Commission that the officers of the company had no intention of ignoring or violating the law and instructions were therefore issued to the company to justify the issue of stock for the purpose of the issuance, if justification were furnished, of a nunc pro tune order. The purchasers paid $13,119.70 for the property and as per state - ments made by President Rawlings as of November 1, 1919, had spent in replacements and repairs other than current, $16,174.58, including the purchase price. It had on that date a balance of $855.74 in capital account. President Rawlings 1 testified that careful effort had been made to pay from the capital account only those items which could properly be classified as capital charges. The questioning of the Commission at the time of the hearing confirmed this statement insofar as it was pos - sible to do so without checking the accounts. </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT Inventory of the property by the Commission's engineers as of Sep - tember 11, showed an original cost of the properties purchased of I18.S97.52 and a present worth based on original cost, Including repairs made by new owners up to that date of $13,030.55. Statement of th3 company furnished at that time showed an investment by the new stock - holders of $15,198. Reasonable allowance being made for the channel unit price conditions, the Commission finds that the investment by ap - plicants fairly represents the property purchased. This plant has been built up slowly and piece-meal. In its central station it has 1 three engines and three generators installed from time to time. It is a direct current plant and because of that tha investment in the distribution system is high. In the judgment of the Commis - sion's engineers it cannot be operated economically. Very likely with - in a very few years the owners will feel it incumbent to re-construct the entire plant. At that time much of the present property will have to be discarded and disposed of as Junk or second-hand material. The problem of financing such an undertaking will not be simple, but the Commission is not concerned at this time with that problem. Th* issue of stock at present outstanding will be validated. A reserve should be created in anticipation of the rebuilding pro - gram necessary some time in the future. More than an ordinary main - tenance and depreciation reserve should therefore be set aside to cover an unusual obsolscent situation. The order will provide for this. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Enission that the illegal Issuance of $17,000 of stock by the Wake- Electric Company in the fall of 1918, said stock being of par value per share and having been sold for cash at par without commls - , be and it hereby is validated. It is further ordered that 8 per cent of the original cost found by the Commission's engineers, namely $18,397, plus any betterment values of the future, shall be set aside annually, out of which all current main - tenance charges shall be paid, and all proper replacements. Any sur - plus shall be carried to meet unusual replacements of the future and to create a fund to aid in the reconstruction into a modern plant some time in the future.

            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 359 APPLICATION NO. 4096 In the Matter of the Application of The Lincoln Traction Company for an Order Increasing Its Appropriation for Main - tenance and Depreciation. BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on (or consideration on an application of the Lincoln Traction Company, to amend the order of the Commission entered September 1st, 1918, in Application No. 3667, wherein the Com - mission directed the applicant to set aside annually from its operating income 6 per cent of $2 224,000, representing the depreciable railway property of the applicant company. The applicant now asks the au - thority of the Commission to increase the annual percentage from 6 per cent to 7 per cent. In support of their application the company shows that for the seven-month period January 1st, 1919, to July 31st, 1919, the total amount deducted from operating revenues on the 6 per cent basis, as ordered by the Commission, totals $77,840. and that of the sum just named there was actually expended $70,239.32. The Com - mission has directed the accounting department to make a study of the monthly reports as filed with the Commission by the applicant, re - garding the question of maintenance and depreciation credits and charges for the year 1919, with the following results: The accounting department's reports show that for the period of eight months January to August inclusive, the total charges to operat - ing revenues for maintenance and depreciation under the Commission's order on the 6 per cent basis, totals $88,960. that of the sum just mentioned there has been actually expended for the eight months for the different component parts of the company's railway property, the following sum: 8 months 1919 Roadway and track $20,064.44 Recently the Commission authorized the applicant to purchase and operate ten Birney Safety cars on the company's lines which has made it possible for the company to retire a number of obsolete and ineffi - cient cars, eight in number. The records of the company show that the eight cars which will be dismantled total $31,152.00. The amount just named would be a proper charge against depreciation reserve.

            <seg id="p360">360 with the Commission the balance sheet as of August 31st, 1919, shows that In the railway department there is a net balance in the deprecia - tion reserve fund of $48,712.21, which has been accumulated since July 1st, 1912. The statement here made appears to show that at the pres - ent time the reserve for maintenance and depreciation of the railway property of the applicant company is hardly sufficient to properly pro - tect the property under the present high costs. The increased cost of labor and material has materially increased since the war and appears to justify an increase in the percentage al - lowance for maintenance and depreciation. In view of the recent order entered by the Commission relative to the payment of dividends and the requirement that the company should keep in liquid form deprecia - tion reserves, it appears to the Commission that the interest of all parties will be better protected by the requirement of an increased per - centage in the annual maintenance and depreciation charges against operating revenues. From all of the facts shown in the application and the reports on file in the office of the Commission, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that that portion of the order entered by the Commission in Application No. 3667, dated September 1st, 1918, regarding the percentage of maintenance and depreciation to be charged against the revenues should be increased to 7 per cent. IThe company in its petition makes application that 7 per cent be irged against the operating revenues 1 beginning January 1st, 1919. In w of the fact that practically all of the money set aside for main - lance and depreciation from the operating revenues has been ex - lded on the 6 per cent basis, the Commission is of the opinion and finds that the 7 per cent herein found reasonable should be set up the company's accounts commencing January 1st, 1919. The question of permanent rates, physical valuation of the entire properties of the Lincoln Traction Company, and capitalized matters, are now pending before the Commission, a hearing will be held at some future date later to be fixed by the Commission at which time all of these matters will be fully considered; under these circumstances- the Commission is of the opinion that it is not necessary to hold a hearing at this time on the application herein considered. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that paragraph No. 4 of the order entered by the Commis - sion In Application No. 3667, dated September 1st, 1918, reading as "(4) Commencing September 1, 1918, the company shall set aside out of its operating income monthly for maintenance and de - preciation one-half of one per cent, making a total of six per cent per annum, on the following amounts: </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4097 In the Matter of the Alvo Telephone Com - pany for Validation of Present Rates. Appearances : For Applicant — A. B. Stroemer, Mgr.; F. M. Prouty, Pres. Com- munity Club. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: For approximately a year this company has been charging $2.00 month for business service and $1.50 a month for residence and farm service, which rate has been without the authorization of the Commis- sion, the legal rates being $1.00 per month for each class of service. The Commission cited the officers of the company to appear in Its offices and show cause why criminal proceedings should not be insti- tuted to collect the penalties provided by law tor violation of the Railway Commission act. </seg>
            <seg id="p362">362 The company made a showing informally through its officers. In brief, the rate was changed at a conference between the owner of the company and the Alvo Community club after an investigation which convinced the latter organization that the company must have more money. The owner of the company had subsequently died and the ad - ministrator was not able to say whether the owner had any knowledge of the existence of the Railway Commission act. This cannot be an excuse in law, but the Commission is reluctant to inflict the heavy penalties of the Railway Commission act upon common carriers for un - intentional violation. There had been no correspondcence between ap - plicants and the Commission by which a warning might have been re - ceived as to possible difficulties. (As a result of the conference, the Commission directed the com - y to file an application and to make a showing as to results of the ration of its 1 company under the higher rates and for the purpose of [dating the rates, If it should prove that the amount collected was excessive. This hearing was held in the office of the Commission October 31. 1919. I This company was organized in 1905 by six residents of Alvo, each rhom put in $300 in cash. From this capital and from $1 200 owed, the original plant was constructed. It was- operated until :h, 1911, no dividends being paid and all surplus earned, if there any, going into the property. The records of this period are not lable. J. Herman Stroemer purchased the property for $3,000 and med the indebtedness. The original builders, therefore, secured return of $1,200 on an investment of $1,800 for the period of si\ %. This is something more than a normal return would Justify for the purposes of this case it would be assumed that the pur - er paid that much in excess of a proper value of the plant. He operated the system at the $1.00 rates on file with the Commis. aion until the fall cf 1918 and so far as any records in the hands of ihe administrator show, never received any dividends on the $3,000 of stock in his possession. This is not conclusive evidence, as the records were manifestly poorly kept. If he did not secure a dividend over and above his wages as active manager, then any such dividends earned went into the property. In 1917 the owner received an inherit - ance of $2,117 and the testimony shows that this went into improve - ments and replacements to the plant, which plant he had bought in a depreciated condition. The administrator testified that the checks drawn against the account showed that none of it was us-ed to pay operating expenses. After the owner's death, the widow put $1,800 of insurance money into the company as working capital, this being neces - sary to offset outstanding bills receivable in approximately that amount, Witness Stroemer introduced an exhibit covering a year's business under the illegal rates, showing receipts and disbursements as followi: </seg>

The statement is subject to some scrutiny for the reason that there was no such item as $432 depreciation, that being more than a proper reserve to set up. Maintenance items were in- cluded in the expense account in other places. The company is not en- titled to a return on $7,000 on the present showing for the reason that part of the assets said to total that amount represents bills payable of $1,600 on which interest is paid. Reconstructing the statement of expenditures in the light of the testimony we have: Maintenance and depreciation on estimated original cost of $7,000 ft 12% $840.00 In explanation of the above items the $840 for maintenance and re- serve should cover half the pay of the lineman and bookkeeper, the Toll commissions 182.24 Total $3,068.24 EXPENSES Operators $840.00 Lineman and bookkeeper 480.00 Maintenance and depreciation @ 9% 432.00 Fuel and light 58.40 Rent 84.00 Taxes '. 50.00 Instrument rental 75.00 Interest on $1,800 („ 8% 144.00 Batteries 370.50 Supplies 50.00 Operators 840.00 Fuel and light 60.00 Rent 84.00 Rent on instruments 75.00 Stationery, blank bocks, etc 65.00 Incidentals including insurance 60.00 Bookkeeping and collecting 240.00 Taxes 50.00 Interest for six months on $1,764 (a 7% 61.74 Dividends on $5,100 @ 8% 408.00 Total estimated expenditures Total receipts from proposed rates $2,783.74 3,068.00 Net balance $ 284.26 </seg>

It does not cover investments in new extensions or actual betterments. The $1,764 borrowed is made necessary by the outstand - ing accounts. These accounts should all be collected within one year, as It Is poor policy to allow the patrons to become indebted in any such manner. As fast as this money is collected, the debt of $1,800 can be paid and an interest charge as allowed should cover the use of the money for the necessary period. If it is desired then, on the part of the former owner's widow, to invest the money in the plant for needed betterments, the Commission will authorize an issue of stock to cover and this stock can then earn the regular dividend rate. Margin of earnings will cover the possibility. Dividends are allowable on the original $3,000 plus the $2,100 later put in. The Commission will not consider 8 per cent excessive, which will represent a proper return on money invested in a public utility In that part of the state and a Just recognition of evident economies of operation particularly in labor costs in the immediate case under con - sideration.

The showing made by the company does not warrant the assumption that an injustice has been done to patrons during the year the illegal rates were charged and they will be validated in this order. Future rates will be as set forth below.

Appearances For Applicant — Alvin Blessing, Pres. ; O. P. Bailey, Sec'y. For Ord Independent Telephone Co. — C. A. Davis, Atty; C. J. Mor - tensen, Sec'y. OPINION' AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: There are two telephone companies at Ord, the Farmers Mutual Telephone Company (hereafter referred to as the Farmers Mutual), and the Ord Independent Telephone Company (hereafter referred to as the Independent). The latter company has an exchange at Ord, with certain farm lines, and an exchange at Burwell. It serves a total of 60 1 subscribers. The Farmers Mutual owns only the town system at Ord, which serves 421 subscribers. In addition, it switches 642 farmers- who own and maintain their lines. Competition has existed between these companies since cbout 1906 when the Farmers Mutual was organized. The Independent Company had been in the field for three or four years prior to that time. I Following extended negotiations, authorized representatives of the companies entered Into an agreement on August 13, 1919, thereby Farmers Mutual is to purchase the property of the other company price to be fixed by this Commission. Upon this application being , and notice thereof being given of the pending negotiations, the neers of the Commission made a valuation of the property in - ed and the matter now arises on the application of tVe Farmers ual for authority to make the consolidation and issue stock suffl - t to pay the purchase price. A hearing was had at Ord, at which valuation of the engineers was received, and evidence taken as to condition of the properties and the wisdom of effecting a consolida- IThe engineers reported a value of the Independent property on the Is of original cost of $33,853.16. and a present or depreciated value 115,121.03. The Independent plant was originally well-built, but, due the competitive situation, has been allowed to run down. For the t five or six years, the plant has been operated under a lease where - the lessee paid $150 per month to the company for the use of the perty, this amount being net to the company. The property has nged hands a number of times since its organization and at present lajority of the stock is owned by August Jaedicke, Jr., a resident of </seg>
            <seg id="p367">367 Kansas. The company has outstanding at present $37,150 of common stock and $39,115 of preferred stock, all of which has a par value of $10 per share. It is admitted by the secretary of the company that the common stock was issued . without consideration and has never been regarded as having any value. The record does not disclose whether the preferred stock was paid for at par, and the numerous transfers? of the property make it impossible to determine the actual investment. Since the hearing, the Commission has been advised that the present or depreciated value of $15,121.03, as found by the engi - neers, is acceptable to the owners of the property as a consideration for its sale to the Farmers Mutual. It is conceded by all concerned that the business is a losing propo - sition as at present operated and that the future holds no promise of improvement. It is certain the plant is in poor condition and will re - quire the expenditure of a large sum of money for replacements if proper service is to be furnished. It is equally obvious if the people of Ord and vicinity are to have good telephone service there must be a consolidation of the two plants. The Farmers Mutual plant is likewise in a run-down condition and needs extensive replacements. Neither company can proceed with an adequate rebuilding program while the competitive situation continues. There will be some loss from duplication through the consolidation. It is estimated that there are approximately 120 duplicate telephones in Ord, which return a revenue at the present time of about $200 per month. A considerable portion of the Independent plant can be utilized by the Farmers Mutual in the consolidation. Such loss as must inevit - ably follow the elimination of duplicate and unnecessary facilities must be borne Jointly by the public and the company. The operation of the plant at a loss for several years and the acceptance of a price material - ly less than the original investment represents the company's portion of this loss, while the capitalization of property now to be discarded by consolidation is the price the public will have to pay for any benefits it may have received from competition in the pasi and from a unified plant in the future. Under all the circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that $15,121.03 represents the reasonable fair value of the property now owned by the Ord Independent Telephone Company and that the said company should be authorized to receive and the Farmers Mutual Telephone Company to pay such price for said property. We are of the further opinion that the consolidation of the two plants, as planned, will be for the best interests of the telephone users and of the public and should be approved, subject to conditions. As one of the conditions ot Its application for permission to effect this consolidation, the Farmers Mutual asks authority to issue its com - mon stock in the amount of the purchase price. Its application was later amended to provide for an issue of $20,000. The reason given for </seg>
            <seg id="p368">368 the increased issue Is that a large amount of rebuilding is necessary and that the company has no depreciation reserve from which to de - fray such expense. It is also urged that a commission of 10 per cent should be allowed for the sale of the stock and the total issue should be large enough to cover this allowance. I in Application No. 3509. approved June 24, 1919, we authorized the nee by this company of $9,350 of common stock to cover dividends Bd In the past, but not paid. This addition to the capital stock ght the total up to $18,700. In connection with that application, a ition of the physical property of the company was made by the mission, which showed an original cost of $22,399.71, and a depre - d value of $14,483.12. As stated In our opinion in that case the nal cost, as thus found, corresponded closely to the plant value as n by the books of the company. The record further showed in case that the company had been economically managed and had no dividends. The combined original cost of the two properties is $56,252.87. The present, or depreciated value is $29,804.15. As stated, there will be a loss through consolidation. To what extent, it is impossible to deter - mine at this time. The management of the Farmers Mutual has made only tentative studies, but has concluded to use that plant as tbe basis for the merger. They expect to make extensive improvements and are looking forward to the installation of a metallic, central energy system within three or four years. The Burwell exchange, which is being ac - quired through the purchase, will probably be sold to a competing com - pany, although that has not been definitely settled. In the event it is sold, it is the plan, subject to the approval of the Commission, to utilise the money realized from the sale in the improvement of the plant at Ord. As previously stated, the Fanners Mutual owns no farm lines at present. It will acquire certain farm property as part of the Independent plant. Tills it plans also to sell to the farmers served. If it can be arranged, the money thus derived to be used In the same manner. I If an issue of $20,000 of stock is approved at this time, applicant have authorized a total of $38,700. The difference between the e to be paid for the Independent plant and the $20,1*00 asked for, ., $4,879, is to be used to reimburse the depreciation reserve and to a commission of 10 per cent for the sale of the stock. There can io question about the need for extensive replacements in both prop - 's. The requirements of the service demand such improvements, reserve has been accumulated for this property, the revenues not ng been sufficient. It would be unwise now, however, and ineqult- M between present subscribers and those receiving service in the , to raise the rates to a point where the depreciation reserve could ully restored. If a reasonable amount of stock can be sold and the eeds used for replacements, It would appear the wise thing to do, </seg>
            <seg id="p369">369 provided the total outstanding capital isr kept well within the original cost of the consolidated plant. It is probable that $38,700 will exceed the present value of the consolidated plant. By how much, there are no means of ascertaining at this time. The difference between tne fair value of the plant and the outstanding capital may ultimately have to be absorbed through a process of amortization, and the Commission will make that a condition of its approval. We are of the opinion, however, that the time is not propitious 1 for the application of such a plan. In the first place, the consolidation of the plants and the require - ments of the public service present an emergency situation that de - mands prompt and certain action. To a certain extent, what the com - pany ought to do is limited by what it can do. In the second place, the present high costs of operation make it inadvisable to add to the rate payers' burden any elements of expense that may more easily be borne when normal conditions are restored. There appears to be no good reason for allowing at this time a commission of ten per cent for the sale of the securities herein ap - proved. The manager of the company now receives a salary of $1,800 per year and other officers a total of $1,400 per year. These officers should be able to dispose of this comparatively small amount of stock without difficulty. The enterprise is a local concern in which the public has a lively interest. The prospects for improved service and a modern plant offers 1 to a progressive community an inducement for in - vestment in the stock almost equal to the prospects of a good raturn. The telephone situation, as it exists at Ord, calls for the expenditure of every dollar for maintenance and improvements which this company can muster. The $2,000, which is thus asked as a commission. Is re - quired In its entirety for the purposes of the company. We are of the opinion, therefore, that this allowance should not be approved. For the reasons stated, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds 1 that an issue of $20,000 of common stock is reasonably required by the applicant at this time and should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Farmers Mutual Telephone Company be and the same is hereby authorized to purchase the prop - erty of the Ord Independent Telephone Company at a price not to ex - ceed $15,121.03, and merge the two plants at Ord in one unified system.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant is a corporation, duly organized under the laws of Ne - branka on October 25, 1919, with an authorized capitalization of $5,000. divided into one hundred shares, par value $50 per share. The purpose of the corporation is to build, operate, and maintain telephone prop - erties in the village of Bushnell and surrounding territory. There exists in the town of Bushnell the remains of a small telephone system which it is the purpose of applicant to take over as a nucleus for a re - construction program, the objective of which is a telephone system com - mensurate with the importance of the town. J Applicant has submitted an inventory of the property which will be uired. present prices of which are found by the Commission's engi - iring department to total approximately $1,000. The inventory sub - ted by applicant has prices attached, but if these are the prices posed to be paid it is not stated. The company should be careful pay no more for this property than its present condition warrants, &gt;ed on new values of $1,000. If the company finds it necessary at i time to install a new switchboard, it should pay no more for the board than its salvage value. The remainder of the stock which may be sold is for the purpose of installing a new switchboard and the carrying out of an extensive reconstruction program. Such use of capital is not to be criticised when the purchases are made at greatly reduced prices, In such in - stances repairs are proper capital charges. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4137 In the Matter of the Application of the Sutherland-Fairview Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rate*. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant herf-in is a rural company, serving a scattered territory and paying switching charges to the Sutherland Telephone Company. In October, 1918, on showing made, it was authorized to increase Its rates to $18.00 per annum. This service is grounded, but the rate was made necessary by the fact that there is an average of over jl mile of pole line to each subscriber. Since that date the Sutherland Telephone Company has been au - thorized to increase switching charges fifteen cents per month p' r sta - tion and this company has that added expense not contemplated at the time of the previous rate order. It desires an increase of tv/cnty-flve cents per month to cover the additional cost of switching and the addi - tional ccst of materials and labor. The application appears reasonable and will be allowed. </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 The company will be required to keep account of its earnings and expenditures more completely than it has in the past and at the end of three months and six months to make a special report to the Commis - sion showing all earnings and in detail the expenditures in the svstem. Failure on the part of the company to make these reports will subject It, on the order of the Commission, to return to previous rates. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Sutherland-Fairview Telephone Company be, and it hereby is authorized, effective January 1, 1920. to publish and collect a rate of $1.75 per month per station for telephone service, provided ■aid company shall at the end of three months and at the end of six months make a quarterly report of all earnings and disbursements of the funds collected in detail. tMade and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 6th day of Decem - 1919.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4140 I the Matter of the Application of the nlted Electric Company for Authority to •ue and Sell Preferred Stock. Appearances: Powell &amp; Wilson for applicant. No remonstrators. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: tThis applicant operates electric light plants at Lexington, Overton, id and Elm Creek, with central generating power plant a' Lexlng- Nfcbraska, and transmission lines radiating to the other points ed. It desires to have approved issuance and sale of $100,000 of erred stock, par value $100 per share, $60,000 to be used to retire payable incurred in the extension of the plant, and $40,000 to be in th* treasury, or to be sold for the Durpose of securing funds wli'ch to add other properties to the system iu occasion may arise. In 3 900 applicant company began business as *he Lexington Mill &amp; Kler-itor Company, with $50,000 paid-up capital or common stock, an! with authority in Its articles of incorporation to conduct a general grain and elevator business and to lease and operate electric light plants. On March 30, 1917, section three of these articles was amended to increase the authorized capitalization to $100,000 of common stock, and </seg>
            <seg id="p373">373 •hcrtly thereafter $50,000 additional stock was sold. On October '-'9, 1917, section one of the articles was xmended to change the name of the company to United Electric Company. At approximately the same time a new corporation war formed to take over the mill and elevator business. Subsequent thereto and following the change of name, the stock was apparently called in and new stock issued under the name of the United Electric Company. In November. 1919 ext :is1vely amended articles were filed by the United Electric Company authorizing sale of preferred stock in the amount of 1100,000 and enlarging the powers of the corporation to do a public utility business. In support of its application to sell preferred stock, the company filed an inventory made by a reputable firm of engineers of Chicago, showing in great de - tail the quantities of property owned by the corporation. Using price* as of August, 1919. the engineers reached the conclusion that the re - production value of the property was $217,755.16, and that Mi present depreciated value, based on the same unit prices, was $191,629.39. The testimony of the Commission's engineer, after a fairly careful check of the company engineer's valuation, was to the effect that the prices used in arriving at reproduction new value of the plant were at least 160 per cent of normal prices, and that if stock were Issued on such valuation the company would have securities outstanding, in the Judgment of the witness, at any time when prices again approached normal, in excess of the value ot the properties. The Commission has not checked the property in place to ascertain its present condition and, hence, needs corroborative evidence as to values. The application indicates that the full amount of the common stock was paid for in cash, but at the time the common stock was issued, valuable mill and elevator properties were included in the holdings of the corporation. These have disappeared from the inventories ai.d there has been no shrinking in the liabilities outstanding. Before this case can be finally disposed of, further information will be necessary as to the history of the operations of the company. Exhibits filed indicate a growing business. Total receipts in the year 1916-1917, September 1 to September 1, were $31,140 on the sale of current, excluding sale to the mill properties which began to be re - corded at that time. Gross receipts in the fiscal year 1918-19:9 were $43,411, excluding sales to mill. In the fiscal year 1918-1919, total re - ceipts, including sales to the mill, were $65,200.61, and the expenses. Including interest on $40,000 of bills payable, were $51,701.03. Net earn - ings were, therefore, $13,498.58. The preferred stock under consideration is seven per cent cumu - lative voting stock, preferred as to earnings and assets. It &lt;r amply protected, both as to property and as to earnings, and has been author - ised with the full consent of all owners of common stock. It is a legiti - mate transaction and good business to convert short-time bills payable drawing eight per cent into seven per cent stock, thereby reducing the </seg>

The of $60,000 of preferred stock, from the proceeds of which to con - bills payable, will, therefore, be authorized. This company, however, operated many years, toing a public utility business, but with no separation of assets as between mill ant 1 elevator properties and public utilities properties. In the judgment of the Com - mission its securities issues, following the enactment of article 18, R. S. 1913, were subject to supervision of this Commission. No such supervision hag taken place as to the $50,000 of stocK issued and sold in the spring of 1917. Without doubt such stock is illegal and its exist - ence not only embarrasses its holders, bui subjects the officers of the corporation to difficulties. Applicant will, therefore, proceed with reasonable dispatch to cor - rect its past proceedings to conform with the law regarding the Issuance of public utiUty securities and to make full showing before the Com - mission by application on or before the 15th day of February J!»i0. At that time the Commission will go more fully into the question of a fair value of the properties' as a ba*is for the issuance of securities :ind will inquire as to the actual investments made in the property be;nre the segregation of the mill and elevatoi portions, and intn the question of the adjustment of the liabilities as a result of such segregation of a portion of the former assets of the corporation and its predecessor, the Lexington Mill &amp; Elevator Company. No question is raised at this time as to the integrity of the man - agement of the company and no intimation of wilful intent to violate the law. The public utility portions of the property have developed rapidly and apparently under careful management -' is to the best interests of the holders of the common stock and certainly a in&gt;ressary and proper proceeding urder the law that the corporation set i r s house in order. We come now to that portion of the application relative to the issuance and sale of $40,000 of additional preferred stock, to be used tor corporate purposes in extending and improving electric lighting facilities as occasion arises. It is undoubtedly true t.iat this corpora - tion must seek a market as the market offers, and that it is advan - tageous to have treasury stock for sale from time to iime and 'o have the cash available with which to make purchases of additional proper- However, it does not appear that under the provisions of a-tfele 18, R. S. 1913, according to which this application is made, the Commission it warranted in authorizing a large block of treasury stock fur indefi - nite future use. That law provides that securities may be sold by public utilities "when necessary for the acquisition of property, the con - ftroction, completion, extension or improvement of facilites. or for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge or law - ful refunding of its obligation!"

It is further made the duty of the Commission in reaching its conclusion to "make such in - quiry ov investigation, hold such hearings and examine such witnesses, books, papers, documents or contracts as it may deem of importance In enabling it to reach a determination." It is the practice of the Commission when public utilities' :&gt;sk au - thority to issue securities for the purpose of constructing new proper - ties to inquire into the details of the proposed construction, examine specifications and th? estimates of cost, and arrive at a conclusion that the issues are reasonably necessary. It is equally necessary that it make investigation as to the value of the properties :o be acquired by purchase, if such purchase is to be made by the sale of securities or other evidences of indebtedness. It will, therefore, be necessary to deny temporarily that portion of the application regarding the issuance of $40,000 or treasury stock, additional to the $60,000 approved herein, but the Commission will re - tain jurisdiction of this application in order to act on that portion of the application, approval of which is temporarily withheld, at such time as further showing may be made by applicant with relation thereto.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4149 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Traction Company, a Corporation, for Authority to Charge and Collect In - created Fares. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This is an application by The Lincoln Traction Company for an emergency increase of fares. To understand the case it is necessary to state briefly what has preceded. Some time since applications were filed by the company for in - creased permanent fares, for emergency fares, and for authority to sell securities. The applications were consolidated and after prolonged in - vestigation and hearing the application to sell securities was rranted and those for Increases of fares were denied. The denial wa.. Dased chiefly upon the ground that the company had illegally paid dividends upon its common stock which the Commission found to be vithout value. The Commission slated in its opinion that it would make no order raising rates until the money illegally paid out in dividends upon the common stock should be returned and the common stockholders de - prived of their power to declare dividends upon their stock An ippeal was taken to the Riipreme court where the decision of the Commission was reversed and the rate cases were remanded to the Commis:.'on for hearing de novo. The court said that as the Commission could not directly cancel the common stock, it could not do so indirectly by mak - ing an increase of fares depend upon the cancellation of the oommon stock or upon the return to the treasury of the company of moneys paid cut as dividends upon such stock. The court found that at! t'jere was no comprehensive and authentic valuation of the properties the cases should be returned to the Commission for further investigation ■ and decision. This left the application for permanent fares' where it started except that the necessity of a physical valuation had tven de - termined. The directions of the supreme court as to a valuation, as </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 well as to all other matters, are being strictly pursued by the Corn- Shortly thereafter the company made a new application for emerg - ency fares and upon the requirement by the Commission of certain in - formation the applicant resorted to the Federal District Court of Ne - braska, asking an Injunction against the Commission to prevent it from interfering with the company in increasing its fares. An injunction was granted covering the period of the pendency of the cases before the Commission, the determination of which requires a physical valuation of the property of the company and which the company now says is practically completed and will be immediately placed "oefore the Com - mission. The Federal Court restrained the Commission frorr interfer - ing with the company in the collection of a maximum base fire of six cents for adult passengers with additional charge? for outlying com - munities. The present application is for emergency fares, it being alleged by the company that the maximum fares provided In the order of the Federal Court are not sufficient to meet its requirements. It Is apparent that the present proceeding does not involve the question of any stock issue, nor of dividends paid in the past. It 1? conceded by every one Interested that it will take some time — perhaps as much as six months — to check the Inventory and valuation and to heai and de - termine the if-sues In the case involving permanent fares, so the ques - tion immediately before the Commission la whether or not tho»"» is an emergency requiring relief for the company during the time that will lapse before proper permanent fares can be determined. Nothing here - in will be a precedent for determining the other cases. This is an emergency fare caee and Is wholly separate and distinct from the case involving permanent fares. The principal allegations of the application in its amend, a form are these: The fares authorized by the Federal Court as maximum are not sufficient to pay the company's operating expenses, taxes, damages. interest on bonds and dividends on preferred stock; during the months of January to July inclusive the railway operating revenues failed to meet such expenditures by $34,425.05, and for the months of August. September and October, 1919, there was a similar shortage of $6,091.64, making a total deficit in the railway department of $40,516.69 for ten months. Detailed tabulations showing operations for the months named are attached to the application. i In addition to the railway department, the company operates a power and light department in its own name; it also operates a heat - ing department through a subsidiary company known as the Lincoln Heat, Light ft Power Company, the stock of which is all owned by the applicant. A statement of the results of operation of the combined properties is also attached to the application in which it Is snu»n that the total operating expenses for the ten months, January to October, 1911, inclusive, were inadequate to pay the operating expenses, taxes, </seg>
            <seg id="p381">381 injuries, damages, bond interest and dividends on the prefers :1 stock by $28,273.71. As the application is based in part upon the statement of the operat - ing results of the combined properties, and as the company actually operates- all the properties, and as the applicant stated for the record that for the purpose of this case it was willing that the combined state - ment should be used, only the figures in the comblued statement will be considered by the Commission in this proceeding. It is to be under - stood that the applicant offers the use of the combined statement for this hearing only and it is not conceded by it that the property should be considered as a unit for any other purpose, nor does it waive any Ets it may have by reason of consenting to such consideration in this Under the evidence the railway department, considered alone, vs, as appears above, a considerably larger deficit than thnt shown by the combined properties. The applicant states that it will take several months to complete the proceeding for permanent fares; that it has paid no dividends on preferred stock for more than two years, which Impairs confidence In the company and prevents it marketing securities 1 already apvroved by the Commission; that there are bonds of $250. 00C which fall due on January 1, 1920, and that in its present financial condition cue com - pany cannot meet them, nor can It sell its securities for that purpose. It is prayed that the company be authorized to charge a fare of seven cents in cash or one token (tokens to be sold at the rate of four for twenty-five cents) for each adult passenger carried within one zone and ■even tickets for twenty-five cents for school children within the city of Lincoln, a;.d for general relief. A hearing was had at which the company presented the d'-.tails of Its operation for the past year. The Commission finds' from the evi - dence that on August 1, 1919, there was a general advance in tlic wages of the entire operating force of the company amounting to about $50,000 per year, and on November 1, 1919, there was another increase amount - ing to about $8,000 per year. There has been a very heavy advance In the cost of coal and fuel oil, the former having risen on an average of considerably more than $1.00 per ton, and the latter having go.ie from about $1.80 per barrel to $3.22 per barrel. Due to the general shortage of coal, made still more acute by the strike, the company has been com - pelled to Install oil burners under more than one-half of its boilers, the coal consumption having been reduced from 125 tons to 50 tons per day. In order to safeguard its fuel supply the company entered ini'i a con - tract, while the strike was in progress, for oil for a six month;' period beginning January 1, 1920, under which oil will cost $3.22 per barrel for the month of January, about $2.50 for February and March, with a Vradual reduction during the months of April and May, and falling to $2.22 for the month of June. The secretary of the company, Mr. Shaw, testified that from his observations as to the relative costs of oil and </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT • cca' he considered oil at $3.22 per barrel about equal to coal, such as the company customarily uses, at about $9.00 per ton. The actual in - crease in the cost of fuel for November, 1919, over its cost for Novem - ber, 1918, Ik $9,037.71. For December, 1919, the inc-reibe over November, 1918, is (partly estimated) $7,628.77. The estimated Increase for Janu - ary, 191*0, over December, 1919, is upwards of $9,000. and over Decem - ber, 1918, nearly $17,000. Since the hearing in this case, the co.m strike has been settled and doubtless the estimated expense will be aomewhat lessened, but there is no Indication that there will be a radical reduc - tion in fuel cost. What has been said of fuel is true of almost all other materials and supplies used by the company; there is nc thine pointing to reduction in their prices. The results of operation of the combined property for the ten months, January to October, inclusive, 1919, are rtiown by the follow - ing summary: M&gt; 630.85 684.796.90 $J 58.833.95 01,059.00 $ 97,774.95 $ll'&lt;*.,048.56 $ ?S,273.61 The month of November yielded a net surplus of $4,161.29 on the combined properties and the evidence shows an increased t:, ffic for December. If it were not for the largely increased expenditures, these facts would indicate some relief for the company, but with the added expenses it is doubtful that any gain will be experienced. Owing to the difficulties of rearranging the boilers for the use of coal and to the contract for oil entered into while the coal strike was in progress, immediate resumption of coal burning will be only partial. The company is in arrears in the payment of dividends on pre - ferred stock, with interest thereon, amounting to more thai. $150.00# Its current liabilities, mostly represented by short-time notes giren to the banks for borrowed money, now amount to about $350,000X0.

            <seg id="p383">383 company is required to make large expenditures to bring up iU proper - ties to a proper operating condition. There is paving and repaying to be done immediately. Thirty-one blocks of paving and repa\ing have been ordered by the authorities which will entail an estimated expendi - ture of more than $50,000. A large part of the deferred maintenance. Including repaying, will have to be cared for out of operating rovrnues. The remainder will have to be met as a capital charge. There !&lt;* also a bond indebtedness of $250,000, which will mature on January 1 1920. The company is therefore confronted with a heavy indebtedness, all of which is pressing for payment and $250,000 of which must be »n»t im - mediately or foreclosure will follow and with most disastrous conse - quences. Under the circumstances the Commission considers that there is an emergency entitling (he applicant to immediate relief. The statutory provision authorizing the Commission 'o fiv emerg - ency fares is as follows: "Nothing in the foregoing section shall be construed to prevent the commission from having the power when deemed by it neces - sary, to prevent interstate rate wars and injury to the business of the citizens of the state, railway companies or common carriers, or in case of any other emergency to be judged by the commission, and it shall be the duty of the commission to temporarily alter, amend or suspend any existing freight rates, tarifts, schedules, orders and circulars of any railway company or common cai Her, or part thereof, in this state, and to fix freight rates where none exist, which emergency rate or rates shall apply to any one or more or all railway companies or common carriers in this state, and shall take effect at such time and remain in force such length of time as may be prescribed by the commission." It is apparent that unless conditions change the business of the applicant will suffer great injury. Definition of the term "'emergency" has heretofore been attempted by the Commission in a previous hear - ing on this company, but we think it impossible to define it as it is used in the statute. Wide discretion is given the Commission in deter - mining when an emergency exists and it would only create difficulties to attempt to lay down limits for the exercise of that discrimination. It is sufficient for the Commission to say in each case as it arises whether or r.ot there is an emergency.

Now that the coal strike has been settled and fuel cost can be reduced somewhat, the applicant will perhaps be enabled with the ir creased fares to pay such expenses and have a small surplus. Should there be a surplus it should be applied by the company in payment of its out - standing obligations. It should not, under any circumstances, he used in paying dividends on the company's common stock. The November expenditures of applicant, in the opinion of the Commission, are no higher than the company will face for many months. If these expendi - tures were projected back for a year, and if November rates for trans - portation, heat, light and power were also projected back upon the volume of total business for the past year, the company would have earned for dividends only $12,000. The proposed increases under most favorable circumstances will add from $40,000 to $45,000 to revenues. Such added revenue would enable the company to pay only part of pre - ferred stock dividends, unless labor and material markets introduce ecopomles not now indicated. We believe that this increase in tevenues will give such confidence to the investing public as to make it possible for the company to sell its securities and thus take up the bond in - debtedness about to mature and to replenish its treasury by ire sale of its stock already authorized by the Commission. tit is probable that the entire controversy concerning fares, can be sted and disposed of within the next six months so that the Com - &gt;ion will not make an order at this time for a longer peri&lt;-&lt;l. It is thought that there is any legal impediment to establishing the rates in provided, yet the city of Lincoln has so strenuously objected tie power of the Commission to increase the rates specified in the r of the Federal Court that to avoid any shadow of conflict this r will be submitted, before becoming effective, to the judge of the ?ral Court for the District of Nebraska who heard the injunc - caae.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3539 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha A Council Bluff* Street Railway Company for Authority to Increase Its Street Car Passenger Fares. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Pursuant to and in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court rendered July 16, 1919, in the case entitled in the matter or the application of &lt;he Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company for authority to increase its street car passenger fares, and the forty days allowed for the mandate having been waived by all of the parties in - terested in the proceedings, the question of establishing tempoiuiy rates to be charged by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company on its 1 Nebraska properties is now before the Commission for consideration. The decision of the Supreme Court directed the Commission to establish temporary rates during the pendency of the hearing before % pie Commission on the question of permanent rates to be charged by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway, and recommended that a fare of six cents be established by the Commission. Since the decision </seg>
            <seg id="p386">386 of the Supreme Court we are advised that the trainmen of the com - pany have demanded an increase In their wages. Figures submitted to the representatives of the commission show that the company has earned from the operation of the entire property during the period July 1, 1918, to July 1, 1919, $37,000 in round figures above the operating expenses, taxes and interest on the bondod In - debtedness. It is contended by the company that an increase of ten cents an hour in the wages of trainmen would necessitate an expendi - ture of approximately $400,000 per annum. The average annual divi - dends paid on capital stock of the company during the five years Janu - ary 1, 1913. to January 1. 1918, was in round figures $425,000. Based en the results of operation of the twelve-month period ending July 1, 1919, it would appear that the earning capacity of the company should he in - creased in order to pay the increased wages considered fair by the company and an average return on the capital invested in the same amount as during the five-year period mentioned above of $800,000 In round figures during the pendency of the proceedings. Looking to thr final determination of the permanent rate to be established by the company for the transportation of passengers on its Nebraska lines, it appears that the total earnings of the company shourd be increased at least $800,000. tit Is contended by the company that the amount of $300,000 per im for depreciation, charged to operating expenses and included in results of operation tor the year herein mentioned, is not sufficient, the same should be increased to $500,000 per annum to meot the irerierts and to allow the company an amount equal to the de - ds herein mentioned, which appear to be reasonable and Jusf. tThe Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the rates of should be increased as follows: Adult passengers, seven cents cash per ride, with the exception that the company should sell on its cars four tickets for twenty-five cents. Ten tickets at thirty cents should be sold to children more than five years and not more than twelve years of age. Ten tickets for fifty cents should be sold to children attending the public schools. tThe total number of riders on the company's lines for the year end- December 31. 1918, was in round figures 60,000,000. It is alleged by company that sixteen per cent of the actual passengers carried [nates and destinates on the Council Bluffs lines of the company, number of passengers carried by the company for the six months &gt;d ending July 1, 1919, shows an average increase of approximately en per cent over the same period for the year 1918. If the same age rate of fare is secured by the company from its lines of strae^ ray which it operated outside of the state of Nebraska as allowed he Commission in this order it would appear that the gross revenues </seg>
            <seg id="p387">387 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of the company would be Increased between six and seven hundred thousand dollars. This in the estimation of the Commission will amply protect the company during the time the Commission has under investi gation the establishment of permanent rates for the operation of the company's lines in the state of Nebraska. In connection with and looking toward the final submission to the Commission of the operation of the company, the Commission is of the opinion that the applicant should be directed to prepare and file with the Commission the following data, to-wit: (1) A detailed Inventory of all of the property owned by the com - pany located in the state of Nebraska as directed by the engineering department of the Commission, the same to be made as of September 1. 1919. (2) That the company shall file with the Commission the cost and the date of installation of all property included in the inventory herein ordered, so far as the same can be ascertained from the records of the company.

The findings and order entered by the Commission at this time in Ise proceedings are made upon the recommendation of the Supreme irt as outlined in its decision hereinbefore mentioned and in con - eration of material increases of wages to the employes of the ap - •ant company. The Commission will provide that the company will thwith proceed and continue with reasonable diligence to file with Commission the data called for in the order hereinafter entered. ;en sufficient data has been submitted to the Commission which in its ition requires the taking ot testimony and the interrogation of wit - see, a date will be set down when all parties wtll be notified and &gt;wed to submit testimony and tabulations tending to support the con - tions of all parties at interest.

The town subscribers own their own instruments and will furnish their own batteries and any repair parts to the instruments. The company owns only the cen - tral office equipment and the lines in town. It asks for the following rates: These rates are high in the light of the fact that a subscriber undertakes to furnish his own batteries and maintain his telephone in - struments.

In an order entered August 23, 1919, on Application No. 3944, wherein this applicant was authorized to increase rates, the Commis - sion found it necessary to reach a fair value of the property on which the company was 1 entitled to earn a return, inasmuch as it was repre - sented in the hearing that the stockholders desired to change the method of doing business from a no-dividend basis to a reasonable dividend on the property entitled so to earn. In that case it was found that present outstanding stock repre - sented cost of materials 1 alone for the original plant; that original labor costs were almost entirely donated; that from 1906 to date the </seg>
            <seg id="p392">TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT 392 company had paid but one small dividend, the remainder of earnings applicable to dividends having been invested in additional properties the company was entitled to earn on such consideration alone on an investment value of $9,400. This was a conservative figure arrived at by a consideration of the history of the company, the sacrifices of the stockholders, and the present value of its properties, based on original cost alone. It was recommended to the company that the difference between the value on which the company was entitles to earn and the outstanding stock be issued as stock dividends, in order that present stockholders have the advantage of past sacrifices and of book values, and future purchasers of stock be prevented from enjoying an invest - ment in which they had no original part. It was represented to the Commission that the company desires to improve these properties and to secure funds therefor by further sales of stock. This fact made it all the more imperative that a stock adjust - ment take place. This application is for that purpose. (In the previous case the record showed a very lax method of keep - account of stock transfers. In approving the issue of this stock dend, the Commission will require the company to call in all out - lding stock and issue in lieu thereof other stock certificates in the o of two and one-half shares for each share cancelled. It will be aired also to purchase and maintain a stock book, on which the les of stockholders will be spread, together with their holdings, and which transfers may be properly recorded as they take place.

It has at the present time outstanding $9 200,000 of stock and it owes the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company $6,472,500 for cash advanced for construction purposes The Indebtedness exceeds at this time the amount permitted under Nebraska laws. The companj has therefore amended its articles of incorporation to provide for an author - ized capitalization of $15,000,000 and desires to substitute capital liability for notes payable indebtedness, thereby readjusting its accounts to conform with requirements of the Nebraska statutes. The Nebraska Telephone Company has for many years financed Itself with the aid of the parent corporation, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, and has thereby without doubt secured its funds at a lower rate than it would have been able to secure had it not had these valuable Wall street connections. Following this policy, it owed on January 1, 1914, $5,453,000. By the authority of the Commission, on April 4, 1914, it issued $4,000,000 of two year six per cent notes to re - fund a like amount of demand notes on the indebtedness named above. Its stock at that time outstanding was $6,000,000. After these two years notes were issued, the indebtedness was reduced at that moment to $1,453,000, besides certain current indebtedness. On July 21, 1914, the Commission authorized an Issue of $1,500,000 common stock to be sold at par with which to pay off the balance of demand notes owed the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. After that financing there was no other indebtedness than the accounts and bills payable for current purchases. Between July, 1914, and April. 1917, applicant had borrowed from the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company $1,108,250 additional funds. A check of the company's books showed that this money had been received in cash. By the authority of the Commission, dated April 12, 1917, this indebtedness was handled by the sale of $1,100,000 of com men stock. The compauy was also authorized to issue and sell at once $200,000 additional common stock for extensions then In progress and to sell on authority of the Commission in multiples of $100,000 as much as $700,000 additional to that. By supplemental order dated August 11, 1917, $500,000 of the above additional common stock was authorized, making the sum total authorized $9,300,000 of stock.

TAYLOR, Commissioner: On February 1, 1918, the Missouri Pacific Railroad corporation in Nebraska filed a motion for a rehearing in the order herein, alleging among other things that this Commission was without jurisdiction and that the rules promulgated were unfair, discriminatory and unworkable. A hearing was had on the motion. Later defendant Indicated its will - ingness to comply with the order of the Commission and apply the rules. This it did, though no action was taken to dismiss this motion. In crder to close the case the Commission now finds that the motion for a rehearing should be denied for want of prosecution.

            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 399 GENERAL ORDER NO. 46 In the Matter of Emergency Rate* for the Transportation of Freight by Vehicle* Using the Public Highways In Eastern Nebraska. SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER "A" WILSON, Commissioner: This matter came on (or further bearing on July 8, 1919, on oral complaints of certain auto carriers to the effect that it was shown that the rates provided in the Commission's' original order. General Order No. 46, were not remunerative to the carrier for the transportation of shipments moving from one consignor to one consignee where the nature of the traffic required the transportation in one direction only. In order to correct this apparent inadequacy of the rates heretofore ordered by the Commission, the carriers suggested that a rate be pro - vided on the basis of the capacity of the truck for the total distance of travel necessary to transport the shipment. It was suggested that a rate of 37% cents per mile for a single ton truck and 12 Vi cents addi - tional per mile for each additional ton truck capacity, would be proper. Taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding an indi - vidual shipment and the probable requirements of the public for such a service, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that a rate should be established for the transportation of commodities where the use of a truck is required to transport the shipment from one con - signor to one consignee and return empty. The Commission is further of the opinion that a reasonable and just rate for such a service should properly be based on the capacity of the truck used to transport the shipment, within reasonable limit, as to the size of the motor truck that is used by the carrier for the pur - pose of transporting the shipment. For the purpose of meeting the public requirements the Commission is of the opinion and so finds, that a rate of 37% cents per mile for a one-ton truck and an additional rate of 12% cents for each additional ton or fraction thereof; provided however, that the capacity of the truck used in transporting the single shipment where established shall be the minimum of a one-ton truck, that the mileage shall be figured from the office of the carrier to the final point of destination and the return to the office of the carrier, provided however, that the most direct available route shall be traveled by the motor truck. In the course of the hearing the fact was developed that there Is a considerable movement of traffic between Lincoln and adjacent cities or villages, namely, Lincoln, College View, University Place, Normal, Bethany, Havelock, Belmont and Lake View. It was urged by the carriers that the nature of the traffic is very similar to the carrying of commodities wholly within the city limits of Lincoln, and that the rates </seg>

On the showing the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the cities of Lincoln, College View, University Place, Normal, Bethany, Havelock, Belmont and Lake View shall be and the same are hereby considered as a Lincoln zone, and that the rates named in General Order No. 46 should not be applied for traffic moving in or between said cities or villages. An order will be entered according to these findings'.

FINDING AND OPINION BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on for further hearing on the motion of the Com - mission as a result of a number of complaints as to the rates and classification established in the original order. The class rates 1 were said to be insufficient for short distances, and the merchandise and single shipment rates for all distances. The classification was com - plained of as unsuitable to truck transportation and incapable of appli - cation by the majority of truckers on account of its complexity. The classification is the same as that used by the railroads and is very elaborate, containing approximately 10,000 Items, and much of it Is predicated upon the condition of shipment as to packing. Considerable study is required to use it properly. Two hearings were held, attended by a number of the carriers. The Commission introduced the results of an investigation made by it, covering fifty-nine trucks operating in and out of Omaha. The informa - tion secured was based largely on estimates made by the drivers inter - viewed, but it is the best evidence obtainable at present, and doubtless approaches exactness in fair measure. A summary of the investigation as to costs compared with the Com - mission's estimate in the original order is. as follows: Class Investigation Estimate Per Ton Mile Per Ton Mile Operating expenses: Gasoline and oil 2.7 cents 2.5 cents Driver's services 8.3 cents 7.2 cents </seg>
            <seg id="p402">402 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT Maintenance: Truck repair* (20% per annum of cost of truck) 2.17 cents 2.5 cents Truck depreciation (33 1-3% per an - num of cost of truck) 4.94 cents 4.16 cents Tire repairs and renewals 2.62 cents 1.87 cents Total _ 20.73 cents 18.23 cents The investigation did not cover actual costs of repairs nor any thing of general expenses. The Commission's original estimate of gen- eral expenses was 6.827 cents per ton mile, which, added to the In- vestigation costs above shown, result* in a total cost of 27.557 cents per ton mile compared with the Commission's estimate of 35.057 cents per ton mile The facts upon which the Investigation cost* are based are substan tlally as follows Average capacity of truck. 1,475 tons Average cost of truck per ton capacity $1,292.82 Average cost of tires per ton capacity $ 195 25 Average distance traveled by truck per year 8,760 miles Average life of tire* 7,450 miles Ton miles per gallon of gasoline 10.53 miles Ton miles per gallon of lubricating oil 191.57 miles Average distance per trip 26.69 miles Average speed per hour 5.27 miles Driver's wage* (102.50 per month Other interesting information was secured by the Inquiry. The In- bound loads of the trucks consisted wholly of live stock, and the arer- age number of each class of stock carried per truck was as follows: Cattle, 2.31; hogs, 8.8; sheep, 18.9. Return loads were secured as fol- lows: Eight, every trip; four, every trip with few exceptions; one. about half of the trip; twenty-one, only occasionally, and twenty-four none. Of the roads traversed, 36.9 per cent of the distance was paved and 63.10 per cent unpaved. Only a few of the operators were found to be complying with the Commission's schedule of rates applicable to live stock. Eight shipments were assessed rates higher than those established, and twenty-six shipments lower. The average rate assessed was 49.11 cents per hundredweight, while the legal rate applicable to the shipments averaged 58.87 cents per hundredweight Many specific complaints were made at the hearing that the Com- mission's order Is not being observed by certain carriers coming within Its term*. This Is due to several causes, among which are Ignorance of the existence of the order by many, extreme difficulty in using the classification, and resentment against public regulation of what has hitherto been a private business. In giving publicity to the order, the Commission was obliged to depend largely upon the press as It had no directory of the persons engaged. It was also embarrassed by ltsr in- ability to provide every carrier known to It with a copy of the classifl- </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 403 cation. The more highly organized concerns In the business were able to and did apply the classification, but the small operators are scarcely to be blamed for not doing so even though in possession of a copy. The classification is very elaborate and many items in it are stated separate - ly according to the condition In which they are offered for shipment, as previously noted. For example, agricultural Implements cover approxi - mately 300 items, and the entire classification contains upwards of 10,000 items. The Commission was in doubt as to the practicability of apply - ing a railroad classification to the trucking business, and did so only at the truckers' suggestion which was based on the want of anything better at the time. The use of the classification, however, has given the industry the benefit of experience, and It is now in position to pro - pose something more workable. CLASSIFICATION Several classifications published by individual trucking compaale) are In the record. The J. S. Davis Auto Company of North Platte uses but one class (with a single exception) and applies multiples to the base rate according to the item carried. The Federal Transit Company, operating between New York, Phila- delphia, Coatesville, Chester and Wilmington (rather between zones established about those cities) uses four classes based on the weight of the shipment per cubic foot as follows: The percentages shown are not in the classification, but specific rates are stated for each class which reflect those percentages. The Interurban Motor Express Company of Sioux City, Iowa, uses four classes and describes 146 items covering merchandise chiefly. In addition, it publishes 16 commodity rates described as "specials," and truck load rates on live stock for distances up to fifty miles. The class rates apply between Sioux City and twenty-three outside points, to which regular service is given and specific rates stated for each class. The relation between the classes is approximately 100, 93, 77 and 67. A number of Denver trucking concerns appear to be carrying on an extensive business without a classification. Specific rates are published between Denver and 78 other points varying according to weights' from 1,000 pounds minimum to 4,500 pounds maximum. The consensus of opinion of those present at the first hearing was In favor of adopting a classification covering all of the commodities now known to be moving In truck transportation, and divided into two classes if possible. The Commission's rate department undertook to prepare such a classification on the basis of the present class rates for consideration at the second hearing, and did so. The classification con- lass "A," 16 pounds or more per cubic foot 100 per cent 'lass "B," 12 to 16 pounds per cubic loot 125 per cen lass "C." 8 to 12 pounds per cubic foot 175 per cen lass "D," lees than 8 pounds per cubic foot 250 per cen 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p404">404 tl 93 items and placed all of them in two classes with one excep - -iron and steel not manufactured — which was given a third class, veloped at the hearing, however, that other heavy commodities, as building materials, would probably not move at second class and that even a fourth class would be necessary to get such The exceptions hitherto made to the classification in effect were also recommended with some changes as follows: 1. Live stock in single shipments, where there is a r»t*rn load. first class, with a minimum of 60% of truck capacity. 2. Grain in single shipments, where there is a return load, second class, with a minimum of 80% of truck capacity. 1. Household goods, double second class, declared valuation not to OTTfiil Ten Dollars ($10.00) per hundredweight; three times second class where declared valuation exceeds Ten Dollars ($10.00) per hun - dredweight. Minimum weight of a single shipment moving In the truck 80% of truck capacity required. Packing requirements subject to Rule 6. 4. Single shipments, other than household goods, requiring the ex - clusive use of a truck and where no return load is secured, 37% cents per truck mile for a round trip where a one-ton truck will carry the load, and 12 V6 cents per truck mile additional for each additional ton truck capacity or fraction thereof required. I The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the classification mended, together with the exceptions above noted, should be sub - ted for the classification and exceptions now in force. RATES The new classification will have the effect of increasing the rates upon merchandise shipments, but this is fully Justified by the record. It was shown that such shipments were rated third elass chiefly under the former classification, and that the rates were too low to adequately compensate the carriers for the service. Such business was generally refused for that reason. Instances were given of shippers offering double the old rates to move merchandise shipments. The new classifi - cation distributes merchandise quite equally between the first and second classes, thus increasing the rates from twenty to forty per cent. flie present rates begin with a terminal rate of fifteen cents per first class, and predicated upon the estimated costs of terminal :e. Experience shows, however, that the costs of gathering and buting shipments are actually greater than were estimated orig - ', and that a terminal rate of twenty cents per cwt. is necessary to xly compensate the carrier. There was no complaint at the rate ogression of one and one-half cents per cwt., per mile, first class, ding to* the distance carried, nor as to the relation between classes tally established, viz: first class, 100 per cent; second class, elghty - &gt;er cent; third class, seventy per cent, and fourth class, sixty per </seg>
            <seg id="p405">405 It cannot be said, however, that rates can be established in the in - dustry on anything like a scientific basis until fuller information is ob - tained. It will require time and the keeping of accurate cost data in order to arrive at such a system of rates. The experience derived from the application of the rates established by the Commission during the five months they have been in effect, however, warrants the hope that sound foundation for the rates will be found In due time, and that the temporary rates and rules established by the Commission are indis - pensable to that end. The Commission finds, therefore, that the rates hitherto established by the Commission should be changed as above in - dicated, and the order herein will so provide. TERRITORY It was shown at the hearing that some of the carriers' subject to the Commission's order had suffered some loss of business by reason of the competition of carriers located beyond the zone established by the Commission in which the order applies, and particularly on account of carriers located in Buffalo, Phelps and Harlan counties. It appears in the record, also, that the circumstances and conditions surrounding truck transportation in the counties named are substantially similar to those in the established zone to which they are contiguous 1 . The Com - mission, therefore, finds that the zone previously established by the • 'ommission should be extended to include Buffalo, Phelps and Harlan counties.

            <seg id="p412">412 PART IV Court Decisions IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED. STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA. LINCOLN DIVISION Nebraska State Railway Commission, Plain tMT, vs. Lincoln Telephone A Telegraph Company, Frank H. Woods, Silas H. Burnham, Charles J. Bills, Joseph Grainger, Charles Mayer, James M. Bell, Commodore N. Beaver, George J. Woods, Mark W. Woods, Charles Stuart and Chris Klem. Defendants. Before Munger and Wade, District Judges Per Curiam: The plaintiff has submitted a motion to strike the defense set out In the answer, because of its insufficiency, under Equity Rule 33. A preliminary question has arisen of the Jurisdiction of this court to hear and determine the case. The suit is by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, as plain - tiff. The Commission is composed of three citizens of Nebraska, and is a body to which the state constitution and laws have committed the regulation of common carriers. The defendants named include a corpo - ration organized under the laws of Nebraska, conducting a general tele - phone business in the state, and its officers and directors, all of whom are citizens of Nebraska. The bill refers to a joint resolution of con - gress approved July 16, 1918, authorizing the President to take posses sion of and to control and operate any telephone systems during th war, and to the President's proclamation of July 22, 1918, taking posses sion of all telephone systems in the United States and directing tha the operation of them should be exercised by the postmaster genera through the managers and officers of the telephone systems, in th names of the companies, until otherwise ordered, and it is alleged tha the postmaster general took possession of the property of the defendan company and has ever since been in the possession and control of it. </seg>
            <seg id="p413">413 The plaintiff then asserts that the constitution and laws of Ne - braska give it exclusive control of the rates to be charged by the de - fendant company within the state and that such laws require an appli - cation to be made to the Commission and an approval by it, before any rates may be fixed. It Is then complained that the postmaster general, after taking charge of the telephone systems, had Issued orders fixing the charges for Installation, and for changes In location, of telephones, that the defendant telephone company had ordered the exchange man - agers to place the rates in effect, although many of tne telephones are used exclusively in intrastate traffic, and that this has been done without an application to the State Railway Commission and without its ap - proval of such charges. An injunction is asked to restrain the collec - tion of these rates. The bill also asserts that the postmaster general and the defendants assume to act under the authority of the joint reso - lution of congress, and alleges that that act does not authorize any federal authority to prescribe any rates or charges for services by tele - phone companies. As all of the members of the State Railway Commission and all of the defendants are citizens of the same state, this court has no jurisdic - tion to determine the suit unless it arises under the constitution or laws of the United States (Sec. 24, Jud. Code). The plaintiff contends that it does so arise, because as alleged by plaintiff, the defendants claim to act under the authority of the joint resolution of congress, and because that resolution reserves to the plaintiff the authority which the constitution and laws of Nebraska had conferred, by reason of the proviso contained in the resolution which reads as follows: "Provided further, That nothing in this Act shall be construed to amend, repeal, impair, or affect existing laws or powers of the states in relation to taxation or the lawful police regulations of the several states, except wherein such laws, powers, or regulations may affect the transmission of Government communications, or the issue of stocks and bonds by such system or systems." It has long been settled that the jurisdiction of a district court under this portion of Section 24 of the Code depends on the "statement, in good faith, of plaintiff's own claim in his bill. It is also settled that jurisdiction is not conferred by allegations in plaintiff's bill anticipating the defense and averring that the defense is based on the constitution or laws of the United States. "A case does so arise when an appro - priate statement of the plaintiff's cause of action, unaided by any antici - pation of avoidance of defense, discloses that it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction or effect of a law of congress." Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 488-489. "It has become firmly settled that whether a case is one arising under the constitution or a law or treaty of the United States, in the sense of the Juriadictional statute (now Sec. 24, Judicial Code), must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's state - ment of his own claim in the bill or declaration, unaided by anything </seg>

S. 149, 152. t Applying these rules to plaintiff's bill, we have a claim for relict ded upon the constitution and laws of Nebraska. The defendants it waive the defenses of the validity, construction and effect of the of congress, and rely upon the Insufficiency of the plaintiff's plead - or proofs, but in any event, the ground of plaintiff's recovery, that :h it seeks to declare and enforce is the law of Nebraska granting orlty to the Commission to approve telephone rates. The antlcipa - of the defense that may be made is not an essential part of its because if plaintiff's authority to make rates is supreme, the ce of defendant's claim to make rates 1 is of no importance. !A ' suggestion is made that the proviso in the Joint resolution of ress grants to the State Railway Commission the power to fix rates part of the police power of the state delegated to be exercised by Commission. The powers' of the Commission were not defined or ired by congress in the language of this proviso, so that the rule led in Macon Grocery v. Atlantic Coast Line, 215 V S. 501. 507 not govern. Whatever the police regulations of the state were be - the passage of this Joint resolution, they remain in force except as Joint resolution expressly modified them, but this proviso was a rvatlon and not a grant of such powers to the state and hence itlff'g action does not arise from a grant by congress. The tenth amendment to the constitution of the United States pro - vides that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the con - stitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people," but this does not mean that all cases arising under laws of the states enacted in pursuance of such reserved power of the states, arise also under and by virtue ot the tenth amend- A» plaintiff's suit does not arise under the constitution or laws of the United States and therefore must be dismissed for want of Juris - diction, this conclusion renders unnecessary the determination of the other questions presented. </seg>

The Lincoln Traction Company, a Corpora - tion, Appellant, vs. The City of Lincoln, the City of University Place and the City of HaveHock, Appellee. In the matter of the application of the Lincoln Traction Company for authority to increase Its rates of fare. The Lincoln Traction Company, Applicant, Appellant, vs. The City of Lincoln, Respondent, Appellee. SYLLABUS 1. In adopting the constitutional provision creating the State Rail - way Commission, it was made an independent part of the constitution and not as an amendment to the executive, legislative or judicial articles thereof. 2. The State Railway Commission has Independent legislative, judi - cial and executive or administrative powers so far as necessarily In - volved In the "regulation of rates, service and general control of com mon carriers," and such exercise of power may be controlled or limited by the legislature. 3. Unless there has been specific legislation that might limit or affect this power given to the Commission, it would seem that the people have given this Commission all the control over common carriers that they themselves could exercise. 4. The rates of a public Service corporation must be based upon the value of the property devoted to the public use. 5. Rates allowed In other similar cities may be considered by the Commission, but would not be controlling. •. If the evidence tending to show that rates are not remunerative, "while based upon actual experience in the operation of the road, re - lates only to a brief period when conditions were abnormal." it will not necessarily require a change of rates. Darnell v. Edwards, 244 U. S. 664. If It is uncertain whether conditions will become more favorable for adequate earnings In the near future, and seems improbable that they will, the propriety of emergency rates would seem to be indicated. 7. When rates are in question, the Item of good will is not to be considered. 8. In, determining the sufficiency of present rates, it would be proper to consider the dividends that had been declared in the recent past under ordinary conditions, but the distribution of these dividends among the stockholders would not throw any light upon the earning power of the property. </seg>
            <seg id="p416">416 9. If the dividends paid were not greater than a fair return on the actual value of the property would justify, and did not exceed the net earnings, the disposition of those dividends among the stockholders would not affect the public interest. 10. If the dividends paid to the various stockholders were more than a fair return upon the property or in excess of the net earnings of the company, it would devolve upon the company to make good the deficiency, and render such service as is due the public, and is required by the Commission. 11. If the earnings are sufficient the company must be prepared to render proper service as required by the Commission. 12. When a public utility, which is under the control of the Rail - way Commission, owns or is interested in subsidiary utilities in the city which are under the control of the city authorities, it is proper for the Railway Commission to require the utility under its control to keep full and accurate accounts of all services rendered to its subsidiary com - panies, and all values received therefor at prices fixed by the Railway Commission; and such values so received must be accounted for as other earnings. 13. It is the duty of the company to keep their accounts as re - quired by the Commission, and to render all possible assistance to en - able the Commission to ascertain true values. If the company fails in these respects, it is not in a position to complain of reasonable findings of the Commission as to value. t4. If the company does not obey the orders of the Commission in regard, and act upon these principles, it cannot complain if the ilssion is as liberal in dealing with the affairs of the company aa it can reasonably be and make sure that it is properly protecting the public. Ei. If, owing to changed conditions, the net earnings of the com properly managed are not a fair return upon the value of its prop the rates should be increased without imposing impossible or un - sary conditions. 16. The Commission properly decided that it cannot under existing condition* order the cancellation of the common stock of the company. and when under existing conditions an order cancelling stock is not authorized, it cannot be cancelled by indirection by withholding from the company that to which it would be otherwise entitled. 17. The Commission should know how the proceeds of the bonds are used by the c ipany, and in authorising the issue of stocks or bonds may determine the price and conditions of their sale, but in a proper case cannot Indirectly prevent such issue by imposing impossible or unnecessary conditions. 118. Money raised to pay for depreciation should not be considered capital upon which a return is to be made to stockholders as divi - ids in the future. But, when, under the rates allowed, dividends are </seg>
            <seg id="p417">417 fairly earned and declared, such dividends become the property of the stockholders, and if used to make proper additions to the property, such additions should be considered In adjusting rates. 19. This court upon appeal cannot disturb findings of the Commis - sion unless it appears that seme requirements of the law have been violated or disregarded, or that the result reached cannot reasonably be derived from the facts proved. SEDGWICK, J. The plaintiff applied to the State Railway Commission for permis - sion to raise its rates of service and for authority to issue and sell securities, and also made an application for an emergency rate. The Commission, after an extended hearing and apparently an exhaustive Investigation of the matters presented, granted the respective applica - tions in part and refused them in part; and the applicant has appealed to this court from the ruling on each application. The applications were heard together, reserving the motion to consolidate the cases for further investigation. Questions are raised and discussed as to the extent and the limits of the jurisdiction and authority of the State Railway Commission. In Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, 211 U. S. 210, the court said. In the syllabus, "So far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, a state may, by constitutional provision, unite legislative and judicial powers in the •ame body." And in the opinion, "Among its (the Commission's) duties it exercises the authority of the state to supervise, regulate and con - trol public service corporations, and to that end, as is said by the Su - preme Court of Virginia and repeated by counsel at the bar, it has been clothed with legislative. Judicial and executive powers." And, that if the state constitution "sees fit to unite legislative and judicial powers In a single hand there Is nothing to hinder so far as the Constitution of the United States Is concerned." In adopting the constitutional pro - vision creating the State Railway Commission, It was made an Inde - pendent part of the constitution and was not designated as an amend - ment to the executive, legislative or Judicial articles of the constitution. The fact, therefore, that it has, by the compilers, been placed In article V. which relates to the executive department of the government, affords no assistance in its construction. Its language is clear, as fol - lows: "There shall be a State Railway Commission, consisting of three members, who shall be first elected at the general election in 1906, whose terms of office, except those chosen at the first election under this provision, shall be six years and whose compensation shall be fixed by the Legislature." Its powers and duties include "the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers." The Legislature may make provision as to these powers and duties, but the Commission "shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated, » • • in the absence of specific legislation." It was submitted to the people </seg>
            <seg id="p418">418 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT by the legislature of 1905. (Laws 1905, Ch. 233.) Unless there has been specific legislation that might limit or affect this power given to the Commission, it would seem that the people have given this Commis - sion all the control over common carriers that they themselves could exercise. While this power must be exercised in harmony with the provisions of the Federal Constitution, and the general provisions of our own constitution that affect all branches of the government, it is plainly not limited by the special provisions of the constitution which distinguish between the legislative and judicial departments of the gov - ernment. The functions of this Commission are largely administrative, but, as is stated in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, supra, the Commis - sion necessarily has independent legislative, judicial and executive or administrative powers. This does not mean that the Commission is made a court with general judicial powers, but only such judicial powers m are necessarily involved in performing its duty to supervise, regulate and control public service corporations; and such exercise of power may be controlled or limited by the legislature. The company appears to contend that the following questions are Involved in this appeal: 1. That the rates should be based entirely upon the actual value of the company's property devoted to the public —Mice. 2. That the value of the property as found by the majority of the commissioners, entitled the company to "an emergency rate of fare." S. That the schedule of rates should not be lower than "in other cities of the same class, and should be sufficient to pay operating expense, providing for upkeep of the property, and pay a fair return upon the value of the property used and useful in the public service." 4. The order of the Commission "requiring the cancellation of the common stock of the Traction Company is void and should be held for naught." I. The order "requiring proceedings to be instituted to recover into the treasury dividends paid on the common stock is also null and void and should be so held." 6. "The limitations placed on the use of the pro - ceeds realized on the sale of the stocks and securities authorized is both contrary to law and unjustified." I That the rates should be based upon the present value of the prop - is thoroughly established by the decisions of the Federal courts, other courts. In the famous case of Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, .. Ed. 819, the court said, "We hold, however, that the basis of all illations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corpo - &gt;n maintaining a highway under legislative sanction must be the value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the lc. And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of con - ction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the terty under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum re - ed to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p419">419 and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience." This holding has been adhered 10 in subsequent decisions of that court, and has been generally followed by public serv - ice commissioners. It was followed in some of our decisions, and was recognized as the basis of rates by this court in State v. Lincoln Trac - tion Co., 90 Neb. 535, in which it was said, "Nor will the valuation by implication fixed by the promoters of the consolidation concerning the value of the property of the constituent corporations and of their stocks and bonds bind the Railway Commission in determining a proper case the investment upon which the respondent's stockholders should receive a return in the way of dividends, or the exact amount of the charges that may be exacted for transporting passengers"; citing Smyth v. Ames, supra, and other cases. It is not always easy to fix accurately the present value of such a property, and for that reason resort may be had to the various matters recited in Smyth v. Ames, supra, and. as there said, perhaps to other matters. Rates allowed in other similar cities will be considered, but they, of course, would not be controlling. When rates are in question, the item of good will is not to be considered. The value of the good will depends upon dividends, and the certainty of receiving them, and they in turn depend upon the rates allowed. To consider good will as value in fixing rates would lead to the most confusing uncertainties. The Commission in May, 1907, increased the rates upon an application of the company and these applications are for a further increase. If the evidence tending to show that rates are not remunerative, "while based upon actual experience in the operation of the road, relates only to a brief period when conditions were abnormal," it will not necessarily re - quire a change of rates. Darnell v. Edwards, 244 U. S. 564. If it is un - certain, and seems improbable, that conditions' will become more favor - able for adequate earnings in the near future, the propriety of emerg - ency rates would seem to be indicated. The Commission appears to have so regarded existing conditions. It was said by the Wisconsin Railway Commission, "A street rail - way will be permitted to discontinue the sale of 6 tickets for 25 cents where the return for the last twenty months was only about 5 per cent, although the average return for the preceding six years was 8.8 per cent, it appearing that the loss during the twenty months from the com - petitive operation of private automobiles, and jitneys to a less extent, and from higher prices for materials, supplies, and wages is not tempo - rary, that large outlays must be made for paving and for improvements and extensions, that any increase in gross earnings therefrom will be offset by expenses, and that it is doubtful whether an abnormally low cost of injuries and damages can be maintained." Re Duluth Street R. Co., P. U. R. 1916-D, 6X4, </seg>
            <seg id="p420">420 I The evidence in this case discloses that no comprehensive and au - tic valuation of the present property was before the Commission le time of this hearing. The attempt seems to have been to ascer - its present value from a consideration of the history of the com - r, and its investments and expenses from the time of the organlza - of the so-called "Old Traction Company" in 1898 to the present , and the findings and valuations made by the Railway Commission t since the consolidation in 1909. Some of the transactions of the ecessors of the so-called "Old Traction Company" appear alto to i been considered. The present company was organized in February. 1909. Prior to that time companies were operating three street car lines, which were then consolidated. This was before the enactment of the statute known M the "Stocks and Bonds Statute." (Laws 1909. Oh. 10S.) The stocks and bonds of the companies so consolidating forming the present com - pany (called in the briefs "The New Company") appear to have been greatly in excess of the actual values of the properties Involved. In order to effect a consolidation of the interests of the various stockhold - ers in the different companies, there appears to have been extravagant ■Ms of stocks and bonds of the new company. Preferred stock was used apparently without much regard to values that it represented, and was distributed to induce former stockholders' to consent to the consoli - dation. Also, a large amount of common stock was used and generally disposed of in the same way. A part of this common stock, however, was sold for 7 or 10 cents on the dollar, apparently to provide ready money for the use of the new company. These conditions were stated more fully, and the results in some respects considered in State v. Lin - coln Traction Co., supra. The commissioners were not entirely agreed as to the dispositions of these applications. A majority apparently formed a conclusion as to the present value of the property, and appear to have concluded that the present rates were insufficient to pay a fair return upon that valu - ation, but refused to increase the rates because of the present condi - tions of the stocks and bonds of the company, and perhaps for other reasons. In the opinion of the Commission, it is said, "It is true that the operating revenues for the calendar year 1917 were insufficient to p»y the dividends on the preferred stock by $22,305.83. The increase In operating expenses for the calendar year 1918. by reason of increased wages, cost of materials and supplies and freight rates, may create a greater deficiency, even though the gross operating revenues remain constant. We do not advocate the policy of allowing a depletion of the entire surplus reserves, and we are of the opinion that should the re- Mrrea continue to be reduced by reason of high cost of operation the Commission should take time by the forelock and raise the rates, but certainly the Commission should not raise the rates and place a greater burden upon the people until the company itself has done Its full duty. </seg>
            <seg id="p421">421 The Commission will, through the medium of the monthly reports of the applicant, keep in close touch with the operating results for the future, and when the company has done its duty by making good to the public the operating revenues properly belonging to the surplus account, should the surplus account together with the future operating revenues not be sufficient adequately to take care of the company, the Commission will immediately raise the rates." The Commission found that they did not have authority to cancel the excessive issue of common stock, but re - fused to increase the rates until the company, by its own acts, should cancel the stock. They also found that the company had paid the last few years a large amount of money as dividends upon that common stock that represented no value, and ordered that the company should, by legal action, recover the money so paid out as dividends on the com - mon stock together with interest thereon. The cancellation of this com - mon stock with other similar matters, was considered in State v. LJn - coln Traction Co., supra, and it was held that, "if, tn a consolidation of constituent street .railway companies which theretofore satisfactorily served the public, all of their tangible property is conveyed to the con - solidated corporation and subsequently improved, the mere fact that the stock and bond issues of the constituent corporations were doubled by the consolidated corporation, without greatly adding to the tangible assets, will not Justify a cancellation of that stock. And if to cancel one class of that stock will take from part of the stockholders the consideration for their agreement to consolidate the constituent corporations and will not interfere with the consideration received by other stockholders, none of the stock 6honld be canceled if the consolidation be permitted tq, continue." The same reasoning applies here. The patrons of this utility are not especially interested in the division of the dividends among the stockholders. They should not be required to pay greater fares than actually necessary to pay a fair return on the value of the property devoted to the public use. If the Commission could not direct - ly cancel the common stock, it could not do so indirectly by withhold - ing from the company that to which it would be otherwise entitled. In determining the sufficiency of present rates, it would be proper to consider the dividends that had been declared in the recent past under ordinary conditions, but, as already stated, the distribution of these dividends among the stockholder? would not throw any light upon the earning power of the property. If the dividends paid to the various stockholders were more than a fair return upon the property, or in ex - cess of the net earnings of the company, it would devolve upon the com - pany to make good the deficiency or run the risk of a receivership in case it was impossible to render such service as is due the public, and is required by the Commission. But, if owing to changed conditions, the net earnings of the company properly managed are not a fair re - turn upon the investment, the rates should be increased without driving the company to remedies so doubtful as suits to recover dividends long </seg>
            <seg id="p422">422 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT i declared and paid. If the company has paid dividends to stock - ers beyond the net earnings, and so failed to accumulate a reserve maintenance and emergencies, it has assumed a risk that common lence would suggest should be immediately remedied, for if the ilngs are sufficient the company must be prepared to render proper ice as required by the Commission. If it fails to do so through an wful dissipation of its funds, the public would necessarily use itlc remedies to secure proper service. If the dividends paid were greater than a fair return on the actual value of the property would Justify, and did not exceed the net earnings, the disposition of those dividends among the stockholders would not affect the public Interest. Since the consolidation, the Commission has had occasion several times to investigate the property of the company and adjust the rates. One of the first questions investigated arose from the fact that other public utilities are operated in connection with the traction company, which are not under the control of the Commission but under the city authorities, and In 1910 the Commission determined some of the ques - tions so presented. In the Third Annual Report of the Commission, page 133, it is said, "At the hearing In this case an attempt was made to find the value of the street railway proper, in order that rates might be so fixed that the Income from the same would be fair to the street railway company and to the general public as well. * * * It was con - tended by the city attorney of Lincoln that the Commission should not ■iH.li | ii 1 1 these properties but should take them as a whole and deter - mine what rate should be charged to produce a reasonable income on the entire property. The Commission found itself In this predicament. The state constitution and legislature have given it power to fix rate* and service of common carriers, which includes street railways, but no - where has it been delegated any authority over public utilities such as heating, lighting and power plants. • • • The Commission agrees with the contention of the city attorney that there should be a fixed and compensatory charge made by the Lincoln Traction Company for all services rendered to any other or subsidiary company for services, and all such amounts so earned must be made a part of its income account. * * * If the heat and light which are being furnished to these sub - sidiary lines of business are furnished by the railway company at a rate that is not compensatory to it, the Commission has Jurisdiction and authority to do full Justice in that respect by adjusting such charges. I* And, again in the same year in another matter, the Commission nd and ordered as follows (page 142, Third Annual Report): "That m and after July 1, 1910, the accounts pertaining to the railway shall kept in books separate and distinct from the books and accounts «f light or power or heating departments; that all operating accounts 11 on the books show the actual amounts of expenditures, accurately [ fully set out, and not altered by any apportionments to other de - tments (excepting only from material account), or by any method or </seg>

In a former bearing of an application by this company, the Com - mission found that, "It is very unfortunate that in the presentation of this case, so much that is in no way material to the solution of the problem has been injected into the evidence. • • » No hard and fast rule can be established In respect to a fixed rate of income upon in - vestments of this nature, but we have no hesitancy in saying that under ordinary conditions, where the good faith of the company and its fairness with respect to its patrons appears, the maximum return to such investors (provided the rate charged is not an unusual one) should not exceed 3 per cent in excess of the customary and existing rate of interest received by those whose investments are represented in fixed interest-bearing securities. In other words, the building of elec - tric lines should be encouraged and the returns upon such investments should be sufficiently large to attract capital to such enterprises. If the rate of interest on fixed interest-bearing securities in any given locality la 5 per cent, a maximum return to the investors in electric railways would not be unreasonable or excessive at 8 per cent" (page 96, Fourth Annual Report). A year later, in another case, the Commission determined what they said was a fair valuation as a basis for earnings and depreciation. In the Fifth Annual Report, page 96, it is said, "Preliminary and prior to the hearing, this Commission had caused a further and exhaustive in - vestigation and examination of the affairs of the Lincoln Traction Com - pany to be made by its accountants, Messrs. Powell and Wettllng, whose report was presented to the Commission and placed on file on March 7. 1912. * * • The value so shown in the report to be used as a basis for earnings is $2,244,639.54. • * • Taking all tnese matters into consideration, the Commission is of the opinion that the amounts stated are a fair valuation as bases- for earnings and depreciation." The Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p424">424 Einer dissenting from the opinion of the majority, said, that the rate urn "must be sufficient, under all circumstances, to attract capital t particular enterprise." Money raised to pay for depreciation should not be considered as capital upon which a return is to be made to stockholders as dividends In the future, but "That it was right to raise more money to pay for depreciation than was actually disbursed for the particular year there can be no doubt for a reserve is necessary in any business of this kind, and so It might accumulate, but to raise more than money enough for the purpose and place the balance to the credit of capital upon which to pay dividends cannot be proper treatment."

But, when dividends are fairly samed under the rates allowed, and are declared, such divi - dends become the property of the stockholders, and if used to make proper additions to the property, such additions should be considered in adjusting rates. These findings and orders seem to be Justified and necessary. It would appear that If these orders are complied with, the Commission. from the books of the company, can find the amount that the company had received from the subsidiary companies for services rendered, ond euch sums will of course be added to its other revenues to determine Ita earnings. These subsidiary companies' should be treated as are other patrons of the traction company. The Commission will see that all values received from them are fully accounted for. It Is the duty of the company to keep their accounts as required by the Commission, and to render all possible assistance to enable the Commission to ascertain true values. If the company in maintaining subsidiary companies, or for any other reason, fails to so regulate Its business and so keep its accounts that its receipts from such subidiary companies can be accurately determined, or fails to submit to the Com - mission an accurate and approved inventory and valuation of its prop - erty. — it is not in a position to complain of reasonable findings of the Commission as to value, if the Commission is as liberal in dealing with the affairs of the company as it can reasonably be and make sure that It is properly protecting the public. This court upon appeal cannot dis - turb such findings of the Commission, unless 1 it appears that some re - quirements of the law have been violated or disregarded, or that the re - sult reached cannot reasonably be derived from the facts proved. The application to Issue bonds, or preferred stock, was allowed upon condition "that said bonds or stock, or both collectively, shall be issued and sold for money only, and for not less than 85% of the par value thereof." If the company can Issue bonds bearing 6 per cent ln - terest, and the stockholders are allowed to purchase the bonds for a nominal price, they can obtain almost any rate of interest they desire on such an investment, to the prejudice of the common stock, and per - haps to the public also. The Commission should know how the pro - ceeds of the bonds are used by the company, and the foregoing restric- </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 425 tions are, so far as Is shown by this evidence, within the reasonable dls cretion of the Commission. The conditions that the company shall bring actions to recover divi - dends heretofore paid, and shall pay no more dividends on certain com - mon stock, and shall take steps to cancel such stock, cannot be upheld. The Commission has evidently devoted great care in an attempt to do justice to the company and to the public. We have found it wrong in regard to some difficult constructions of the constitution and statutes, above specified; when these are corrected there is no doubt that just conclusions will be reached. As these several applications have been by us considered together, it seems best that the Commission shall have nn opportunity to consider the whole contention "de novo" In the light of the construction of the law that we have indicated. And. for that reason, the orders in the three several applications are re - versed and all remanded for the further consideration of the Commis - sion. Reversed and Remanded.

Hall et al, Defendants. The parties will of course understand that upon this hearing the court can make no finding as to what would be a reasonable rate. That question can only be determined upon final hearing upon the evidence. The only purpose of this hearing is to makp such order as may be warranted, if any, a? will preserve the property rights of the complain - ant pending final hearing. As a general rule, all that the court can de - termine upon an application for a temporary injunction is. whether or not the application is made in good faith, and whether upon the affi - davits presented there is a reasonable showing made justifying the claims of the complainant. Each person is entitled to his day in court upon any proposition which he may assert and where it is made to appear to a court of equity that property rights are in Jeopardy pending the hearing of his case a party is entitled to an order which will protect his "property rights until final hearing, if this can be done without damage to the other parties affected by the order.

I The court, however, desires to limit the inconvenience to the public far as possible, and to require the payment only of such amount any) as will safely protect the complainant in its claimed rights. Everyone can see the necessity and justice of such an order where the facts are sufficient. If, as claimed by complainant, the present rate Is not compensatory, if its property is being confiscated under the pres - ent rate and this confiscation continues for the period pending the liti - gation before the Commission and possibly before the courts, and if the complainant should ultimately succeed in establishing its contentions, it would be helpless to recover from the public any portion of the addi - tional rate which it was found to be entitled to. It would be imprac - tical to bring action against the various people using the utility to re - cover the additional rate which should have been paid; in fact, there is no legal redress if the complainant is right in its contentions except by a temporary injunction. I But in view of the serious contention of the defendants in this case, feel that it would be advisable to appoint a Special Master qualified make investigation and computation, to report to us a finding as to i questions in issue. Of course, such finding can only be an approxi - tion and should be a finding as to what amount or rate will fairly &gt;roximate the maximum rate which the complainant may be able to ablish upon final hearing. We therefore make the following ORDER tAnd now, on this 14th day of July, 1919, in the above entitled case, IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that William G.

Hall et al. As heretofore indicated, this hearing involves no question of fixing of rates but only the question of maintaining the rights of the plaintiff pending final hearing upon its application now before the Railway Com - mission of the State of Nebraska. After submission it was deemed advisable to appoint a Special Master, not with any view of having his findings made a part of the record in this case, for final hearing or for any other purpose except as advisory to the Court with reference to the issues now before the Court. The plaintiff is contending that upon final hearing it can estab - lish certain facts and the Special Master was appointed with a view of investigating the good faith and reasonableness of the contentions of the plaintiff. The Court does not follow, in the order here made, the findings of the Master, but the Court realizes that if upon final hearing the plain - tiff should be able to establish the facts found by the Master it would suffer severe and substantial loss unless protected by a temporary order as prayed. </seg>
            <seg id="p428">428 TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT Certain objections to the appointment of the Master and the find - ing* of the Master have been filed but in view of the foregoing such objections must be overruled. The fact that the objections to the ap - pointment were not filed until after the report of the Master was made Justifies the overruling of such objections aside from the foregoing MMH, It is now apparent to the Court that the plaintiff is entitled to an order restraining the enforcement of the rates heretofore fixed by the Board or any of the penalties provided by orders of the Board or the law. While if the Master's conclusions are well founded a higher rate might be justified, we feel that we ought to fix as the maximum charge by the plaintiff pending final hearing the amounts fixed in the order: Six cents straight on its entire system, with the following exceptions: t Seven cents each way between Lincoln and Harelock, Lincoln and ersity Place, Lincoln and Bethany, Lincoln and Normal, Lincoln College View; between Havelock and Bethany, Havelock and Nor- Havelock and College View; between University Place and Beth- University Place and Normal, University Place and College View; een Normal and College View; all other termini not included in paragraph shall be considered as Lincoln. » Seven tickets for twenty-five cents shall be sold to school children use in the city of Lincoln. The parties will understand that we are not fixing a rate. We are merely, as a condition of the injunction issued, fixing the foregoing as the maximum charge which shall not be exceeded by the plaintiff during the pendency of further proceedings or until further orders The Court believes that it is the duty of the plaintiff so far as practical to adopt a method of selling tickets within the maximum rates, making some slight reduction for purchase of five or more tickets, for the convenience of the public.

In fixing the rates at any particular time, former earnings and probable prospective earnings should always be considered with a view to so adjust the rates as to prevent extortion and allow a fair average ti. The law contemplates that the findings and orders should be s in the first instance by the commission, which has powers of its that the courts may not usurp. Its orders will not be reversed un - clearly wrong. I. The act, known as the railway commission act, Laws 1907, Ch. M, p. 311 (Rev. St. 1913, beginning at section 6104), gives exclusive original Jurisdiction of cases, like this, involving the rates of common carriers, to the state railway commission, and is not changed by the provisions of the Omaha charter. CORNISH, J. I The state railway commission denied the application of the plaintiff st railway company for an increase of its fares from five to seven s. Plaintiff appeals. The application is denominated by the plaintiff as one for emerg - ency or temporary rates, due to conditions brought about by the war, causing a large and unexpected increase in wages and cost of material and supplies, making it temporarily impossible for the company to con - tinue paying its fixed charges and a return upon the reasonable value of its property. </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 431 At the hearing the commission ruled that emergency rates would not be justified except as a condition is shown which, it not relieved from, will imperil the property of the company and its service to the public, — such as might subject the company at once to proceedings in bankruptcy or receivership; that mere Inability to make profits or pay dividends would not create an emergency. The plaintiff company, be - sides insisting that the condition shown was one which imperiled the utility, also contended that a temporary rate should be granted when it becomes clear that the revenues are not sufficient to pay dividends. In ordinary cases the view taken by the commission, as to when an emergency rate should be allowed, is correct. The fundamental in - quiry in fixing rates always is: What rate is necessary in order to yield a reasonable average return on a fair valuation of the property for rate-making purposes, — such a return as will not discourage but will attract the investment of capital in the utility. It is desirable, if possible, before changing the rates, to know all of the facts, so that the rates may not be temporary and fluctuating. Under the constitution and laws of this state, the commission has a wide discretion in these matters. Even though present financial conditions 1 , prices and wages (showing almost unprecedented changes), together with the financial condition of the plaintiff company, do not show a situation which would be technically denominated an emergency, yet. if they do show a situation which makes it altogether probable that the past and present rate is insufficient to yield a revenue which will pay that fair average return which the law supposes, the commission is empowered, and it may be its duty to permit a temporary rate, limited to the time required for making an investigation and finding of the value of the property. If it should happen that the temporary rate so fixed is too high, the condition can be rectified in the order fixing the rate after investigation. The purpose of the law being to allow those, who voluntarily furnish the necessary capital to install and operate such public utilities, a fair average return upon the value of the property so devoted to the public use, and to prevent unreasonable profits; in fixing the rate at any particular time, former earnings and probable pros - pective earnings 1 should always be considered with a view to so adjust the rate as to prevent extortion and allow such fair average return. In the instant case, we believe it is not altogether certain that the street railway company can continue paying present wages and high prices for material, and at the same time meet its obligations and maintain its credits, and it is altogether probable that it cannot make profits and pay dividends If we could assume that a five-cent fare was a reasonable charge before the war, we would know that it is not a reasonable charge under present conditions, because we would take Judicial knowledge of the (act that the exchange value of the dollar ha3 lessened, at least temporarily. </seg>
            <seg id="p432">TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT 432 We will not go Into an extended discussion of the financial condi - tion of the plaintiff company. The plaintiff's evidence would indicate that since the pre-war period, 1914. there have been increases in the wages of the company's 1,200 employees, amounting to $740,000 annual - ly; that taxes have increased $117,000; that these items, together with increased cost of coal, freight charges, material and supplies, will in - crease the amount of annual expenditures for operating expenses and repairs in the year 1919, over the year 1914, in the sum of approxi - mately $1,321,518. Prom this increase should be deducted the in - creased income to the company from passenger travel, which in the jrear 1918 was $426,575.13 in excess of that for 1914. Fcr 1919 the ex - ceas will be greater, possibly from $150,000 to $200,000 greater. The income from passenger travel for the year 1918 for both Iowa and Nebraska division of the road was approximately $3,214,000; for 1914 It wag $2,787,424. The total revenues for 1918 were $3,3:&gt;9.1ir. 93 and the expenditures for that year, which included: taxes $320,638.84, rent of leased roads $150,900, interest on bonded debt $480 9r&gt;0, and miscel - laneous $6,025, amounted to $3,289,319.22. This would leave a net in - come for 1918 of $69,796.71. The figures are somewhat in dispute the company putting the net income at $40,150. The operating expenses for 1918 were $2,330,805.38. For 1914 the operating expenses were $1,608,231. The increase in operating expenses for the year 1919. as above Indicated, would be much in excess of those for 1918 because the increase in wages, following the order of the national war labor board, did not go into effect until July 17, 1918. The net income, above shown, of from $40,000 to $70,000 for the year 1918 makes no allowance for dividends ($399,600), but includes other deductions. It is contended by the plaintiff company that for the year 1919 there must be a deficit In the sum of $422,600; that the fixed charges and obligations of the company cannot be met. This is disputed by the defendants, who con - tend that to show such a deficit the plaintiff has estimated the opent ing expenses to be $2,467,000 for 1918, and $2 929,750 for 1919; that $200,000 of this increase for 1919 is in addition to the $300,000 allowed for 1918 for the depreciation account. It is contended that the actual money needed for this account, instead of being $500,000, has- never been in excess of $170,000. It is further contended that the statement showing the deficit for 1919 makes no allowance for increased passenpei fares which will in all probability be over $200,000. Attention is also called to the fact that the evidence shows 1 that the company his other operating revenues which have increased annually !n about the sum of $15,000 since 1914. It is argued that instead of a deficit there will be a net Income of $200,000 for the year 1919. Just what the situation is, it is difficult to say. It would seem that no wrong would be done which could not be corrected, in allowing such increase in fares as would make the company secure against in - solvency for a temporary period. Insolvency might do permanent in- </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 433 Jury to the utility, for which. In the long run, the people would have to suffer. No great risk of that should be taken. Besides, any appearance of disregard of the company's rights in this respect lays the public and the authorities open to the charge of attempting to confiscate the prop - erty of the utility company. Now, we believe, without the slightest hesi - tation, that neither the commission nor the public nor any community in this state, if left free to act, would, from greed or ignorance, ever desire to take the property of the utility without compensation. They know that in the loss of these utilities the people would suffer most. The state must be careful to do nothing which may rightfully take away from it that valuable right of Jurisdiction and control over its local property and institutions. While there was some evidence bearing upon the valuation of the utility, we agree with the commission that there was not sufficient upon which to base any permanent rate. The law contemplates that the findings and orders should be made in the first instance by the commis - sion, which has powers of its own that the courts may not usurp. Its orders will not be reversed unless clearly wrong. We are of opinion that the commission was right in ordering that a hearing be had for the purpose of taking evidence with a view to fixing the valuation of the property for rate-making purposes, and that, pend. ing such hearing, the commission should award such raise in fares as would make the company secure against possible insolvency; that such rates so fixed should be temporary, abiding only the investigation ordered. Apparently, a rate of six cents for a single ticket and ten tickets ofr 55 cents would not be improper, but the exact rate is for the commission to order. Public service corporations naturally keep in view the value of the service to the user and what charge the traffic will bear. The public (and the courts, too) inquire: What has been the cost of the service to the utility? Capital can be attracted to these enterprises only as there is confidence that fair returns, under reasonably capable man - agement, will be allowed. The profits of most business enterprises depend largely upoi. the amount of business done. This is peculiarly true nf railroads and street railway companies. When the plant is ready for operation the great cost of the service has been Incurred. Additional cost, due to erer-increaslng business, Is insignificant compared with the increasing income. The public have always anticipated and may properly antici - pate decreasing rates as population and business increase. A fair wage must be paid to employees and a fair return must be paid to those whose capital is invested. L Complaint is made by the plaintiff company of the attitude of the tnissioners, or pome of them, or their manner of conducting the hearing. We admit that it is a little startling to the lawyer, bred In </seg>
            <seg id="p434">434 the courts, who Is submitting bis controversy to a body having Judicial powers, to see a member of that body conduct a cross-examination and hear him express opinion upon the merits before the case is finally submitted. Not only is impartiality the supreme virtue of courts as ministers of the law, but the courts have always recognized that their functions can be best exercised and protected under conditions which exclude any invasion of the partisan or personal element or the appear - ance of it. Accordingly, they have been hedged about by forms and rules calculated to inspire the greatest respect for the position the Judge occupied. That which may appear to be anomalous inheres more or less in the nature of the proceeding and the unusual powers vested in the state railway commission. The division of the powers of the state into legislative, executive and judicial is natural. Aristotle pointed out long ago the difficulties and dangers of lodging law-mak - ing powers in the executive department of government. Courts, as such, know only adversary parties and are unsuited to the work of commissions. The state railway commission is clothed with certain legislative. Judicial and administrative powers, but a review of its action is reserved to the courts. In the exercise of its legislative and administrative powers, it must be that it exercise those functions, and hence conduct for itself those investigations which will enable it to legislate wisely. It must be permitted to see to it that the evidence — c Binary is adduced, and to take the legislator's attitude as to what the law should be. The commission, as a co-ordinate department of the state, acts independently. In the exercise of its prerogatives, it is not subject to dictation or criticism by the courts except as what transpires may be a proper subject of review, as bearing upon the orders or judg - ments of the commission. The courts, ordinarily, in reviewing the work of arbitration boards and commissions, give ready attention to any complaint on the part of either of the parties that the body hearing the matter was actuated by any feeling of bias or prejudice, or other improper motive. The commission is free to adopt its own rules and course of procedure, and to do everything necessary to inspire and bring about absolute respect for it and its Judgments. It may preserve decorum and under some circumstances may punish for contempt. Being, in fact, neutral as between the parties, and conducting its hear - ings not exparte nor as a partisan .debate between it and either of the parties it may avoid all appearance of bias or prejudice. Upon review of the record in this case, we find nothing to indicate that the commis - sion has been actuated by any desire other than to do justice to the utility, on the one hand, and the public on the other. Defendant city of Omaha raises the issue whether jurisdiction for determining rates is not, by law, vested in the city council of Omaha. A part only of the plaintiff's lines are within the limits of the c'ty of Omaha. The act, known as the railway commission act, Laws 1907, Ch. 90, p. 311 (Rev.

The order of the state railway commission, denying any Increase of rates, is reversed, and the cause remanded to the commission, with instructions to order an increase of rates, the same to be temporary only and continue until such time as is necessary after an investigation and hearing before the commission to determine what rate Is right and proper under the facts of the case.

MORRISSEY, C. J This Is a proceeding, in the nature of an appeal, to vacate an order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, fixing the rate which the Union Stock Yards Company may charge for grain and feeding service at its yards in Omaha. The order was made under the authority of sections 134 and 135, Rev. St. 1913, which read as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p436">436 « Section 134. "The term 'stockyards' as used herein shall mean and embrace all corporations, individuals, associations of individuals, their Imiccs, trustees or receivers (appointed by any court of lawful author - ity, whatsoever), that now or hereafter may own, operate, manage or control any yards and pens, railroad tracks, switches, engines or other motive power, for the purpose of handling live stock in transit and for •ale; and all stockyards are hereby declared to be common carriers." I Section 135. "The State Railway Commission shall have power to s orders regulating service and charges of all kinds' at all stock - s." The stockyards company Insists that the order in this case is in - valid because the provisions of the statute upon which it is based are unconstitutional. It is claimed that the sections set out deny to ap - pellant the equal protection of the law, and constitute class legislation. The contention is that the statute in question does not allow the Rail - way Commission to regulate the service charges of all public feeding and shipping yards in the state, but only of those which also maintain common carrier facilities; that appellant is the only stockyards com - pany in the state doing a common carrier business; that this fact fur - nishes no basis for a classification in the regulation of yard or pen charges; and that it is therefore discriminatory to allow the fixing of service rates at appellant's yards, and not at those of other companies engaged in the same line of enterprise. While it is true that section 134 may be susceptible of the interpre - tation placed upon it by appellant, it is equally capable of another and less questionable construction. No reason is apparent why the terms of this statute should not be read disjunctively, so as to subject to state regulation the service charges of all companies maintaining either feed - ing pens and yards, tracks, switches, or all of these facilities, "for the purpose of handling live stock in transit and for sale." There is noth - ing inharmonious with this view of the statute, unless it be the final clause of section 134, which provides that "all stockyards are hereby de - clared to be common carriers." If, however, the power to regulate feed- Ing charges at stockyards cannot be conferred upon the Railway Com - mission, except by reason of a common carrier capacity, it cannot be conferred at all in this case, since mere legislative denomination can - not constitute an enterprise a common carrier. And certainly feeding, watering and caring for shipments of live stock, for an independent con - sideration, are not within the scope of a common carrier's duty, nor subject to regulation as such. Union Stock Yard* Co. v. United States, 169 Fed. 404. Since the right of the state in this case must be deter - mined without regard to the common carrier designation of the legisla - ture, this provision of the statute may be disregarded. The construction of the statute announced is effective of legislative intent, and will therefore be adopted in preference to that suggested by </seg>
            <seg id="p437">437 appellant. It is the policy of the courts to uphold rather than over - throw legislative action. Hence, sections 134, 135, Rev. St. 1913, can - not be said to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, by denying to ap - pellant the equal protection of the law. But though the statute in question is non-discriminatory as be - tween the stockyards companies of the state, the question arise? whether it is constitutionally within the power of the state thus arbi - trarily to fix the charges in this particular line of business. That stock - yards are so affected with a public interest as to be subject to the inherent police power of the state, and to a regulation of charges by governmental authority, seems to us (incontrovertible. Ratcliffe v. Wichita Union Stock Yard* Co., 74 Kan. 1. If, then, the state has the power to regulate these charges, how may it exercise such power? Appellant urges that the fixing of rates is wholly a legislative function which cannot be delegated. While this is true as a general proposition, yet statutes delegating to an admin - istrative commission power to fix rates for public service corporations have generally been held not to violate any principle of constitutional law. State Public Utilities Commission v. Chicago A W. T. R. Co., 275 111. 555, Ann. Cas. 1917C. p. 50, and notes; Village of Saratoga Springs v. Saratoga Gat, Electric Light A Power Co* 191 N. Y. 123, 18 L. R. A. n. s. 713, and notes, 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Ann. Cas. 606, and notes following. In this state, however, the Railway Commission is a body organized under the Constitution for the purpose of supervising and regulating common carriers, and it is said that this constitutional authority cannot be extended by statute so as to make it an administrative body for the purpose of stockyards regulation. But there is nothing in the con - stitutional duties of such commission incompatible with its serving as a body for the fixing and control of stockyards charges. And, indeed, the legislature, having the power to create a body for this purpose, might well appoint the members of the Railway Commission to serve in such capacity. We now pass to a consideration of the order itself. By the terms thereof the Railway Commission directed appellant to "determine the price of corn to be charged to feeders of corn at its yards in South Omaha for the current calendar month paid by said Union Stock Yards Company for the corn received at South Omaha for the calendar month immediately preceding the current month for which the price per bushel of corn is determined." In its finding of fact the Commission found: "In addition to the price paid for corn at South Omaha, there is an actual out-of-pocket cost to the applicant for the handling and placing of the corn in the feeding pens, which for the purpose of this temporary arrangement the Commission places at ten cent? per bushel. The amount just named may be added by the applicant to the price of the corn for the current month.*' </seg>
            <seg id="p438">438 Thus It will be seen that under this temporary order, which on final hearing was made permanent, appellant was allowed no profit what - ever for handling the corn, nor reimbursement for the use of the prop - erty employed in feeding and distributing the corn. It is suggested that in finding "out-of-pocket" cost, the Commission took into consideration the value of the use of the property employed in feeding the corn, but the finding itself does not seem to bear out this contention. The com - pany furnished proof of the usual charges in stockyards in other states, and insists that this is prlma facie proof of what is a reasonable rate In this case. The statute so provides. Rev. St. 1913, Sec. 6127. An order that permits appellant to make a charge having regard for the market price, plus such sum as the Commission may find from all the evidence will allow a proper net return on the investment, is more likely to do justice to all parties than an order based on a monthly average. Appellant is entitled to the value of its corn at the time of sale, without regard to the price at which the corn may have been pur - chased at some remote date. The mere fact that the stockyards, a month before, paid more for the corn than it is worth when sold to the shipper is no reason why he should be charged more than the com - modity is worth on the day he buys. The order in this case was made during the war period, wher abnormal conditions were prevailing. In furtherance of Justice the order is set aside and the cause remanded so that the Commission may make such further Investigation and enter such order as may be Reversed. CORNISH. J., not sitting. following opinion on motion for rehearing was filed May 3, . Former opinion modified, and rehearing denied. PER CURIAM. KOn motion for rehearing our attention has been called to the follow - statement in the opinion: 'The company furnished proof of the usual charges in stockyards in other states, and insists that that is prima facie proof of what is a reasonable rate in this case. The statute so provides. Rev. St. 1913, section 6127." The point is made that the statute cited was passed in 1907 as part of the legislation applying to railroads, and that the stockyards statute (Rev. St. 1913, 134-138) was not passed until 1911. It appears that sec - tion 6127 does not apply to stockyards unless they are performing the functions of common carriers. Our opinion is modified to this extent, and the motion for rehearing is Overruled. </seg>
            <seg id="p439">439 PART V Engineering Department Lincoln, Nebraska, December 31, 1919. Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen : The numerous applications which have been filed with the Com- mission by telephone companies for increases in rates have required a large number of inventories and appraisements of the physical prop- erties of the applicants. This has called for a careful count and in- spection in the field in each case. We have also made quite a number of inventories and appraisements of telephone properties for use in connection with the new accounting system adopted by the Commission for telephone companies. Our small force engaged for this line of work has not been able to keep up with the demand. The construction of transmission lines, the applications for which are checked in this department, have gone forward during the past year notwithstanding the high prices of material and scarcity of labor. The following list of telephone companies' will show the properties which have been inventoried and appraised during the year. The list of transmission lines will show the light and power companies who have constructed transmission lines, which have been checked and approved by this department. The service complaints set out below also Include inspection trips for various purposes as requested by the Commission. Telephone Inventories Company Town Amherst Ind.
