            <seg id="p002">To His Excellency, Governor E. P. Savage, and the Honorable Board of Public Lands and Buildings: As the time for the Seventh Biennial Report of the Nebraska Industrial Home is due, will you kindly allow me to submit for your consideration the advancement in our work, and also some of our needs which I trust you will kindly approve of. I am, very respectfully, Margaret Kbaly, Superintendent. </seg>

            <seg id="p005">/ GENERAL INFORMATION. It is needless for me to say that the Home is answering the object for which it was originated, that is to shelter, protect and help reform those wayward, unfortunate girls who seek the pro - tection of the Home. Our object is to help them to better lives. In the first place by good examples; secondly, by good moral, mental and physi - cal training. Over five hundred and fifty adults have been received and cared for in the Home. A large per cent have reformed and gone out to lives of respectability and usefulness. I would suggest that the term be lengthened, as one year is rather short considering the magnitude of the reform necessary in some cases. DISCIPLINE. I have not so far been obliged to resort to any severe meas - ures to receive prompt attention and obedience. With some obedience is foreign to them, never having been under any kind of discipline before coming to the Home. The government of the Home is such as to engender self-respect by giving the inmates the respect due them and requiring them to respect each other as well as the ones in charge. By establishing true self - respect, we are sure to engender the essential principles of morality. INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT. The work of this department is to teach system and thorough - ness. The inmates are detailed to the following departments: Laundry; cooking, plain; cooking, pastry; dormitories; and general management. Their promotion from these separate departments depends on their efficiency to do the work. Each serves as head girl in the departments they work up in under direction of the matron. I am not able at any time to fill the applications I have for competent help. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">266 EDUCATIONAL. We have a well organized school. The branches taught are: Reading, spelling, arithmetic, geography, language, composi - tion and history and penmanship. The largest enrollment dur - ing the year 1902 was thirty-two; the largest attendance any one day, twenty-seven; the average daily attendance in school, ten. When it is practicable, and we have girls whose ambition it is to fit themselves for teachers, the higher branches are taught. In connection with the Home we have our Sunday school, con - ducted by one of the officers or employees; also Sunday even - ing service. During the week we have a short chapel service each evening. Twice a month Mr. Berkey or Mr. Morgan, of Milford, gratuitously tender their services. We feel deeply grateful and indebted to them, and we feel we should show our appreciation in a more substantial way than by thanks. SKWING ROOM. One of the industries of the Home is the sewing room. Those who desire to earn their support by sewing, are given every advantage in that line; all are required to spend as much time as possible in this department and have every advantage to at least do good plain sewing. A large number of the girls when admitted to the Home, have little or no knowledge of sewing, that with daily practice have become quite proficient with the needle. REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS. Lin repairing we have done the best we could with what means e had, where it was the most needed and would be 'the most beneficial to all concerned. We have had the north wing nursery wainscoted, painted, calsomined and otherwise im - proved. The worn-out wooden cribs have been replaced by white iron ones; we are having the dormitory in the same build - ing plastered, the floors repaired, and will replace the worn-out wooden beds that were there with new iron beds. In each building we have done all that was possible to do (with our limited means). In repairing the water system, we found many </seg>
            <seg id="p007">-Nebraska Industrial iIomk. 267 pipes that had been injured by freezing or otherwise, that had been cut off and plugged up instead of repairing them as they should have been. The engine, enginehouse and boilers are badly in need of repair, as also the cottage and barn. I would suggest having an addition to the cottage, so the farmer and engineer can be taken care of there I would also suggest the enginehouse be moved back the proper distance from the main buildings, be rebuilt and a good water system be put in, so as to give us the proper protection in case of fire. Should fire occur under existing circumstances, the Home would be a com- plete loss to the state. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. The governor's kind interest we appreciate greatly ; also the careful attention the Board of Public Lands and Buildings have given the accounts of the institution, the interest and kindness of the advisory board. To the pastors of Milford who have preached to us and given us assistance in other ways we are especially grateful, and to the business men of Milford. I want to thank my helpers who by their earnest, harmonious work have helped me to bring the institution to its present high standard as a Home. The present salary of each officer is as follows Per Annum. Superintendent $800.00 Physician 700.00 Matron 500 00 EMPLOYES.
