We feel proud to state that we had an increase in our attendance while many other state fairs in the middle west circuit ran below their attendance of the previous year. The state fair receipts were approximately ns follows: total re - ceipts ?!&gt;4,7. 5.20, total expenditures $74,619.74; this shows a balance of ,20,178.46. While the 19.16 State Fair shows a profit of $20,000 it has been necessary to use this amount and some of our balance at the beginning of Die year to take care of the material and labor bills in - curred by the many improvements and the WPA projects that were worked out on the State Fair Grounds. This method of getting all of this work done at a nominal expense to lhe Nebraska State Fair Association was a God send at this time. liider (he small stale appropriation for maintenance that we have been receiving it would have been impossible to have made these improvements this summer. j„ as much as the state appropriation for maintenance was cut to $10.0(10 per year for this biennium, and by January iirst we will have paid out approximately $..1,139.57 in 19.!. for maintenance. In addition to this we have turned over to the First Trust Company $1 &#132;S9 _.S9 for the grandstand bondholders. The major improvements on the Nebraska State Fair Grounds in 19:: ii included on.- mile of pay,-,! streets, lis.ooo square feet of paint - in?. rehuildh_._ horse barns, repairs and now roofs on some of the building:., low-ring 0 | water mains and sewer lines, and a lot of other work which was made possible by taking advantage of some of the government projects that were available. In addition to tl„. improvements we have doubled our Percentage win tin carnival on shows and rides which did and will mean quite an increase in dollars for the Fair. »ef.,r.. bringing mv few remarks to a close.

I have made quite a good many reports—or, I should say I hao served on the auditing committee quite a number of times, and I think this report gives me more real satisfaction from the State Fair standpoint than most of them that we have had during the long term of years that I have been connected with the State Fair. You know 1,777 qUUe the tWng ' qUit6 C°mmon here ln ?ears P"t when we audited the accounts to find a bunch of notes for borrowed money that was necessary to conduct the fair during the year. This time there are none, no money has been borrowed during the year, and there are no notes to be paid to any banks. I might say, in addition to that, that all State Fair maintenance claims, everything, has been paid to January Ist. The expenditures during the past year for maintenance, we And reached J31.756.37. All the receipts iv this departmen amounted to only ?11,947.38, and of this amount $10,000.00 was the : ae g !, PP;; P* t lm; th. la meant th&lt;" «» difference had to be paid, of 119,809 00, that went into this maintenance department. It is a very splendid showing, and I think that the report this year is therefore very satisfactory. I should say that it was necessary to pay the differ - ence, I don't know whether I made that plain or not, of ?19,809 out of </seg>

In many ways it was the most successful that has been held since the depres - sion! In spite of the fact that the state had one of the most destructive drouths in its history, the agricultural exhibits were of em. excellent quality and the numbers surprisingly large. The exhibits of live stock were of course much smaller than in the years before7the drouth. In no part of the stale's affairs has the drouth, shown Its .affects more forcibly than in the pure bred live stock industry. Oh account of the shortage and high price' of feed, many of the farmers and live stock breeders who have been our most faithful exhibitors for many years, have been compelled | to sell or give up their breeding stock, which means a distinct loss not only to the Fair, hut to the state at large. Others have lost their farms from foreclosures and in many cases the farmers, as well as many others, have had to apply to the federal government for financial aid. All these conditions in an agri - cultural state like Nebraska, curtail the exhibits and also attendance. .'.-'.'.- Draft Horses : ¦'.. ''¦¦¦"': '..'¦•;- [.-..- In the draft horse show the Percheron show was not as good as in I :. 1 ¦ _ 1935, but the Belgian class was much better with more entries than in 1935. There were not as many ponies in the pony classes as in former years. The one day colt show put on by Mr. Frisbie in Class R— Club Work, had only two counties represented, Gage and Hamilton, with 11 entries in the class under one year and only 3 entries in the over one year and under two class. </seg>

[The Agricultural exhibit ¦was"Very, good considering climatic conditions. There were more entries than in 1935 with many changes in the arrangement of the exhibits from the previous year as the premium list was revised and the Central Idea Exhibit was discontinued, i The Horticultural exhibit was jery good although the fruit crop in many places was damaged by hail and dry weather.

Government Exhibits The exhibits put on by the WPA and CCC organizations as well as the Library Commission and Safety Council which were housed in the old dining hall on Dunham Avenue, were interesting and were viewed by a great many people. State Institutions Exhibit The exhibits put on by the state institutions were up to the usual standard and were very popular. Veteran's Day and Auto Races Veteran's Day with the auto races on the opening day brought one of the largest crowds at the Fair, with the bands, drum corps and drill teams with their flags and colors, added much to the splendor of the occasion. But unfortunately rain came and the program for the night had to be declared off. The auto races in the afternoon were well received. Children's Day Children's Day, which was a new feature this year, was held on Tuesday and brought a large crowd of youngsters and their parents to the Fair. Much interest was manifested in the giving away of the Sheltland pony and the articles donated by the business firms in the City of Lincoln. The rural school chorus and the spelling contest were also attractions for the day. Baby Health Contest The baby health contest was again held on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings of the Fair. Prize winners were announced on Friday afternoon. One hundred ninety-five babies were entered this year with five sets of twins, the largest twin class for many years. The grand champion boy scored 98.8%, the girl 98.2% and the high scoring twins averaged 97.3%.

The other nights they put on a fine performance but were not very well patronized. We have since learned that this same show played at several other large fairs to record crowds each night. I Midway After two years absence the Beckmann-Gerety Shows were back on the midway as they were contracted for by all the state fairs in the Middle West Circuit. This is one of the largest and best companies in the business and furnished the visitors with the latest variety of rides and Other features. Omaha Six-Horse Team . ... '•¦¦ .

They were always willing to play any place we desired. .--) ¦ .' Racing.' The running races with the pari-mutuels were an attraction that brought the attendance of many people nearly every day that would not have otherwise attended. The horses as a whole were of a much higher class than, in former years and many of them went on to Kansas City,(Texas and New Orleans and were winners there. A number of other state fairs that! do not have laws permitting pari-mutuel bet - ting are having bills presented to their legislative bodies permitting it at their fairs. ¦ v ¦ Beauty Pageant ¦" The Beauty Pageant was one of the big attractions of the Fair. With the pageants held in the different sections of the state, the Fair received a vast amount of publicity that they could not receive in any other way.

While it would still be a hardship on the Board, the lowering of the interest rate would make It possible to pay some on the principle each year. Improvements One of the improvements that was appreciated very much by the patrons of. the Fair was the paving on the main streets of the Fair Grounds. This was accomplished through a WPA project' and by the Board assuming a certain amount as sponsors arid the WPA furnishing a larp share of the. labor arid material. Putting this in made it necessary to change water and sewer pipes, also electric and trans - mission lines with an expense of much new material and labor that had to be; borne by the Fair Board. One new show horse barn 32x140 feet with a cross section leading toward the Coliseum was a new improvement, also an extension 40 feet on the end of each of the other three horse barns; this places all of the draft and show horses down by thp Coliseum and these barns are good for many years service Several hundred feet of side walk was relaid. The old entrances to the coliseum were torn out and the old wooden sections were replaced with brick .and.new doors. The inside fence, to the race track was raised repaired and painted, A new judges stand was built and put on the side of the race track next to the grandstand. About $800.00 worth of paint was put on various buildings. One of the WPA projects was for grading and moving dirt which had be.en thrown to the side by the sanitary sewer district project, a very large amount of WPA funds was expended on this project and improved the looks and worth of the grounds. Putting over a successful Fair Is not a one man job as some might think and I appreciate the fine cooperation we have had from the members of the State Board of Agriculture, county fair people, exhibit - ors, and all those connected with the organization.

         <seg id="p033">REPORT OR NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . I - some of George Jackson's poetry that he has written know that there is going to be a good deal in that book that is going to be worth read - ing, aud it seems to me, I don't want to be classed as taking up a business as a publishing man, but I am only too glad to here and now leave that thought with you men; wouldn't it be a good idea that at least every county fair, board in the state of Nebraska made it a business to get a copy as soon as if is off the press. (Applause). I don't believe that you will have anybody in "your county that would' find any fault because you have taken that couple of dollars out of your treasury of your fair to have a works like that in your records for your officers and your people that are identified with and interested in your fair to have an opportunity to read that book. That book should remain with the files of the officers of your county fair, who - ever, they may be, in the: future. And I think myself, men, that we could do no less than to show our appreciation to George Jackson for the labors that lie no doubt has put into this work. I have heard him say to men "I would like to send you the book, and if you don't like it you can send it back". Well, now, I don't think George had ought to do that; still I certainly believe that when you get that book you are going to keep it. You can put it in your libraries in your town; that,book is going to be something that the people of Nebraska, as well as people all over this country will appreciate. Mr. President, I want to thank you for giving me permission, and I know that you will agree with me that we are all glad to recognize George Jackson as a past member in our State Fair in Nebraska. PRESIDENT VANCE: Just keep the change. Charley; MR. PURCELL: I didn't expect to say anything until after I heard Charley Graff tell some of the things George Jackson has done; I just can't agree with him. He referred to George Jackson as a poet, I don't agree with him. I can recall that George Jackson, among his other poems, wrote one on me which was entitled "How Purcell Spilled the Cranberry Sauce"; but along with it I :have had the privilege of reading the advance copy of the—of his description of the fairs and expositions, and I want to say that George Jackson has made a deep study of the subject; not only that but he knows the game when it comes to talk - ing about fairs, expositions, county fairs and state fairs, and that other information that is so valuable to the fair board and educational along all lines of fairs and expositions. I have already ordered two of those books. We are going to put one in our library at Broken Bow. and we are also going to have one in the secretary's : office. After you go through it you find that it has a fund of information that will be of value to us. He speaks in one place about the many "Don'ts" of build - ing a! grandstand; it goes into that line of work that is so interesting, and is going to be so acceptable to the fair boards of the state. </seg>
         <seg id="p034">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I think this book has real value, and I think it should be in the fairs, not only in Nebraska, but should have a place in the fairs all over the country, and in the libraries and educational institutions. I look for it to be in the schools; and I certainly hope it will be in the hands of the fair boards of the county fairs of Nebraska. PRESIDENT VANCE: That is mighty fine, Mr. Purcell, but what's bothering me the least bit, I believe I heard Mr. Jackson himself say yesterday that these books wouldn't be printed (If I get it wrong, George, your correct me I until about the 15th of April; and now Purcell gets up and says he's already read the book. MR. PURCELL: Just the manuscript, of some of it. J. E. PORTWOOD: I give George credit for a lot of things, but there is one little thing I want to bring before this gang; George said last night in a long speech before this body about this book that is to be off the press soon, and by the way he deals with every World's Fair from time immemorial, taking in also the Omaha Exposition in IS9B, which a lot of you fellows remember. George said last night "Now, if this hook don't suit any of you fellows you can send it back", but he didn't say a darn word about giving hack the two dollars and a half we are going to pay for it. PRESIDENT VANCE: lam going to give Mr. Jackson above five minutes. MR. JACKSON: Mr. Chairman, I sure appreciate what has been said here, whether it is so or not. In regard to this check that you are supposed to send me for the book; why that check will get hack to you sometime, I never issued a check in my life but what it came back. PRESIDENT VANCE: I believe that concludes the meeting today, and we will meet tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, and let's all be there promptly. A DELEGATE: I move that we adjourn. A DELEGATE: I second the motion. Vote taken, and motion declared carried. PRESIDENT VANCE: I forgot to announce that we are going to have a wonderful banquet tonight.

RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: We, your Committee on Resolutions, herewith submit the following report: Mr. R.

' A DELEGATE: I second the motion. Vote taken, and motion declared carried. MR. MEYERS: .Mr.' Chairman, Mr. L. I. Frisbie is here; he has just returned from Denver, where they had the Livestock Show. It might be interesting to hear from him. 7 PRESIDENT VANCE: Thai would be just fine. Mr. Frisbie, would you care to say a word or two? "''¦¦' ' MR. FRISBIE: Well,-1 did attend the Western Livestock Show, and onmy return I noted thafa resolution was presented in the County Fair Association relative to changing these dates of state'meetings so that we folks that.are interested in both could attend both. I. really hope that they, will; have something done about it, Mr! Vance,.because I do enjoy coming to these meetings and mingling with: the folks that are here, but. they called me out to Denver, where we. had 114 cattle and quite a number of sheep, I don't know the exact number, some - where near fifty, and a few hogs shown; at the Western Livestock Show in the 4-H.Club section from Nebraska. In addition.to, that there was quite a representation of open class, breeders. The high places went to other states this year, other than Nebraska/ Colorado, or Wyoming where they ordinarily go,,but w eareglad tosee .them passed around. You folks probably read in the paper that the Grand Champion steer ¦went^o Missouri, the Reserve to lowa, in 4-H. Club, class .'.the Champion went,to a girl from Newton, lowa, and the Reserve Champion 4-H wentjto Missouri; But there w.s a thing I was particularly proud of as far as our Nebraska 4-H folks were concerned, that is they were practically all in the ribhops; We didn't take but two first places, one first place in Angus came from _V febster county, and first place in Here - ford class came from Scotts Bl iff county, and. the Scotts.

         <seg id="p038">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE One interesting thing was that all the Vniversity of Nebraska live - stock, at the time I left, bad gone into the ribbons excepting two, and when we can make a consistent showing of that kind I think it is a record to be proud of. I don't know what Mr. Meyers had in mind that I would say up here, but I would like to tell you just a little of the 4-H Club work Let me assure you that we of the 4-H Club section of the Extension Service want to cooperate with county fairs and with the State Fair in every way possible. We are always glad to receive your suggestions and talk them over, and I am hoping that you will always be glad to listen to them: we may have suggestions for you sometimes that may not always fit, and that might be true of your suggestions, but we will try and work them out to the best of all concerned. I am particularly proud of Nebraska this year because they have increased the enrollment under the greatest drought conditions more than three thousand in the state this year, and in completion of projects we have raised it one and a half per cent, so we are very very proud of the boys and girls throughout the counties which you represent. I am hoping that next year we can get a bigger increase, for to me the boys and girls are much more important than the livestock and the crops, and I think the folks over the state realize that. As shown by this last year's record, the hardest feeding period, the hardest crop period we ever had, we had a greater per cent of the boys and girls finish the job they started out to do, and to me that is a real thing. When it comes to what they are doing, back at Chicago this year I think we pretty near established a record as a fourth rate state. When you consider that there were forty-three states competing in this inter - national contest maybe that is a pretty good record, but we did have five judging teams, and, by the way, I want to mention to you that Nebraska was the only state in the United States that entered every judging contest in the agricultural show in Chicago this year, and we Placed five fourth places, we placed another in second, we placed one in seventh, and two in ninth, so we are very very proud of our boys and girls. In our exhibits we went Into the ribbons with every exhibit ex - cepting one, we placed three in the red ribbon group, and we placed five In the blue ribbon group. I want to assure you that we want to cooperate with every county fair there is here, every fair that is represented, and we would like to cooperate with a lot of them that are not represented here, and we are going to do the very best we can for the boys and girls. I was interested last night in a remark that was made by the rep - resentative from Walthill relative to the encouragement of breeding classes, and I would like to say just a word about that if I may I don't know whether this State Board of Agriculture thinks as I do </seg>
         <seg id="p039">! REPORT OF NEBRASKaWtE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ' ;.¦ ¦ '..' ' .7 or not, but they will have a .chance, T think there; will be. plenty of time for them to say what they think about it after I. get through, but if they don't agree with me I.hope they will say so. T am referring to the talk about getting a class of breeding livestock in the Nebraska. State Fair, and we have been talking about it for a long long time. There are no immediate returns from breeding classes, like there is from the feeding classes, but if we can get the cooperation' of the older folks In the breeding classes I lelieve we will be doing one of the best things that we can possibly do. If those breeding classes are put into the shows, the county shows ah I the state shows, we want to be patient with them, because breeding ;attle don't grow out in one season. Another thing you want to .remember' is that when you put up a show of breeding livestock you are going to have to produce them and then you are going to have to carry 1 hem a little bit beyond the type of flesh at which you would want to k _p them at home; that is going to in - crease the expense to the boy and girl, and naturally you have got the expense of getting them back Lome. It is a big job, that's certain, so let's be patient with these boys and girls in the breeding classes. I really hope that we can get sone breeding classes, and then you folks that are breeders, let's be careful about this, don't expect to get them started in that class of livestock in a hurry. The big advantage, as was mentioned last night, is the establishment of foundation herds, and we certainly need the right kind. I was a little disappointed in what he said,.though, in limiting it to beef cattle, for I think there is just as big a problem in hogs at the present time as there is in beef cattle, and I think there is more opportunity for our boys and, girls to help out in the production of the right kind of hogs than cattle, their time is shorter, and the returns maY be obtained quicker, but I do think we are doing one thing, that; Ib establishing the right type of live, stock in the minds of our young people, and they are not going to be satisfied with scrub stock when they get older. Ijthank you, Mr. President, |or giving me this time, and I hope that I have said something that may be thought provoking to these men-here. PRESIDENT VANCE: Now, gentlemen, our secretary, Perry Reed, myself, and R. C. Johnson was the committee to go down to Chicago this winter, and I want to say lhat we came back with the same good contract with the carnival company. While down there our secretary took down some notes, and I am going to ask him to talk a little on the trip down to Chicago. Mr. Reed: SECRETARY REED: While we were down.there listening to the different talks by the different speakers on the program I jotted down a few outlines of what they said. ..-¦•.'-' Mr. Raymond Lee, the secretary of the Minnesota State Fair,, was present, and in his talk he brought out the fact very forcibly that'fairs </seg>
         <seg id="p040">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE had two commodities for sale, tickets and space, and if fairs gave away either one they were beating themselves. He brought out the fact that business firms would pay the newspapers many hundreds of dollars for Bpace which could only reach the paper's subscribers, yet object to paying a small portion of that for space at the fair where they would get the attention of many times that number of people. He also stressed the fact that there was a lot of business concerns that had different schemes of getting before the public; they had moving pictures, and they had different attractions, and that they came to the fair boards and represented that they were doing all this free and that they ought to be allowed the space without charge, and still, at the same time their object was to advertise their own proposition. Mr. E. E. Irwin, secretary of the Illinois State Fair, had the sub - ject of "Horse Racing and the Afternoon Grandstand". He made quite a talk on the proposition of whether grandstands could be filled suc - cessfully at the Illinois State Fair without harness racing, with a few good acts between, and so forth. Mr. R. D. Molesworth, publicity man of the Missouri State Fair was on the program: his subject was "The Importance of Free Attrac - tions and Publicity for Growing Fairs". He contended that these features could be made to pay not only for their own departments, but other departments of the fair. He stated that one of the features which brought out a record count for the first day of the Missouri State Fair was the giving away of a Shetland pony, and that one of the other chief attractions was the state beahty contest. Mr. Leo C. Daley—you will remember a year ago at your annual fair meetings he was to have appeared on the program here, but was de - tained on some account and did not appear; he was on the program as secretary of the Clay County Fair at Spencer, lowa. He advised that fair boards work with chambers of commerce, and other civic bodies - he declared that in either county or state fair work the main work was to put the fair up to the people in those organizations. He said that as a rule people demanded the best of acts, and that his board bought the best acts rather than a large number. It was his opinion that only about ten per cent of the people went to the fair especially to see the exhibits, and it was necessary to have a strong entertainment so they would have money to pay premiums of sufficient size to attract exhibitors. PRESIDENT VANCE: Does anyone alse have anything to say» Mr Purcell was so anxious to hear from a California fellow. I think I will let him talk in his place. MR. PURCELL:: I don't believe I have anything special to say at this time, but as we are putting in a little extra time to give the tellers a chance to make the count, I might ramble a little </seg>
         <seg id="p041">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I - ' ' I want to say this, continung some of the remarks that the secre - tary. Perry Reed, made; that-there are two things in any fair that are vitally important. Of course the program must be good, but Ido be - lieve that we could go into heavier publicity during the summer months prior to the State Fair. Of cou-se that is my hobby, the publicity game, or in other words newspaper work; there is a great deal of publicity that; can. be secured without a great deal of expense, from the news - papers, the country weeklies oi! the state, and I would like to see this coming year a greater effort _j_.de to get a continuous line of small notices calling the attention of the people to the State Fair from its various angles, in such little articles as the country publishers would handle. I believe it would be possible to get a heavier attendance, from further out in the state. I will be glad to help in any way I can along the me of interesting the country, publishers in giving more space and o putting a little more pressure en that the next year. VAN 9 E:7 Is there anyone else that might have any - thing to say this morning? MR. J. E. PORTWOOD, Nuckolls County: This is just in case • any of you are thinking of going to California. You will notice in this morning's paper that California had their second freeze in the citrus fruit belt. Will Rogers siid there are only two kinds of weather out there, that is the one hundred per cent and the very unusual weather. It cost them fifteen million dollars, and we folks back here will pay for that; everybody buW or selling oranges is hurt by it to some extent. -.'..¦¦.'.'¦ -."¦'i ' ¦ " •"¦ ... ¦'.¦'•.--7 ¦-•¦¦ -7 -...' •;. ¦ 1 jwould like to talk about fr 3e fairs. Most of your Fairs up in the Starve to Death" section for I.he last four years, and in almost all corners of Nebraska, even the eastern side, have felt it. Down in Southwest Nebraska near Kansis we don't expect to raise anything we are prosperous on about a tlird of a crop. Four years ago when they saw they were up against t the county fairs talked about a free gate.; At that time 1 didn't haVe any salaried office, so we tried to prevail on the local board to oien the gate and make it a free fair so they finally said "if you will raise ?500.00 from the business men arounovtown and others interested in the fair, we will make it a free gate, but charge them for auto barking." So we did, and had a free gate and a little home talent entertainment, and were able to raise some jmoney and paid out some debts, and the next year we tried it -again and paid out more debts, tie next year we cut out the charge for auto parking, and we still lived and paid,a few more debts. Now we are going to have a free gate akin this year, but I believe the time will come when we raise crops and we can charge them something at the gates again. MR. BAUMANN; I have a little matter on my mind which might </seg>
         <seg id="p042">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE be for the good of the organization. I am reminded somewhat of a little story of the doctor and the blind man. There was a new doctor that came to town, one of these hew kind of "Chiro's", and this town had a blind man who had been there for a number of years, and they had tried to help him in every way to regain his sight; so they waited upon the "Chiro", and asked him if there wasn't something he could do to help this man regain his sight. "Well", said the doctor, "I don't just know, but I will study up on it", so they went back later and the doctor said that it might be that an adjustment would do him some good, and he gave the ad - justment, and to the astonishment of the people of the community the man regained his sight, but to their amazement he lost his memory, he just couldn't remember anything, where he was at, or anything. else. So they went to the doctor again and said, "Say, doctor, you re - gained this man's sight, isn't it possible to regain his memory?" The doctor said "1 don't know, I would have to study the matter over"; so when they came hack later he said that possibly another adjustment would put him back in the same condition he was, if it didn't do any good for him; so they thought they better talk it over with the man that had been blind, and after talking it over with him he said, "Well, gentlemen. I think its a damn sight better to have my sight than to have my memory of all the things that have come and gone in the past, and where I have been", so lie preferred his sight. I think that is applicable to this organization; that we should for - get the past and work for the future, and let's use our eyes for the betterment of the organization, anything that would be a betterment in the future, and forget the things of the past, and let's go on and move on as we try to do in all our activities. 4-H, good breeding, and so forth: keep those things in our minds and branch out and go for - ward, and in order to do that we must forget some of the things of the past. (Applause,. PRESIDENT VANCE: Talking about adjustments, that brings back to my memory a few years ago while I was down here in the Legislature. Of course I took the grippe amongst some other things, and went home one evening and went to bed sick, and the landlord came up and said "What is the matter?" and I said "I guess it is just the grippe", and he said "You need a doctor", and I said "No, I don't have a doctor for grippe or colds when I am at home, and I don't see why I should have one now." Well, along about eight o'clock that evening there was a young chiropracter that was rooming just across the hall from my room, I didn't know he was over there. Well he came over to my room and was a nice bright young fellow, and introduced him - self and said "What is the trouble, Mr. Vance?" I said "Well.T guess I got the grippe". He said "I am a chiropractic doctor, have you ever had an adjustment?" I said "No", and he said "Well, let me give you </seg>
         <seg id="p043">.; report of Nebraska! state board of agriculture one, I think I can help you oJt". I said "Well, Doc, I don't think it would be any use. I don't .believe, in it in the first place, and I don't think it would do me any gooc anyway". But he begged and begged and finally I said "Well, go ahiad, just out of curlousity I will let you give me an adjustment". Well he laid the pillows along in a row and told me to lie on them. Abou. the first thing he did to me was take hold of my head and give it a yink. I said "That is enough", but about that time he parked his knee iA my back and gave another yank, then he started down my spine digging in with his fingers, and when he got through he said "How do you feel, Mr. Vance?" "Well" I said "I will have to own up that you woke me up a little bit". "Well" he said ["of course you will have to have a little more, that won't cure you.;, Now in the morning before you go to work, if you are able to go to work, I will come over and give you another". Well I didn't say anything at all, but after he stepped out and shut the door I said to myself "I'll bet you ten dollars you don't", so in the morning I got out^a lot earlier, and I am alive yet. That is my experience within adjustment. Have any of the rest of you fellows ever had one' ¦• i ¦¦.-:¦¦", . ' .. . • : Ijam going to call on Mr. Chapin here, from Lincoln, and see if he has anything to say. Mr. Chapiin: - - l - - -. :¦ '"' MR. CHAPIN: I don't know that I have anything special to bring up but there is a thought in my mind that may be as surprising to you as it iwas to me. About three or four weeks ago I came in to spend the evening with a gro^up of men that were running a test of the soil moisture through - out the drought territory, and it seems that the figures that they had gathered indicated that we wou d be deficient in this drought territory of moisture for about twelve years; it has gradually been getting worse during the four years of this drought we have gone through. They were testing the soil down to where the moisture comes up from the water level down below, and it seems from their discussion that whei - there was only ten per cent moisture in' the soil it was zero, because vegetation could not grow whe . there wasn't moisture in excess of ten per cent. They had prac ically finished in Nebraska, and the minimum shortage was thirty-two inches and the maximum shortage ran in excess of one hundred inches. Now, as a result of that ob - servation they made no predictlUs of the future, but called attention to the fact that if this deficient Loisture was all made up in one year it wouldn't do us any good, ifk got to come back the way it went biit the interesting part was tha this was not the first occasion of this knd.of a period. About fortjUve years ago the same thing, and ninety years ago the same thihg. had occurred, extending over the same kind of a period, and. if, ad Solomon said there is nothing new in the world, and like begets likk that we should have reached the </seg>
         <seg id="p044">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE climax of this shortage last year, and that commencing this coming year we should begin to reach above the normal rainfall, but that it seems to depend this year largely upon seasonable rains for a crop. Following that, there was a man here from Washington during the Agricultural Activity Week with statistics of the United States from every point that had had a weather service, some of the records going back close to one hundred years. Perhaps some of you saw him out at the Agricultural College and listened to the statistics, and the slides he showed showed practically the same thing. One of the inter - esting things was that he had a picture of the dust storms occurring in these last few years that we have been through; also some letters written trom various points to the weather bureau at Washington and he read some of those letters. They described the dust Storms down in Kansas and western Nebraska, and different places, written at differ - ent periods. April, March. February, July, describing accurately the dust storms and conditions that we have had in the past two years - then he said "Every letter that I have read to you here was written forty-five years ago". So that apparently the period through which we have gone is nothing startlingly new, and I am thoroughly con - vinced in my mind that we will come back as strong or stronger in the agricultural sections on which we depend, stronger than before. PRESIDENT VANCE: Thank you Mr. Chapin. Is there anyone else that wants to spend a little time talking about the dust storms? It puts me in mind of about the worst dust storm I ever saw A couple of years a K o I was called down during one of these storms to write some insurance around Roseland. Well. I started out, and the dust was just flying so thick you couldn't see the road, couldn't stay on the road: I would go a while and then have to stop and wait for it to clear up a little, then start up and make a few rods, and then I would have to slow up. Of course I got lost down there, and I happened to look up towards the sun and saw a couple of little dark spots up there really darker than the rest of it. and I tried to figure out what that was. and I finally found out before I went very far that the dust was so heavy up there that there was ocnple of badgers up there digging a hole in it. MR. JOE S. STEELE: I saw my old friend Mr. Jackson come in a few minutes ago; he generally has the championship for tall stories when he comes out to our country. One time when he was out there he brought us the story about the kind of barometers they have in Vermont. He said if you go back there you will find a pole sitting somewhere in the farmer's yard with a fairly heavy log chain fastened to the top, and if you ask the farmer what it is he will tell you that it is his barometer, and then if you ask him how it works he will tell you that when the chain sticks straight out they are going to have pleasant </seg>

         <seg id="p052">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. CHARLES GRAFF: Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen: For fear that you might be disappointed if you didn't hear from me at the close of this convention, I will take the privilege to make a few re - marks before we leave this chamber. There might be one or two among you here that don't know much about me. I know there are a good many of you here that know perhaps too much about me. You know I come from a little country town in the state of Nebraska, where I have resided for fifty-three years. I was much interested last evening at our little banquet to hear our friends Smrha talk about what a big place the little town fills. Our town Is perhaps half again as large as the town of Milligau, but we have in our town a Tammany Hall where those of us like to congregate for an hour or two in the afternoon to help save the nation. It has become my habit, about five or six blocks from the business '¦ district of the town, to have my car down on Main' Street, and after this meeting in Tamaiiy Hall had adjourned there were some old brothers with a cane that were perhaps just a little too lazy to walk all the way home, so I would drive around the different streets and distribute these boys where they belong, and get home in time for supper. Well, that has been Increasing, my business has been growing the last few - years along that line. And, I don't know whether you would call it a blesshi S or not, but in a country village of less than seven hundred population we have right around fifty widows, and Mrs. Graff has seen fit to delegate me to haul this one and that one around; some of them have a cane, others a crutch or two, hut I have noticed that those that she selected for me as a rule all had backs In their dresses, their skirts were long, and the dress came well up under the ears. You know, it finally dawned on me, and I called my good wife's attention to it. I says "It seems to me you are picking out these old crips for me. those that are spavined and ring boned, and bow legged". Now, I have got a lot of kick out of living in that town the last eighteen years. Everybody, of course, knows Charley Graff in and around that town, because I have been there for fifty-three years, but it is hard for me to become acquainted with all our people, even in that little center, and especially among the young folks. I recall many times where a mother has tried to correct her little boy, and sometimes maybe the little girl, because they would address me as "Charley", and you know that sounded better to me than "Mr.", when those little folks call me -Charley" some way or the other it makes me feel good. Now, perhaps I ought to say a word to you about the business that we are here for, and have been for three days, and to leave with you a thought or two to take home with you. Like our new president just stated, Bill and I came onto this board twenty-six years ago, and I admit that I have made a lot of blunders, and I have raised a lot of </seg>
         <seg id="p053">REPORT OF NEBRASKA! STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE hell in this organization, but W intentions, I don't -.vant anybody to - question my good purposes. Now, this convention is coming to a close, and I am glad to say that it has been all around harmonious; some of .our. people feared that there was a storm brewing, it seemed there was a little evidence of it a year ago, but it seems that it was nothing more nor less than a little constructive criticism, and that shouldn't hurt us, as your president has just stated, that should'be invited at all times. Any organization that is never criticized in its work becomes careless and indifferent eventually. . ¦ ¦¦ ':{'¦¦¦ Now, I understand there is going to be a bill introduced in this unicameral legislature to reorganize this organization, and 1 want to say to you men that that is nothing new; we have had those things come up before. I well recallj Mr. President, when the State of Ne - braska enacted into law what was called—What? Mr. President, a great long name that came from Illinois—The Civil Administrative Code. I recairthat.l went with a delegation to see the governor, who was then McKelvie, a young man, as we looked.at him, for a governor, but a wide awak go-getter, and we finally requested the governor that if he was going to foster and put through the so-called Administrative Code to take the old State Board ¦of Agriculture along with it, be - cause it seemed to us men in that organization that there should be more or less a declaration from our governor. Of course we lost our point, the governor won/but the governor said "That is one organiza - tion that I don't wish to interfere with, they have always appealed to me as being one of the great organizations in the state of Nebraska that 1 has been independent in' 'thought and action and non-partisan". We even turned the budget of the Agricultural and Livestock Pro - motion Activities over to this new governor, we ask him to designate the amount that each activity should have.^ He said "No, I won't do it", he told me, he says "Charley your organization is better qualified than* anything or anybody that 1 know of in the state of Nebraska to dish; out to these different agricultural and livestock promotional activities the amount they shoild have.out. of the total sum of that budget", which was some twe lty-eight thousand dollars. That was the confidence that people gave us, and the governor at that time had, and all the governors that I c_n recall for forty years or more. My Mentis, this is the one great organization in the State' of Nebraska that has stood the test of time. The old act that created this organiza - tion W one .of the oldest statu tory acts on the stautes of this state, almost sixty years old, and here somebody for some reason, they can't give'a valid one, has a personal grievance, perhaps a trifling one at that.(that likes to spread dissension and discontent among the people that 7this organization is not functioning any more to the extent that it is responsive -to the people of the state :of Nebraska.

         <seg id="p054">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE You are going home now, and you are representatives of this great organization. I have got faith in that unicamerl legislature, my friends, all we need to do is to lay our cards on the table face up be - fore them, and I have no fear that they will wish any more to wipe out or reorganize this organization any more than McKelvie did eighteen or twenty years ago. I believe I am speaking from personal knowledge; when I came on this board, my friends, I didn't know what in the devil it was all about. I was started down at the foot of the class, and I was graduated up and up. You will bear with me when I tell you my first experience, it caused me a lot of won. . I was assigned, with a few men under me, and had charge of a certain big building, which was the livestock judging coliseum, and those old roosters they wouldn't obey orders, they were old timers, they had served under men before me and knew that I didn't know anything, and I had to agree with them, and I discovered that I wasn't boss, or they thought I wasn't, and I went up to the administration office and I made my report to the Board of Managers, and one of them says, "Well, Charley, we got you down there to run that place, and if you can't do it we will have to send somebody else down there". "Oh" I says, "Hell, I can run it all right", and 1 went down there and I told those birds what to do, and I says "Unless you do that you can go up to the office and get your time". I never had any more trouble after that, and I went on through. Now, I don't know, my friends, why I am tolerated any longer on this body. All I can say to you is that since I served my time as presi - dent the Board of Managers has given me a job; they change the name about every so often, but it doesn't' make any difference to me, it is the same job. It used to be Superintendent of Tickets, many of you remember that place: it has developed into an information bu - reau, and I am looked upon as being the trouble shooter to iron out the difficulties for people who come to our State Fair and don't know Where to go; even if you have to have a check indorsed they will say "Why, send them to Charley Graff, he maybe will indorse it for you". I have indorsed dozens and dozens, my friends, and I have never lost a dollar. A man comes in and I have never seen him, I have never heard of him. I question him, I find out his occupation, I look at him, and I try to look into him. and if he's got his wife there and the kiddies I make him bring them up there; why, I will even go so far as to feel the wife's right hand, to see if she's telling me the truth or not, whether she is raising chickens and is his helper. If he is honest you can tell it. I never lost a dollar. It's been my policy, and I have always ad - vocated that to our people that are running that fair, let's be tolerant, let's send every fair visitor home saying "I enjoyed my trip, to the fair, they are a loyal hunch of fellows that made me feel welcome, and they helped me wherever they could, they stood ready all the time </seg>
         <seg id="p055">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to render all the service they could, that I might get the beat out of that fair." in the present times nothing will build up a fair more than that. I have had other men that want to tell me what a bunch of crooks we are, and I am net permitted to quote the language that I used in replying to those . birds, they are few, they are mighty mighty few. You see, men, I know yo i are going home giving this a little thought. This institution has never received the recognition by the state financially that I feel it ;s entitled to. %It Is a great big instttu - tion.some million dollars and t half of property Is out there that must be kept up and maintained; oir exhibitors, who are out all over the State of Nebraska, they comi lain about the measley premiums we pay, but we have always been able,to show them why we can't pay them any more, and they are willing to come back. Now, I believe that everybc dy is going out of this meeting feeling a little better satisfied with this great organization, and understanding a little better than ever beforii what it is here for, and !what it has done; and what it is willing to do for the state. (Applause). • • PRESIDENT BANNING: Well, I think this completes the pro - gram. MR. PURCELL: Mr. Chairman, just before we adjourn I just want •.to.say a .word. . First I want to say that ,i' appreciate the honor conferred on me in electing me as Treasurer. I Want to say also that I accept it with a feeling of. regret, with a feeling of hesitancy, I am mighty sorry to see Tom Wake relinquish his activ ties in this work. I had no idea that I would be asked to take this place until very shortly before the vote. Mr. Wake has made a splendid lecord and one that will be a hard place to equal. ; The real thought I wanted 1j bring is that we are losing one of the. best treasurers this state fair or any other state fair ever had. PRESIDENT BANNING: Now, we would like to have these new members of the Board of Manajgers remember that we have got some business to take up, then possibly we will want a meeting this after - noon io talk over some things.

PURR: Mr. President, members of the association^ of Fair .Managers: As you have been told, they have changed the program on you, instead of having a banker to address you you have a wholesale, grocer. I understand that a year ago you had the mayor of our city - extend to you a greeting of welcome; you know the chamber of com - merce is a little different, each year we change presidents, and in the state of Nebraska we elect a new governor once in a while, but we keep the same mayor year after year, so that you already have a welcome from our mayor. -.¦'¦¦• - !'. • •!¦¦'.-.'¦'¦' Talking about changing, we are In the midst of changing times right now, we are in what you might call the "Want" age, we want better automobiles, we want better roads, and we are getting them; then we want better buildings, and we are getting those; better every - thing, and more of it. \ We even want better fairs, and as a result of your.meeting here today we are going to have better fairs. Among the things we want better and more of, is jobs. lam an optomist, but I want to present to you just one pessimistic thought; if there is any one thing that stands in the road of progress this year it is the matter of jobs. The administration at Washington is using every influence in the world to create jmore jobs for the unemployed, and after they have created good jobs that pay good money the workers go on strikes. The situation is not asj shocking here as in many many states, but I think the problem of labor is one of the very very serious ones. Your address of welcome should consist of three things. It should be eloquent, and it should be brief, and it should be sincere. You never heard of anybody; in the wholesale grocery business in your life that was eloquent, but I am sure I can be brief, and I am sure I can be sincere.. I would like to greet each one of you personally as I greeted the. </seg>
         <seg id="p078">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE secretary and president by shaking hands with you, but there are so many of you that that is Impossible. You know Lincoln has so many state institutions, and so many things that you are interested in that in reality you are coming to your own city. We hope that while you are here you will take time to visit the state capitol. It would also be worth your while to spend some time at Morrill Hall if you have the time. And of course it would be perfectly wonderful if you could spend some time visiting some of our wonderful stores. Your president asked me a while ago if this was my first address of welcome, I said "No, it isn't, we had a meeting of the board of di - rectors last Thursday, and after the meeting I stood around the di - rectors' room for a while, and then put on my coat to go out, and started downstairs; the secretary rushed up to me and took hold of my shoulder and said, "take off your coat, there's a convention in ses - sion now, waiting for you to come and extend a welcome", so I took off my coat and went in and gave them the address of welcome. If any of you have had to make a speech on one minute notice you perhaps know how I feel. I feel like a certain woman who was being baptised in the river; the preacher gave her a good ducking and brought her up and said "Do you believe?" and she said "No sir, I don't believe", and he gave her another one and held her under longer, then he let her up and says "Do you believe?" and she says "No sir. I don't believe"; so he gave her a third one. bigger and longer than the others, and she came up with water dripping out of her eyes and gasping for breath, and the preacher said "Do you believe?", and she said "Yes sir, I be - lieve", then the preacher said "Will you tell the folks what you be - lieve", and she turned to them and said "I believe he's trying to drown me." I might say that in this convention over at the chamber of commerce the other day it was the water rights folks, and in addi - tion to extending the greetings to them, of welcome, I thought that I should like to make one recommendation to them, so I made one recom - mendation to them, and I think I shall make one to you. I recommended to them that they see if we couldn't have some water that didn't have to be measured through meters. lam getting tired of having all the water we get measured through meters. So I would like to have your convention appoint a committee to see that next year we get some free rain water, so we will get some crops; so that we can raise the biggest pumpkins we ever had, and the biggest ears of corn and the most of them. Your convention, gentlemen, is in the nature of a trading business. I can Illustrate that in this way, Mr. President, if you had a dollar and I had a dollar, and I gave you my dollar and you gave me your dollar, we would each one still have a dollar. You have come to this con - vention here today, and you have an idea, and I have an idea, and I will give you my Idea and you will give me yours, and we will go away </seg>
         <seg id="p079">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS j - '.-'• "..'.-¦'-.. .':'¦".¦ ¦'['.-' from the convention with two Ideas. So ram sure that you can go home today not only with the ideas you have brought with you, but with Ideas the other fellow, has brought with him, so you can have as a - result bigger and better and more successful fairs. In that connection. I might say I am reminded of a story which illustrates how little we* sometimes know about things. An old lady who lived with 'a family thaf had youngsters in school had never'been to a basket ball game, but the rest of the family were very much Interested In basketball, and never missed a game; Anally the old lady got enthused and decided that she would go to the basketball game. However, it happened that the particular night she decided to go the teams weren't having very good luck, and couldn't seem to score, and they couldn't even make the free throws. Finally when the.game was about over one of the players made a throw at the basket, the ball hit the rim and rolled around a while, and then finally dropped through. The old lady had been very much in suspense, hoping that the home team would make a score, and when she saw the ball drop to the floor she sighed and said "Oh my goodness, after they have tried all this time the darn thing had to have a hole in it." I see by the time that if I started at one-thirty o'clock, I have been talking for thirty : flve minutes, so, if this is to be a brief address as addresses of welcome should be, my time is a about up. I want to tell you that we do heartily welcome you to Lincoln, not as visitors but as folks that are coming to a place that really belongs to you, kfter all, Lincoln belongs to ;the. state of Nebraska. We want you to feel at home as citizens of the state. I hope that you have a very success - ful convention, that you derive a lot of good out of it, and that you will be glad for having come, and as you go away from our city I hope that this will be a happy and successful year for you. Thank you kindly for inviting me here to. greet you, which I assure you has been a pleasure to me. I thank you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Furr. If you will re - main just a minute we will have a response by our vice-president, Mr Stanley Matzke, of Seward. Mr. Matzke. VICE-PRESIDENT MATZKE: Mr. Furr, Gentlemen: lam rather at loss as to how we will acknowledge this talk myself. When I read the program and noticed that Mr. Strain was going to deliver .he - address of welcome I prepared a very nice speech. It Is easy to find stories on bankers, and I had myself lined up, now they switch on me - and I am here with nothing to shoot at. The Nebraska Fair Managers have always been happy to come here - to Lincoln, in fact we like Lincoln as a convention city so well that years ago it was written Into the laws of the State of Nebraska that </seg>
         <seg id="p080">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we could not meet any other place even if we wanted to, and you may be assured that as long as that law remains on the books we will be back here. However, I can assure you that even if the law were repealed we would still be back in Lincoln. In the few years that I have been connected with this organization I think it has been the unanimous opinion of the members that we have been mighty well treated here, that we have been furnished with the finest facilities that could be furnished, and that we have gone back home feeling we have had a mighty fine time. And that we have been able to work under condi - tions conducive of accomplishment. Throughout the depression years we have had many here from practically every county in the state, some of them paying their own expenses to come down here and work with us in the interests of better agriculture, and a better Nebraska. We appreciate the efforts you people in Lincoln have taken to help us accomplish these results. We know that you personally have been very much interested in the success of our meeting, and in seeing that we be made to feel at home, and we feel that we are welcomed here with outstretched arms. We know that you are looking after our interests, and we know that you are going to do everything possible to enable us to work alon^ so that the County Fairs Association can continue to function in this city and in the State of Nebraska. We are glad to be here, Mr. Purr. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Matzke. lam going to ask if you folks in the rear of the room are able to hear what we are saying, if not we have quite a few empty chairs here in front. A DELEGATE: We can hear you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: lam guilty of talking too loud usually, and I hope you can hear me. This year we are going to have a little different roll call than in previous years. I am going to have the secretary call your county, and I wish the county board member that is present from that county would rise to his feet and we will get your names and check on our files who is present. Will the president of the association of the county that is called give names other board members present. If you will act quickly it should not take very long. Now, of course the first county, I know, is Adams county. Mr. R. R. Vance, get up and name your board. MR. VANCE: Mrs. A. H. Brock, the only lady board member that I know of, and there is none better. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Vance. Now, I will have our secretary, Mr. Marshall, call these names and if you will work fast we will soon get through. </seg>

         <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Every fair has two commodities to sell, tickets and space, and when these two commodities have been sold it is up to the fair management, to see to It that value is received. Being county fair presidents or secretaries or even a board member, today is a greater taskithan it was a jfew years ago. To balance the budget has become a complex problem in everything and everywhere, even in county fair work. ! As I look oyer the reports of county fairs filed with the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the last two years, I can not help but compliment you managers of county fairs in Nebraska for your aggres - siveness, that you did profit by the mistakes of a few years previous. I have always admired a man thatihas a hobby, and fair work has become a sort of a hobby with most of us. I am sure you will admit that it is fascinating, it is educational and also expensive, for real fair managers never get paid for the time put in on fair work; In reviewing my work as your president the last two years, I find that it has not been work, but rather a pleasure to serve in that capacity. With the assistance of your secretary,-1 have the last two years, sent out approximately one thousand letters to county fair managers in Ne - braska, trying to interest them in the work of our State Association. You all know that since the depression hit us, the State Board of Agriculture has been unable to pay the expenses of delegates to our annual meeting and since we have had three years of drouth, many county fairs have been unable to cany.on and it has been doubly hard to keep up interest in our State Association. In closing, I might say that I am not as old in years as many of you are, but I feel that I must admonish you fair managers that if we are to succeed in county fair work today we must take our fair work seriously. ¦ j " -&#132;;!'..

         <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS rodeos. I think the people of Garfield county, around Burwell, and In Cherry county, it is a real treat for them to go to a rodeo. Now that is our experience in rodeos, and I have noticed that it has been the experience of several small rodeos held in the county fairs in Ne - braska. Some of you might ask "How is the Sidney, lowa, able to put their rodeo over year after year." I wish Mr. Howe would answer that. There.is a difference of opinion, of course. I might say that last year in Saunders county we wanted to do something altogether different than we had ever done before, maybe some of you would not call it a fair, you might call it a big picnic, but I might say at this, time, just going off the subject a little, I had a man that, wanted this question brought up this afternoon, "How can a fair have a free gate and pay Its bills?" that is in the box and we will take that up later. Last year we had a free gate fair at Wahoo. I think we have had free gates for four years, and last year our operations on our last year's fair showed a profit of nine hundred and fifty-three dollars, with a free gate. The entertainment that we put on in front of our grandstand paid the bills, and the catch is, of course, the entertainment we had before our grandstand last year was the only entertainment outside of the rodeo the first year, that ever paid its way. What I mean by that, our grandstand entertainment always costs us more than the money, we took in at the grandstand gates. Now, many of you will wonder. It should not be so, but its been true of the fair. Last year we had some home talent. We hired a very efficient school man for two months before, in fact right after school was out, to go around to the different towns and have elimination contests of the different talent in the different communities, in other words, copied a little after Major Bowes programs. He came to the communities and had small contests in the school house, and picked out the best one, and then went to the other towns. Well, for the three evenings of the county fair we had about fifteen or sixteen different ones every night, then the last night of course we had a grand prize for the one that had won. The first night, second night and third night were devoted to elimin - ations, then the third night the winners were picked. If you were showing them as an exhibit you would call them grand champions, but we called them first, second, and third prize, and that home talent program went over good, It filled the grandstand. We postponed from Friday night to Saturday night, because Friday afternoon came the only rain we, got all summer, and we got two inches and a half on the fair grounds at six o'clock that evening, so we postponed the fair until Saturday night, and it is the only postponed fair we ever had that ever paid out in Saunders, county and it paid big..

PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Mr. Thompson, have you anything to add to what Mr. Baumann has said? Mr. Thompson is president of Cuming County Fair. They have one of the good fairs of Nebraska, and I believe many of you fair men can profit by getting their ideas. MR. THOMPSON:. I don't think it is altogether the attractions that draw people to our fair, we call them free attractions but there is a grandstand admittance. The point I want to make is that I don't think it is the free attractions alone that bring the (people to our fair. We try to make our fair a family fair, we have facilities on our fair ground where you can bring the tiniest baby, you can bring all of your family and take care of them almost as well as you could at home. We have facilities there where you can bring your lunch and sit on the lawn and have a regular old time picnic. The fact of the matter is that people from all over the country come back many times particularly to see old friends at the fair. As Mr. Baumann has pointed out, we get the very best ittractions that money can buy, usually State Fair atraetions. I saw some of our attraction^ at the State Fair this last year. Several of the attractions that we h^d this year are over In London right now, and I believe It best to get' the very best. ; We have a clean* fair. You can bring your family to our fair and you don't have.to feel afraid you are going to be embarrassed by run - ning into something you would rather not have your wife and children see. You can come to bur fair and go anywhere, there are no gambling devices of any kind, and we try to make it as educational as possible. I do not think that any fair, any tax money is justified for any fair that isn't a strictly educational institution, but we do have these attractions so that people have some diversion, and can come there and get around a.day's entertainment. We stress our boys' and girls' club work. We have a fine show there each year. These various features bring various people. As Mr. Baumann pointed out, we have men and women, who are interested in different things, and we have a fine implement show, and various educa - tional exhibits, but our fair, above everything is a clean fair, it is a </seg>
         <seg id="p098">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE family fair, and it is an educational institution strictly, and that,! I think, is the reason why it has been successful. We have operated - how many years? MR. BAUMANN: Fourteen. MR. THOMPSON: Fourteen years, and we have always made profit, in fact one year, that was our best year, we paid more for our free attractions than any other year, and made twice as much as the next best county fair in the state of Nebraska. I thank you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thanks, Mr. Thompson. Are there any questions? I see a president of one of the largest, maybe the largest, county fairs in the State of Nebraska. Mr. Vance, from Hastings, will you come forward? MR. VANCE: I really have a bad cold today. We have my co - worker here and if she cares to I am going to ask Mrs. Brookes, of Hastings, to get up and tell you and me what we want to know. MRS. BROOKES: I think this is very unfair, because I wasn't here last year or two years ago, but I have been here several years. Last year we had our second free fair gate. I think that really saved us, because a few years ago we were about on our last pegs, and were in one of the worst droughts during the last two years that ever oc - curred in our part of the state, but'nevertheless most of these counties have a little bit of water and we got a real display from the Blue river, and that has made our agricultural display for the last two years, but I also think that last year we got one of the best free attrac - tions at our grandstand. I think last year was one of the biggest in receipts we had from our grandstand when we had a one night show of the Barn Dancers from Chicago and we did have a very very attrac - tive show at that particular time. Last year we got along better than we had for three years because we had our free fair, and we paid out more for our premiums, as well as getting this program. I can remember when in more prosperous times the fair paid out more for entertainment. At one time we bought a revue and paid, I think forty-two hundred dollars, and we had a big fair, and had a big crowd,' but we can't afford that any more, but we do try to put on some revues.' A county fair has to have a show for all kinds of people. One of the gentlemen here today told us about how they took care of their visitors. The American Red Cross and Fair Board went to - gether in our county and put up a big Red Cross building, and we took care of our babies there. About three weeks before the fair we have a health contest, and get all of our doctors and nurses to assist us and they examine the babies there, and we have several of these con - tests and about two hundred babies. They take care of the children at </seg>
         <seg id="p099">¦¦;¦ NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS our fair, and if anybody comes to the fair, it enables the mother, after riding thirty miles to get-to the fair, to bring the children, and they are cared for by these nurses, so we try to make it a family fair. I like county fairs because they take in everybody. We are never too old or too young, or too green or too smart, to come to a county fair. I thank you. j- . i : PRESIDENT JOHNSON: As I listened to Mrs. Brookes I wondered what the people of Adams county are thinking of when they keep R. R. Vance in for president and Mrs. Brookes just for a board member. Now, I would like to spend a little more time on this entertainment feature, but we have a speaker here that I. am sure you are all Interested in, and following that we have a question box, we have some questions, that have come to us, that I believe should be read and answered by you fair men. If someone answers them for you, you can go home and be helped in your county fair. I heard a speaker say, at the Inter - national Association of Fair Managers, that every fair has two com - modities within itself those two commodities are tickets and space, and when you have sold those two commodities, it is up to your fair man - ager to see that the value is received. Someone might say, "Well, if you have a free gate, you don't have tickets for sale". Play up your grandstand, and sell your tickets there, you will be surprised at how they will go into the grandstand if they don't have to pay to go in at the front gate. That question will be brought up later, however. At this time it is my pleasure to present to you and introduce a member of the State Racing Committee, Mr. J. B. Rossiter, a resident of Walthill, Nebraska. ' MR. ROSSITER: Mr. Chairman, representatives of the County Fairs of Nebraska, it is a pleasure to be with you here today, and I ¦want to thank you .on behalf of the commission which has made my presence possible here. . '-[¦ ! I realize something of the problems of County Fairs, as I was an officer and director of the Thurston County Fair for many years. I have been asked to talk on "The Distribution of Pari-Mutuel Funds", or as Mr. Marshall stated, "Anything pretaining to races con - nected with County Fairs". Before going into that I would like to give you a little history of the progress of legalized racing, which I thought might be of interest to you. For many years Kentucky and Maryland were the only states in the 'Onion who had legalized -racing, under the control of a State Com - mission. The initial, meeting of the National Association of Racing Commissions was held in Miami, Florida In January, 1904, at that meet - ing only eight states were represented, in January, 1936, at the Janu- </seg>
         <seg id="p100">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ary meeting, eighteen states were represented, and twenty-one states had legalized wager. As you all know, Nebraska approved their bill in about 1935, and shortly after that, Governor Cochran appointed J. B. Watkins of Omaha, and J. C. Meyers of Broken Bow, and myself on the State Racing Commission, and in April we had our first meeting in Omaha. We were all strangers to each other at that time. At that meeting we appointed Mr. J. Cullen as secretary, and by the way, I think you men will all be interested in seeing what the racing commission looks like, so I will ask Mr. J. B. Watkins to stand up. (Mr. Watkins rises); J. C. Meyers of Broken Bow. (rises) and our good looking secretary, J. Cullen of Omaha, (rises). ' About the first task we ran into was to prepare rules to govern races in Nebraska. And Mr. Watkins and Mr. Meyers were very good to us and let Mr. Cullen and I do that. We worked many long hours looking at rules which other states had adopted. Some of those laws change from time to time, and add amendments, and if you look over our rule book you notice an amendment added excepting counties under seventy-five thousand population. For instance that amendment makes it possible for horses to run in counties under seventy-five thousand population that are not registered or eligible to registration. I am as interested in our county fairs as any of you are, and I personally feel that county fairs in our state are very fortunate for the benefit they receive from this bill. Texas is the only other state that contributes any of their money to the counties Nebraska is the only state where the licensees must be a non-profit assodatmn. and the profits used for Agricultural and livestock pre - miums. I know of several counties that could not have held their 4-H programs, according to their own letters, if it was not for the fact that they come under the provisions of this bill. In 19X5, eighty-one counties qualified and received two hundred and thirty-nine dollars and fifteen cents each, and in 19.G ninety counties qualified and received three hundred and ten dollars and ninety cents each, only three counties did not participate in the revenues of 1936, those being Sarpy, Wheeler, and Thomas. Our law encourages the breeding of registered horses, it provides for a race tc be held each day for horses foaled in Nebraska if that race can be filled and in cases where it has not been filled they have put on a Nebraskg owned race, it also provides that the owner of the dam gets three per cent of the win on all Nebraska horses in all races in Nebraska. To make racing a success in all counties, I would suggest that thref or four counties go together and form a small circuit, so as to male, it a greater Inducement to get more horses in order to make more competition and create more interest. If you have a three day meet </seg>
         <seg id="p101">¦ NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS - i" ... In a county, and there isn't any other meet near you either before or after, It is pretty hard to get enough horses to have a successful meet - ing, because the owners .will not stand the expense of moving for a short meet. Under our 1935 rules the-licensee had to put on a race if five horses were properly entered,; but in 1936, we changed that rule to seven horses, which has been found much more satisfactory and provides greater protection for the licensee, especially where they don't have enoughhorses to make keen competition. Personally I think one of the things that causes more dissatisfaction, because it is not understood, than any other thing in connection with racing, and I think it ought to be explained each day at your race meet, and that is that the orders of the board refer only to the win, and indicate nothing whatever as to your place or show bet. Many people are not familiar yet with the orders of the board of Pari-Mutuel wagering, and they will look up at the board and see what is four to one, six to one, or ten to one and go buy a two dollar show ticket not realizing that on the show at that particular time that particular horse might be even money, and they finally win and go cash their ticket and get perhaps two.dollars and twenty cents or two dollars and forty cents and im - mediately become suspicious and think that they have been glpped. Another mistake I find!in small meets is that if the betting has been slow: prior to the contest it begins to pick up when the horses head for the track, so in order to get in revenue they keep the horses parading up and down, which Isn't fair to the owners or bettors. When a fast horse is ready for a race it is carrying a lot of weight, arid then that horse is paraded up; arid down with all that weight and he lost a lot ,bf his energy and naturally cannot run at his best. ¦ ( Now, in regard to fees: The licensees of the meets under seventy - five thousand population pay fifteen dollars a day, which is barely enough to'cover supervision. 4 The law provides that' the commission can charge in addition to the license fee, the supervision! cost, but that we have never done. In counties of over seventy-five thousand population and under two hun - dred thousand population which is of course in Douglas county or the Ak-Sar-Ben rack, they pay two hundred dollars a day and a fifteen cent tax on each, ticket, so you! see that practically all of the money Is divjided among the counties is the revenue from the Ak-Sar-Ben track. \ .'..¦¦'¦¦ .Now, for your information, in 1935, the total revenue received by the commission was twenty-eight thousand, six hundred and sixty - eight dollars and ten cents. In 1936, the total revenue received was, thirty-three thousand, four hundred and seventy-nine dollars and ninety cents, an increase of four thousand, eight hundred and eleven dollars, and eighty cents. And twenty-nine thousand, five hundred and twenty dollars and fifteen cents of that was collected from the Ak-Sar-Ben, </seg>
         <seg id="p102">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE being sixty-six hundred dollars to cover their racing at two hundred dollars a day, and twenty-two thousand six hundred and ninety dollars and fifteen cents being the fifteen cents tax on all tickets. Six hundred and fifty dollars of that was collected from the State Fair for thirteen days of racing at fifty dollars a day, and five hundred and thirty-six dollars and twenty-five cents was the license fees received from the other twelve counties that held the meets, the balance of twenty-seven hundred and seventy-three dollars and fifty cents was the license fees collected from owners, trainers, jockeys, and so forth. After paying our expenses in 1936, which was forty-four hundred, and ninety-eight dollars and ninety cents, and deducting the five thousand dollars which we must hold In reserve, as provided in the law, the balance is divided among the counties that qualify. The idea of legalized racing besides encouraging the breeding of better horses from the revenue received, is to see how high a standard can be kept in racing. All the states belonging to the National Association of State Com - missioner exchange ideas and official rulings, and in most cases re - spect those official rules, and the usefulness of such an association is very pronounced, going together as an association they can weed out those felt guilty of unsportsmanlike practices and provide that they cannot use tracks under that organization's supervision. It is also the duty of every licensee to see that its track is operated in a practical way so as to guard and protect the sport in its future. It Is necessary to protect the owners, the trainers, the jockeys, and so forth, and the interests of the licensee should at all times be to protect the people interested In the business, because if tracks are operated in such man - ner as to lose public confidence it will destroy racing as a legalized Bport. At the present time the licensee takes ten per cent of the bet plus the break on the dime, by that I mean if after the amount wagered on a certain horse is added up and the number of tickets divided up, for Instance, the amount of the pay-off would be four hundred and forty cents and would keep the eight cents, so you see the take really amounts. to more than ten per cent. In closing I want to leave this one thought with you, your city cau discourage the public from betting by taking too high a per cent in the- Mutuels, and if public confidence is distroyed, legalized racing will stop. I thank you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Rossiter. I would like very much if the other two members of the Racing Commission would come up here in front, also their secretary. Because I know most of you fair men are not acquainted with them and would like to see them. </seg>
         <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS They are very close to fair work, and I wish you would get acquainted with them, they are Mr.: Watkins, Mr. Meyers, and Mr. Cullen. Now. you realize that these g;entlemeri have a big job on their hands. This is Mr. Watkins, from Omaha, Mr. Meyers,, from Broken Bow, and Mr. Art Cullen, their secretary from Omaha. We are going next to the question box, and I notice there is one ques - tion there that I belleve;l can answer, but I wish someone else would answer it. It is in regard to the racing: "Would it be advisable to have the Pari-Mutuel.law amended so that the racing commission pay the fair's portion direct to the county fair treasurer, instead of to the county treasurer, as It is now"? That is the question. We are going to the question box, that is the last part of our meeting. Maybe the secretary of the Racing Commission can answer that more intelligently anybody else. Mr. Cullen, what do you think about it? I MR. CULLEN: It wouldmake it a lot easier for us If we didn't have to write and send it to the county treasurer but it is in the law there, and we. don't mind the work. I think that every county has're - ceived their money. I think; last year, 1935, we had two counties that had. trouble in getting their money from the treasurer, and we wrote the treasurer and the money was turned over to the county board. The way it is set up it is perfectly all right with us as it is, it is a little more work, but we don't mind that. \ PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Are there any questions that you would like to ask this gentleman? Any other questions? Frank Rlst of Humboldt, I think he's the gentleman that really had the trouble. Have you anythinjg to say, Mr. RiSt? MR. RIST: As the law is today it does hot specifically state that 1. to be turned over to the county fair board, so the county treasurer may not turn it over, and may think he can place it wherever he sees fit. That was the case in pur county, and I think Mr. Johnson had a - similar experience in some other county farther west. It would seem that if the law was amended this situation could be corrected, although the spirit of the law is undoubtly correct. MR. CULLEN: I think, Mr. Rist, after we had your case up at the last meeting, the committee instructed me to write on the endorsed side of the check that the treasurer agrees to turn this money over to this particular thing, now when they endorse that check they agree to pay it over to the county fair if there is a county fair, or to the Four-H Club, whichever is entitled to the money. MR. RIST: Are you going to do that with all the checks? MR. CULLEN: Yes sir, the commission instructed me on it, right after your trouble. </seg>
         <seg id="p104">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. ANDY WELCH, of Milford: We had to go to the Attorney General's office because the money was turned over to the general fund of the county, and the county treasurer said he had a right to put it there, although I will say that since then we haven't had any trouble. MR. CULLEN: That was in 1935, wasn't it? MR. WELCH: Yes sir. MR. CULLEN: I mentioned the fact that we had had one other case, and that everybody else received their money. If anybody has had trouble let us know, and we will try and settle it. I think every county got it this year without any trouble. MR, VANCE: I just happened to remember that it was turned over to our county treasurer that way, and we could not get it. We went to the board of supervisors and they ordered the treasurer to turn it over, and we got it. MR. CULLEN: That was in 1935 too? MR. ANDERSON, of Gage County: I understand by the report a few minutes ago that each county received three hundred and ten dollars each, is that correct? MR. CULLEN: Yes sir. MR. ANDERSON: Gage county received only two hundred and seventy-five dollars. MR. CULLEN: Another check went out in December, for thirty-five dollars and ninety cents, that should be in your place in January, it was sent out in December. The way that is handled, the commission at the middle of the year estimates about what they can do. and send that out, because we have had letters from counties wanting to get that money in order to help them put on their shows, so that was mailed out in September, then in December, when we know exactly how much we have left to distribute, a second check is mailed out for the balance. MR. ANDY WELCH: Is there any reason why you should not turn that over direct to the county fair board instead of to the county treasurer. MR. CULLEN: Not that I know of. MR. WELCH: Why wouldn't it be agreeable then if there was an amendment put on there making it payable direct to the fair board. MR. CULLEN: In order to do that there would have to be a provision in the racing bill that the money must go out direct to the fair treasurer. </seg>
         <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS I PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Mr. Welch, I will answer that question in this way, personally, I don't believe that we should monkey with the Pari-Mutuel bill in any way, let good enough alone. Many fair man - agers think, I did myself, we thought we should have had a larger per cent to start with, but we are getting more than we anticipated at that. If we go to work and monkey with the legislature and have this bill" amended they will take.it away from us and give it to relief and we will get nothing. Now that we have our county treasurers all over Ne - braska educated, and our supervisors on how to handle that money, I don't believe we are going to have any more trouble from now on. A DELEGATE: I was in the legislature the time that bill was passed, and it was the intent that that money go to the County Agri - cultural Society, and I think ff you will check back you will find that to be a fact. MR. CULLEN:, With us it is just a case of distributing the money, it don't make any difference to us where it is distributed. MR. McLEAN, Custer County: I happen to now be on the fair board, and on the county board up there, and Mr. Meyers happens to be from our county. Our fair board last year had some trouble getting this money, and there was some argument about it. It was put into the general fund, but when this gentleman here asked why this money could npt be turned over to the fair board direct or the 4-H Club or whoever might get it, we must bear in mind that all funds of any kind, no matter what they are, county, school, or whatever it is, it goes to the county treasurer first, and the county treasurers, some of them, might not know all about what was intended in regard to those funds and put it in the general fund, or sinking fund, or something like that Our treasurer was a little tough about it, but I got it taken out of him so it is all right up there, but there is one thing I want to ask some of you men, and that is whether you got paid in full, for this reason, on money coming through the treasurer's hands, and things like that, there is a treasurer's fee which.comes out of that, of something like two per cent, and that was the part that he held back on us, and I would like to know from you fellows whether the other counties got the full amount or whether the fees were taken out. Mr. CULLEN: That was the '1935 money to you? or 1936 money? j MR. McLEAN: It was the. 1935 money that was held up, but we got the last check the same as I Was speaking of. j PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Ar4 there any other questions? I MR. RIST: Do I understand now that the racing Commission writes on the checks that they are payable to the Fair Board? | PRESIDENT JOHNSON: It is a form on the back of the endorse- </seg>
         <seg id="p106">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ment, isn't that correct? MR. CULLEN: Yes, we could send a copy of that endorsement to each of the County Fair Boards that will be put on the check, but the law provides that we must remit money to the county treasurers We would be glad to send out endorsements to all of the county fairs it you would like to see it. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Do you have anything to ask these gentlemen? MR. GEHLEY, Harlan County: May I ask at this time whether any particular portion of this money has to be turned over direct to the Four-H Clubs. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Have you a county fair in Harlan County? MR. GEHLEY: Yes sir. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Is it hooked up with the Four-H Club or a separate show? ( MR. GEHLEY: They have been showing at our show, but this year they asked for a share of the money. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: That Is up to your fair board to spend that three hundred and ten dollars that you got this year. The Four- H Clubs don't have any strings on that, because the county fair in that county is the organization that Is entitled to it. MR. ROSSrTER: It would be a great help if the county fair board would have the county clerk write in and notify the commission as soon as your board is certified. We have written several times to get a letter from county clerks trying to get a letter showing who is qualified to receive this money. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Are there any further questions? If not, I thank you gentlemen very much. Now, we come to the question, "How Can County Fairs Pay Bills and Have a Free Gate". MR. VANCE: I can answer that. Down there at Hastings we get our money from the concessions and the carnival, that is the only Place that you can get it unless you charge at the grandstand. Now or two years we have given a free gate and free grandstand, but that is a little bit tough, you have got to have a mighty good carnival if you are going to get out on it, but we have been making the money eta d Carnival' Now ' we have Parsed a little bit at the grand- PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thanks, Mr. Vance. But there is an- </seg>
         <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS \ - ' ' ''I ¦ ¦'¦ • . ' ¦' .'- ¦ ' other thing, that when you have a free gate (I am answering this ques - tion, part of it) when you have a free gate, of course you have more people walk through your gate, at least we have found that true, and the more people you get In on your grounds the better the carnival company likes it and the greater per cent you can get. A front "toot is worth easily a dollar fifty with a free gate If It sells for a dollar with a pay gate, and your revenue is increased by the free gate, and I think that is passing through the gate free if someonehas got fifty cents in his pocket when they leave home and have to pay a quarter at the gate they have only got a quarter to spend somewhere else, but it they don't have to pay at the; gate, they have fifty cents, and of course they spend it with the show, and you get your per cent of the carnival. It helps you that'way. Is there someone else that wants to talk on this free gate, or talk against it, if you want to do that it Is all right. FRANK TROJAN, Colfax County: We often hear about those free gate fairs. Some people are able to give a free gate, it depends on how they are situated. In Colfax county we haven't a grandstand. We have no other way to collect the revenue only through the gate, and we charge twenty-five cents at the gate, and after they are in the grounds they have access to the show grounds and everything that is there. I have heard quite a little discussion about the free gate. You may go Into some fairs and go in free,;but they have the attractions blocked off where you have got to go intothe grandstand and pay your twenty-five cents to see anything. So I don't see anything free about that. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: ! Well, you have heard the gentleman from Colfax county give his viewpoints. T might drop something here, the chairman is not supposed to talk as much as I do, but did you ever try getting the extra two thousand dollars from your county and have a free gate. That is the argument we used with our commissioners, we are one of the two counties that get their second two thousand from the county, we said give us the, second two thousand and we will put on a free gate. We can't put on ;a free gate and clear the two thousand, but if we can take the two thousand from the taxpayers we can, so we get our four thousand, and why can't we put on a free gate? ' HARRY C. BELKA, Saline County: What persuasion did you use on your county commissioners? PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We've got a club a little larger than this one. .¦ MR, HARRY C. BELKA, Saline County: We don't have any grand - stand, we have gotten along: for thirteen years without one, but it doesn't give us any surplus to build any.

         <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS We have our sixty-first annual fair this fall, and I might say that a lot of our old boys in the earlier days went to Hastings and helped you fellows, Mr. Vance, lay out a grandstand and showed you fellows how to build a race track one time.

MR- WELCH, Seward County: j want to say to you, that we have had free fairs for a number of years, prior, to that time, a we have told yoirhere before, we went in the red. Now then during th 72 veir we.have put on a sixty-five hundred dollar building program andparto i in the PWA, and the best recommendation that I can give from our standpoint, and we are out here only a little over twenJ. 7,7 like to have every one of y.u co™to™ 2^ TtZ the last three days of.August and.the first day Of September »!/ how a county fair can be put on successfully Member, and see nJZ?"

         <seg id="p110">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE you need spend no money unless you want to, but as the president said, if a man comes with fifty cents he will spend it all anyway, and we have made a little money with the free gate. I think a free gate is all right. MR. VANCE, Adams County: Pardon me, for talking so much. I just want to tell you what we spent, I am afraid some of these fellows thought that we didn't spend any money. I happened to find a state - ment of our last fair here, we spent seven thousand, six hundred and seventy-two dollars and three cents. We made seven thousand seven hundred and fourteen dollars and thirty-five cents, that left us forty - two dollars and thirty-two cents, but out of that we did a lot of im - proving. We only have two thousand dollars from the county, is all we asked them for. I might as well let you in on a little secret of our free fair. We don't pay the city of Hastings anything for electricity, we don't pay anything for water or police duties, it is all donated, and whatever we want from the county board of supervisors they do our bidding, and everything is like that, they just simply send me down to get It. and being Scotch-Irish, I get it, and that is the thing to do, get after the cities. Why, the city of Lincoln should help this fair more than they are, too. If everybody in the city would come out and visit once or twice It would help the fair a lot. That is the secret of conducting good fairs, boosting for them. J. S. STEELE, Kimball County: I have just been listening awhile with interest on these testimonials on free fairs, and I wonder how it can be done in a county of my size. We only have six hundred farmers in our county, yet this year we had a fair that cleared a thousand dollars, but we didn't do it with a free gate, we charged fifty cents at the outer gate and charged twenty-five cents at the grandstand, and I want to say we had a crowd this year. Every available inch of space In our fair grounds for cars was taken and we had to park them out - side half way down town and it is a mile from the fair ground, down town. We ran Pari-Mutuel racing. I was opposed to Pari-Mutuel racing two years ago. I don't know where I am now on the subject, personally, I am still opposed to it, I really think it is the wrong thing to put it before youngsters, but we have got it and it has paid from a financial standpoint. In our county, the first year, it was a failure from an entertainment standpoint, we didn't know how to operate it, didn't know how to sandwich in a program between the races, and consequently it was a drag for some people to get there and they were not interested in Pari-Mutuel betting. You will find a good per - centage of people are not interested in Pari-Mutuel betting, it is mostly people in town who patronize the Pari-Mutuel, the others want to be entertained, and this year we had worked out a program that we think entertains those people and we didn't have so much back-kicking on our Pari-Mutuel. </seg>
         <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS But lam interested in this subject. Some counties near us had free fairs this year, Cheyenne, Morrill and Banner. Banner county is. still - smaller than we are and they did not try to put on any entertainment at all. It was the first time-Banner county had held a fair since 1892, and the only reason they had a fair this year was the fact that they' had that money that these men have told you about and they didn't know how to spend it for their Four-H clubs' work unless they held a fair, so they held a Four-H fair, which was a wonderful success. Ban - ner county only has about twenty-six hundred people in it, yet they had a good fair, and while on the subject I want to say that they had fifty-six entries of corn. I don't know that there are any counties in the east part of the state this year that could match the exhibits that Banner county had this year, and they paid out financially. I don't know how Cheyenne county and Morrill county came out on their fairs. I know they had nice crowds and nice fairs, hut I don't know whether they paid out or not. In our county I don't think we could run a free fair and make it pay. . HENRY BRANDT, Gage County: I would like to say a few words in regard to these fairs. We have been running what we call a free gate, and were probably, one of the first counties to start it, and since then we have followed it up and will have it again this coming year, but instead of calling it a free gate we do not charge at the main gate only for automobiles, we park those and charge a quarter, and they are under police protection and we pay the police, and then we charge for the grandstand. Now, as far as entertainment is concerned, we find that you can not have the same thing every year, what might go over big one year wouldn't be any good at all the second year, so we change our entertainment. Sometimes we have some home talent, then some - times we go out and buy our entertainment. Of course, we do buy some every year, sometimes we will nave racing, and sometimes we will have a rodeo, and so forth, as that is what our community requires. As far as free fairs are concerned we have tried our free gates and never gone in the red, and yet each year we have paid off on our obligation at the rate of five hundred dollars a year, and have done so since we went over to the free gate. P. P. CEDAR, Nance County:. I think we were the second or third free fair in the state. We usedjto charge at our gate and at our grand - stand, and kept that up until finally we went broke. Of course now it is not free in a way, but all concessions and exhibits and all of that is - free, but if you want to go to the grandstand you have to pay to see - any of the entertainment on the inside. Since we started doing that we have been able to keep our head above the water. Last year we - put up a grandstand, of course that was WPA money, but we had to - put up some of it. Our buildings are paid for, and we are getting along - fine. I believe it is the only thing to do. If you rob a man at the gate* </seg>
         <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE when he conies into the gate he goes home and says "To hell with the fair The way we have it now he doesn't have to go into the grand - stand If he doesn't want to. ERVINE E. PONT, Stanton County: I would like to ask one ques - tion of the fellows who have the free gates, what do they _ut up for their premiums? MR. CEDAR: We have just about the same as any other a thou - sand to fifteen hundred. FRANK WATKINS, Antelope County: lam glad to hear this dis - cussion on this. We have been trying to run fairs on county appropria - tion, and charging at the gate, charging at the grandstand, charging for the cars, and charging everything we could get, and still going in the hole. lam wondering if we would take that off if we would be better off. We don't have a big attendance there, but we charge ail of them and I just can't hardly figure out how a free gate would pay out We get sixteen hundred dollars from the county. I heard you say you asked for two thousand dollars more, that takes care of the free gate if you can get two thousand dollars more from the county, but we can't do that. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Mr. Watkins, before I call on Mr. Bau - mann, I think he has the floor next, I might say this, turn over your tax receipt. If you do you will see that you are assessed for county fair purposes. I have always contended that when a man pays bis tax he has made his donation to see the pumpkins, corn and soforth, but if he wants to see what is in front of the grandstand let him pay for it. MR. BAUMANN, Cuming County: Of course everybody has a right to his own opinion. lam glad to hear the discussion of this free gate. As far as Cuming county is concerned we have never had a free gate and don't intend to. We are sort of proud of it. We star*ed out at a normal charge of admission, we charged them for automobiles, bring - ing automobiles in there, and we have a good police system and take care of them. We have been charging forty cents admission, and sea - son tickets, one dollar, and run a five day fair, that is twenty-five cents a day. We charge twenty-five cents for the grandstand We have been operating for fourteen years. The first year we started we got an extra thousand dollars from the county board, and one time after that we got an extra two thousand and put up a school building. Up ' to date we have spent for improvements—for land, buildings and im - provements, over forty-eight thousand dollars, in addition to that we ' took care of the county agent for five years at a cost of approximately ten thousand dollars,—we paid his salary. The county board refused to do anything and we figured that if we gave him a start, after he was in there, he would prove to the people that he was worth the money </seg>
         <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Things went on and we couldn't convince the county board, so we kept on paying and for five years paid his salary and stenographer, paid his office rent and supplies, and-it cost us about ten thousand dollars for the five years. Then this "Triple A" came along and luckily the government took him off our hands; but at the present time we owe about seventeen hundred dollars and we think that is a pretty good record, and we would never have done it with a free gate.- And as far as our county is concerned we are not interested in free gates. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I know that this is an interesting sub - ject, and.l know that there'are more of you that would like to speak on it, but we have a few more questions that we are going to hold dyer until this evening.

This discussion, as you will notice by the program, is led by a gentleman of Cass County, Paul Wolph, of Avora. Mr. Wolph, will you please come forward? MR. WOLPH: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, this question assigned to me "Eliminations Previous to Judging in Four-H Exhibits", deals with the sifting committee at the State Fair,—sifting the baby beeves shown by the Four-H Club boys and girls. As it has been prac - ticed in the past the boy or girl feeds this calf for a year's time, then brings it up to the fair, and generally the night they unload it, or the next day, the sifting committee goes around to look over the calves, and If any calf don't look exactly right they sift them out and send them to Omaha. I don't see anything fair about that kind of a proposi - tion. A fair should be run, almost entirely, for educational purposes, and these boys and girls have looked forward to the fair and to bring - ing their calves down, and it just ruins that week for a boy to have his calf eliminated and not even get in the competition. Not only that but he has gone to a good deal of expense, some ot these calves are trucked as high as two hundred miles to the fair, and he has quite a little expense connected with it, —it just knocks him out of a week's pleasure. </seg>
         <seg id="p115">' NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS You know, if you would put yourself in the boy's place, that if you had spent a year's time looking .forward to that trip to the fair and got knocked out the day before, and then couldn't show your calf before the judges, you wouldn't feel very good about it, and the boys don't either. They have had a good deal of expense and when they are knocked out before competition, the boys feel like they did not really get what was coming to them. In my estimation I don't see any reason why we can't let these calves go before the judges, if some of them are not quite as good as they might be, it doesn't take a judge long to find It out. As far as the fair part of it is concerned, I don't see anything about it that would be unprofitable to the fair. As you know, our fairs have to depend on exhibits, and when you discourage a boy or girl from bringing his calf to the fair he?s not very apt to come back the next year, and he's hot going to be a good advertisement for the fair. Your boys and girls won't come back, and you are naturally going to cut down on the number of exhibits you will have next year. We all know from showing cattle and hogs, that there are no two men that would judge a class of cattle or hogs the same, even on the same day, and these are judged two different days, a calf might fill the next day and look like an entirely different calf than when he came in. You couldn't get two judges that would judge exactly the same. If there is any. sitting to be done, In my estimation, the only way they could do it in fairness to boys and girls would be to sift them before the boy or girl bought the calf in the first place, because on nine-tenths of the calves, I believe that are sifted out up here, that it wasn't really the boy's fault that the calf was sifted. Lots of times he has a poor judgment on his part In pick - ing the calf, or else poor assistance, and got a calf that never should have gone into the club work in the first place. I don't see any way that.it would be handled in fairness to the kids or as a benefit to the fair if it is handled in the way it has in tha past. If there is going to be any sifting it should be done before the boys get. the calf. If you will get good competent judges, there is no reason in the world why you could not put ten calves more in the class, and that would probably be all.there would ever be in the class, and there is no reason why they should not judge in exactly the same length of time, and that would let the boy know he would come be - fore the judge himself, and.if he lost he would try to come back next year and have a calf a little better, but if another fellow comes around to the barns before hand and tells him he can't show, naturally he feels had about It. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Wolph. This is a very important question that we are presenting here, and it is something which, personally, I feel we should have the feeling of this convention </seg>
         <seg id="p116">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in regard to whether this ought to continue or we should take action on it. Before we do, it should be discussed. I wish you would ask this gentleman questions, and if he cannot answer them, some one else can, maybe. I am going to call on Mr. Reed. Would you outline just what this means, as secretary of the state fair board? This sifting is done here at the state fair, as I un - derstand, and they never get to show, is that right, Mr. Reed and will you care to tell us something about it? MR. REED: Mr. Chairman, it was probably my idea, having this proposition brought up here at this meeting. It is a question that there is considerable controversy over in regard to the Four-H show, and I think that all of the county fairs are interested in this proposition and it is a matter that should be taken up here and some action taken on It. I think it would help the State Fair Board considerably if they knew what the expression was out in the state in regard to this matter. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Now, you realize that the state fair board don't want to have any proceedure of this kind if all the county fair boards in the state of Nebraska are opposed to it, and to get this before the convention and a round table discussion. I wish you would ask some questions on it. The way I understand it, gentlemen, these Four-H calves are beef and dairy. MR. WOLPH: Just beef. A DELEGATE: I would like to know just what it is about, we just got in and did not get the question. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I will let Mr. Wolph explain that. MR. WOLPH: As you probably know, the Four-H baby beeves are sifted, there is a sifting committee that goes around before the judging is done, and they pick the calves out that are not good enough to be shown and send those to Omaha. These boys and girls have come down here for the week, and they either go back or stay for the week and take their licking and do not enjoy life very much either. Now, I would just like to call your attention to one instance this year, to emphasize my point that no two judges, judge alike, one of the calves, a member of the champion group this year, was sifted the first day. Of course they lined these calves up afterwards and they let this one calf stay in the second day, and he was a member of the champion group. So the judge did not look at him like the sifting committee did, in that occasion, at least. D. C. CHASE, Stanton County: I have been a leader of the Four-H baby beef clubs for some seven or eight years, and I have run into the </seg>
         <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS very same thing the gentleman brings up. I have had boys with calves at the state fair that have had their calves picked out. Boys go into this club work with the idea of learning how to feed a calf, they are also supposed to learn how to select a calf. I think if you will investi - gate, you will find that the bulk of the calves that are sifted are calves that are fed by boys that are beginners, or by boys that have not learned their lesson and I am rather inclined to believe that maybe the sifting is correct. .;•." The boys, whose calves have been sifted, in my experience, have gone home with the determination that they are going to pick out a better calf to feed.next year and I believe that in our exhibits In our fairs we should only show the public, calves that have been a success in their feeding operations. If the hoy has not taken care of his calf, and the calf Is not fat the calf is of poor quality, and would be a poor exhibit to put up at our fairs. I don't believe that that calf should be there for all the public to see. I don't believe. In my experi - ence that the sifting committee has taken out a calf that I thought should be in that show, in most cases the calves sent down from our county have been fit, and every time the sifting committee has turned down a calf it has been one that I thought myself should not be shown. In fact the boys have asked me before taking, their calves down to the fair whether that calf should be sent to one of the major shows and It I felt that they would be unfit, the boys have left it at home. In fact, except in a few cases, where they have sent them, the sifting commit - tee has sifted them out, and the boy has gone home with a determination to feed a better calf next time. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Are there any questions that you wish to ask? This is a good place to have it aired out so that the state fair board will know if they are proceeding with it in the right way. CHARLES GRAFF, Cuming County: While I have no experience myself with the boys club work directly, I have been much interested in it for years. I attribute a good deal of the success of the county fair to the Four-H work. You have heard Mr. Baumann tell you this afternoon what our people have done in Cuming county to encourage it, in fact they have financed the county agent, because that was the only agency they had to look after the Fpur-H club work. Now, I know that every one of us would like to find a way that we could send every one of those boys and girls back home feeling that they have done something but it is almost impossible to do it. I have thought sometimes,gentlemen, that it may be that this activity Is getting so large that perhaps there would be a way found whereby the amateur Four-H Club members would not have to compete with the Four-H Club member who has had Borne experi - ence. </seg>
         <seg id="p118">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Just to show you how some of these things work, there is a man In our county that bought fifty high grade heifer calves from the sand hills a year ago last fall, he picked out three of those calves of that herd, or rather his boys did, and those calves were shown, and they were out of a big herd up there in the sand hills, a herd that has got a reputation, and they had the first and second baby beef heifers In the state fair, and grand champion heifer In the baby beef. Now, that man and his boys have gone up into the sand hills a couple of months ago and they have picked out six steer calves from a bunch of twenty-five, hundred; and now, out of these six there Is going to be more sifting done and possibly they will be out to the fair with two or three of them next fall. If they get a licking and get beat, it won't hurt me, because sooner or later those fellows have got to be bumped. You know it ruins a boy to think he's a world beater all along the line. It has already been stated here that you want to encourage that boy if he meets defeat, to come back loaded and see if he can not finally make the grade, and that is where we get quality. I am not entirely in accord with the gentleman over here who said we should not encourage any of these animals to be shown that are not a credit to the show ring, or a credit to the breed, or to a boy's credit that is showing. You will have to do sifting, and that is going on all the time and it will be more so. But what to do with the poor boy, the amateur showman, that we would like to send home happy, feeling that he has won somthing is the problem, because if he does not have that incentive you have lost what might in future years be a real show - man, and who might become a stock man of the state. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Graff. The question be - fore the convention is "Shall we or Shall we not have this sifting com - mittee at the state fair on these Four-H Baby Beeves". Quite a few have come in recently, I wish we could have a sifting committee out in these entertainment rooms, and maybe they would have been in sooner. Now, I think the State Fair Board Members are very anxious to get an expression from this convention as to whether or not they should proceed and have this sifting committee as they have done in the past. Is there anybody else that would like to speak on this subject? Try and stick to the subject as close as you can. Whether or not you think it is the right thing to do. M^R. WOLPH: I would like to ask you gentlemen how many of you would show in the open class if you knew there was a sifting com - mittee to meet you at the fair when you came in. That is exactly the proposition that you put up to the boy or girl. And I will warrant you that not a one of you would show in an open class. Ido not believe in prosecuting a child, and I do not believe in putting bars in the show to him I would not do to anybody else. I don't believe there is a county </seg>
         <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS fair or state fair in the state of Nebraska that would get very far if they had a sifting committee for everybody in the open class. The boy would rather take his licking before the judge everytlme, and would feel a lot better. I believe we could build a .better Four-H Club and do it a lot quicker than by the sifting committee up here. I will say this,. I believe that the breeders of the state have done more towards helping the club calves than the sifting committee has done, Lots of times it is not the boy's fault- that he does not win, it is not any fault of his own. And I believe he would learn his lesson a lot quicker if he could show before the judges than by having a sifting committee go around and eliminate his entry before competition. MR. HOWARD JENSEN, Washington County: It seems to me the reason for this sifting committee is to facilitate the work of the judges, because of the large number of the enrollment. But if you are going to have a sifting committee, or some committee, why not do that at home before the calf comes up here and all this added expense is incurred. Why put them to this added expense, why not send a competent person out.to the boy's home and inspect the calf before it is brought down here. There are men in every county in the state that have the ability to do this. '¦¦¦•..- MR. ANDY J. WELCH, Seward County. Do not the majority of our Four-H Club leaders sift these cattle at home? In our county we have a sifting committee, and the county agent does not allow any to go to the state fair that do not come under the wire, so to speak. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, : Mr. Welch. I realize, Mr.- Welch, that not every county in the state of Nebraska puts out the class of Four-H baby beeves that Seward county does. They have a reputa - tion of having toppers and only bringing down toppers. Incidently, would every county have men that could qualify to sift? That is some - thing I do not know. Is there someone else that wishes to speak on this subject? MR. GRAFF: Seward County happens to have a County Agent that weighs oyer three hundred pounds. MR. WELCH: That is correct. MR. GRAFF: We had him for six or seven years in our county, and that is one of his long suits. I can sympathize and feel for these boys. It don't look fair to dis - courage the boys in that line of work. You know at the International Congress,—you go down there with your car loads, and they have their sifting committees/and when they tell you to send them to the packers, that settles it. Now, I believe some gentleman here said every county </seg>
         <seg id="p120">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE had men that were competent, but he did not say that they were avail - able. I can see where a man would not undertake something like that In his own county, unless he was ready to move out. It takes an outsider to do that, and then there would be the matter of expense. But that would be the proper solution as I look at it, because they should not go on beyond the county fair unless those calves have got quality and finish to show up right in the big shows. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Graff. Are there any other questions or any move discussion on this? I think now is the time to thresh it out. I believe the State Fair Board would like to have an expression from this convention as to whether they should proceed one way or the other. Will be glad to hear from anybody else on this subject. We do not want to dwell too long on one thing. Is it the pleasure of this convention to take any action on this, a vote, I might say, that the state fair board might have the expression they get here from all sides? They do not want to do sifting If people of Nebraska, the fair men over Nebraska, say they should not. I believe they think, they are doing the right thing, and would like to have this convention's endorsement, or otherwise. I will entertain a motion, if it is your pleasure, if not, we will pass to our next subpect. A DELEGATE: I move you that you take the expression of the ' body. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: All right, with a motion I will. All in favor of having this sifting committee like has been the practice at the state fair, please raise your hand, regardless of whether you are a delegate or not, you have heard the thing discussed. All opposed to the sifting committee, signify by the same sign. The vote is almost unanimously opposed to it, so State Fair Board govern yourself accordingly. Now, we have a subject that interests every fair board manager in the state of Nebraska, a subject from which they derive a lot of their support, or their revenue, in other words, and this subject is going to be discussed by a gentleman who has had experience in this line of work. The subject is "Concessions: the class of how to know what to admit—how to collect". That is a big job, and the discussion will be led by Dave Osborn, of Pawnee City. Mr. Osborn has had charge of the concessions at Pawnee City for Pawnee County Fair and I take pleasure in presenting to this convention, Mr. Dave Osborn, of Pawnee l DAVE OSBORN: Ladies and gentlemen, I never see anybody read I a speech but what I am reminded of a preacher who always read his ' sermons. One Sunday morning he laid his notes on the table and step- </seg>
         <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS ped out, and while he was out the wind blew his papers off the table and the dog got hold of them and chewed them up. It was too late for him to rewrite his sermon so that all that there was left to do was to make the best of it. So he decided that the best thing to do was to start the service and when he came to the sermon he would do the best that he could. So that morning he apologized to the congregation and told them what had happened and that he would go ahead and do the best he could without his notes, and proceeded to preach one of tho most powerful sermons that they had ever heard. After the benediction everybody came lip to him and congratulated him on his sermon. One old lady held back until everybody had come up, and then she came up and told.him how she had enjoyed the sermon, and said "I don't live in this community and I just wonder if that dog had a pup that we could get for our preacher." (Laughter). . The class of concessions has always been a bone of contention. There are some would-be reformers with the Idea that they are person - ally responsible for the morals of the community and that every time a midway Is in need of their personal supervision. One good sister, one time rushed up to me and said "Mr. Osborn, they are selling alcohol on the grounds", when I investigated I found that it was near-beer less than one-half of one per cent alcohol. I'm afraid I wasn't in very good humor when I tcrtd her that as long, as the law permitted people to drink near-beer I could see no reason why it should not be sold. We had a clean midway, we did not have any wheels, spindles, or luck plays.in fact no games of chance' on the grounds. I was on the midway in a few minutes and some one came to me and told me they had closed everything up. I found a local preacher had had them closed and after thrashing the matter out with the county attorney he finally agreed that the only illegal concession was a horeshoe game where they sold shoes for ten cents apiece, and the player getting his shoe closest to the peg got forty cents. ¦ His contention was that there were four play - ers that didn't get anything for their money. The winter before this fair the merchants in our town had an auto - mobile drawing, and every person purchasing a bill of goods or a given amount was given a ticket for this drawing. After the fair I talked to two of the persons who had been the principal supporters of the preacher in the cleaning up campaign and reminded them of this auto - mobile drawing which was a lottery without a doubt, and suggested that it might be well if they would clean up the streets on the town before they started upon the fair. For several years I have been sending everything that was a little bit doubtful to our county sheriff,—he having a good deal of experience with picnics and other gatherings, and being able to contact the county attorney and county judge, was in a better position to pass on the legality of these concessions than I was. v </seg>
         <seg id="p122">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The sheriff and his deputy are the only law enforcment officers on the grounds with power to close any concessions. Our police are all Instructed about their duties and do the work assigned to them, and if they see anything that is not right they are instructed to report It to the sheriff or his deputy or myself and we will see that it is taken care of, but In spite of that we always have concessions that some people do not want. In our part of the country at least, when the concessions are spotted, we find it expedient to spot the concessions as fast as we can. and begin collecting the first day, the sooner these concessions are collected the better. Usually collectors work together, giving a receipt for the money collected and keeping a carbon copy of this receipt, and some percentage of the charges are collected every day, but most of the con - cessions that we know are all right, we leave until the last of the fair. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Osborn. We want you to ask the questions, and Mr. Osborn will answer them. MR. OSBORN: I also might add that Mr. Johnson can answer any question that I can't. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: He knows lam a bluffer anyway. This a very important subject, and I know that you have all had to deal with concessions, and it is a source of a large revenue for your fair. It is something that every fair board wants to get as many dollars from as they can. It has been my pleasure in the years past to halve visited Mr. Osborn's fair, I think four different times, and I have always thought that Mr. Osborn handled concessions just about as good as anybody did at any county fair that I ever saw. MR. VERNE HENSLEY, Merrick County: We had quite a lot of trouble with the county attorney up there in our county last summer. He got pretty stiff on these carnival cases, and forced us to close a corn game. I would like to ask Mr. Osborn if he^ever had a corn game closed on his fair grounds. MR. OSBORN: No, we have never had a corn game closed on us. There are different ways of conducting a corn game, you know. If you use a pick up that is a gamble pure and simple, but if you use a board with numbers on it, and dart and everybody throwing at that board, it Is a game of skill, and is not any game of chance. We make them use the dart and this board rather than the shakeup. I don't know that there is a lot of difference but it saves your conscience a little. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I see one of the corn men, who has made many of the fairs of Nebraska and many other states, and he is one of the best that I have ever had anything to do With,—Sidney Halford. I wonder if you will tell us something about the corn games? </seg>
         <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Mr. Half ord knows the corn games that are straight and ones that are crooked. MR. HALFORD: lam from lowa, but I have made a lot of the fairs in the state of Nebraska. I like Nebraska, in fact my wife and I have played a great deal over Nebraska. I have fellows like Mr. Vance, of Hastings, I played Mr. Vance's fair sixteenyears. Mr. Vance and Mrs. Brookes, and get along with them very good. I played with Mr. Osborn's fair, at Pawnee City. We have played St. Paul, Hart - ington, Bloomfield on the corn game, and during the time that I have worked corn games I have never in all my life met a bunch of people that I enjoyed so much, and I really love to work with them. It is not just the attitude they take towards the corn game, but on good prizes. We work hard to get good prizes for them,—we go into Chicago and try to buy merchandise for them that they would like to have in their own homes that they cannot buy in their home towns. lam not trying to criticize the home town people, but we do try to get prizes for them that they would like to play for. We don't like to give people prizes that we could not sell to them because they have no value. When we put prizes on our corn game_ they range from a dollar up not any less than a dollar we do not pay less than a dollar and from that on up to seven or eight dollars. Then we just let them go to.work and the winners get them. That is just why I have been at these fairs so long, be - cause I shoot square. We go down to Mr. Osborn's fair and we have nothing but a wagon to pull around.. Every player throws a dart at that box and gets a number,-—that is what they call a game of skill. lam not criticizing Mr. Osborn's fair, because he has one of the best fairs in the state, but that is the only place we have to use that box. It is all right with us if that is the way they want it, we play that corn game the way they want it, and we shoot square by everybody and give a prize to the on-, that wins and I get as much kick out of it as they do. MRS. BROOKES, Adams County: I have been in/The fair crowd every day that Mr. Halford has been there, during all of these years, and I believe it is splendid for our town. I don't know how other towns take it. We were told last year by some people that they did not know whether we should have a corn game or not. Well, I said "we will have it and if you don't like it you can come out and tell us about it", but they never came. The people from our town get things from Mr. Halford that they cannot buy, and there is a lot of women that are my best friends that go out there, and don't go around to see the stock at all, but go sit down there and play the corn game for three or tour days, and they nave an awfully good time doing it. Sometimes they get something and sometimes they, dp not, but it is one of the drawing features of our fair, and I like that kind of a thing myself. </seg>
         <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mrs. Brookes, Sid, you will have to give me a commission on what you sign this year. MR. HALFORD: I will, Mr. Johnson. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Before we go on with the corn game I would like to tell you something on Mr. Halford. Several years ago when he was up to Wahoo, and the first day It rained, and the second day it rained, but on the second day he came in and gave us eighty dollars for his corn game, he had not opened up yet but he gave us the eighty dollars, that is the way Sid plays and shoots square. Now, gentlemen, I have a question here that was dropped in the box. I don't see it just now, but it is on concessions. If I remember correctly it is "What constitutes clean concessions". Now, that might apply to entertainment, a lot, but it also applies to concessions. That Is a big question, there are concessions that are not considered clean. Is there any one else that wants to ask Mr. Osborn a question. If no one else is going to talk I am going to disagree with Mr. Osborn on the statement where he said, "when they are coming into spot them and go ahead and collect afterwards." I have had charge of the concessions at Wahoo for a good many years, and it has always been my policy never to spot a man unless he pays fifty per cent of his con - cessions. If his concession is ten dollars, or we will say twenty, and for the last five years we have had this policy, he pays ten dollars when I spot him. You can always keep a man from pitching his tent, but you can't keep him from tearing it down. I have found out this, you spot a man, especially gypsies, I guess Ed Melby will vouch for this, you always do business with male members of gypsy troupes, that is who you bargain with, you never see them again until the day they are taking their tent down. It is the same way with other concessions, you bargain with them and they want to get their tent pitched and play a day or two before they pay you any money, and when the day or two is gone they are gone. But if you get the fifty per cent when you spot them, and at the beginning of the third day,—in the morning- of the third day,—go around and collect the other fifty per cent or do not let them play, you can get it. It isn't fair to let one concession pay in full and another concession that pays half plays three or four days and have the same privilege. Let the fellow that pays in full get the money out of the crowd. I believe in making them pay one hundred per cent and collect fifty when you spot them. Is there any other discussion on that? MR. HALFORD: I think you are right about collecting that fifty per cent. I think that ought to be all right, If a man Isn't able to pay that so that he can do business, why I do not think that he ought to start, I think that he ought to stay home. </seg>
         <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. OSBORN: If concession people were all like Sid Halford, it would not make any difference when you collected, you could wait and collect after.the fair was over. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I might add another word: These con - cession people that are shady do not like to pay their bills, and want to dollar you to death—a dollar today and a dollar the next day.' I would sooner not spot them because they are just a source of trouble, and one year our fair lost five hundred dollars because the gentleman that had charge of concessions was dollared to death. He would collect three different times and get three dollars on a forty dollar concession, and we were holding the sack. MR. FRED STEYER, Douglas County: I think the way you speak of is the proper way to do it. Several years ago we had a little trouble with a man, he had been there for several years, and he seemed to be good pay, but this year was a little bit slow for him and he said, "well, you know me, and how things are, and I will pay you oh the third day.' On the third day he asked us to let him have another day, and the next morning when I got up he had "flew the coop." Since then we have made it a rule to collect fifty per cent when we spot them, and also stip - ulate that the show is clean, and if it is not clean we shall tell them to fold up, and what they have paid they won't get back. I think they ought to pay fifty per cent when you spot them. MR. R. R. VANCE, Adams County.: I want to tell'some of my friends how to keep them from sliding out, I solved that question very nicely, but it is pretty hard on the cash man. Now, when I spoi anybody, I have a number, just a small one that I tack up on the concession, then we have a couple of policemen that stay up there in the booth all night, and I go home and rest easy until they call me up way long In the night, maybe in the morning about two or three o'clock. I go to the phone—the police up at the fair grounds will say, "Vance, number 10 is loading", andl say "Wait a minute", and go get my little red book, and if this poor devil hadn't been making any money, and has paid any part of his concession, and I know he is not making it, I say to that policeman, "Let him go", but it he owes me and I think the man has been making some money I say to the policeman "If he will pay ten or fifteen dollars more let him go, if heroes not, hold him until I get up in the morning". They don't get away, but it. is hard on me —jump- ing up to answer the phone and coming down so early in the morning. One more word about concessions, I have handled them for sixteen years, and usually get a pretty igood bunch. However, you get a bunch from the southern states, usually a little more tricky than these fellows up here in the north. I don't know why it is. Now, a lot of times a good concession man will drive in and if yoi </seg>

One year I had nearly every foot on the grounds sold, and a couple of young fellows drove in and said, "Vance, we just have enough money to buy some goods, we will pay you but you will have to wait until we make the money". Well, I had everything full, and I didn't have to take any chance, but I took them over by the Red Cross building, right close to Mrs. Brookes, where I thought she could watch them a little bit, and let them run. I sold them a spot that I had never sold in my life on that fair ground, a place about fourteen feet square, gave them plenty of dirt because that didn't make any difference. I never said a word to those boys until Friday night when I walked in and one of them says, "Have a cup of coffee with us, Vance, so I sat down and drank a cup of coffee with them These fellows had not paid a penny up to that time. When we flished our coffee one of them said to the other "go back and get the money", and he went back and got a big sack of money and they paid me the eighty dollars and believe me they had plenty of money left. That is what I got for trusting those boys. About two years afterwards the same two boys drove in again, and came and hunted me up and said, "Vance, we are broke again, but you can take our car down and lock it up, so you will be sure to get your money". I said "I made money the other time". They said "We would like to have a good spot", so I gave them one not quite so big but a better location and stayed away from them and did not bother them until Friday night, and when I walked in and drank another cup of coffee with theiji and got sixty-five dollars from them. Now, when Sid Halford conies down there he does not try to make me trust him. The first year he was on our grounds, I didn't know him and let him run until he got through, and then he paid up, and came out with a sack and said "here's a bag of money and would like to hay. you take it down to your bank and send me a draft," I said "now much is it", and he said, "Four hundred and sixty dollars". I said "My gosh, you don't know me Mr. Halford, are you going to trust me with that"'. And he said "That is all I am telling you to do, take it down and send me a draft." So you can't always tell how to handle these concession features. MR. HALFORD: It is true that you can't tell how to handle thes. concessioners, some of them are the biggest robbers there are in the world. As far as Mr. Vance Is concerned, you can't get away from him any - way, I knew I would have to pay him before I got out of there, so I might as well pay him one time as another. I have played his fair for sixteen years, and always got along with him fine. It the concession men will work with the business secretary they will get along all right. There are a lot of concession men that need </seg>
         <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS just a little support. They run around and spend a lot of. money around and they go broke and then come into the fair grounds and really need a little support. I really believe the best thing the secretary can do is learn the man who comes into his fair, and you can tell by a man's looks if you want him or not. MR. LOUIS A. HASTERT, Polk County: It seems that everybody uses different tactics dealing with concession men. In our county we are a little harder about it. Last year we had twenty-seven concessions on the grounds and we made every one of these concessions pay one hundred cents on the dollar before we let them put down their con - cessions, and every one was willing. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Is there any further discussion on this subject? If not, we will leave it. T am sorry to announce that Mr. J. Hastings of Osceola, is very sick with the flu, and it Is impossible for him to be here. But some one has come to our rescue, from our neighboring state and it is a pleasure for me to present to this convention a gentleman who will give us a few words of greetings from his state, Mr. Harmon, secretary of the Kansas Association of Fair Managers of Topeka, Kansas. Mr. Harmon. MR. HARMON: The chairman said I might give you some ideas about fair management, which reminds me of a story that I once heard about a man that came in from the mines into a little mining town. He had not had much to eat for some time, and said to the waiter "I want a Porterhouse stea_, about that thick, and smothered with onions". Some of you fellows with grey, hair that have lived out in the western part a long time may know about What one of these mining camp restaurants were. The man that ran the place came and looked the fellow over after the order was given and said "Do I look like a damn fool", well he weighed about two hundred pounds, and the.fellow said "no, I don't think you do". "Well," he said, "I would be if I put out anything like that. If I had anything like that around here I would eat it my self". So if I knew anything about the running these fairs I would do it myself In Kansas. I came up here to find out something. I came up here not withstanding the fact, that I have a bad cold. Coming up here I am reminded that Kansas and Nebraska, way back yonder—before a lot of us remember very much were together in one territory, and those people who settled these plains were the cream of America, they were individualists, they had a way of thinking, they were optimists. In other words they looked at the doughnut more than the hole, and they thought everything would be all right in the spring. And when I came up here to your magnificent state house, the only one like it in the United States, and I walked in at the north door </seg>
         <seg id="p128">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE there, involuntarily I thought of the caverns that prehistoric men had dug out and lived in, and then I walked In and saw the beautiful decor - ations of the magnificent building, and went up in the elevator and looked out over your wonderful prairie country and I thought that only a few years ago, comparatively, the whole magnificent territory was populated only by roaming bands of Indians. And then I came down the elevator and walked to your one house legislature which only a few years ago was unheard of, even the name you have given it, I thought as one of the gentlemen said here that we are moving at a pretty rapid pace. Then I walked into your his - torical society hall, and I saw a bronze tablet there and a bust Of a man that only forty years ago came to Lincoln, and made such a furror that it was heard around the world, and after the most bitter, vindic - tive and positive campaign that ever was heard of in this country he returned to Lincoln as an outstanding radical of this country. And then I thought that is only forty years ago, and if William Jennings Bryan could come back here to Lincoln today and look over this country where his cross of gold was absolutely obliterated, and where it is now even a felony almost to have a gold dollar in your pocket, he would have considered himself very much of a conservative instead of a radical, as we thought him at that time. And so when I stood the other day in my office at home and heard Big Ben toll the hour at London, England, I was a good deal like the old man who went to the circus and saw a giraffe for the first, time. He looked up to the giraffe and looked at his wife, Mary, and said "Mary, there ain't such a goldarned animal", and today I can't hardly make myself believe there is any such a thing. Can you under - stand how without any wires, without any connections, with nothing that you can see. nothing that you can feel, a man can stand in Wash - ington and be heard just as plainly and distinctly as right before you' We don't have it so commonly now but is coming and then you can see him well, as you can see me here talking to you. This talk about concessions reminded me that about twenty-five or thirty years ago, one of the good brethren, came to me and wanted a concession closed at our fair because the lady did not have any more clothes on than you will see walking up and down the street now— what was a clean concession in those days would be clear out of date So, we are living In an age, and we have got to consider that we are going at a fast rate on a trend nobody knows where. Sometimes we say "what is it all about, any way". You old grey haired men in here, after it is all said and done, have been fighting the battles of years —you get up in the morning, and go to bed at night, you make your friends and your enemies, and after it Is all done you lay down </seg>
         <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS and take your six feet of earth like the rest of us. Maybe in ten years, maybe twenty-thirty-forty-sixty or eighty. But what is it all about?' After all I think all you can really figure is that you have done some - thing, not that you have laid up a lot of gold or silver, or lead, but that you have done something for your fellowman that makes his living easier, that makes him feel that he has a friend that he can go to for assistance. What has this to do with the fairs. I heard several folks mention Four-H Club. That Is my idea of what a fair is for. You take fellows like Johnson and Marshall, there is no use of fooling with them, you can't change them, they are "sot" in their ways, you can't change their methods of living. But how about this boy or girl? It is the thing that you do for that boy or girl that will be remembered for years and years after you have forgotten it. Down in our town in our fair we made it a point to have, for a number of years and until they got too numerous, taken them out to Manhattan to the Four-H Club building, and time after time, years after those same boys and girls would come to me, would remind me about the time Ihad taken them down to Kansas City or to Manhattan. They remembered that, but I had forgotten, I remembered that I had taken a bunch of boys but I did not remember that particular boy. I remember one boy that came and talked to me after he was grown and married. When a little tike ten years old I took him out to Manhattan, he took in those lectures, and now he's farming for himself. I was interested in this talk about this sifting committee aiid I don't think anything of that committee. If you have got the right kind of judges they will tell the boy what Is the matter with the calf, but this boy if he has shown the poorest calf;has done something, and should be taught where he fell down, and be given a chance to build up again. ' I don't know how it is in Nebraska but in Kansas, outside of a few high schools where we have Vocational Training, there Is hot a class, there is not a teacher, there is not a book that tells these boys and girls or gives them any instructions or that gives them any inducement or information to go back on the farm and make better farmers or house - wives of themselves. It is all algebra, geometry, higher mathematics, Greek, Latin and anything else,—you know what it is. You know that our high schools have over looked the fact that in an agricultural state like Kansas or Nebraska the vital thing to teach these boys and girls is to teach them so that they will know how, and they will want to go back to the farm and produce more stuff at less cost and with less effort, and live a higher life than their parents, did. That is my Idea of what fairs are for, and fairs are doing just that very thing. By com - parison I am just another one of the boys, we are all boys, maybe 5 : ''¦¦•' ' ' .". </seg>
         <seg id="p130">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rather old boys, but we are boys yet so long as we have an interest in the fair. Some one was saying we do not get paid for fair work. I claim we get the best pay there is,—we get all the pay there is. We may not get paid In money, we do not get the long green, but how much does that satisfy. When we are improving these boys and girls we are getting the best pay there is. Why? Because we ars making the best citizens possible to be made. We are educating our boys and girls away from the farm. We get them into the city. We educate the boys and girls that they do not need to work for a living, that they can go to town and get a salaried job. We are educating them away from the farm, and fairs are educat - ing them back to the farm. That is why I say we are getting the best pay there is because we make better citizens. It is work, of course, it is a lot of work, but it is work everybody ought to enjoy. I have enjoyed this meeting with you folks. I have been secretary of our association down in Kansas for about fourteen years, and we have the same problems that you boys here have, and I see here it is like we have it at home, hut it is a good deal like the old revival preacher that gets up and preaches a good sermon, I don't know whether the dog run away with his prepared sermon or not, but you see he doesn't get to the sinner that ought to be there, because he's not in the congregation. And that is the trouble with our state associations. If we could get every fair manager to come to the State Association and exchange ideas with each other and get a little enthusiasm we would have a whole lot better fair when we return home, and as a matter of fact I often think the little fairs do just as much and possibly more in the way of improving and getting the enthusiasm of the boys and girls as the great big fairs, because the little fair, it is much more informal. You get around and you talk to each other, and get acquainted with Bill, Tom, Joe, Mary and Ruth and that way you get the whole theory that you are working for. And that is for the betterment of yourself and the community, which you live in. So, I would say that the real spirit of a man never grows old, he should always feel that he is one of the boys in the Four-H club work. He gets so old that he can't belong but he can still have that same interest. I picked up a little clipping that I am going to read to you in clos - ing. It is my idea of the prayer that the real fair man can say, be - cause he makes more friends than anybody else, he may have enemies too but he makes more friends. The little prayer runs like this. "1 thank the Lord that I am straight and strong, with wit to work and hope to keep me brave, I thank Thee for the sight of sunlit land, of dipping hills, the shimmer of the evening grass; I thank Thee that </seg>
         <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS the cold damp brooks that flow thru the lands can give me dally calm as I pass this way. And I thank thee that I love the things of earth, work, song, laughter, the courage of beating human hearts that laugh and weep. I thank Thee that everything I need not know, yet need not fear the mystery of the end. But more than these, and tho all these be good, thus on my bended knee, dear Lord, I thank Thee for my friends." I thank you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Harmon. We have a very distinguished gentleman from another neighboring state but before I present him to this convention, I.wish the chaplain of our new uni - cameral legislature would stand and make a bow. Mr. Zimmerman,. Rev. Zimmerman. REV. ZIMMERMAN: I would like to answer that question asked" about what kind of concessions to have in your fairs. I think George Jackson probably always answers that question in his management in a good way. I talked to George one time and I said, "George, I would like to know something about some of these concessions, what kind of concessions do you. like to bring to your fair", and Georges-a - nswer was "Concessions that I could take my wife and my children to".. I am a small town preacher but I work with the county fairs and the- State Fair; also I have been to all of the world fairs in the United States for quite'a few years, and I have seen all kinds of concessions. If you ask yourself what kind of people go to the fairs, you can answer what kind of concessions you ought to have at fairs. We do have the sort, we do have the man that is given to gambling, but largely our fairs are agricultural fairs set up by the state of Nebraska and given assistance by the state in order to give the farm lads and farm lassies a better education along; agricultural lines in a general way. We dis - miss our country schools for our fair days, when every child in the county goes to the fair, We have our Four-H Club. We have our mothers, bur daughters, and our sweethearts,'and that question ought to be answered in that, way, bring into your fairs the kind of conces - sions that you want to take your daughters to and your mothers, and. your sweethearts, and-be rather careful about the kind of concessions: that you don't want to take them to. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Zimmerman. When I intended to call on Rev. Zimmerman, I didn't realize he was a "fair" preacher. Now, I see one of our senators on the floor, and I know this senator is a,real fair man, I've visited his fair many times, and I hope that he will be just as good a legislator as he is a fair man; my good friend, I call him "Doc" Cady from Arlington, -Doc, would you give a bow, and say a few words it you like. </seg>
         <seg id="p132">KEl'i &gt;HT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SENATOR CADY: President Johnson, Fair Managers, and Fai Boosters: I came here not to be heard, I came to listen tonight lar interested, yes, or else I would have been some place else where hay plenty of work to do. But this is more than a business with me this fair management business is sort of a disease if you so care t take it. I know a little about what you are doing here today, last yea and the year before, because it has been my business for these man many years to associate myself quite closely with the boys over till state that are interested in the promotion of better agricultural show in our state. I just want to say while I am here that the problems of the legisla ture are many and pretty tough to handle. When you stop to con slder the program that Xebraska has carried out, that program of build ng the ,-apltol that they were talking about, paying for it as we bull, the building, building roads and paying for them as we build them whatever state improvements have been made it has been paid for or completion of the project. Today we are faced, as never before, with state problems, the un - fortunate are more than ever before. The ability of the people who stil can pay and do pay is very much depreciated. Now, put those two problems together „»,, &#132;-y and solve it in the traditional way of taking care of all those in need and still taking care of the taxpayers if you can see the picture as it is presented to we folks who are trying to legislate for the good of all. We are faced with the proposition of ways and means to do these things, whether it is right to continue the extra cent gasoline u,x. whether we should vote another property tax to sup - plant the gasoline tax. because the gasoline tax in the first place was made to build highways. Then another controversial matter is what are we going to do about a moratorium; are you going to extend the present moratorium •; Well, the answer to me seems so simple If this was ever good legislation then most certainly it still is good legislation but there are those who think it has gone tar enough. I just want to say this, President Johnson, that I hope that the time is not here when the support, the small crutch which has been given to the county fairs in the way of premiums will be curtailed lou folks, of course, do not have to lobby me to know that I will give every support within my power to see that you are still given the privilege of a good premium list, premium appropriations from Up county, i think it should be maintained. I know what you have been up agamst for the last few years, wondering whether you ought to con - iTd riT kneW y°U Wei'e undeltakin S * big program, but as we talked at Arlington, if we discontinue the fair and wait until it rains in Nebraska, and it most certainly will rain one of these days, then our organization is broken up, and the chances are that with that organ - ization goes the fair. So we have continued in our small way and I </seg>
         <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS am thankful that we have continued. I know the rest of you are going to continue, and I hope that the state and counties are going to con - tinue, and I hope that the state and counties will continue to finance this most worthwhile program. . PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Now, there are gentlemen I would like very much to calf on, but we have several questions that have been placed in our question box which P wish to take up after our next speaker. It gives me great pleasure to present a man from the state of lowa, the state where-the tall corn grows regardless of whether it rains or does not rain, the state of lowa. We have with us this evening the secretary of the lowa Association of Fair Managers, Mr. Williams. Will Mr. Williams please come forward? MR. WILLIAMS: Mr. President, members of the Nebraska Asso - ciation, and Senators: I came up here as a visitor, as I enjoy, these meet - ings. Our convention was held the first week in December, so the topics and the troubles of the fair men are very fresh in my memory. I have had the privilege of being the secretary of the lowa Associa - tion for sixteen years. I have had the privilege of attending every session of the legislature in lowa for the last twenty-two years in the interest of fairs. I took the pains to go over and see your new body of legislators this morning, to my mind it is one of the greatest steps forward any state has ever taken. The gentleman that spoke here to - night should be highly. honored to think that he and his associates are members of the first body which the gentleman from Kansas re - ferred to in giving us a word picture where we are going to. In answer to the many questions that come to all fair men, I think that many can be answered in this way. You do admit the wonder - ful improvements of every line of travel, and many other lines. It goes undisputed that every man in this room is interested in the wel - fare of his community inasmuch as he is interested in the fair or he would not be here. Now, inasmuch as we admit the fact that the world is moving on, and faster every day, do we take stock of ourselves as fair men, and are we keeping up with the times, or have we gone too fast. I think personally, and lam sTpeaking of lowa, as lam not here to give advice or suggestions to the state of Nebraska, but speaking of my own state, I think we have not kept up, we have gone along in a manner of a rut. The gentleman from Kansas referred to the year,, back and of going up in the tower this morning. I did that myself, and the thoughts went through my mind in practically the same manner, only I looked at it and, could see a vision of my father going through this state and other states in the old wagon days, and were he living today, I wonder what his vision would be from that tower. We havo </seg>
         <seg id="p134">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE advanced in many ways, in some ways I don't think the fairs have kept up with the times, and many ways I don't think the local county lairs have advanced. My town is about four thousand population in Dele - ware county, lowa, and we are just the average county fair, so I have had the opportunity of a personal Wew of the average fair. We have been afraid to advance on account of so called criticism by the public I think the average fair board should take into consideration that the day the fair opens they have two things to sell,—space and tickets — and you have covered a lot of your argument. Remember when your fair opens that you have only two things, space and tickets that can bring in your finances and pay off your overhead. Maybe it would be of interest to you gentlemen to note a passing few words in regard to our State Association over in lowa. lam sure that it is run along different lines than your association here. We have ninety nine counties in the state, and we have seventy-seven fairs in the state. Last year, seventy-one came out with a little or a bigger profit, our dues to the association are one per cent. We have state aid in lowa, the state grants us aid. By that I mean this, they make a biennial appropriation, of which we are asking this session for a hun - dred and thirty-five thousand dollars for 1937, and the same for 1938 In paying out the premiums the state of lowa reimburses each fair eighty per cent of the first thousand dollars paid out for premiums although you understand that does not include presenting premiums to free acts, or any of the other expenses. They reimburse us eighty per cent of the first thousand in premiums paid out, seventy per cent of the next thousand, sixty per cent of the next thousand, but no fair in the state of lowa big or small, receives over two thousand dollars of state aid money. Ten years ago, we were fortunate enough to have a bill introduced S uTS T\ aU°WS tbe C°UntieS l° SiVB 3id ' in aay CoUnty where " fair is held the board of supervisors may, (not must) levy not to exceed one-half of a mill tax tor the aid of that lair, which must be used for the erection of buildings or Four-H club work. Now, just to give you a little idea of ,vhat that county aid is, my county on the average dollar^ TttT W°Uld rUn fr°m thirtj-four t0 "lirty-six hundred do ars. Scott County, or Davenport, runs about thirteen thousand dollars. I want to say this, that our association has felt that they had he right to this money. It has been my pleasure, as I stated, to attend these sessions, an d I have met some of the most marvelous men, too among the livestock breeders of the past. We have counties that have fair managers that are broad minded kn w wT nw ln which your fa!r and my fair ™y be ™*- we Sr ?l aV6rage maaageT Ot tbe County fafr- °r &lt;"strict fair ia " giving of his or her time because of interest in the community, interest in the boys and girls of that community, and they feel that the fair is </seg>
         <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS entitled to their help, and we honor them for it. We know that the average fair man doesn't receive even mileage for his car; their only pay is the satisfaction they receive for doing something for their community. j . When I think back to the time when I started fair work in my county, and I have given much time to it, and as I go about the state, I realize that I have made hundreds of friends. Sometimes when I go to other states, people come up to me and make themselves known, —they probably led a calf out on that fair ground tenjor or fifteen years ago. We have all got to admit that the days are approaching faster and many of us are advancing toward the great divide. I still believe that the fairs are here to stay. Every public speaker that gets up to speak refers to agriculture, and land knows we get all the help we can get for it In the way of appropriations, and I have this to offer, without fear of contradiction, that the aid that we received from the state or county absolutely goes to the rural folks, and none other. We have had drouth along the southern part of the state, the same as you folks have, and I do not know what the fairs would have done without this aid. However, with It they have held together and held their fairs. It would be foolish for me to go into the business end of county fairs, as you are all just as well posted on it as I am, but I do have a warm spot in my heart for the so-called "Free Attractions", especially for the concession people. I believe much trouble could be overcome on the fair grounds, not by being too lenient with the finances, but I do believe that if you place yourselves in their steps you will learn that the trouper is the biggest hearted human being that ever lived. The trouper is a regular person, he has his home and has his loved ones. I have this criticism to offer about my own people,—that if they would open their hearts and come across and treat the trouper as one of them, no matter what his capacity may be; they would get more money expended for those attractions. Troupers are human, they are artists, and you could not pay them a greater compliment; The criticism I have found in my own state is this, if the average fair board after buying an attraction, program or contracting with a carnival, would meet them as you meet them in this room, later in your own town, and would exhibit the same friendliness, and apparently the same confidence in their ability or their wares when they arrive on the grounds, I be - lieve the performance would be better. But I have never attended a fair in Nebraska, except the State Fair, so I am not offering any criticism. These troupers travel all over the country, and in our state there may be a concession man from Lincoln, your town, or some other town of your state, or, If you please, there may be a concession man from my home town that goes to the other fellow's fair ground. They are not only concession people, they are just human beings, and </seg>
         <seg id="p136">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE there is the sticker. I have advocated this point for several years, It is still a hobby with me. I think that where our state associations fall down is this, lowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Nebraska, known as our State Associations are holding together as state associations, with dif - ferent meeting dates, of course, but they could each appoint a com - mittee of three, and have an interstate association, if you please, and we could weed out the fakers, and then If we would all be men enough to stick together and, as a gentleman said here this evening, let them know that we mean business, we would have no trouble. We must admit that during the last few years of the depression, there were times that many good men, good at heart and clean, were down and had nowhere to light. They did not know what occupation to pick up, but it was the easiest outlay to procure some sort of a game of chance and call themselves troupers and make the various fairs. They knew no more about the game than you and I, but it was an outlet for their endeavors and enough to eat on. In my state we patterned after you. I was here some six years ago, I believe, and I took home with me to our association the idea of a grievance committee. lam going to be honest with you, we tried it out for two years. The gievance committee seemed to be a manner in which to relieve the hard ridden secretary of some of his work. I took enough home with me, and we formulated our grievance committee, which consisted of the president, vice-president, secretary-treasurer, and five directors, so I was made the goat of both. We did have a few grievances, but in every case found, or at least I thought I did, that the secretary x was just as much at fault, either intentionally or un - intentionally, as the man on the road. So we gradually swung out of the grievance committee, because some of our secretaries were not paying their bills, they would not abide by the rules of our own asso - ciation, and were not holding up to the idea of fair and square dealing. We are still holding on to it, but I am going to say this frankly, that I insist when they come before the grievance committee they must have the company of written material pertaining to any grievance. Gentlemen, I do not want to take any more of your time. I have enjoyed being here with you, and at this time I want to extend life - long invitations that when any of you are in lowa you visit our asso - ciation. In closing I want to say that I am glad to be here with you and may you have one of the most successful seasons you have ever ex - perienced in the State of Nebraska. I thank you. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Williams, I am sure that we can profit by the experience of our neighbors, and will. </seg>
         <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Now, before we go to the question box, I have on the desk here names of three or four concession people or entertainers that did not have their cards handed in this afternoon, and we would like to give them a chance at this time to tell us what they have to sell. The first one that I will call on will be Rosenthal Amusement Company. We had listed this afternoon thirty-four different attraction companies, 1 believe that is a record for this association. REPRESENTATIVE OF ROSENTHAL AMUSEMENT COMPANY: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Gentlemen, I now want to say a few words to those of you who are interested in a good clean enter - tainment for your fair, a program that will be an asset to your fair. I am speaking on behalf of the Lou Rosenthal Amusement Company, of Waterloo, lowa. We are located in parlor J. I arrived a little late today and our displays are not in yet,; but I expect Mr. Rosenthal any time this evening or tomorrow. We would be glad to have you come around and look regardless of whether you buy from us or not. We will be very glad to make your acquaintance and show you around. We are well equipped to give you a large revue or a small one, and a big program or a small one, and I am sure that we can agree with you and meet up with your pocket book and give you a better program for the price you can pay. Last year we played the Red River Valley Circuit in Minnesota, and for nine consecutive years, so that shows that we can give those folks satisfaction. We will be glad to meet you to - morrow in parlor J, come in and we will show you our displays. Others were called but did not respond. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: It is not very late yet, and I have some questions here that we will take up. "Does the State Association recognize more than one county fair board or organization of. that nature in the same county, should the board of county commissioners recognize more than one fair board by county appropriations?" I might say that we have in the state of Nebraska, Dodge county has two county fairs that are both recognized by the. State Board of Agri - culture. I think at the present time that is the only county in the state. A. DELEGATE: Frontier has two, also. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: What is the name of your association? A DELEGATE: We have the Frontier County organization it is divided into two fairs, and one is the Frontier County Fair and the other is the Eustis Fair. ' PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you. -71 Should the board of county commissioners recognize more than one fair board by county appropriation?" Well, I would think they </seg>
         <seg id="p138">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE should where there are two fairs recognized by the state board of Agri - culture. Is there any further question or answer to those questions? If not, I will pass to the next one. "Is there any special appropriation for county fairs organizations having an entirely free fair available over the regular appropriation by the board of county commissioners?" That appropriation I might say is set by statute and I do not believe there is any statute that would permit any county board to make an extra appropriation be - cause they have a free gate. Of course you know that the second two thousand is optional with your county commissioners whether you have a free gate or not. Is there any question? Or anybody else that wants to answer that. MR. HENRY F. KUIIL, Knox County: In Knox County in addi - tion to the two thousand dollar appropriation they can also levy two and one-half to eight cents per pupil for school premiums. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: That is correct. Is there anything further on that? Here is another who would like to hear the experiences of different managers on buying free acts through booking agencies versus independent acts. That is a question that we could take up a lot of time, does anybody want to answer that question? I know there are some county fair boards in the state of Nebraska that are not buying of the booking companies and would sooner buy of independent com - panies. It does not make much difference who you buy from, it is to get your moneys worth, I guess. Does anybody have anything to say? MR. E. R. PURCELL: I think that is a matter that is up to the fair board. I think it is a question of whether you want to run the risk of buying independently or not. I might say that if the act is not de - livered you do not always know that you can recover damages, but with the reliable booking agencies you can recover, although I think there are a number of very reliable acts that book independently. You do have that protection of the reliable booking agencies, in case something happens, and I know it has happened with us. when the act through some accident, death sickness or something of that kind cannot be delivered, then the booking agency will make every effort possible, and usually do fill the place with an act that is satisfactory. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Purcell. I think that is correct. Does anybody else have anything to say on this? If not, I will pass to the next question. "Are beauty pageants at county fairs profitable and advisable?" That is a good subject, you can spend a lot of time on that, and I know you men would like to talk about the beauty contest. Is there any county fair represented here that had' a beauty pageant or beauty contest at their fair last year? There Is a gentleman. </seg>
         <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS .i ¦" ¦ MR. HENRY JORGENSEN, Howard County. Our last fair was the first fair where we tried having a beauty pageant and to make a more interesting contest out of it, we had a precinct affair, when we picked the winner from the precinct, and then on the last night we brought in the winners from the sixteen precincts for the final contest, and it made a very successful affair for ua: Whether it will be continued or not I don't know. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Jorgensen. S. W. ROE, Valley County: I think there Is a little misunderstand - ing in regard to this. I think there is a distinct difference between a beauty pageant and a style show. I think that what most fairs had last year was nothing more or less than style shows. Now, there has been in certain parts of the state, regular beauty pageants/also style shows that were very satisfactory in drawing good crowds, but not what I would call beauty pageants, and was not so listed in the advertis - ing. One was held under the auspices of the American Legion or the Ladies Auxiliary of the American Legion. It was very satisfactory but I would not call it a beauty pageant. Ido not know whether a beauty pageant would be the proper thing in the county fair in certain parts of the state. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank you. Is there anybody else? I know there are counties in Nebraska that have popularity contests, but that is not really a beauty pageant. I think our state fair this last year had a beauty contest, and I am sure that those of you who saw the show liked it and it was a real draw - ing card to my notion. It was my pleasure to attend both evenings. However, the girl that happened to be picked as Miss Nebraska, for - feited her rights, but that was not the State Fair's fault. MR. LOUIS A. HASTINGS, Polk County: We had a beauty pageant the first night of our fair—as a rule our first night brings the largest crowd. We had over a hundred and fifty girls entered in the pageant, but before the actual show fifty-one of them dropped out, but we still had left ninety-nine in the pageant It was one ot the best drawing cards we put on at the fair. • i PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I knew it was a success, because I was there the following day to visit their fair, and heard very many complimentary remarks on the presentation before the grand stand on the night before, which was of. course the night you had this beauty pageant. Is there anything else on tills question. I believe that is all the questions we have. There are four or five attraction companies that did not respond to roll call this afternoon, and we want to give these gentlemen every chance and opportunity that </seg>

         <seg id="p142">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Now, lam ver y sorry to disappoint you this morning but we/received a message from Mr. Erie Smiley, of Seward, who was going to talk on County Fairs In the South Sea Islands". We received a message from Mr. Smiley that he is judging poultry at the Denver Stock Snow and that show is so large that he is unable to get through in time to get here. I know Mr. Smiley would handle this subject in correct shape because he has ability, and he has judged over in the South Sea 1 Islands and has judged In big fairs in all the world. He judged the poultry show In Hawaii, I believe about a year ago. Now. we have several questions, that is two or three questions, in the question box, that have not been answered which we will take up a little later. However, at this time we will have the report of the legislative committee. This report is to be given by the chairman ot the legislation committee, the other two members are Joe S. Steele of Kimball, Nebraska, and A. A. Russell of Geneva, Nebraska. Mr. Matzke. our vice-president, is chairman of that committee. MR. MATZKE: Gentlemen, the specific task that was given your legislative committee at the last meeting was to ascertain whether or not this organization had for its government a constitution and by - laws, they seemingly were lost at that time and could not be found. We went to Perry Reed's office and searched there, and were unable to find them at that time, however, at some later time in an old file Perry Reed dug out the constitution, and I want to read to you that constitution and those by-laws. They are short and to the point, and will probably settle some of the questions that have been raised This was adopted and made a part of the proceedings of this organization for the year 1928, and in that bulletin is the report for the year. "Constitution and the by-laws for the Nebraska Association of Fair Managers". These were adopted in January, 1928. (Proceeds to read constitution and by-laws). CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS OF THE NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS ARTICLE 1. The name of this association shall be the "Nebraska Association of Fair Managers." ARTICLE 2.

At this time I would like to pause to ask if there are any questions concerning this that you would like to have answered, any questions or suggestions you would like to make? If there are none, I will'continue with the report; which we have here. For reasons, which your committee, Mr. Steele, Mr. Russell and my - self consulting with Perry Reed and Mr. Johnson and Mr. Marshall consider sufficient, we are making no report on the Pari-Mutuel matter at' the present time. ..'..-'."'' There is one thing that your committee considers important in the matter in change of by-laws and legislative changes, that is the matter of the date of our meeting. We made a half-way survey, and it is our opinion that there are from twenty-five to fifty able fair men vitally in - terested in the County Fairs and in the state fair that are not able to be at this meeting because of their attendance at the Denver Livestock Show. The Denver Livestock Show has their meeting the same week in January as. our State Board of Agriculture which dates are set by law, and our by-laws fix our meeting the same week as the State Board of Agriculture, so it is a joint proposition of our by-laws and the- </seg>
         <seg id="p144">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE statutory law of the state, and it would require a statutory enactment of the legislature to change that date. About a week ago K. C. Fouts of Seward county, an able fair man loaded sixteen head of fat beeves and twenty-two head of hogs and' shipped them to Denver for the Livestock Show. Erie Smiley has been int. rested in fairs all his life, both as an exhibitor and judge, and he is at the Denver show. The fact of the matter is that the reason I get into this fair work is that Smiley and Fouts would be listed on your programs and could not come and would ask me to pinch-hit for them. It would help us if they could be here. But they are at this Denver show, and your committee after going over this situation would recommend to this body that we pass a resolution urging the legislature to change the date of the meeting so that it does not conflict with the Denver Livestock show. Now, I think that Joe Steele a member of our committee who is down here in the legislature a lot of the time and Perry Reed can carry this out and have the bill drawn so it will work out all right, and I really believe it would assist us in building up our attendance probably twenty per cent greater than at the present time. And would greatly increase the number of men we could call on at our round table discussion and for our speakers list, and would increase the interest in our organization meetings if that date could be changed so it would not conflict with (he Denver show. I think that is about the extent of the report of your legislative com - mittee. In addition I want to say this that in answer to the letters that we sent out asking for specific recommendations we received twelve letters back. There was no uniformity of suggestions contained in them, but I win say this, I think eight out of the twelve made the sug - gestion that our meeting date be set so as not to conflict with the Denver show. Four of the eight suggested that it be held just one week later in this same month. There was nothing else of particular interest that was suggested for legislative changes or for changes to the con - stitution and by-laws. Mr. President, I submit this report of your legislative committee and suggest the matters presented here by the committee be thrown open for such discussion or action as the body might want to take, but as chairman of the committee I will move that this organization go on record urging the legislature to enact a law that will change the date of our annual meeting as not to conflict with the Denver Livestock show. A DELEGATE: I second the motion. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Now, is there any discussion, I don't think I should put this motion until it is aired out properly at this conven- </seg>
         <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS tion.. This question has come up more than once before. What is your pleasure? MR. JOE S. STEELE, Kimball County: My only thought in changing this meeting date, as far as lam concerned is our county. I would like to see it set at least ten days or two weeks later than it is now for this reason, most of our fair men go to the Denver show, and they are over there all week, and if they have to come home and hop right on the train and come down here they might not like to do it. But if they had a week to spend at home before this meeting came on they would be more apt to come to this meeting. MR. BERT MILLER, Washington County. lam just wondering if this meeting of the Denver Livestock.show has been set for all time. I remember at one time some years ago that this meeting was held a week later than now. I remember distinctly attending the annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture here and immediately took the train and went out and attendedlthe meeting of the Denver Live - stock show. But for some reason or other they shifted the meeting to one week earlier. The question is, has the Denver Livestock show set the show for all time, or will they at some later time set the show for some other date. Supposing we go ahead and get the legislature to change the date of our animal meeting to a week later and then Denver would do the same thing? I don't know whether they would do that or not, but that is the question that arises in my mind and in the mind of some of the other members. Personally, I don't want to have our annual meeting conflict with the Denver stock show. The men that have been referred to here are great workers for the state fair and county fairs, and they are not able to be present. Does anybody know definitely? Mr, Steele, do you know? MR, STEELE: I cannot answer that question. The same thoughts came to my mind this morning, whether that was a definite date. Possibly we could get in touch with the Reference Bureau here and find out whether the date of the Denver Stock show is fixed by statute. It is a tax supported show, Colorado supports the Denver Stock show. . MR. MILLER: I think you could find put whether or not they are going to continue keeping the show on the same dates in the future as .at the present. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: lam notsure, but I feel that if It was a statutory date in Colorado the Reference Bureau could tell us. MR. STEELE: If you folks would pass a resolution here authoriz - ing the legislative committee to go ahead and look into this matter, then, if we found it was fixed we could ask that our legislature set a new date .for our meeting here. I think that would handle the situation. </seg>
         <seg id="p146">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. CADWALLADER, Furnas County: I think this question can be answered, Mr. Miller. Several years ago, that is twelve-fifteen, we had a group of loyal Nebraskans at the Denver Livestock show, and at the request of the men in western Nebraska we went to them and asked if they would not initiate a move to have the Denver show set at a time when it would not conflict with Organized Agriculture in Nebraska. At that time there was no definite provision in the Colorado law which said when the show had to be held. They did move it ahead a week and it did not conflict with this meeting or the meetings of Organized Agri - culture in Nebraska, but they run into a very bad storm and blizzard and it was extremely cold and they had been warned previously that that was a poor week because they would run into that snow storm and blizzard, so they took definite steps again and changed it. lam positive you will find that the show is fixed to be held just at the time it is now. I am convinced, having shown there for a good many years myself, that Denver would not consider changing their week there regardless of any amount of persuasion, and I am convinced that they are going to hold that week regardless of whether this meeting conflicts with theirs or not. I am very positive that you will find that Denver will not change their show. MR. MILLER: Do you know whether or not that is fixed by law? MR. STEELE: I cannot say it is a statutory provision but lam quite positive, I wish I had my constitution and by-laws of the Denver Livestock show here with me. you will find that it is set by their con - stitution and by-laws, whether it is statutory or not, I cannot say. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Is there any other discussion, or any other questions? MR. CHARLES GRAFF, Cuming County: I know nothing about whether it is statutory or not but I would judge. Mr. Miller, that Nebras - ka will not get Denver to change their dates. That has become established, and with us in Nebraska, we used to bunch up all these tlnngs, with Organized Agriculture, and we Had so many meetings here that it just compelled the farmers to take a pace they weren't used to and they couldn't attend all the meetings there were so many meetings going on that they had to miss many of them. We have been trying to divide the meetings a little by making two meetings out of t and I think it is right and proper Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen of this convention, that we change our state law. We should not have any trouble to get this legislature to amend that law whereby we could meet, say a week later, or whatever time they set. There should not be any opposition, and we would get away from all that trouble with conflicting dates. I think it is right and proper that this convention take some action and have some one look after that in this legislature and change that law. </seg>
         <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. R. R. VANCE, Adams County: We have this condition down there with us. We have some good breeders who would like to attend these meetings, I might mention one of them that you all might know, Henry Fausch, secretary of our fair board ih Adams county. I saw him the other day and begged him to come down but he said "Vance, I can't do it, I am loading some stock for Denver, and just can't attend that meeting". I think that we are just perfectly safe going ahead and letting this committee get the legislature to change our dates. I think everybody is for It. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Is there anything further? A DELEGATE: Question. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: All in favor of this motion as stated say "I". It is so ordered. This gives the legislative committee that will be appointed for next year, the authority to present this to the legislature, that Is the recommendation of this body. Is there anything further in regard to the report of our legislative committee. Now, is the time in this convention when we are on this report of the legislative committee and the constitution, If there is any questions that you wish to ask in regard to anything that this legisla - tive committee has done I am sure that they will be more than pleased to inform you. I will say this for the committee, I know that they have put in a lot of time and a lot of hard work in the past year. MR. BERT MILLER, Washington County: I move you, in view of the excellent work that this committee has done, that we give them a vote of thanks for the efficient service. A DELEGATE: I second the motion. . PRESIDENT JOHNSON: A rising vote of thanks? MR. MILLER: 7 Yes, rising. WHEREUPON A RISING VOTE IS TAKEN, AND DECLARED .UNANIMOUS.. .'.;'¦. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: If there are no other questions or re - marks pertaining to the constitution or. work of the legislative com - mittee, we will pass on to the further business of the convention. We have two more questions herein our question box that I would like to take up at this time. One of the questions is right in line with one of the subjects that was assigned to. one of our speakers, Mr. J.. Hastings, of Polk County, who was unable to be here on account of sickness. "How can the State Fair and County Fairs Better Cooperate </seg>
         <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for the Good of the State", that was the subject, or something like that assigned to Mr. Hastings, and that is a question that is handed in.' How can the state fair and the county fair better cooperate for the good of the state fair. That Is a big subject, however I would like to spend a little while on it, and if somebody wishes to speak on it,—it isn't a touchy subject, so don't be afraid,—l am sure that the state board will be pleased to have your suggestions, because the state fair is nothing but a—just the county fairs put together, in other words, a home coming of all the county fairs. VICE-PRESIDENT, MR. MATZKE, Seward County: Mr. President, I am not Inclined to stir up anything, but we do have a situation that I see developing in our county, and I would like to make a statement on it. I remember six or eight years ago our boys out in Seward county came down to the state fair and pulled down a bunch of premiums at our state fair but were doing better at Denver and other places. I found out that is what is happening. They are culling out their stuff and showing the third class stuff at the state fair, the next a little better at Ak-Sar-Ben, and showing the good stuff at Kansas City or Denver. I would rather see Seward county sending down its real good stuff to Lincoln. It looks to me like there should be some county activity to correct that situation, maybe you don't have it at any other Place, maybe it is just Seward county, but every year good stuff is being held back to go to Kansas City and Denver, and it looks like we could do something with our board to get the stuff down here. This is in line with this question, and it is in line with our talk about the Denver show, and I would like to have some of you livestock men who know something about it, talk about it. MR. CHARLES LEMLEY, Butler County: I might offer just a suggestion that might answer Mr. Matzke's question. Anyway in re - gard to Four-H Club stuff. I believe it is our ruling connected with he rulings of the state fair that when a Four-H Club calf is shown at he Nebraska State Fair it can not be shown at any other major show, It must be sold. Can you expect a boy to spend all year raising a calf and then bring him down to the state fair and sacrifice him on the block when he can keep him at home and show at two or three shows. A lot of times their best calves are not In real top condition to show, but they are still good enough to go to any show, and they are going to hold back and get them just a little bit better for later shows. I think it Is just a ruling that works against our club boys and girls very radically. MR. JOHNSON: Charlie has had about as much Four-H leader - ship experience as anybody in Nebraska, and I would take Charlie's Zf' ?'? n\ hear what he sald. I wasn't ] istening very close, but is there anything further? </seg>
         <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. CADWALLADER, Furnas County: There is another answer to that question, or part answer to the question Mr. Matzke raised. First, let's get this matter understood relative to how manytimes a boy may show a calf.: I think there is no major show in America that will let a boy show a calf more than one time previous to any major show, I believe I am correct about that, but it is still true in some of the major shows that many have shown once before. The difference, as I see it, between the Ak-Sar-Ben or Denver and the Nebraska State Fair might be summed up in this way,—l believe the top money that a boy can get at Nebraska is about twelve dollars and fifty cents, is that right Mr. Reed? I think that is right. A boy may get a hundred and thirty-one dollars in Denver. I think that tells the whole story of why the top calves: Of any county go there. It isn't any dlffioult trick at all for a boy to come home from Denver with twenty-five-thlrty-forty-slxty dollars, and if he goes clear on through he could get a hundred and thirty-one dollars, some boy gets that every year out there. Just to come to Lincoln ifrom some part out in the western part of the state it takes twelve dollars and a half to bring the calf down here and then its feed bill while it is here, and the boy's expenses on top of that, and he's .got a long shot to go some place else, so he just has the same sporting blood in him as the rest of us, he takes the long shot and heads for a show where he thinks there is a chance for more money. I think that just about answers the situa - tion Mr.. Matzke brought up. MR. PERRY REED: I think there is another phase of this proposition that we haven't considered,—lt is a pretty hard proposition to feed anything to show over a period of a month and half or two months, that is, .they do not all come to a peak at the same time, and a lot of times they get part of the calves for the State Fair, they get another bunch for the Ak-Sar-Ben, and another bunch for the Denver show. I might say that these rules are written up by the county agents over the state and Mr. Frisbie. I think as far as the state board is concerned, they will do what is best for all concerned. Now, in regard to the premiums,—that appropriation is made, di - rectly by the legislature. We have tried each session of the legislature to get more money. At one time they gave us fifteen thousand, cut it down to ten and then cut It down to. seven thousand five hundred. We are asking more money but nearly all state fairs have a definite appropriation for Four-H Club work. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Thank, you, Mr. Reed. Is there any other discussion? Don't be afraid to get on your feet and talk on these subjects, don't think you are criticizing because there is nothing better than constructive criticism. MR. R.R. VANCE, Adams County: I think I can answer that </seg>
         <seg id="p150">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE question iv three or four words. Just simply everybody work to - gether and boost for the state fair, that is all you have to do. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Is there anybody else? If not I will take up the next subject. Our next question here is entirely different, "Can Group Buying of Attractions be Done to Advantage"? Now, I believe, in fact I know that there are fair men here that have tried it and their suggestions or opinion on the subject we would be glad to hear. MR. BAUMANN, Cuming County: I don't believe you could call it group buying, but we have had a split week up there and we have been having the attractions for a good many years split with a fair about thirty-five miles from us, and it worked out very satisfactorily. We had the show the first part of the week and they had if the last. This is the third year that we have been cooperating. We start our fair on Sunday, usually operate five days, that includes Thursday, then they go up to the other fair and work there Thursday, Friday, Satur - day and Sunday. Most of these attractions are bought on a week's basis, and we are able to cut the price we pay for these attractions when we split the show with somebody else for the remainder of the week. But the shows that we have are billed on a week's basis, and we get an extra day out of it, getting eight days the way we are operat - ing now. In this way we figure five-eighths of the price of the show, and naturally it is a whole lot better than eight days. We have been ' having a wonderful show up there and have been getting it very reasonably. I don't know if that answers the question or not. MR. R. R. VANCE, Adams County: Mr. Chairman, may I ask Mr. Baumann a question or two? Now, when you have a split week, do you go in with the other fair and buy the show together and pay the price, or does each one buy their program and then split it? MR. BAUMANN: No, we have the same program, we use it five days and they use it the other three days. There is no variation in our program, except what we get out of the revue. We have talked a good many times of having them two or three days and then taking the attractions the other three days, and exchanging, we think that would really be better, but it is a very difficult proposition to handle. In the first place you are dealing with two fair boards, and that is quite a problem. MR. VANCE: The only reason I am asking is that if you had each one of these fairs buying a program and then exchanging in the middle of the week. Now Adams county was figuring on doing that </seg>
         <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS with some fair if they happen to have the same dates'we did. The only question I know of that might happen is supposing we go together and each of us buy our program, I wouldn't want you to go buy a cheap program and let us buy an expensive one. I think they should buy about the same amount. MR. BAUMANN: The only way that I can see is that you would have.to buy both shows together at the same time. That is the only way you are going to have any satisfaction. MR. FRANK WATKINS, Antelope County: For a few years we bought our attractions something similar to what they are talking about. We dealt with Madison and O'Neill for three days, and they started at Madison, and came to our place, and so on to O'Neill, so we had different attractions each day. Really the attraction company didn't like to do that, but we had it for two or three years and it worked well, but lately we haven't been able to make that connec - tion, but that is a real good way if you can line up that way. • PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Is there anybody else that wishes to speak on this question? The only drawback I can see in showing the show every day, or at least the trouble I think I would have, everyone on my fair board would want to see every show, and they would be leaving their post and not tending to their business. If you have the same show all four days they see them a couple of times and stay at their post. Is there anybody else? That is all the questions I have from the question box and unless someone else has something to bring up at this, time we will proceed further. Before we proceed to the next order of business I would like again to thank the Regalia Company for giving us these buttons and badges. You know they have done it so long free of charge to the association of fair managers that we just expect that they are going to do it, and still I just wonder sometimes if the fellows realize it is free. It is really a contribution to us and we are appreciative of same. I also wish to state that I received word from a carnival company that has a few open dates. They are in room 304 or 308, and I can personally recommend them because they have played our fair at Wahoo several years. They have ten rides and ten shows, and it is just the right size carnival for the average county fair. I am not here to advertise any particular show, but we have always found them straight shooters and that'is the kind of gentlemen you have to deal with, or should deal with, in carnival work. Men that sign a contract and live up to it, or even better than that, men who's word is as good as their con - tract. I wish you gentlemen that haven't contracted your entertain - ment, if you intend to do so, would visit these attraction men. I know </seg>
         <seg id="p152">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE some of you realize what a great part they are of our 3how here at Lincoln, even now, we have the largest attendance of attraction people that we have had for—well, I just don't know how many years, in fact since I have been coming down here. I believe it is thirty-eight differ - ent companies that have filed their names and there might be some that have not, and that is unusual. I must remind you again, because it is very important, the man - ager of the hotel told me this morning that they must know at noon approximately how many are going to attend the banquet this evening, and we must put our order in at noon. So those of you who have not bought your tickets please buy them of Bert, Miller, Emerson Purcell, Ed Miille, Chet Marshall or Andy Welch. I wish these men would rise so that the ones that do not know them could see them and know where to get their tickets. Get them immediately after the adjourn - ment of this session. Of course, we want you to bring the ladies. In years past we have had as many ladies at our banquet as men, and I am sure you will enjoy the program, because one of the large booking companies, Barnes and Carruthers, are putting on the show and showing two troupes from Chicago and one from Kansas City. It is costing them some money to do it, but it is free to the state fair and county fair association. As chairman and president of this association I wish at this time to go on record that we do appreciate this from the booking company of Barnes and Carruthers. Jack Polk is rep - resenting that company here. Now, we have had the reports from our committees but at this time we will have the report of the grievance committee. Mr. Emerson Purcell, will you please give your report of the grievance committee. MR. PURCELL, Custer County: Mr. chairman and gentlemen, the grievance committee has not had a meeting. As far as I know there isn't any trouble or grievance filed. I see Mr. Welch over here, you have received nothing, have you? MR. WELCH: No. MR. PURCELL: And I think that is a very encouraging report, and I think one of the finest reports we could make is that we have no report to make, no business done in the grievance committee. I thank you. MR. MATZKE, Seward County: While the boys are registering,— I forget who it was, or from what county but one of them asked who the grievance committee was going to be before you were appointed, so evidently there was somebody that had a grievance, so whoever that gentleman is he might see this grievance committee. MR. PURCELL: Yes, if the gentleman is in the room I would </seg>
         <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS be very glad to receive any reports. We don't even know at this time who It is, however if you have any grievance we will still take it up. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We have come to the last part of our conventiotj, the election of officers, and before I call for nominations for the different offices of this association I do want to express my ap - preciation to the officers that T have worked with the last two years. It has not been any task at all to perform my duties with the help that I have had and the cooperation. I think these last two years will always be remembered by myself as the happiest years in fair work in my life.; When you have men to help you such as our vice-president, Mr. Matzke, and Mr. Marshall, as you know is a detail man and never leaves anything undone. I also want to thank the legislative com - mittee, they have been men that have been qualified, men with under - standing of their duties that they have had come before them. Mr. Matzke the vice-president was chairman of that committee as you know, and no more able attorney could be found that would be better than Mr. Matzke in this place, and Mr. Joe Steele a long time member of our legislature, from Kimball county. Most people in western Ne - braska know him, better than eastern: Nebraska. Joe Steele was a leader at all times in the legislature, if he stood alone we would fight for a cause, and that is the kind of men that we enjoy working with. Also I appreciate; the other member of the legislative committee, Mr. Russell from Geneva, always on time and always on the spot when we wanted him to come to Lincoln to meet with us. Is there j anything further to come before this convention before we go to the election of officers? It not, next in order is nominations for president for the ensuing year. What Is your pleasure? A DELEGATE: Mr: Chairman, I nominate Mr. Matzke. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Mr. Matzke has been nominated. Are there any others? MR.

         <seg id="p154">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. ANDY J. WELCH, Seward County: I move you that Mr. Joe Steele be made vice-president for the ensuing year. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Joe S. Steele has been nominated for vice-president. Are there any further nominations? MR. M. E. CADWALLADER, Furnas County: Mr. Johnson I feel that such a nomination would be ideal, if we could have a president from the east end of the state and a vice-president from the far west end of the state, and I move that nominations come to a close, and that the rules be suspended and the secretary directed to cast an unanimous ballot of this convention for Joe S. Steele for vice-president. A DELEGATE: I second the motion. (Motion put to vote and carried). PRESIDENT JOHNSON: It is so ordered. I should have called on these men for their speeches, but I am going to wait a minute. MR. MARSHALL: I hereby cast unanimous ballot of the dele - gates present for Joe S. Steele for vice-president. MR. STEEL: Mr. chairman, and friends, this is indeed an honor to me to be selected as your vice-president. Something that has never occurred before, I believe, to select a man from a group of this kind from that far out in the west end of the state, in fact you are almost on the Wyoming line when you select a man from Kimbail for any state organization, we are just twenty-two miles from the Wyoming line, and I farm one piece of ground that is just a mile and a half from the Wyoming line. So you see how close you are getting to the extreme end of the state when you select a man from our county. In this work, while I am new in the work, I will endeavor to the best of my ability to serve you as your vice-president, and I want the help of you delegates, because there are a lot of things that I won't know about this organization, but I will do my level best to serve you as your vice-president. Thank you very kindly for the honor. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Next in order is the nomination for our secretary-treasurer. What is your pleasure? MR. RAY SMILEY, Seward County: I would like to nominate Mr. Chet Marshall. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Mr. Chet G. Marshall of Arlington, has been nominated for secretary-treasurer.

PRESIDENT JOHNSON: You have heard the motion and second that the rules be suspended and the president be instructed to cast an unanimous vote of this convention for election of our secretary - treasurer, Chet E. Marshall, of Arlington. (Vote taken and carried). PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I hereby cast the unanimous vote of this convention for your re-election as secretary-treasurer. MR. MARSHALL: Gentlemen, I don't think it is necessary for me to, make a speech, I think you very much for the re-election. I have tried to carry on the work to the best of my ability, and really put in some pretty hard licks, rather a lot of licks, but I don't mind it, I like it. .1 really enjoy the work, and I will carry on the best I can. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Inasmuch as he has been elected our secretary I might say that only the executive committee realize how much time and effort he has put in his office for this organization. As I retire I might say that I believe his office has sent out more letters to county fair managers in Nebraska in the last two years that Mr. Marshall has been secretary than ever done before, and I don't mean to cast any reflections on any other secretary, but it is the success of our organization, it isn't the president, it is the secretary. And as you all know with the depression and with three years of general drought in the state of Nebraska yet we have been able to get interest in as many county fairs in Nebraska to come this far to a meeting, it shows what our secretary has done. And at this time I really feel gratified you elected a man from western Nebraska as vice-president. As he says right on the Wyoming line, however Nebraska in his state. It might cost our association a little more in having a man In western Nebraska for vice-president, but I am sure you will find it will be worth the extra expense, and as you have heard from our report our finances are in good standing, we have more at the end of this year than we had last year. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I would like to make a recommendation. I would like to recommend to this association, or to the executive com - mittee, who ever has the power, that they allow the president not a salary but a sum of—well, I would say fifty dollars, so that he can visit the different fairs in Nebraska. I had invitations this year and the year before to visit several fairs, but I did not get to all of them. Also I had invitations to attend the meetings, homecomings or banquets, and I enjoyed them very much, but you know if you take your car out and drive fifty-sixty, or seventy </seg>
         <seg id="p156">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE miles, and buy your dinner and lunch it is going to cost you five or six dollars besides your work. I don't think it is fair that the president or anyone else should take money out of his own pocket, but still he has to do that or has to disappoint some fair that gives him an invitation. I might say that I appreciated very much my trip to Chicago. It didn't end up just right,—l am glad that Mr. Reed and Mr. Vance haven't been telling tales on me,—but I got in the first day of the con - vention and that was the most important day, and got in one day of the International Livestock show, and which I enjoyed very much. I think we have left out just one thing in this convention, and that is that the delegate, when sent to a convention ought to give a report, but I did not start for fear I might disappoint you. Now, then will the newly elected chairman please come forward. Mr. Matzke, it is with great pleasure that I present this gavel to you. It is my individual gift to this association, and when you have served your time, give it to the next one. I thank you. MR. MATZKE: Mr. Johnson, on behalf of the members of Nebraska County Fair Managers Association, I want to say that we think it mighty fitting and mighty proper that as a last expression of your good will to our organization, as your last effort as president and as an officer you put us on our right course for the future, and may we consider it as a token, perhaps, of the work you have done for us. I think it is mighty fine that you have seen fit to present this organization with this gavel. This gavel, gentlemen, was made for Mr. Johnson, by a friend of his in his own town from walnut grown on his own place at Mead. It was made by a man who certainly is a clever craftman. It is presented to this association by Mr. Johnson with his name engraved thereon, with the date of his serving, and a place left for future presidents to have their names engraved on it. I think it is very fine and on behalf of the Fair Managers of Nebraska I want to thank Mr. Johnson for this token and I want to call upon you gentlemen to give him a rising vote of thanks. (Members unanimously rise and applaud). PRESIDENT JOHNSON: If there is nothing further, a motion to adjourn is in order. MR. BERT MILLER, Washington County: With reference to the recommendation that you made a minute ago in regard to the president having at his disposal the sum of fifty dollars to visit various county fairs. I think it is a mighty good one. He ought to take in as many fairs as possible throughout the state of Nebraska in order that he might know their conditions and better serve them as president. Now, </seg>
         <seg id="p157">j NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS '."'-'¦' i ¦ ¦ . i . •fifty dollars is an amount small enough, yet is would remunerate them in a measure as far as the actual expenses are concerned. Therefore I move you that this sum be set aside by the association and placed at the disposal of the president for this purpose. : A DELEGATE: I second the motion. MR. E. R. PURCELL, Custer County: I would be glad to second that motion, and in doing so I would state that the more fairs the president of this organization in the next year, the more fairs he visits the better it will be for the association, because I know he will bring some good information and good thoughts for our next meeting. PRESIDENT JOHNSON: All in favor of this motion that fifty dollars be set aside to our president to be used to visit various fairs in Nebraska, signify by saying "I". (Motion put to vote arid carried). . PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Motion carried and it is so ordered. MR. MATZKE: I think it is proper before adjournment owing to the fact that there is a session of our senate in session at thi3 time and that we have made recommendations that will have to be dealt with from the legislative standpoint, I think it is possibly well to appoint the hew legislative committee at this time. I have thought the matter over, and have taken into consideration the fact that we want someone that is close to Lincoln, and can get into Lincoln easily. Wo want others who are in a position of having contact with the legislature, and further, than that we want someone that will work like the two men that served with me on this committee. In doing so I have re-appointed Mr. Russell, of Geneva, and Joe Steele of Kimball, both of whom have worked hard and both have been very faithful, and will continue to serve in that capacity. Joe Steele is the new vice-president of our organization, will be in direct contact with the association, and as chairman I have appointed Andy Welch, of Seward, so the new com - mittee will be Andy Welch, chairman, Joe Steele of Kimball, and A. A. Russell of Geneva. I have had a wonderful training with Chet Marshall and R. C. Johnson and if I do not make a good president it's going to be my own fault not the fault of these men with whom I have worked here, and with such a secretary as we have, and I know Mr. Johnson will bear me out, there isn't a great deal for the president to do except what Chet tells him to do. So with that excellent help, lam going to do my very best to keep up the interest of this organization, and I hope a year from now we can have a large meeting as this.

         <seg id="p162">WHAT OCR ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN DOING IN 1930 PRESIDENT C. Y. THOMPSON, West Point Pasture Contest: The second annual Nebraska Pasture Contest was sponsored jointly by the Nebraska College of Agriculture, Agricultural Extension Ser - vice. Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, Nebraska Livestock Feeders and Breeders Association, and the Omaha Chamber Of Commerce. Early in the spring a special circular announcing the Pasture Con - test and including timely pasture questions and answers was printed. Fifteen thousand copies of this circular were distributed. A total of B*4 fanners located in 56 counties entered the contest. Of this number 715 were visited by an Extension Agronomist, usually together with the County Agent or a member of the County Pasture Committee. In this visit, the entire pasture set-up was inspected and suggestions on improved management offered. Forty-one pasture meet - ings were held in 31 c6unties, with a total attendance of 1045. In most respects, activities of the 11)36 Pasture Contest were prac - tically double those of the lirst contest held ill 1935. For example, in l'.»:i.-,, IDT farmers and County Agents attended the State Pasture banquet compared to UTS this year, in 1035, 420 farmers entered the Contest and -'51 completed. This year, MM entered and 5-13 finished. The Contest was officially closed with an afternoon "Clinic" and an ei'fiifns banquet held at Omaha on Thursday, November 12. Be - tween 4ii(i and 500 persons assembled at the Paxton Hotel for the afternoon session, where various angles of the pasture problem were "diagnosed l.y specialists, such as farmers and station workers. Four hundred sixty &#132;x were served at the banquet in the Chamber of Com - merce dining room that night. The President of the Crop Growers- Association responded to the address of welcome at the Omaha banquet. Four farmers were given special recognition at the banquet for hav - ing developed outstanding pasture plans and practices. They were: E. A. Knska, Fillmore county; Lawrence Quante, Nemaha county; Albert A. Arens, Cedar county, and B. M. Boals, Dakota county. Twenty other farmers received honorable mention for their efforts. College and 4-H Crops Judging Teams The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association donated $100.00 to the College Crops Judging Team and $50.00 to 4-H Crops Clubs to help de - fray expenses to attend the Crops Judging Contests at the Kansas City Royal and the International Hay and Grain Show at Chicago. </seg>
         <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION The Nebraska Crops Judging Team placed first in the Chicago contest and second at the Kansas City contest. At Chicago, the boys established the highest record ever made by any team during the 13 years that the contest has been held. They broke the record previously set up by another Nebraska team'in 1933. The boys all received a perfect score in the identification phase and were very consistent in that they placed as second, third, and fourth high individuals in the contest. A team with such a record is a credit not only to their in - structor, but to the institution which they represent. Most of our judging teams have given a good account ot themselves, and deserved the support which we have been so glad to give them. The 4-H Crops Judging Team (Fillmore county) placed seventh at the International at Chicago. Seed Supplies to 4-H Crops Clubs &gt; Seed supplies of improved varieties were distributed to 4-H clubs In 21 counties.

Two or three hundred farmers in my county got together and formed a bindweed organization. They are becoming bindweed conscious. They want something done about this pest </seg>
         <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION out at the National convention ot the American Farm Bureau Federation I.tried to get a resolution thru to manufacture chlorate. I wasn't able'to quite accomplish my purpose, but I did get the reso - lution before the directors of the American Farm Bureau Federation. 'The U. S. Department of Agriculture and various experiment stations -of the mlddlewest have found sodium chlorate to be one ot the most -effective means of eradication. I had a letter asking for that resolu - tion and for some supporting evidence. At Muscle Shoales they have set up a research department to manu - facture various chemicals, particularly fertilizers, and our idea was if they could do that they could manufacture chlorate. I believe that the farmers in our section here are probably more interested in chlorates than they are in fertilizers, at least at the present time. In Sweden they manufacture chlorate at 2 cents per pound. In Nebraska we are paying about 9 or 10 cents, sometimes as much as 11 cents. The price is held up by one of the tightest monopolies in this country, and we think that Muscle Shoales or one of our western plants here could pro - duce this as cheaply as in Sweden, and if we can do that, it would be •of great benefit to farmers in getting rid of bindweed. Some of you probably heard Senator Norris last night. I told the Senator what we were thinking about. I didn't think he would make it the principal part of his talk. He told us exactly how tar they had gone and I would like a resolution from the Crop Growers supporting work of this kind. The Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation has gone •on record, and I would like the Crop Growers Association to send the senator a resolution also. I don't know whether it is-necessary be - cause President O'Neill and the Governor were both there when Senator Norris made his talk, and they couldn't help but be impressed. I don't think we will have time to take action on this matter right now, but would like to have you do something during the session if you think the matter is of sufficient importance. (The suggested resolution was later formulated, adopted, and forwarded to Senator Norris.) CONSERVATION IDEAS By D. L. GROSS, Agricultural College In preparation for the assignment given me for today, I have at - tempted to analyze Nebraska's soil fertility and erosion problems with the thought in mind that if we might first. determine, as nearly as possible, what our real problems are and what Influences are bearing upon them, we might be In a better position to attack the problem as :a whole, and with greater effectiveness. </seg>
         <seg id="p166">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE First of all, it is important that we consider the extent to whicli - erosion has affected our agricultural land. It has been my good tor - tune to be present at a number of meetings held recently-in eastern and south-central Nebraska, at which pioneer farmers discussed the changes that have taken place on farms since the early days, with par - ticular reference to the soil. The ages of these men ranged from in - the sixties to 98 years, the eldest still hale and hearty, and in full - possession of all his faculties. Their first Nebraska experiences ranged from the early 1850's to the 90s. Collectively, they described the native landscape as one of tall, thickly matted, pungent scented prairie. Clear constant streams fed by numerous springs issued from seepy low - lands. Comparatively shallow wells provided an ample water supply. Fish were plentiful even in the upland water holes. Wild game was abundant. Gullies or other active erosion were entirely absent. Farms - were yet unfenced. Roads angled across the country without reference to section lines. Free pasture was available to all on the unbroken and often unclaimed prairie. Cattle rustling called forth the very effective and even more decisive law of the frontier. Few trees existed except along the major streams. Occasional sod or log houses dotted the land - scape, farm equipment consisted of a plow and harrow only, drawn by newly broken steers. A black spongy soil, highly absorbent of rain - fall and resistant to erosion was revealed by the breaking plow. They gave that description and compared it to what we see about us today. Canyon-like gullies eating through our land. Hillsides with the absorbent topsoil entirely removed. Dry stream beds, once easily fordable by team, now entrenched deeply and impassable. The bordering mires drained. Tall native grasses replaced by the shorter types, and by perennial and annual weeds. Thick muddy flood waters. The nearly complete disappearance of springs and seepy draws. Steep hillsides adapted only to grass, now giving up their lifeless sub-soil to cover and destroy the high productivity of the rich lowlands. A New Frontier When we listen to these comparisons we wonder what the next fifty years will bring. We wonder whether or not we have reached a criti - cal stage or a parting of the ways in our agriculture. Crop produc - tion in the past has been at the expense of the top soil that nature was thousands of years building. Will we find ways and means to main - tain yields without that top soil on our rolling agricultural land? We no longer have a west to turn to as did our fathers and grandfathers. We have brought about this great change in a short time, historically. Perhaps we will need to consider Secretary Wallace's term "New Frontiers." and accepting our problems as our pioneers accepted theirs, give our thought to conservation, as they did to conquest. </seg>
         <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION Technologic Difficulties i To say that the present or the past generations are blameworthy for -the condition of our land is not altogether a Just accusation. The /spirit of the past was one of conquest and exploitation. The future con - sequences of pioneer methods could not be clearly seen. The present generation, not as yet altogether cognizant of the role it Is to play in this "Drama of the Soil," is beset with technologic and, at least for the present, with economic influences that vastly complicate its position. In the early years of our country 19 persons living on a farm produced enough for but one person in the city. Today 19 persons living on a farm can produce enough for themselves and for 66 persons living in town. Between 1910 and 1930 the output per farm worker Increased 41% as compared to 39% for; the factory worker. In the five years between 1922 and 1926, agricultural production increased 27% while the crop acreage remained stationary and the amount of farm labor actually decreased. The development of new farm machinery and new power has revolutionized our agriculture in a brief period of time. It has meant the introduction of large machinery, and a great increase in the number of acres farmed by each individual worker. ! It means fewer hands, less attention to the finer details of conservation, and ,the complication of many conservation practices. Large machinery of the present type does not lend itself well to contour farming, strip cropping, non-tillage of field; draws, and the avoidance ot damage to erosion control structures. If we are to retain these labor saving tools and preserve the present productive efficiency of farm workers, we will need to devise new methods of erosion control, or re-design our pres - ent jf arm machinery. Progress along both of these avenues is under way. Whether the need for attention to the many small details-of a complete erosion control program can be avoided seems doubtful. Progress of Conservation Practices We now come to an immediate, though we hope, a passing prob - lem that is hindering the progress of conservation. This problem might best be approached by considering first one of the major conservation practices. Good crop rotations are the basis of any adequate conserv - ation program, at least for eastern and central Nebraska rolling up - lands. Experiments have demonstrated that under humid and sub - humid climatic conditions no conservation or erosion control program is successful in maintaining a productive soil unless it involves the more or less frequent use of legume Crops in the rotation or the copious use of barnyard or green manures. Comparatively recent experiments have shown that non-rotated corn fields on moderate slopes will have .approximately twice as much run-off of rainfall and seven to eight times as much soil loss thru water erosion, as rotated fields; and that •corn on non-rotated land will lose 40 % more rain water by run off and </seg>
         <seg id="p168">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE two and one-half times as much soil as corn on rotated land. Since rotations are so fundamental to a successful soil conservation program it is important that we analyze that particular phase of the program as we find it In Nebraska today. In the past Nebraska farmers have made great progress in this respect. Since before the world war and contin - uing up until a few years ago the acreage of legumes in Nebraska in - creased many hundred fold. Sweet clover Increased from almost none to over a million acres. For a time Nebraska led all other states in acreage of alfalfa, having at the peak about 1,300,000 acres. Red clover in the meantime, just about held its own. This progress made by Nebraska farmers was indeed encouraging to those charged with the responsibility of disseminating information and encouraging the use - of those practices which would build for a permanent and prosperous agriculture. Particularly was this true when it was considered that a great portion of our state is unsuited to the growing of a large acre - age of legumes because of inadequate rainfall. Most of the great Increase of legume acreage took place where it was most needed, on rolling eastern Nebraska land, that is subject to water erosion. The Effect of Drouth Considering now our present situation from the standpoint of legume acreage, we find a much less encouraging picture than the immediate past has afforded us. Notwithstanding the advent of the wheat and corn - hog programs, and later the Agricultural Conservation program all of wh.ch encouraged the seeding of additional acreages to conserving crops, we m.d that our legume and our grass acreage has decreased remendously in recent years. Drouth, of course, has been the chief factor in bringing about this reduction. Millions of dollars worth of seed have been lost thru failure to get stands; the biennial clovers have passed out of the picture on most farms; thousands of acres of form- Z'l S°7 khT 7* PaStU''eS haVe been ruined and are bei »S broken out. Established stands of alfalfa have weathered the drouth years remarkably well, but few replacement stands have been obtained. This condition cannot be cured in a year or two. Seed is now scarce and prices are high. Second-year sweet clover and red clover must come from stands established the previous year. Our usual luxunant stands of second-year sweet clover will be few and far be - tween in 1937. Practically no sweet clover stands were secured this year on upland fields. The scarcity of seed this year will likewise have ts effect on 1938 stands even though 1937 weather conditions are tavorabie. Economic Conditions and Land Tenure There are other factors besides drouth, however, which are not only adversely affecting our legume acreage, but which are tending to- </seg>
         <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION Tetard the acceptance and use of other conservation measures. I refer to the economic condition of the farmers generally and their relation to the land they farm. The last five or six years have been extremely devastating to the economic security of farm people. Bankrupt prices of 1932, and three years of crop failure in 1934-5-6, superimposed up - on an already burdensome farm mortgage indebtedness, combined to throw more farmers into a distressed condition than in any previous period of Nebraska's history. That this condition would have a very vital effect on the problem of soil conservation is obvious. Principal and interest on mortgage indebtedness are not paid by promises. Ready cash is essential. Immediate cash is not. obtained by planting 'additional legume or grass acreages. It comes through the sacrifice of livestock herds, and from the production of quickly cashable grain crops. Both of these actions leave an aftermath of soil depletion. Less barnyard manure is returned to the land, intertilled crops which in Nebraska means principally corn, increase the loss of soil through water erosion. Notwithstanding the sacrifices made by thousands of farmers in their attempt to retain an equity in their farm land and their other possessions, many hundreds of them, principally because of drouth, failed to make the grade. As a consequence, the farm ten - antry curve has moved sharply upward. Today, of the .more than 125, - -000 farms in Nebraska, over 60% of them are operated by tenants. In one Nebraska county 75% of. the farms are now being operated by tenants. Unfortunately the end does riot seem to be in sight. Though the rate at which foreclosures were at one time taking place has been reduced, farms are still passing into the hands of non-resident mortgage holders. The sale of farm land may now be on the upswing but few of the purchasers are in a position. to operate the land themselves. Good crops and fair prices will need to persist for a number of years before those now engaged in farming can purchase much land. Farm tenantry in Nebraska is quite generally a one year lease sys - tem. .This is not favorable to a conservation program. The tenant, with the assurance of farming a particular piece of land for but one year is inclined to mine the soil, unless guided otherwise by the land - lord. The landlord, In many instances an insurance company or the federal land bank, anxious to balance his books, is inclined to not look with disfavor on a proportionately large acreage of grain crops, since his income is largely in the form of a share of these crops. A Brighter Future Thus it is that during-the last few years, we have in one sense gone backwards so far as the acreage of our soil conserving crops is con - cerned. To say that we are in a hopeless situation, however, would be far from the truth. Notwithstanding our present condition, we have every reason to look toward the future with greater hope than ever. </seg>

         <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION ¦number of farmers adopting new conservation practices on their :farms has increased tremendously. Chief among these practices is that of contour listing either for corn or for moisture conservation. The interest in this practice and the demand for technical assistance in laying out contours has been so great that the combined force of the Soil Conservation Service and the Extension Service could not be - gin to satisfy it. The Extension Engineers have attempted to take 'care of the situation by the holding of training schools in the use of the farm level and in the construction of home made levels. As a re - sult, thousands ot contoured fields can be noted along the highways today, where a few years ago they were an oddity. Ten Points in Erosion Control Program Some of you no doubt are not familiar with all the features or practices of the Erosion Control program as it is being carried out at the present time. It may be of interest, therefore, to review briefly, a few of these practices. The Soil Conservation Service has drawn up a "Ten Point Program" that may be likened to the Ten Command - ments. Some of them read "Thou Shall" and some of them read "Thou Shan't." Briefly they are as follows: . 1. Crop rotations 6. Gully preventive and control 2. Strip cropping 7. Retirement of badly eroded land to grass and trees 3. Contour farming . 8. Prevent burning 4. Terracing 9. Pasture management 5. Maintenance of land cover 10. Farm ponds Heading this list Is, of course, crop rotations. This has already been considered and needs no further discussion; suffice to repeat that it is the foundation for any adequate conservation program where legume crops? can be grown economically. •s Strip Cropping—not a new practice in Western Nebraska, where different crops are planted in strips about 15 rods wide at right angles to the prevailing winds, for the control of wind erosion, but a new and as yet little |ised practice on rolling land in eastern Nebraska where the strips are laid out at right angles to the slope in order that run - off water.coming from the strips of inter-tilled crops such as corn, may have its speed reduced, its sediment dropped, and given more time to be absorbed by the soil as it reaches a strip of thickly sown crop such as small grain, grass, or legumes. Experiments have shown that this is an effective practice for reducing run-off and soil loss by erosion. It seems certain that eventually all land that is adapted at all to this practice will be contour farmed. ¦ It seems inconceivable at least, that we will continue to list or plant corn up and down slopes that are suited to contour operations. There is too much at stake </seg>

Successful contour operations involve new field arrange - ments, fence line changes, and the use of permanent grass strips of uneven dimensions to eliminate so far as practicable the short or point rows that otherwise occur on most contoured fields. The great in - crease in the use of the contour method of planting introduces a hazard that should be recognized by all who have not had experience with this type of operation. There are perhaps no fields on which It is prac - t.cable to plant row crops exactly on the contour. There are bound to be deviations from the contour line at several points in the field Linear depressions which extend down the slope offer the greatest problem. It is usually most practicable to carry the rows directly across these rather than to make V-turns and stay on the contour. When the rows do run directly across, however, the depressions be - come a place of water concentration. More water is led into them han would occur if the rows were run directly up and down the slope. In other words, the danger of gully formation would be increased. This problem is best solved by leaving such depressions undisturbed by machinery operations, thus allowing vegetation to gain a foot - hold and form a non-erosive water channel. The vegetation will en - courage silting, and eventually the depressions may be eliminated. Terracing-an old practice in the south, but new to many Ne - braska farmers has a distinct place on many fields. Where sloping </seg>

Fields which have even slopes may be greatly benefited by terraces. As a general policy, how - ever, terracing forms a very minor part of the erosion control pro - gram in Nebraska. A combination of strip and contour farming with attention to hillside depression is regarded as a more practical solu - tion. Maintainence of land cover through as much of the year as pos - sible is an important item in erosion control. A good vegetative cover is the most effective erosion control measure of all. It not only re - duces the velocity and erosive power of run-off water, but its roots and tops tend to hold the soil in place. It might be said that the ero - sion control program in Nebraska is chiefly one of contour operations and vegetative control. Gully prevention and control are, of course, major items in the program. Prevention, obviously, must be given first place and pri - mary consideration. Both in prevention and control, vegetation in the form of grass, trees, and shrubs is of first importance. Structures such as brush.and earth dams must often be used, but where possible, water diversions and revegetation are preferred and are more economical.

Deferred grazing, supplemental feed, and temporary pastures, is the solution to overgrazing. Nothing is better than a vigorous growth of grass to prevent run-off, No land will shed water more thoroughly however than an overgrazed and badly tramped pasture. Much has been said about the great value of farm ponds. They are even credited with the Important function of changing climate by cooling the atmosphere, increasing the humidity and thus affecting rainfall, none of which they will dp. A healthy corn or alfalfa field is much more efficient from this standpoint. Farm ponds do have a place on farms where well water is insufficient or where they may be used for irrigation. They are being used also to raise the water level in nearby wells. The difficulty with most of our farm ponds is that they soon lose their capacity as a result of silting. The average life is but from three to five years if the water shed above is under cultivation. Conclusions I have now discussed, I believe, the principal factors which have a bearing on our soil conservation problem. These seem to fall into four major groups. First of all is the consideration of the state of our soil so far as erosion and fertility is concerned, and the direction in which these are going. Second, the consideration of those influ - ences which are adding to our conservation difficulties, namely, our extensive type of agriculture with ita large machinery/greater power, and fewer workers on the land to give attention to the details of con - servation; the. increase; in tenancy; the one year lease system which is not coiidusive to soil conservation; and the present economic status 7 of our farmers which interferes with the adoption of a sound soil conserving program. - The third is a question mark and asks whether or not we have come to the parting of the ways, and whether or not the present generation lives at the end of one great historical period so far as our agriculture is concerned, and at the beginning of a new one —look - ing back on a period of conquest and exploitation—and looking ahead upon two paths,—one that leads to the destruction that has befallen many of the older civilizations because they gave no heed to the soil —and the other path that leads, through conservation, to a permanent agriculture. The fourth factor is a more encouraging one.

On a soil that is a little lower in fertility but just as well supplied with moisture, superphosphate may be expected to yield bigger returns. On a droutby soil, it may be expeicted to yield less return than at the Agronomy Farm. The results from superphosphate /have been seasonal. Some sea- t sons it has produced six to 10 bushels more wheat and eight to 12 bushels more oats. Other seasons it has had no effect, or perhaps has depressed the yield a bushel or two. It is therefore suggested that if superphosphate is to be tried at all, It should be tested for a period of at least three or four years in such away that comparative yields can be estimated in fertilized and unfertilized parts of the same field. It is also suggested that superphosphate need not be used on land that has been manured, for manure contains a sufficient amount of phosphorus to supply the needs of.the crops. • Potash and superphosphate fertilizers have been used In other localities in eastern Nebraska, with results that lead to about the same conclusions as the Agronomy Farm tests. Nitrogen fertilizers have given some fairly good increases in yield of small grains on land that has not produced legujnes nor been manured within recent years. On such land, the deficiency appears in the crop early enough In the spring so that quickly available nitrogen fertilizer, such as sodium nitrate, may be applied as a top-dressing. In the case of wheat, the resulting increase in yield has been five, ten, or in a few cases, as much as 15 bushels per jacre. The practice has not been recommended, however, because at present prices it is doubtful whether the fertilizer will be profitable. We believe it is more economical to grow legumes or apply manure than to buy nitrogenous fertilizers under present conditions. Comparison of Manure and Commercial Fertilizers The field plat tests with manure at Agronomy Farm have shown that it is more effective than the commercial fertilizers. It has in - creased the yields of crops about twice as much as the best fertilizer treatments. Where manure and commercial fertilizer have been used together, the resulting Increases in yield have been no greater than where the manure was used without any fertilizer. The manure sup - plies both nitrogen and phosphorus, and the effects of both can be seen in the crop. Like the commercial fertilizers, manure has been more effective on small grains and alfalfa than on corn. It has produced six to eight bushels more wheat, eight to 12 bushels more oats, and one-fourth ton more alfalfa, but the increase in yield of corn has been no more than three bushels.

         <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION and more. It should be remembered that a properly balanced soil fertility is necessary if the crop is to make the most of the available moisture supply. Any practice that holds forth a prospect of Increas - ing the efficiency of rainfall is worthy of consideration. Soil Fertility Affects Efficient Use of Available Moisture It was shown by Dr. T. A: Klesalbach In 1915 (Nebraska Research Bulletin 6) that soil fertility has a considerable effect upon the efficiency with which corn uses moisture. In a soil of low fertility, the plant used 1200 pounds of water in producing each pound of ear corn, while in a highly fertile soil it used only 560 pounds of water per pound of ear corn produced. The increases in yields of small grain resulting from the use of manure and fertilizers are at least partly due to a lower - ing of the water requirements of the crops. We cannot make full use of this principle and build soil fertility to a very high level for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the rainfall,' because of the danger of over-stimulation, especially In dry seasons. The best we can dp Is to aim to keep soil fertility at the highest level that is con - sistent with the average moisture supply. We cannot make the maxi - mum use of either,moisture or fertility unless the two are in balance with one another and working together.'; ¦ " Water Requirements of Com, Oats, Wheat and Alfalfa The amount of water used in producing a ton of crop varies widely in different crops. This figure, the ratio of water used to dry matter produced, is called the water requirement of the crop. The following table shows the water requirements, under average conditions, of a few crops. It also shows the amount of water used by satisfactory yields of these crops, in tons per acre and in inches. Crop Water Yield per acre Water used '-..: requirement Grain Total ' - Tons Inches Corn 317 30 bu. 2.5 T. 792 7.0 Oats 595 40 bu. . 1.4 T 833 7.4 Wheat ; 475 30 bu. 2.3 T 1092 9.6 Alfalfa (second seeding) 900 1.4 T 1260 11.1 Alfalfa (first seeding) 900 ' 4.2 T 3780 33.4 From this table it is evident that corn, oats, and wheat actually use only about one-fourth to one-third of the total precipitation. The rest is lost by run-off, by drainage thru.the subsoil to ground-water storage, by evaporation, or through weed growth. The question im - mediately arises, what can we do to reduce these losses? There is very little loss of water by drainage to the water-table, except in sandy land, and as a rule no attention need be given to it. As to weed growth, every good farmer realizes its importance and knows what to do about it. If the weeds and the crop are growing at </seg>
         <seg id="p180">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the same time, the weeds compete with the crop for both moisture and fertility, and should be destroyed. That leaves for our attention the losses by run-off and evaporation. Loss of Precipitation Through Run-off and Evaporation It is very difficult to estimate the extent of run-off under any specific set of conditions. The amount of run-off is Influenced by the amount and character of the precipitation, the topography, the texture and structure of the soil, the moistness of the soil, the tillage, and the nature of the plant cover. The following table, taken from a Missouri PWU.« Sh°WS U'e eXte'U °f rU"*°ff ""der S6Veral ma»la&amp;e™nt Treatment 7, CCf °f I&gt;KJcll&gt;,t" ation lost as run-off Bare soil, weeds scraped ,„ Spaded 4 inches deep Spaded S Inches deep , 0 Continuous corn „. Continuous wheat Rotation' of corn, wheat, clover &#132; Bluegrass sod From these figures it ta evident that land unprotected by vegetation is most subject to the loss of water by run-off, and land that is in corn year after year, under the usual tillage practices is practically no better off Where a rotation is used that includes, in this case, red clover and timothy, the soil is put into such a condition that it remains re - ceptive to moisture during the following year when corn occupies he land. A suitable rotation of crops will result in greater efficiency in the use ot rainfall as well as in higher fertility. Moisture Conservation and Cultural Practices There are tillage and cultural practices that tend to retard run-off such as terracing, contour listing, waffle- or basin-listing, and the like' that are very useful from a moisture conservation standpoint. The' figures presented in the following table are the results of a single experiment, and should not be considered as conclusive, but they illus - rate the possibilities in these methods. They indicate the number of inches of moisture stored in the soil from approximately six inches of rain between August 21 and October 17, 1936. </seg>

There were in some cases rather wide differ - ences. There was undoubtedly a larger volume of dry soil in the ridges than of wet soil in the furrows, and it should not be assumed that an average of the two conditions will give a true measure of the moisture content of the soil as a whole. It seems fair to conclude, however, that both the contour tillage and the basin listing have stored about one inch of extra moisture in the soil. '.....- It Is evident that under ordinary conditions this bare ground in late summer lost more than half of the rainfall a large portion of It by evaporation. How can we reduce these losses? Evaporation of mois - ture from the soil takes place near the surface. It is accelerated by heat and wind. If we can put the moisture deeper In the soil, keep the soil cooler, and break the force of the wind, the losses will be reduced. _. The ten-point program of the Soil Conservation Service (mentioned by Mr. Gross) will go a long way in this direction. All of these points aim to reduce run-off; this will put more moisture into the soil and will put it deeper, where it is safer from evaporation. Rotations will give part of the land the benefit of shade and wind protection every year. Strip cropping will put the crops where they will do the most good. Planning the cropping system in such a way as to maintain a vegetative cover on the largest possible area of crop land during the largest possible share of the time, will shade the soil, keep it cooler, and reduce the wind velocity at the! ground surface. All these practices will decrease run-off and evaporation losses, increase the efficiency of rainfall, and raise our crop yields. THE WEATHEB BUREAU By DR. J. B. KINCER, Chief, Division Climate and Crop Weather, Washington, D. C. May I address you as fellow farmers? I always feel at home in a gathering of farm people because I was born and reared on a farm —not a broad level farm like those out here, but rather a steep rocky </seg>
         <seg id="p182">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE farm down in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Now your chairman stated I am scheduled for two talks at this meeting. This first one will be a preliminary talk dealing with the work of the weather bureau, how we collect observations, how those observations are summarized and published for the benefit of the public; how they are manipulated to form the basis for our daily weather forecasts. Tomorrow we shall summarize just bow we manip - ulate these records; that is, the technique of determining climatic trends, whether or not, as has been suggested, for one thing, that the Great Plains are reverting into desert, and things of that kind. Even briefly to discuss the interests of the weather bureau would be impossible in one short talk because we come in touch with the lives of many more people than any other government service except the Post Office. People are always interested in the weather. Our changing weather from day to day and from year to year naturally suggests many questions. What are clouds and how are they formed? What makes it rain? Why are thunderstorms more frequent in summer than in Winter? Why are there more clouds and rainfall In the mountains than on level land? Why are raindrops sometimes large and sometimes small? Why do some clouds bring rain and others do not? Why does it hail in hot weather? Why is frost likely to occur on a bright moonlight night. Does the moon control the weather? Why the dust storms? Does the recent drouth mean the Great Plains are reverting to a desert? Can you do anything to produce rain? To answer all these and many other questions that might be asked would require a great deal more time than we have at our disposal, so we decided to consider briefly two phases of the weather bureau work. First, the matter of our climatological service which collects mil - lions of observation reports from all parts of the country, providing data for Btudy of climatic conditions in different sections. </seg>
         <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION Tomorrow we shall'discuss how the weather bureau makes its tore - casts. We shall discuss the matter of what the millions of records collected during the past century show with regard to. climatic trends, and whether they Indicate that our climate is permanently changing, and whether our Great Plains country is reverting to desert conditions. During recent years, especially the tragically drouthy ones of 1930, 1934, and 1936, the importance of weather and climate to the well-being of man, and their influence on our economic life as a na - tion, have more than ever been forcibly impressed upon the public mind In this country. Now, with respect to the climatological service. You know the weather bureau of this country is not old. Our longest records go back only 150 years, and most of our records go back about 75 years. Now as to how we collect these records and how our stations are maintained thruout the United States. Up until 1870 the weather records in this country were made in rather spasmodic fashion by several uncoordinated agencies, but in 1870 there was the beginning of the first systematic collection of weather records in this country. In 1865 the Honorable Isaac Newton, U. S. Commissioner of Agricul - ture, endorsed a recommendation of Professor Henry, at that time Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, that a more extensive weather service be established for the benefit of agriculture; and five years later the Congress of the United States accepted Newton's recommenda - tion by enacting a joint resolution requiring the taking of observations at all military posts in the United States. In 1890 we come to the birth of the weather bureau, as it now exists. In that year an act ot Congress established the present institution. Among other things they provided the basic act transferring the weather bureau to the De - partment of Agriculture and provided the Bureau should collect suf - ficient records in different parts of the United States to give an indi - cation, or to establish, the climatic characteristics of different parts of the country. It was a big job. Congress had no idea of the magnitude of the work, and had little money. They could not establish a sufficient num - ber of stations and.pay workers, so established an extensive system of cooperative observations. We have about 5,000 stations through - out the United States. The observers receive no compensation. They are public spirited citizens who are interested in the weather; it's a hobby with them to take observations. The Weather Bureau supplies the instruments, rain gages and thermometers, and they make monthly reports without pay. It .would surprise you to know how long some of these people have done this work. 'Naturally, you would think to assign yourself </seg>
         <seg id="p184">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the task of taking the weather observations every day and at the end of the month make a report would be quite a task. But we have some 300 people that have done it for 25 years. We have some that have done it for 50 years. We believe it one of the most remarkable services performed in the country when 5,000 men will give their time to take necessary observations and reports a certain number of minutes every day , n the year, year after year, for 20, 30, 40, and even more than 50 years, and never receive a cent for it. We believe that is unparalleled in any government service in the country. The Weather Bureau now has nearly 5,000 cooperative observers who serve without compensation, and this means that, if for each on the average, there is required, say, a minimum of 15 minutes a 'day to take and record the observations, answer numerous questions about local weather, and make the regular monthly reports, the total of time contributed to the government for the entire service would amount to 1 .000 full days, of work each year. We know of no other govern - ment cooperative^ service that even remotely compares with the cli - matological service of the Weather Bureau; that is, where considerable of the time of those cooperating is required every day in the year even including Sundays and holidays, for long periods ot time. 1 am going to discuss briefly how these observations are made Mr. Elwood Kirkwood of Mauzy, Indiana, is the dean of cooperative ob - servers. He is now 79 years old and has served the Weather Bureau for 56 seasons. Next in length of service is Miss Louisa B. Knapp of Plymouth, Mass., one of our women cooperators who has acted as observer for 50 years. It may interest you to know that we have 300 women observers in our cooperative family. A typical cooperative station consists of an instrument shelter and a rain gage. A shelter contains two thermometers, one known as a maximum thermometer, and the other as a minimum thermometer. The maximum thermometer is so constructed that it will give you the highest temperature reading that has occurred since the last reading It is always possible to tell how high the temperature has been since you last read the instrument. The minimum thermometer operates on the same principle except that it shows the lowest point since the last observation. We also have cooperative stations to study evaporation which is an important factor, particularly in the Great Plains area. An evapor - ation station consists of a rain gage, evaporation pan, thermometers, and wind instrument. -»«*»¦. AH of the cooperative stations in Nebraska are under the super - vision of Mr. T. A. Blair who is director for the state. He collects records from all of the weather stations of the state. These ari"sum! </seg>
         <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION marized and published monthly with, annual summaries. These sum - maries show the average temperature day by day and month by month, the absolute maximum for each month, and absolute minimum, the number of days when precipitation was received, and other interesting information. We have another classification of stations that is collecting climato - logical data on which we base our daily forecasts. The observations are much more complete than in the class of stations just described. These more important stations have a complete set of instruments and all stations are manned by professional meteorologists. The force ranges from one man in some of the smaller stations to 20 men at some of the larger stations like Chicago and New York. The observ - ations at these points are taken at 8 o'clock in the morning and at 8 o'clock in the evening and telegraphed by special arrangements to central stations. At these points weather maps are-constructed from work sheets and the forecaster decides what forecast he will make. In addition to the ordinary rain gage, some stations are equipped with a bucket rain gage which has an arrangement to measure the water as it falls so as to indicate not only the amount of rain but the intensity, that is, the rate at which it fell. An electric record is made of pre - cipitation and from this one can tell when the rain started, when it stopped, and just how fast it rained at various times. Long ago it was recognized by forecasters of Weather Bureaus that there was a great need for records of the upper air. We have varying weather in the upper air as we have it down on the ground. It was apparent that in order to make a satisfactory forecast one had to go into the upper, air. At first kites were used for this purpose. The instruments for recording were attached and the kite was sent up a mile or so by means of a piano wire operated by a windlass. Then came the pilot balloon. The pilot balloon was released and we could tell the direction of the wind as long as we could see the light. These balloons would go as high as 20 miles. Often the balloons traveled a long, distance and there was no way to know what the in - struments showed in the way of changes until the balloon and instru - ments were found and returned to the Weather Bureau. The airplane was then used for a study of the upper air. We now have 20 airplane stations in different parts of the United States. These planes go up about three miles every day and their observations form a general part of the Weather Bureau system. But the airplane was not exactly satisfactory as it doesn't go high enough. In some kinds of weather the airplane can not fly and this is usually the kind of weather that we want to know about in the upper air. The latest development is the radio meteorgraph. I have just come </seg>
         <seg id="p186">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE from Atlantic City where I saw two of these instruments released for trial purposes. It is the most wonderful instrument that I have ever seen. If you could have seen the demonstration you would have agreed. The radio meteograph has in it a radio set which transmits back to the earth the kind of weather that it is going thru every 15 seconds. This instrument was attached to a balloon which went up 14 miles. The report was very interesting because on the Board Walk at Atlantic City the temperature was mild, 40 to 45 degrees, but the records as they came back from the little radio showed temperatures dropping and dropping to zero, below zero, 30, 50, 60, and then didn't stop until they got to 90 degrees below zero. It was a wonderful demonstration and well worth seeing. We hope in a very short time to have these instruments in use, and I feel sure they will be a very great advantage to forecasters. There are two methods of recovering instruments, one is to have two balloons and when one bursts the other will act as a parachute. It is a matter of expense in trying to recover the Instruments. We have the records as they are reported back while the balloon is in flight. The instruments, consisting of a transmitting set, batteries, thermo - meter, barometer, and humidity element, all together weigh less than one pound. When all observations have been collected they are sent in to a dis - trict forecast center where the data is plotted on maps. Prom these maps we find areas where the barometer is low, others where it is high. Lines are drawn through the points which have the same pres - sure. Low pressure areas have warm moist air, high pressure areas have cold, dense air. These areas of high and low pressure move across the country at about the speed of a passenger train. They do not always follow the same route across the country. That is why a forecaster gets grey hair. His job is to study the map, the upper air conditions and decide what the map Is going to look like tomorrow, and then make his weather forecast. If he decides the low pressure is going to be in a certain location tomorrow, he then will forecast rain for that area. He will decide where the high pressure area is most likely to be on the following day and will forecast fair weather for that portion of the country. Just why does it rain in the low pressure area? There is always more or less moisture in the atmosphere. When the air is saturated it can not hold any more moisture and if more is added it will condense and form clouds. The amount of moisture that the air will hold de - pends upon the temperature. A body of air at 60 degrees can hold just half as much moisture per cubic foot as at 80 degrees temperature Suppose we have a saturated body of air at 60 degrees temperature and we raise the temperature to 80 degrees. Evidently it would hold twice as much moisture and the humidity would drop. Turn the sltua- </seg>
         <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Hon around. Suppose one cubic foot of air at 80 degrees temperature was saturated and then the temperature was reduced to 60 degrees. Half of the moisture would be squeezed out to form clouds and rain. There would be little droplets that would form thin'clouds. .These little droplets would collide and moisture condense on the tiny ones, which would grow larger and larger until they would be heavy enough to fall to the ground as rain. The only way to get moisture out of the air Is to cool it. Air blowing into a low pressure area tends to rise. As it rises it is cooled and, therefore, can not retain much moisture. The opposite is true of a high pressure area. You can not get rain out of air if It is getting warmer, even if it is saturated, We. might, say a word about tornadoes. The Weather Bureau has made a record of tornadoes in various parts of the country. During the last 20 years about 2800 people have lost their lives from tornadoes. They result in great property losses. lowa leads in number of tornadoes with Kansas second and Nebraska quite well down the list. The more eastern states have very few tornadoes. The Weather Bureau also makes a study of hail storms and their distribution and the amount of damage done. They also study the terrible tropical hurricanes and their; paths across the country. Flood warnings. and a study of flood conditions are also carried on by the Weather Bureau. An important activity in the fruit areas is the assistance which the Weather Bureau: gives in fighting Jack Frost. On the Pacific Coast and in Florida we have specialists who spend their time with the, fruit growers planning how to protect fruit from frost, to forecast frost, and help in protection work. THE PROGRESS OF HYBRID CORN IN THE CORN BELT By MERLE T. JENKINS Principal Agronomist in Charge of Corn Investigations, Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases, Bureau of Plant Industry Recent Expansion in Hybrid Corn The. hybrid seed corn industry is of very recent origin as is shown by the fact that the first commercial crossing field for the production of hybrid seed corn was that of George S. Carter at Clinton, Conn., in 1921, only 16 years ago. Crossed seed of the Burr-Leamlng double cross was produced in this field, about 10 bushels of the seed being sold in the spring of 1922 at $8 per bushel. Growth in the production of hybrid seed corn during the next 10 years was slow. In 1932 the total quantity sold probably did not exceed 5,000 bushels. Beginning </seg>
         <seg id="p188">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE with 1933, an extremely rapid expansion has been in progress in hybrid seed corn, in spite of two abnormally dry seasons. The estimated acre - ages in hybrid corn in lowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Winsonsin, and Minnesota for the four years just passed and probable acreages for the coming year are shown In table 1.

It is roughly estimated that about 3.5 per cent of this total area will be planted to hybrid corn in 1937. If the rate of expansion during the past few years may be used as a guide, it would not be sur - prising to find around 15 per cent of the national corn acreage planted to hybrid corn in 1940. Comparative Yields of Hybrids and Varieties The rapid expansion In hybrid corn Immediately raises the question, "is it warranted". What assurance do we have that this is not simply another case of the premature advertising of a practice that is likely to "fold up" after more extensive trials? Just how convincing is the available information on the subject? For many years the Division of Cereal Crops &amp; Diseases, Bureau of Plant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, has been cooperating with many of the State Agricultural Experiment Stations in breeding programs for the development of inbred lines of corn and hybrid combinations among them. Extensive yield comparisons of </seg>

         <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION yielding hybrid has exceeded that of the highest-yielding variety by 13.2 bushels, or 19.5 per cent. A survey conducted a year ago indicated that at that time 44 hybrids had been releasted from 12 Experiment Stations for commercial corn production. These constitute the better hybrids developed up to that time in the 12 state programs. They have been tested for periods ranging from 3 to 12 years.- One of these was distributed In North Dakota because of Its more suitable plant type. The others have given yields from 10 to 35 per cent larger than those of open-pollinated varieties, with % of the increases above 15 per cent. In addition to the excess yields of hybrid corn over open-pollinated varieties, they have been more resistant to lodging. In many cases, this is of equal importance with their increased productiveness, especially where the crop, is harvested with machinery. Many of the good hybrids also have shown better market quality in that they are more resistant to the ear-rot diseases. A number of them have given definite evidence of resistance to the damage resulting from attacks by insect pests. . All of the evidence indicates that the hybrids have justly earned their, growing popularity. The comparisons have extended over a sufficiently long period and over a wide enough area to give a reliable indication of what may be expected from adapted hybrids. It should be emphasized, however, that It is just as important to grow an adapted hybrid as it is to grow an adapted variety. ¦' Hybrid Corn Not A Substitute For Good Farming Practices The use of hybrid seed corn can not be expected to take the place of good farming practices. The poor farmer who has "mined" his soil to the place where it ceases to yield a profit need not look to hybrid corn as a method of milling it still farther. #lso, in sections where moisture is the factor limiting crop yields, hybrid corn can not be expected to -produce material increases in yield over present varieties. As is shown effectively by data from the Illinois Agricultural Ex - periment Station, hybrid corn fits in best on 1 productive soils and with good farming practices that increase the potential yielding capacity of the soil. The Illinois experiments show that.under the higher levels of fertility the ordinary open-pollinated varieties have a decided tend - ency to lodge and are very susceptible to ear rots. Adapted hybrid strains, however, are able to utilize this fertility to the maximum In the production of larger acre yields of sound corn. Figure 6, taken from the Illinois Farmers Institute Bulletin on "Progress in Hybrid Corn Production", shows these results In graphic form. </seg>

The educational programs in many states have not been able to keep pace with this expanding publicity. Partly as a result of the lack of Information and partly because the demand for hybrid seed corn has In most years exceeded the supply, a number of un - desirable practices have developed. </seg>
         <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION One such practice is the sale of second-generation seed. The maxi - mum yields of hybrid corn are obtained only in the first hybrid (F_) generation. The second and later generations yield less than the first generation and this reduction in yield depends upon the number and kind of inbred lines involved in the cross. The second generation of a single cross will yield on the average about 30 per cent less than the first generation and the second generation of a double cross will yield about 15 per cent less on the average than the first generation. The reduction differs somewhat in different crosses with the higher yielding combinations usually showing larger reductions In yield between the first and second generations. In spite of the lower productivity of second-generation seed there has been in the past, and probably still is, a considerable quantity of it being marketed as hybrid corn. The shortage of seed of foundation single crosses has resulted in another undesirable practice. Individuals anxious to get Into the production of hybrid seed corn, and not having seed of good foundation hybrids, have resorted to the making of untried Combinations among the second generations of single or double crosses, or between the second generation of a hybrid and a variety. In untested combinationa of this sort the consumer, as always, pays the bill. Efforts to protect the purchaser of hybrid seed corn against such undesirable practices have proceeded in some states along the following two lines: ,1. Tbe establishment, of statutes or regulations defining hybrid corn and forbidding the labeling of seed corn as hybrid corn unless it conforms,to specified requirements.' 2. The establishment of machinery for the certification of hybrid seed corn. This certification is based on past performance rec - ords and requires inspection for the supervision of detasseling '.:'.'¦; and of sealing the seed In properly labeled bags. Most of the definitions of hybrid corn are designed particularly to prevent the labeling of the F, and later generations of a cross as hybrid seed 'corii..The following is a typical example: "Hybrid seed corn shall be deemed to be seed of. the first generation of a cross between strains of different parentage and involving one or more inbred lines of corn or their combinations." Unfortunately, the undesirable practice mentioned above of cross - ing anything available makes this definition inadequate. It Is very likely that present definitions will need to be revised with the object of naming only those specific types of combinations that may be labeled as hybrid seed corn. Such definitions probably should limit the use of the term to top crosses, single crosses, three-way crosses, and double crosses. </seg>
         <seg id="p194">REI'OHT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The proper certification of hybrid corn is developing Into an enor - mous undertaking. If certification is to mean much, it ought to be based on established records of performance. This necessitates rather extensive yield comparisons under state supervision. Certification also necessitates a supervision of the detasseling and a checking of the identity of the parents in the crossing blocks. It needs to be followed with inspection of the harvested seed and supervision of the sealing of this seed in properly labeled bags. Unless the certification of hybrid seed corn is carefully done so that it gives the purchaser reasonable assurance as lo the value of the seed he Is buying, it is very likely to break down entirely. Too much emphasis ran not be placed on the purchasing of tested hybrids only. If farmers generally would insist on being shown definite records of past performance before buying seed of any hybrid, most of the undesirable practices that have grown up Would have Utile chance to survive. I'ollt'ics K&lt;' K aidinj. the Helea.se of Lines In the early stages of the hybrid corn program, experiment stations made no particular effort to maintain control of the inbred lines they developed. This puii-y has been gradually changed. At the present time tin- shortage of seed sto"ks. with the consequent necessity of utilizing' all supplies m th. host advantage, has required more careful supervision of tin- dl. tribniions. There, also is the necessity of avoiding the inclis- rlminutc dispersion of mediocre lines that might be used in hybrid combinations to the detriment of the ultimate purchaser of hybrid se.il ci.ru. State policies on the distribution of lines are divided at the present time. In Minnesota. Wisconsin, and Ohio, th" inbred lines are not re - leased, but ar- niniiitiiiii. d under the control of the experiment sta - tions. Seed vi the single-crossed foundation hybrids is produced under experiment station supervision and this seed is sold direct to commercial producers of hybrid so.-cl corn. In lowa, Illinois, and Indiana, a few specified inbred lines have been released by the respective experiment stations for the general use of commercial seed producers. Both policies have certain advantages and disadvantages. A more careful supervision of hybrid seed production is possible where the experiment station maintains control of the lines. To offset this advan - tage, the station of necessity must assume the responsibility of produc - ing and maintaining sufficient seed stocks to meet demands. This more or less puts the experiment station in the seed business. These respon - sibilities are avoided if the lines are released. Released lines also are available for use by private breeders in combination with lines developed by them. Less control is possible, however, over the quality of the seed produced under these conditions. </seg>
         <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION Future Trends in Hybrid Corn In attempting to predict the future of hybrid corn, consideration must be given to present seed stocks, the area in which hybrids may be expected to outyield open-pollinated varieties by a margin sufficient to return a profit to the seed producer and the grower, and the extent to which the present farm management practices in corn production may need to be modified in order to substitute hybrid corn for the present open-pollinated varieties. The most rapid expansion naturally should take place on the productive lands of the Corn Belt. It Is here that hybrid corn probably will yield its greatest returns. On the western fringe of the Corn Belt, where yields are uncertain and factors other than the inherent produc - tivity of present varieties govern the yields, hybrid seed may not justify Its extra expense. The same Is true for the less productive areas of the South. • The uncertain production of Inbred seed In some sections of the South, because of Insect damage, and along the western fringe of the Corn Belt, because of drought and other unfa/vorable conditions, also will very likely retard the expansion of corn hybrids in these areas. When hybrid corn comes to be widely used, the average farmer probably will purchase seed each year, rather than try to produce it for himself. Throughout the Corn Belt, where corn is one of the main sources of income, the extra expense and trouble Involved In the production of hybrid seed corn is meeting little resistance. In sections of the South, however, with their tenant system of farming, there is some little doubt as to how rapidly 't will be possible to substitute hybrids for open-pollinated varieties, even after good hybrids are developed. It is reasonable to expect that trends in the price of hybrid seed corn wiil be downward. During the past two or three years the bulk of such seed has sold for $8 to $12 per bushel. Hybrid corn has sold in the past in some seasons for from $6 to $7 per bushel. As the saturation point is reached, it seems reasonable to expect that prices may even drop to around ? 3 to ? 5 per bushel. It probably is too early in the program to predict the methods of commercial production. Present trends in the areas where hybrid seed corn has been 1 available longest seem to be toward the development of large companies with sufficient capital to operate over a rather wide ter - ritory and so distribute production risks. ; Several of these larger companies have financed private breeding programs. Present tendency is definitely toward increasing the support given to'these breeding programs. The lines and hybrids produced by these companies remain more strictly under their control and thus should permit them to realize greater returns on their investment from breeding operations than is the case with other cereal crops. </seg>
         <seg id="p196">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The hybrids developed by the State Agricultural Experiment Sta - tions on the whole are being produced commercially by individual farm - ers and by smaller seed companies with no independent breeding pro - gram. There is no doubt that experiment station hybrids, even though they have represented a minor fraction of the hybrid seed corn offered for sale up to the present time, have had an extremely beneficial effect in setting standards of performance which privately developed hybrids must meet. Most of the larger seed companies have maintained their own stocks of the parent inbred lines and produced sufficient seed of the foundation single crosses to meet their own requirements. During the past few years the large companies that could scatter these operations over a wide territory and so distribute their risks and insure a supply of seed for their own use. have had a decided advantage. Most of the smaller commercial producers seem inclined to spe - cialize in the production of the final double-crossed seed, buying the seed of their foundation single crosses each year. The hazards in the production of single-crossed seed are greater than for double crosses and fewer individuals have undertaken this phase of the program. This, together with the drought, has so limited the stocks of foundation hybrids that in some sections the smaller producers of double-crossed corn seem to be having difficulty to remain in business. This situation is clearly illustrated in lowa in the estimates by J. L. Robinson of the lowa hybrid corn acreajie planted to hybrids developed by the lowa Agricultural Experiment Station in recent years. The Station hybrids are grown almost entirely by the smaller seed companies and farmer - producers. S-'ed of the parent single crosses has been produced largely within the state, and consequently has suffered from the severe droughts In lit.'it and Hl.'lii. According to Robinson's estimates, the certified Station hybrids have comprised the following percentages of the acreage of hybrid corn in Iowa: Percentage of hybrid acreage eal * planted to certified Station hybrids 1933... "" ".~*jj ' 193&lt; 6 1935 22 1936 "I 19;!" 14 The severe drought of 1934 so reduced parent stocks for crossing fields in 1935 that certified station hybrids dropped from 22 per cent of the hybrid acreage in 193,. to 9 per cent in 1936. Stocks were in - creased moderately in 1935 for 1936 crossing fields and sufficient hybrid seed was produced to plant about 14 percent of the acreage ill </seg>
         <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION 1937. The 1936 drought seriously curtailed the production of parent single crosses for the 1937 production of double crosses and accordingly it will not be surprising to find the relative acreage of Station hybrids again reduced in 1938. It is hard to say just what the ultimate place ot the experiment stations will be In the seed production program. At the present stage it is essential that they produce enough seed of the hybrids they have developed to insure that they get into general production. The rapidity with which these hybrids are taken over by private enterprise will largely determine the future activities of the experiment stations. One of their necessary functions for some time to come will be the main - tenance of pure stocks of parent inbred lines. They also must con - tinue to lead the way in investigations of the more theoretical aspects of the breeding problems and in the development, testing and improve - ment of inbred lines. In closing, I may say that the hybrids we now have are only our first efforts in the use of the hewer methods of corn breeding. The hybrids of the future unquestionably will be much better than any available at the present time. PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF HYBRID SEED CORN PRODUCTION By T. A. KIESSELBACH Hybrid corn is just getting off to a good start in Nebraska. The growth in acreage has been a little slow compared with that in more eastern corn beit states. This has resulted from a retarded increase in suitable local seed supplies because of three successive unfavorable seasons rather than from any lack of confidence in the superiority of our Nebraska.hybrids^. In spite of the drouth, about 2500 bushels of certified commercial hybrid seed were produced in Nebraska in 1936. This will undoubtedly be planted by.many different farmers in all parts of eastern Nebraska, and will afford splendid opportunity to ob - serve the advantages of this kind of corn. Fortunately, seed stocks are at hand for planting 2,000 acres for the production of hybrid seed in 1937. Whereas there were 20 growers of hybrid seed in 1935 and 40 in 1936, it is expected that there will be 150 in 1937. Their acreages will vary from one to about 400 acres per grower. Many of the new men with small seed acreages will wish to expand in 1938 and from then on the hybrid seed producing acreage should be able to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand for such seed. . </seg>
         <seg id="p198">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A hundred and fifty growers of hybrid seed may not sound like very many for an entire state. But under favorable crop growing conditions they should produce 30,000 bushels of hybrid seed this year which Is enough to plant a quarter million acres in 1938. That amounts to about 8 per cent of the corn acreage planted in the eastern fourth of the state and the irrigated sections of central Nebraska where these hybrids are recommended. By 1939 one may expect suf - ficient hybrid seed to plant 25 per cent of the corn in this region and by 1940, 50 per cent. It is entirely reasonable to anticipate that such acreages will materialize. As a precedent, the states of lowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin have each estimated that 13 per cent of their entire acreages will be planted to hybrid corn this year, namely in 1937. The Economics of Hybrid Corn While it now appears that the extensive growing of hybrid corn is inevitable, only time will tell to what extent individual farmers will wish to produce their own hybrid seed. Those persons interested in hybrid corn fall into three classes: (1) Producers of hybrid seed for home use. (2) commercial hybrid seed growers who produce a sur - plus for the seed market, and (3) corn growers who do not produce their own hybrid seed but purchase their needed supply. This latter class is not to be regarded as hybrid seed growers but rather as hybrid seed consumers. Many of these farmers have neither the interest nor the facilities for the specialized work of producing hybrid seed. Never - theless they appreciate its advantages over the ordinary open pollinated varieties and will purchase the seed because of the increased profit which it brings through higher yields. When we stop to consider that the good recommended hybrids yield an average of 15 to 20 per cent more than the standard varieties, the added gains through their use are easily figured as in the following example. Where the standard varieties yield 42 bushels per acre, a 15 per cent gain from the use of hybrid seed would raise the yield to about 45.3 bushels. This is a gain of 6.3 bushels per acre. Since a bushel of seed will normally plant eight acres, an increased pro - duction of 50 bushels would result from each bushel of hybrid seed substituted for ordinary seed under such conditions. From these figures the use of suitable hybrid seed appears very profitable whether home grown or purchased. There is another decided advantage in most good hybrids; they are stronger stalked and more firmly anchored in the soil which causes the plants to stand up much better in the field at husking time. There is less down corn. Since the field practices connected with the planting and growing of hybrid corn for the general commercial crop are the same as for </seg>
         <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA CROP-GROWERS'ASSOCIATION ordinary varieties, there is little added expense to the use of the hy - brid other than the greater seed cost and the added labor of husking a larger yield. As the seed supply increases, it is reasonable to expect that the price will be materially lower and well within the reach of all eastern Nebraska growers who do not produce their own hybrid seed. What Is Hybrid Corn? Hybrid seed corn as recommended in Nebraska originates from the crossing of four inbred or self-fertilized lines. It is not possible to combine all four lines in any one season, and two years are required when starting with the inbreds. The first year two single-cross hy - brids are miade by crossing inbred "a" by "b" and inbred "c" by "d". The second year, these two single-cross hybrids are crossed to make the commercial double-cross seed. It is this double-cross seed that is in such growing demand for planting the general corn crop. While it is the chief purpose of this paper to discuss the procedure on the farm by the practical hybrid seed corn grower, It may be well first to consider the question of where do the inbred seed stocks come from that are needed and how does the grower know which ones to use in his hybrid seed business. Origin of Seed Stocks.—Producing the needed inbred lines is the work of a specialist who has had special training for this work. In this state the job has been left almost altogether to the Agricultural Experiment Station. What is more, the inbred lines developed in other corn belt states are drawn upon extensively for testing and utili - zation. In a few states, private breeders have also undertaken produc - tion of inbred lines which they afterwards control. Most of these pri - vately produced inbred lines are not available for use by the general public, whereas the Experiment Station lines are available as soon as they are recommended and released for making commercial hybrids. Inbred lines do not occur in nature without the artificial manipu - lation by the corn breeder. By successive controlled inbreedings for five or more generations, using the "bagging method" which has been described In other years, inbred lines are produced In which all the progeny come to have almost Identical inheritance and all the plants look alike. As a result of this inbreeding the plants lose their normal hybrid vigor and the best "ones yield only about one-third of a crop under favorable conditions. During the early years of inbreeding, the progeny is rather variable, some plants being more productive and less defective than others. These better plants are selected each year for inbreeding to continue the line. For this reason the procedure has come to be known as "selection within self-fertilized lines." </seg>
         <seg id="p200">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE After this purification-by-inbreeding has progressed for four or five years, the more attractive lines are used in making experimental single and double crosses. These are grown in field-plat compari - sons to observe the yields and other agronomic characters. Double crosses which give outstandingly superior results on the Experiment Station farm are included in a collection of standard hybrids and varieties and tested thoroughly on farms in various parts of the state in co-operation with the Agricultural Extension Service and farmers. From these tests it is decided whether the seed stocks should be re - leased for the production of certified commercial hybrid seed. What inbred lines combine well to make superior hybrids can only be determined by testing the hybrids after they have been arbitrarily made. It is largely a "cut and try" method. The corn breeder natur - ally stresses the use of those lines which he regards as possessing the best all-round characteristics and which may be most easily main - tained as such. But often the crossing of two very excellent lines or two choice single crosses may result in rather mediocre hybrids. In technical terms, it has come to be accepted as a correct prin - ciple that the most productive and desirable hybrids result from the crossing of two lines or two single crosses whose favorable dominant growth factors are so distributed on the chromosomes of their repro - ductive cells that they supplement each other to best advantage, result - ing in a maximum number of factor pairs carrying dominance. This is commonly spoken of as "nicking." It is determined by testing of the progeny. Because of the small number of lines involved, hybrid corn is more uniform in appearance as well as in productivity than are open - pollinated varieties. There is more of a tendency for every plant to "contribute its full share" to the yield. However all hybrids are not equally good and it is wise to choose what hybrid will be grown on the basis of accredited past performance records. The Crossing Field to Make Commercial Double-Cross Hybrid Seed Source of Seed Stocks.—The hybrid seed corn grower who would produce certified commercial double-cross seed in Nebraska must have certified seed of the two specific single crosses: required for the par - ticular hybrid in question. These single crosses may have been home - grown or may be purchased from an accredited source. Generation of Single-Cross Seed Stocks.—While theoretically first and second or later generation seed transmit the same inheritance when used as parents of hybrids, there are certain reasons why first-generation seed is preferred for the natural crossing field. It yields on the </seg>
         <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION average about 50 per cent more and there may be less opportunity for contamination by accidental crossing with other corn. Such contam - ination is not so apt to occur if the generation of the seed is advanced by planting alone in an isolated field. In fact with some important single crosses it is difficult to produce first generation seed because of low productivity of the inbred parents, and the use of second gener - ation or even third generation seed produced in this way may be recommended. But contamination is more likely to be found in second gener - ation seed saved from the corresponding male parent of the previous yearns natural crossing field. The danger lies especially In failure to do a perfect job of detasseling in the field from which such seed is saved from the male rows. . Extreme caution to thoroughly detassel the female parent is urged if seed from the male rows is to be saved as seed stock. The use of second generation seed is recommended primarily when an emergency exists and there is a shortage of first generation seed. It can be used in Nebraska for the production of certified commercial seed only when specially authorized by the State Certification Board. For the reasons indicated, extensive growers of commercial hybrids especially are urged to undertake the production of sufficient F x (first generation) seed stock to plant their own crossing fields the follow - ing year. It is also considered a wise practice and highly desirable to produce enough surplus seed stock to supply the needs tor a second year in case of crop failure. This will tend to serve as seed Insurance and is certain to help avoid embarrassing shortage in some years. It would facilitate the consistent production of commercial hybrid seed year after year. Production of F x single-cross seed for sale to other seed growers may also prove profitable and be ot service. In this state seed of the needed inbred lines for making certified seed of foundation single crosses can at present be obtained only from the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station or from one of the other State stations. After such inbred seed has once been secured, the original purchaser only may continue to use his home-grown seed thereof and then only if he has had his field properly inspected and the crop officially certified. by the official state inspector. These limita - tions are established as precautions to preserve the identity of seed stocks. ¦';-.¦ Locating the Crossing Field.—ln-order-to avoid contamination with foreign wind-borne pollen, the seed field must be at least 25 rods re - moved from other corn in order to meet certification requirements. An exception is niade to this rule; only 20 rods are required if 10 rows of the male parent are planted op the side nearest the other corn. For </seg>
         <seg id="p202">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the proper location of fields used in producing foundation single-cross seed, whether F, or F„ 40 rods isolation is required. The same dis - tance applies to inbred lines. Planting the Crossing Fields.—ln order to insure the prescribed crossing, certain details of procedure have become fairly well estab - lished. The two parents are planted alternatingly across the field. In this state where drouth may cause a scarcity of viable pollen, It is customary to plant two adjacent male rows In alternation with tour female rows. This can very conveniently be done with a two-row lister by carrying two extra seed boxes on the lister. Two of the seed boxes are filled with male seed and two with female. When planting begins on the field margin, two rows of male are planted, then four female rows, followed by two male, four female, and so on across the field. Great care is needed to avoid error in the number of rows planted to either parent. If such an error remains unnoticed, this may result in detasseling errors and seed mixtures. The rate-of-planting or spacing in the crossing-field Is normally the same as for an ordinary corn field. If the male parent has a ten - dency to sucker considerably, it may be planted a little thinner, as this will increase the yield of the female rows through lessened compe - tition and yet sufficient pollen will be assured. FoFcommercial seed production, the stand should not be'so thick as to cause the kernel size to be stunted because most customers favor large seed. It is urged that the proper plates and calibration of the planter or lister be determined for each seed stock ahead of planting. Time of Planting.—Crossing fields should be planted at the usual time for planting this crop. When one parent is latter tasseling than the other, it should be planted enough earlier to cause both to tassel at the same time. With several of the Nebraska hybrids there should be as much as a week difference in time of planting in order to as - sure an abundance of pollen when the silks emerge. The approximate difference in time to plant in the case of the five Nebraska certified commercial hybrids is shown in the following table. Incidentally, this table also gives the pedigree of these hybrids.

Under normal conditions,- corn begins shedding pollen about one day before silk - ing begins. Drought tends to delay silking as compared with shedding of pollen. Care of the Seed Field.—The crossing field requires only the us - ual cultivation given ordinary corn. If the field is to be irrigated the water should be applied timely and in sufficient quantity to keep the crop growing thriftily. Shortage of moisture delays ripening and •',. stunts the seed size as well as lowers the yield. In case of a single-crossing field planted to inbred parents, it may prove advisable to give one or two additional late cultivations with a one-horse cultivator. The reason for this suggestion is that some in - &gt; breds are so small that they do not shade the ground sufficiently to con - j trol the weed growth. Roguing.—Since no seed stocks are likely to be absolutely pure it is necessary to examine the seed fields carefully for oft-type plants. </seg>

         <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION It has been observed that the seed buyer is very particular as to the quality and appearance of the seed. He wants It clean, sound, and uniform; In other words well graded. The successful grower strives to produce quality seed in every, respect. Because ot the high value of hybrid seed, it is customary to make several grades and discard relatively little. In the first place all sound ears are suitable for seed. It has been learned that butt and tip seed, if sound, yield equally with the middle seed. Two to three grades are therefore common/known as..(l) large flat, (2) large round, and (3) small. Each bag is labeled with the grade of seed it contains. The preparation of one or two intermediate grades would increase the uniformity of the seed and should be seriously considered. When it comes to planting seed ot the various grades, it is found that any uniform grade can be planted with a high degree of accuracy if proper planter plates are selected. • To illustrate the acreage that may be obtained from a bushel of the different grades: Samples prepared by various hybrid seed growers for this spring planting would average about seven acres for the large round, eight acres for the large flat, and 11 acres for the small seed when the kernels are spaced 14 inches in 42-inch rows. The round and small seed grades normally command a somewhat lower price per bushel. In years ot severe drouth a high percentage of the round kernels represent poorly filled ears and do not all come from the butts. Essen - tially identical inheritance and productivity are represented by the various grades regardless of size or shape, provided they are equally sound. Final Inspection for Certification—ln addition to several inspec - tions in the field for isolation, thoroughness of roguing and detasseling, the corn must also bear inspection In the crib and as shelled and graded seed. The precise rules governing these inspections are available from the Secretary of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. labeling and Marketing.—A neat package always attracts the eye and is suggestive of careful work throughout all the production opera - tions. The good looking bag of certified hybrid corn bearing a tidy certification tag and officially sealed makes a strong bid for purchase. If the seed has been grown for market, it behooves the grower to understand the underlying principles of merit behind the hybrid seed he has produced. He should make an honest presentation of its advant - ages. Hybrid corn or at least its producer is easily discredited by unwise exaggerations of its virtues.

They have reasoned that the difficulty with second generation seed must be that it either does no. germinate or does not produce grain. Their explanation of this reason n_ is that hybrid corn is also sometimes called "mule co n," aTd bey know that the mule does not reproduce. Therefore it Is assumed hat mule corn also does not reproduce. The fact is that the reasoning is in error. Such second generation hybrid germinates as well and he reproductive cells normal.y function as well as with the genuine firs. fsThlt T77" Beeb t The Pr°bable reaS°D f°r the -«e-'muL corn - is that it is a cross between two unrelated parents.

         <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION Hybrid Seed Corn Legislation Needed A state seed law should be enacted which prohibits the sale of second, generation seed and crosses between open-pollinated varieties as Hybrid' Seed corn. The Nebraska Crop Growers' Association has contemplated, such action for some time and doubtless will make the necessary recom - mendations. Several cases have come to our attention where such, seed was offered and advertised as Hybrid Seed. The Adaptation of Hybrid Corn With the advent of hybrid cornand its rapid replacement of open - pollinated varieties in much of the corn belt, it becomes important to discriminate between these two kinds of corn in respect to the influ - ence of seed source upon their adaption. The adaption of hybrid corn originating from the crossing of inbred lines is entirely dependent upon the component lines and not upon the locality where the seed is pro - duced, as is the case with open-pollinated varieties. All hybrids'are not equally good and they also differ widely as to vegetative size and number of days required to mature. After the local adaption and superiority of any specific hybrid has been established through trial, it is possible to procure this same hybrid with identical characteristics year after year'lrrespective of where the seed is pro - duced, provided the same parental stocks and proper crossing have been used. This constancy of character is due to the essential purity of the inbred parents, which do not undergo radical adaptive changes as do varieties. Thus, if the climatic and soil conditions are favorable for the production of sound seed, it is immaterial whether the seed of any specific hybrid is produced in the north or southland whether on dry or irrigated land. Any statements to the contrary on the part of the grower or salesman or consumer can but mean a misunderstanding of the character of hybrid corn. The identity of Hybrid corn may be assured through the use of seed produced under conditions of official state inspection and certification., PLANS AND SEED SUPPLIES FOR HYBRID CORN PRODUCTION IN NEBRASKA IN 1037 P. H. STEWART, Extension Agronomist The adverse 1936 season was naturally a severe blow to our plans, for expanding the hybrid corn program in the state. We thought we had our outstate plantings distributed so we would be sure to produce an ample supply of foundation seed of inbreds and single crosses as. well as a large amount of double cross commercial hybrid seed. W( did not figure,'however, that the weather man would give us the worst year, in the history of Eastern Nebraska for the production ot corn.. </seg>
         <seg id="p208">KKI'OKT Ol- NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACRICULTURE We expected that growers would produce more than 20,000 bushels of hybrid seed but only a little over 2000 bushels ot certified seed were actually harvested and graded into marketable seed for sale. The past season was a severe test for all corn and afforded varieties and hybrids a chance to demonstrate their ability to stand drouth and heat. Numerous reports reached the Agricultural College that hybrids were more able "to take it" than were varieties. Altho In some cases they were finally ruined hy the drouth, hybrids were the last to go. In the spring of 1936 we planted the usual number of out-state co - operative tests with farmers. However, only one of these was worth harvesting for yield comparisons. This was on the farm of Arch Hosterman of Brownville. Yields, so far as the individual lots were concerned, were rather erratic and probably not a great deal of reliance should be placed on them. The figures on hybrids as compared to varieties are interesting and valuable and demonstrate the higher yielding ability of the hybrids. The 26 hybrids in the test yielded 21 bushels per acre compared to 12 bushels for the 10 varieties a difference of S2 per cent in favor of hybrids. Of the 36 lots in the test, the top 14 were all hybrids, with Nebraska 238 hybrid at the top of the list. The lowest yielding lots in the test were all varieties. We have good reason to believe that the five hybrids, eligible for certification in Nebraska, are all good ones and on the average should be expected to yield 15 per cent or more higher than the average of open pollinated varieties. More seed of these should be available for eastern Ne - braska farmers. In order for hybrids to be eligible for certification In Nebraska they must, over a two-year period, have yielded 15 per cent more than standard varieties, and have desirable characteristics such as 1" stiff stalks, good shanks, well covered ears, and good ear and grain qualities. Rules and regulations for the certification of hybrids in 1937 have been prepared by the state certification committee and are ready for distribution to those wishing to know just what the requirements are. I have the feeling that hybrid corn needs the aid of a good system of certification. Without this protection it is subject to the dishonest competition of misrepresented varieties, variety-crosses, and advanced generation double-cross seed. There are also good and poor hybrids being offered. Not all hybrids are good for certain conditions even though they are genuine hybrids. Certification assures the buyer that not only is the seed produced from properly isolated and detasseled single-crosses, but that it has also been tried out and proved its yielding ability. There is still some uncertainty as to just how much detailed inspec - tion work will be carried out in hybrid corn certification in the corn </seg>
         <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION belt states. There Is some demand that the inspection and certification work be cheapened and simplified. It must however be a real protection to the buyer or it will pass out as an unnecessary service of doubtful value. Hybrid seed is the most complicated crop that farmers use. The value of hybrids'depends on their being as represented, otherwise the results are likely to be disappointing and a reflection on hybrids In general. The acreage to be. planted to single-crosses for the production of double-cross commercial hybrids in 1937 will be entirely dependent on the amount of seed that can be secured. Dr. Kiesselbach deserved much credit for locating a considerable amount of foundation seed that can be used. This for the most part is advanced generation single - cross seed from certified fields. The disadvantage in using this is that the grower gets only about 70 per cent as much grain from his crop as would be the case If F, single-cross seed were used. However, the yielding ability of the double-cross corn produced Is just as high as were F, seed used in making the cross. We should make plans to produce F x single-cross seed and to build up an ample supply for carryover from year to year to avoid seed short - ages after droughty years. To have F, siiigle-crosses we must, of course, plant Inbreds In natural crossing plats. lubreds are sensitive to un - favorable climate conditions and the yields are low. But every year we have a much greater demand for inbreds and F^ single-crosses than can be met. This year such seed is selling at from $1.50 to $2.00 per pound which is excessively high. Such seed normally would be avail - able at a cost of about 50 cents per pound. We need to develop a few men In Nebraska who will make a specialty of raising inbreds and F x single-crosses for sale. The Experiment Station cannot be expected to produce all of this type of seed that is needed. We are willing to help those who are Interested in developing a program of this kind and who are so located that this type of work can be developed. Some time ago we sent a letter to all those who, in the past, have indicated: an interest in producing hybrids, telling of the foundation seed that is available, for sale this year. Many orders have been placed with its. We estimated that the larger growers will plant a total of about 2000 acres of natural crossing plats. We set aside, as a reserve, seed for nearly 200 one acre plats. It is our thought that these small lots would be sold to those who wished to try seed production on a small scale in order to learn the procedure. We have set up In our extension program a series of 12 hybrid corn schools. These will be held at central points in eastern Nebraska during March. County agents.are inviting from 10 to 15 men from each county who are interested in learning the details about hybrid corn acreages, yields, .and production practices and technique. We expect about 600 farmers to attend these Kindergarden hybrid schools. Those who want seed </seg>

With a good season in 1937 we should have a good deal of hybrid seed throughout all eastern Nebraska: Hybrid seed this year Is high in price; so high in fact that sales are slow on account of the scarcity ot money, the dry subsoils, and the threat of grasshoppers. We feel that hybrid seed, in the future will be much cheaper. If it can be produced and sold at about $6.00 per bushel this will greatly Increase the demand and the amount the public will take. The present price of $11.00 to $12.00 per bushel, In regions where climatic hazards are high and average yields relatively low, discourages the sale of hybrid seed in large amounts. Hybrids are here to stay. There seems to be no question about that. We, no doubt, will have better hybrids as time goes on. You cannot get 12 per cent of the farmers in a state like lowa to plant hybrid seed on a million and a quarter acres, unless that crop has special merit. That many farmers cannot be wrong. There is chance for some of you who like to work on the improve - ment of crops and in the seed business, to develop a good sideline of hybrid corn. It may, in fact, not long be a side line. If you have some boys coming on who like that sort of thing and who are looking about for something that they may develop into a business, why not give them a chance at some natural crossing plats for hybrid corn produc - tion. It will add interest to this work and should pay its way and more. WHO SHOULD GROW SORGHUMS? P. H. STEWART, Extension Agronomist My reply to the question, "Who should grow sorghums?" is—Every livestock man in the state who does not have subirrigated or irrigated alfalfa land which is sure to make a substantial bay crop. lam thinking of two things in making this reply. First, that there Is no greater agricultural calamity than a drouth that forces the farmer or stockman to sell his breeding and foundation herd because of a lack of forage. Such a man has lost his tools of trade, —his machinery for converting feed and roughage into a marketable product. It Is tragic to see so many Nebraska farmers forced to sell their milk cows, and brood sows, —down to the very last one in some cases, because of a scarcity of feed. It will take considerable time to re - store such farm families to the status of a self-supporting agriculture, to say nothing of a profitable agriculture on a commercial basis. Second, I have made this reply because I feel that sorghum crops, grown on a reasonable acreage, are the best protection available for the Nebraska farmer who has livestock to feed and maintain. Sorghums </seg>
         <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION as a group might be called "Camel Crops". They have that Camelus dromcdarius characteristic of going without water for a considerable period of time without suffering permanent Injury, just as the camel is reported to do on desert journeys. Sorghums are the best drptith and heat resistors we have. If they cannot survive the summer's heat and drouth periods and make considerable growth, then no other crop, excepting irrigated or subirrigated alfalfa, will fill the feed bunk either. That .Is not to say that sorghums are infallible. They, too, cannot grow without soil moisture, but they can "shut up shop" during dry periods only to be able, when rains do come, to revive quickly where corn would be too badly fired and burned to survive. The sorghum variety test in Wayne County this past season illus - trates this point in a fine way.; After a hot, dry, nearly rainless sum - mer period, substantial rains fell in late August and early September. The following table shows the silage yields of several sorghum vari - eties as compared to corn. Uncured forage yields of sorghum varieties and corn at Wayne, Nebraska. 1936 Season.

Western Blackhull Kaflr 9.8 Grohoma — — 8.9 Cheyenne Kaflr -— — 5.3 The corn was gone before the rains came and made only a fraction of the yield of the later varieties of sorghums. There are sorghum varieties of both the forage and grain types that range from early 90 - -day types to those that take more than 130 days to mature. Selections may be made to fit local needs and intended uses of the crop. In the eastern one-third of the state, Atlas ranks at the top in yield for silage purposes. It can also be used for fodder if desired. Waconia Orange is slightly earlier and offers some promise. A midseason, juicy stalked group for forage consists of Early Sumac, Early Orange, and Lebtl Red. AH of these varieties deserve further trial and increase in local seed supplies. The earliest igroup of forage varieties such as Cheyenne and Freed Kaflr, Early Black and Red Amber were outstanding in much of the state last season because of their earllness. This was particularly true </seg>

For several years there has been a good deal of promotional work in Nebraska suggesting a greater production of sorghum crops. Many farmers are not yet sold on planting from 5 to 15 per cent of the usual corn acreage to sorghums. A grasshopper threat this season is just one more reason for planting sorghums. These pesky insects do not relish the taste of sorghum. I am not supposed today to talk in detail about how to plant, culti - vate and feed sorghums. I have, however, boiled down into brief table form some of the most important points about the different sorghum varieties. This is given in Table II and may prove to be a handy table for those interested in getting a bird's-eye-view of some of the more important varieties of the "Camel Crop" most likely to be found in Nebraska. </seg>

         <seg id="p214">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BURIED TREASURE PROF. H. J. GRAMLICH, Agricultural College Mr. Thalman is supposed to talk to you at this time, but he is in the hospital so I am pinch hitting for him. On the wall are pictures which Mr. Thalman took two years ago and enlarged himself and framed and hung. They tell the story in a nut - shell. "Buried treasure" means ensilage—feed kept from a period when we have a surplus to a period when we are short—when we have a deficiency. We have found that it is relatively easy to move grain and concentrated products a considerable distance; for instance, corn is moving large distances now. Much is coming Into Nebraska from Eastern Illinois. Corn is coming in from the Argentine. A tele - gram received this morning stated that 35,000,000 bushels of corn have come in from the Argentine since August. Two years ago only 10 million came in during the period July 1 to the following April. Roughage usually cannot be efficiently shipped long distances. I was Impressed with the statement which appeared in this morn - ing's World Herald to the effect that In Germany scraps of bread and other foodstuffs are being scrutinized in the garbage pails. The state - ment indicated that police were under orders to see that all waste is stopped at once. I wonder if we have not been guilty of tolerating a. tremendous waste in the past, not in garbage palls but in the form of livestock feed. Cornstalks permitted to winter In the fields, which, had they been cut at the proper time and stored in silos, would have made a very fine feed. Only last year In much of Nebraska there were thousands of acres of weedy and immature corn possessed of very few ears. The vast majority of fields of this type were left standing. Heavy winter snows made it impossible to graze livestock satisfactorily and consequently little good was derived. Had the fields been cut in Sep - tember and the crop stored in silos, there could have been a reserve of roughage carried over into the present year and many who are today short of feed could have supplies of "buried treasure." Only yesterday a man at Waverly indicated a willingness to buy ensilage at $6.75 per ton. A year ago thousands of acres of weedy corn in the territory tributary to this man's farm went to waste. Admittedly we know only a little about the storing of ensilage. A few years ago we thought it was imperative that tall, aboveground silos be used. Later we came to the conclusion that trench silos could be used to very good advantage. We are not sure now but what ensilage can be preserved in stacks. For sureness of preservation over a period of several years, undoubtedly the silage should be put in a container, either aboveground or in a pit or trench. If feed is thus conserved, we know that the owner will not have to go out in the field and haul in shocks of fodder when covered with snow, much as in the large picture </seg>

Authentic records are available of ensilage having been preserved for 18 years under Australian conditions. In Texas we have records of ensilage in trench silos having been preserved for 10-year periods. That the state of Nebraska is very much interested In taking ad - vantage of the opportunity which it has to provide "buried treasure" is proven by results of a recently conducted survey. This survey dis - closed that there are now 45,000 silos in Nebraska. Of these 33,000 are trenches, over 12,000 of which were built last summer. We have about 130,000 farms in the state. I think when every farm upon which row crops are produced is equipped with at least one silo, and preferably two, we can truthfully say that Nebraska will be supplied with sufficient "burled treasure" to enable her stockmen to carry basic herds through any type of emergency brought on by the fickleness of a capricious </seg>

Question (Mr. Holmes) What about the practicability of adding molasses to ensilage as you fill the silo? Answer: Where you are using corn, cane, or some other non - leguminous crop, we doubt if it is advisable. Probably feeding molasses on the silage is a better practice. In the case of a leguminous crop such as alfalfa or sweet clover, there is a material advantage to be derived in adding molasses as this will encourage fermentation. The usual practice in the East, where the making of ensilage from first cutting alfalfa is a rather common practice, is to add molasses at the rate of from 50 to 80 pounds per ton of green material. IS THE CLIMATE OF THE GREAT PLAINS CHANGING? DR. J. B. KINCER, U. S. Weather Bureau The climate of the Great Plains is typical of that found in the interior of large continental land masses in middle latitudes. Great distance from important sources of moisture supply, and Interventing topo - graphic barriers to the west, forming a rain shelter belt, contribute to make the region one of relative dryness. Agricultural utilization of the Plains is limited primarily by the available moisture, with a gradual decrease in precipitatioii from more or less humid conditions in the east, to semi-arid, in the west. The average annual amount ranges from 2 0 Inches in extreme eastern North Dakota and 25 inches in south-central South Dakota, central Kansas, and west-central Texas and Oklahoma, to less than 15 inches in much of Montana, eastern Wyoming, eastern Colorado, and the Brazes Valley in western Texas and eastern New Mexico. However, the agricultural significance of the normal rainfall depends not only on the annual av - erage amount, but also on the rate of evaporation, the seasonal, and even diurnal, distribution and intensity of the rainfall, variations in amount of rain from year to year, and long-time trends. Most of these modifying factors operate more favorably in the northern half than in the southern; therefore, with a comparable amount of rainfall, general conditions in the north, with lower temperatures and less evaporation, are more favorable for crop utilization of the moisture received. The minimum amount of precipitatioii necessary for successful farming by ordinary methods is usually considered to be between 15 and 20 inches annually, depending upon the modifying phases above mentioned. Where the average annual amount is appreciably less than 20 Inches, other conditions must be very favorable to insure sue- </seg>
         <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION .-"*..,* , ¦ fooooooor cessful, permanent crop production. In considering this question, it must be remembered that more than half the years usually have less than the average amount, and some years considerably less than half. The rate of evaporation of moisture from the soil, depending prin - cipally on the temperatures, relative humidity, and wind movement, increases from north to south over the Plains, ranging, for the warm season, from about 30 to 60 inches. The agricultural significance of these date, stated in terms of actual equivalent rainfall for the different </seg>
         <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE areas, can be determined only approximately because of several niodify - ng influences. However, the difference of 30 inches in evaporation be - tween the north and the south is equivalent to about 10 inches of effec- </seg>
         <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION tive rainfall. That is, for example, 15 inches of rainfall in North Dakota is about as effective as 25 inches In west-central Texas. Much of Australia is similar to the Great Plains with regard to moisture conditions. It is interesting to note, however, that in the early days of farming in that country wheat was sown largely in the more humid eastern coastal sections, where rainfall was comparatively heavy, and failure of the enterprise resulted. Later, attempts were made on interior drier lands, intermediate of the humid coast and the desert interior, and signal success-resulted. In much of the Australian Wheat-Belt, dry-farming methods of fallowing and tilth are practiced, with only a third of the area under wheat at the same time. The designation of dry farming areas there depends principally upon the rate of evaporation. In some cases sections having less than 18 inches of rainfall annually are classed as dry, while others are so designated when the rainfall is nearly 25 inches.; ' Seasonal and Diurnal Distribution In the Great Plains, It Is the rainfall of the crop growing season with which the farmer is most concerned. While the moisture stored in the soil at the beginning of spring is decidedly Important, this is fre - quently small, owing to the normally scanty winter precipitation, and crops must depend largely on spring and early summer rains. While the annual precipitation is light, the seasonal distribution, with the maximum coming in the most active growing season, is most favorable, especially in the central and northern portions of the region. In addi - tion to this characteristic of the climate of the Plains, the dlurual distribution of rainfall is such as to favor the fullest utilization of the moisture received, as most of the rain occurs at night. This is especially characteristic of the central portion of the region w .are, on the aver - age, more than 65 per cent of the total falls during the night time, which affords opportunity for the moisture to penetrate the soil with a mini - mum loss by exaporation immediately following the rainfall. Variations of Rainfall from Year to Year It is important to know the frequency of droughts or of years with harmfully deficient moisture. With less than 15 inches of rainfall in an individual year conditions are usually critical. An examination of a chart showing the percentage of years with less than 15 inches em - phasizes the rapidly increasing risk of crop farming from the central Plains westward to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The fre - quency of such occurrances Increases from 10 per cent of the years in west-central Kansas to 80 per cent in the drier sections approaching the Rockies. On the other hand, a favorable feature of the Plains rainfall is that most of the rain occurs in showers of moderate amount instead of heavy downpours. </seg>
         <seg id="p220">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Heavy Trends However, as affecting agriculture, the matter of comparatively long - ime droughts in the Plains Is of most significance. Its importance to the welfare of agriculture is not a thing just recently discovered as many seem to think, but has long been recognized and stressed by cllmatologlsts. Let us read an extract from a paper on Great Plains Climate, by the writer, given at the annual meeting ot the Association of American Geographers at Ann Arbor, Michigan, in December, 1922. "There Is a well recognized tendency for precipitation in the Plains region to show several successive years of comparatively generous rain - fall followed in turn by several years with deficient moisture, and this renders farming by ordinary methods precarious in many of the drier western portions of the section. Abundant crops in years of ample moisture encourage the western extension of the cultivated area, but he records show that these are only temporary conditions, to be fol - lowed by years of drought when the rainfall is entirely insufficient to 7ms7°7 °iSaSter S'"'e t0 tOU°W "nWiSe ricu,tura' adventures Is Hie Climate of the Great Plains Changing? Many people think, because of the recent successive drought years, that the climate is permanently changing, either naturally or from some act of man. The popular fallacy that man can basically change climate o. that it is changing tram some other cause is not a product of the 20th century by any means. It is as old as historical America Itself. In the I°'°»«°'1 °'°»«°' Columbus' voyages, the following is found: "JAMAICA, July IS, 14.14, •.

The critical 20- Inch annual isohyet always extends in a general north-south direction over the Plains country. In much of the Great Plains, during the period from about 1900 to 1915 there was comparatively abundant moisture. For these 16 years Nebraska had an accumulation of more than 20 inches above normal rainfall and 13 of the 16 years had above normal in North Dakota. Most other Plains States enjoyed like conditions. This attracted attention with much speculation as to the cause. It so happened that during this period, and the years immediately preceding, there was a very large increase in the cultivated acreage in the Plains, and to this many people gave credit for the increase in precipitation, From 18 79 to 1899 the acreage of harvested crops in the Great Plains States increased five-fold and from 1899 to 1029 more than 1000 per cent. During the second decade of the present century, the Weather Bureau was literally bombarded with suggestions that the increase in cultivated land in the Plains was responsible for the abundant rains and had definitely changed the climate to wetter These claims became so insistent that a paper entitled, "Cultivation Does Not Increase the Rainfall" was published in the December 1919 issue of the Monthly Weather Review. In due time this pronouncement was fully sustained, for following the p. nod in question, the pendulum beg.,,, ,„ swing back, so to speak; rainfall more or less gradually do-r.ased. culminating in recent dis - astrous droughts. Just as man formerly was credited with the bringing about ot the generally favorable conditions prevailing from about 1900 o IJI.. he is now blamed by many for the present situation. The facts are, he had practically nothing to do with the matter of rainfall n either case, though the very thing, extensive cultivation, for which he was earlier given credit for effecting an apparently favorable change n climate, is now known to have materially contributed to intensifying the effects of the recent severe drought through soil erosion and inten - sive dust storms. Many theories are advanced as to the cause of the recent conditions. Those most frequently heard are extensive radio broadcasting and the drainage of small lakes, ponds, marshes, and the like. Most of the others are too silly to even mention. The broadcasting theory can be disposed of quickly. It Is definitely known that radio waves have no influence whatever on atmospheric 1777777°™ 7 °" Ule tem"erature' Consequent*, they could not affect condensation, the major factor in precipitation. Further - more, some long records show that quite similar droughts occurred </seg>
         <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION many years before radio was even thought of. If broadcasting is responsible for recent conditions what was the sinister influence that caused the drought Centering around 1850 and that in the early nineties, such as the records show obtained? The drainage theory, sponsored by a good many thinking people, on its face, appears logical and convincing. It is argued that, with the destruction of thousands of square miles of water surface, there Is obviously less moisture contributed to the atmosphere through evapora - tion, and, consequently, less to condense and precipitate as rain. This also is superficial reasoning. Let me suggest that the next time some one propounds to you a pet theory of some human action claimed to be responsible for the drought, you ask him to explain what man did, In reversal of former practice, or in:any new activity, in Kansas in September of this year to cause in that month 20 per cent more rain than fell during the entire preceding summer. There is abundance evidence to support the statement that rain - fall basically depends on atmospheric mass motion rather than on local conditions, such as ponds, or forests, much public opinion to the con - trary, notwithstanding. For example, the Panhandle of Texas, in a relatively dry part of the Plains, had, during the last half of May of this year, 9. inches of rainfall, with rain on 13 of the 15 days, which is comparable to a very wet month in the more humid sections of tho country. Following this the last half of June had only 0.38 inch without a single clqudy day. How the vapor pressure records for Amarillo show for the wet period in May .454 inch and for the dry period in June .425, approximately the same, This is not an isolated case, but many such instances are on record. Again, we might con - sider the case of Maiden Island in the tropical Pacific, south of the Hawaiian group. This is a little, flat island, about 6 by 10 miles, surrounded for long distances by warm tropical water and the air is heavily laden with moisture. Here the average annual rainfall is about 26 inches, varying from 6 inches for the driest year to more than 90-inches for the wettest. Certainly, trie vapor here plays a minor role in the amount of rainfall and its regularity. In the 1930 drought West Virginia was relatively the driest state, yet it is one of the most densely forested in ithe East. " Rainfall was abundant in 1929 and again in 1931. If forests are effective in producing rain, why the great drought there in 1930? Again, in July 1936, western Kansas had 3 times as much rainfall as lowa. There is much loose talk these days about changes In climate due to human activity, and various suggestions that man should do this, that, or the other thing to prevent droughts. Most of such talk is utter nonsense. But here we must distinguish between preventing droughts as such and doing certain things to modify the unfavorable </seg>

         <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The few available precipitation records, covering 100 years or more, indicate that a general dry phase, somewhat comparable to that of 1886-95, and the more recent one of 1930 to date, obtained in the 30's of the last century, or approximately 100 years ago. The outstanding wet phase of the United States climate In the last century was from about 1865 to 1885, with a secondary maximum during the first two decades of: the present century, though several transitory droughts were interspersed. All of the foregoing statements refer specifically to that part of the country east of the Rocky Mountains. Some tree-ring records of the far Northwest indicate that there probably was a major minimum precipitation phase, at least in that area, soon after the middle of the 18th century, within the period 1755-' BO, with a succeeding maximum phase culminating about the beginning of the 19th century. While study of long weather records has not as yet disclosed a law to justify a forecast of future droughts, such study does give an historical background, which warns us that droughts in the future may be expected, just as severe as those of the past. For example, the records show that in the early nineties, or some 40 years ago, there was a drought in the so-called "dust bowl" just as severe as that recently experienced. Doubtless, when the present drought definitely comes to an end, there will be a period of years with comparatively heavy rainfall, just as before, and little will be heard about duststorms and the like. But, in planning a permanent farm program for such areas, the basic considerations should include the practical certainty that dry climatic phases, at least as severe as in the past, will recur. The droughts of 1934 and 1936 were among the most extensive and severe in the climatological history of the United States, not only because of the large deficiencies in rainfall, but also the fact that temperatures were unprecedented.- high, which accounted for much of the crop damage, especially to the corn crop. In discussing drought we speak glibly of certain deficiencies In rain - fall, with reference to .the normal, but seldom do we grasp the enor - mous quantities of water represented in such shortages, which should be a matter for study to all who contend that man can make It rain, or who advocate certain practices, such as constructing ponds, to change natural climatic conditions. One inch, of rainfall represents for an acre of land 113 tons of water. For example, for a single month last summer, July, Kansas had only 0.86 of an inch of rainfall, or a little more than one-fourth of normal. That means that the State was short of moisture for that month alone nearly 15 billion tons of water. Well, to say it that way doesn't mean much, for it cannot register. Let's put it another way. If it were humanly possible to count these 15 billion tons at a uniform rate of 3 a second, 24 hours a day, and 365 </seg>
         <seg id="p226">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE days every year, it would require more than 150 years to complete the count. When we consider the enormous energy that is required to extract that much additional water from the air for a single State in a single month it is difficult to understand how anyone could seriously consider the proposition of man-made changes in climate. While dust storms In the Plains are done primarily to droughty conditions, and they are of little concern during the relatively wet phases of climate, it is a tragic fact that the drier sections of the Plains have been extensively plowed and cultivated where crop farming never should have been attempted. Men is not responsible for drought, or dust, as sent by Nature, but he has made the results of drought more devastating to human homes and fortunes by removing, from areas not climatically suited for permanent cultivation, the vegetative pro - tection, or covering, that Nature provided. Much of this one-time grass - land is now under cultivation and has become an aggravator of dust - storms. The basic remedy, of course, is rain. Man cannot make it rain, but he can do the next best thing—restore the original natural conditions as far as possible, and avoid repeating mistakes of the past. However, we should not become too excited about the matter of duststorms. as ihoimh they were only recent occurrence, unheard of before. They have always been severe in the drier sections of the Plains whenever extensive droughty conditions obtained. The follow - ing are ofli ial weather reports from Dodge City, Kansas, not last spring, mi!- last .ear, or the year before that, but nearly a half century ago, and tlu-y have remarkable conformity to similar reports of recent years: April 8. 1!-'!)|): At In a. m. the dust hi the air was so dense that obje Is could not b - distinguished Ml) yards off.

         <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION HOW I PLAN MY PASTURES By LAWRENCE QUANTE, Brock Winner-^—1936 Nebraska Pasture Contest There are four main objectives in planning a pasture program, to - wit: (1) to provide early pasture; (2j to provide a mid-summer pasture: (3) to provide pasture late into the fall; and (4) to provide a lot of pasture per acre all of the time.' On this farm, temporary pastures are used extensively. The pas - ture set-up in 1936 consisted of the following fields: 1. Fall-seeded rye for early spring pasture. 2. Oats and first-year sweet clover to fill In the gap between rye and sudan grass. 3. Sudan for hot weather pastured 4. Perpanent alfalfa-grass pasture when needed. The permanent pasture in this set-up came Into usage following the 1934 drouth during which the regular bluegrass pastures were "killed out."' It was an old alfalfa field, about one-half "killed out," part of which was plowed and part disked in the fall of 1935. The entire field was seeded to a mixture of orchard grass, rye grass, blue grass, and brome grass. The disked portion turned out best and this fall had a good stand of alfalfa and brome grass with some orchard grass and blue grass. It was pastured lightly all summer with no bloat difficulties. _ ) Sudan grass was planted on cornstalk ground, plowed early and left rough to catch early spring rains. Although the summer was very dry, the sudan produced continuous pasturage. No trouble with prussic acid poisoning was encountered. ¦",'-, Because the sweet clover seeded this spring perished during the summer, a new field was seeded this fall to provide second-year sweet clover in 1937. A little wheat was included to curtail bloating. Also an alfalfa-brome-bluegrass seeding was made this fall, to be used for hay at first and later for pasture. Based oh this year's experiences, the following temporary pasture set-up will be used in 1937 to supplement the permanent pasture: *1. Winter wheat, pastured early and left for frafn crop. 2. Second-year sweet clover (including light mixture of wheat). 3. Oats and first-year sweet clover. 4. ; Sudan planted on cornstalk ground. * Oats can be planted on this ground for October pasturing. </seg>
         <seg id="p228">Rt PORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Conclusions Moisture is the most important factor in pastures and since rainfall cannot be controlled, it must be conserved. On the fields under dis - cussion there was no run-off except when the snow melted in March. The ground was frozen and quite a bit of moisture got away at that time. Drouth resistant plants such as alfalfa, sweet clover, and sudan should be planted. They should be sown at a time when moisture con - ditions are most favorable. Early plowing puts the ground In shape to hold the rain that falls. Little wild barley has been a worse pest than downy brome, but can be controlled by rotating with cultivated crops. HOW I PLAN MY PASTURES Hy ALBERT A. ARENS, Hartington Winner 1 9:. G Nebraska Pasture Contest The year of lit:i(j is now history and it treated most of us quite roughly. Most of us will recall that furnishing ample pasturage for our livestock was quite a problem; and some of us, no doubt, had to cut down numbers, open the extra silo if fortunate enough to have one. and some stock had to go more or less hungry; in many cases the fellows that left their s.rond-year sweet clover stand on account of the soil conservation program or otherwise were mighty glad that they had done so. It is gratifying to note the interest that is beginning to manifest itself among tanners in regard to conserving their moisture and soil and planning better pasture. No doubt a year like the past and the year 1934 illustrate the necessity of such procedure; the federal programs and state pasture contest give this work encouragement and aid in the development of useful information. We farmers, as a whole, have more or less unconsciously been guilty of mismanagement due to numerous reasons, and perhaps have been most abusive of our pastures. Deferred grazing is beginning to be quite widely practiced and many are depending on fall rye and winter wheat and second-year sweet clover for early spring pasturage. Many farmers depend on sudan for midsummer pasture, and then first year sweet clover in grain stubble and fall grain for fall pasture. </seg>
         <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION This supplementing of permanent pasture, whether native or tame, ¦will do much to revive them. :. . The mowing of pastures to control weeds is a rather common and good practice; Incidentally, however, the appearance of considerable amount of .weeds in established seeding is a pretty good Indication of •overgrazing. Regarding weeds I had an experience which may benefit some of our listeners. In the fall of '35 I bought what I considered some "cheap" brome seed from a farmer in a neighboring township. Last spring I noticed a pretty heavy infestation of pennycress; two of us pulled and piled this the latter part of May until we were "blue in the face," and later we burned these piles. If we hadn't had such a satisfactory stand of brome we would have plowed it under. Later I learned that It was wise not to plow pennycress as the seeds will ripen under the ground. I learned this from no less authority than Nebraska Weeds, Bulletin 101 published by the State of Nebraska. I also learned that pasturing these weeds will taint milk and even the meat. On account of its early ripening and large seed producing ability I would consider it our worst annual weed. In the more intensive farming areas of the state, many farmers, especially tenants, have been more or less wholly depending on temporary pasture. I can't help but feel that this is not a very desir - able, economical, or satisfactory procedure. ¦¦-. The rental usually has been too high, seed cost has also been quite high, and in cold.wet or exceedingly dry springs, stands of such crops as sudan has not been satisfactory; I feel that in this area every livestock farm should have some permanent pasture. This, when once established, will furnish more substantial forage, will save the expense of yearly seed cost and field preparation, and do away with the problem of getting a stand. Another factor which has usually been over - looked until recent years, is that of erosion on this annually tilled ground. We hear occasionally of disappointment in the establishment of a permanent seeding. Insufficient moisture, weed competition, and seed bed preparation will spell the success or failure of a seeding. In the spring seeding seeded alone perhaps the most ideal seed bed would be sudan or millet stubble cut the previous year for hay; this will not be as foul and soil will be in good condition. After the seed is sown a light harrowing and a good rolling will usually do the job; it is seldom necessary to disk ahead of seeding, if practiced it should be done light; 1 wouldn't plow. If sown with a nurse crop on rather fertile soil that is quite clean, I prefer flax as a nurse crop for alfalfa to the spring grains. Flax does not rob the soil of moisture as much as spring grains, </seg>
         <seg id="p230">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is practically lodge-resistant, and the gradual shedding of leaves while ripening does not give as much shock to young seedlings. However, we usually have to hunt for a market for the seed but have always found it and realized a handsomer cash return than from small grain. Incidentally, the straw also is superior for bedding or feed. If moisture is a problem or land rather foul, I prefer summer fallowing and fall seeding from mid-August to not later than the second week in Sep - tember. The chances are that any future seedings we make will be according to the latter procedure. We have found a mixture of brome and timothy with 2 or 3 pounds of alfalfa added hard to beat; we do not favor sweet clover in a mixture as it gives too much competition; altho there is a place for sweet clover as supplementary temporary pasture. There has been considerable interest In the reestablishing of native grasses. There has been quite a bit of experimental work done along these lines. While there is yet much to learn, some grasses show promise. We have been doing some work along these Hues In co - operation with our local CCC camp and on our own hook; one of the grasses that we are most interested in we still know the least about and that is our bluestems. In an other year we will be able to observe the result of three different methods of reestabllshment; the scattering of native hay, seeding of native seed, and sodding; this latter procedure of course would not be practical. We're doing it to try to Increase some more desirable strains that we found while gathering seed. We all realize by this time the mistake made by breaking up much ground that should never have seen a plow. If we could put it back as nature intended, it would be a great thing, not only by putting marginal land back for grazing, but also to combat both wind and water erosion. We've learned that we can't conflict with nature. After all she had the grasses that furnished ample sustenance to wild life in the way of green forage and cured grass without supplementary feeds or grain. We never heard of bloat, prussic or hydrocyanic acid poisoning, corn stalk disease, and many others, from it. All in all, this supplemented by tame grass and fall grains for early spring and late fall appears to be the ideal procedure. PASTURES FOR NEXT SEASON By E. F. FROLIK It's always well to look back and see what has happened before we decide just what we're going to do about any problem. In this pas - ture proposition it may be best to see what these recent dry years have done to our pastures before we lay our plans for the coming year. Prior to 1934 we thought we had grazing problems and, for that </seg>
         <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION matter, we did have plenty of them. But the situation hadn't be - come what you could call acute and on most of our Nebraska grazing land it continued to be possible to turn our critters out on the pas- i ture in the spring and for them to find a fairly good stand ot grasses ¦on which to graze. True, in many cases the grasses present were not of the species which would have provided the most feed, nor were they in the condition, nor was the soil in the state of fertility to provide maximum production. But all of that was not readily evident on the face of it, and we just went along putting most of our efforts on our corn, wheat, alfalfa, and other such crops where the returns were more evident. About all we did to the old pasture was to put in a few more posts on the fence, perhaps stretch the wire now and then, and maybe, if the plowing was done and the boys weren't doing anything anyway; we'd go out and mow the ironweeds and ragweed along in : late August or early September. I don't have to tell you that the situation is entirely different to - day. You can't drive one mile in any direction in the eastern third Of the state without being impressed by the deplorable condition of our grazing land. That was especially evident last fall after we received those rains along in September. Some of the pastures did green up. But what was the vegetation? Well, in most of the cases I saw, it was dandelions, one of the wild bromes or little wild barley—all of which are practically worthless from a pasture standpoint. The bluegrass wasn't greening up and it -won't 'green up next spring—the greater share of it is "killed out." Without going into detail of the accompanying causes, and the years when the damage was done, we feel from our observations and from what farmers have reported to us that 70% of the pasture grasses and legumes in eastern Nebraska have been "killed out." Will Bluegrass Pastures Come Back? Will the bluegrass come back? You hear it said by a lot of folks that there is no need of getting alarmed about these pastures—all we need is the right kind of weather—that would do more good than all of the advice in the world. Well, I wouldn't argue with anyone about that point. It's like telling a sick man that what he needs is good health. Perhaps the doctor can be of some little help in restoring health. And so It is with this pasture situation. Perhaps, by putting forth some planning and effort we can do something to bring these pastures back, with, of course, the aid of the weather man. But what I started out to say was, will the bluegrass pastures come back? Well, they always have before and probably would again if we allow them sufficient time. But this much is true. Where formerly every farm had a source of seed in the bluegrass in the pas- </seg>
         <seg id="p232">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tures and waste places, most of that is now gone. That means that the natural spread of seed is much more limited today. Eventually,, these pastures would come back but I can't help thinking they would be quite a few years doing it. I leave It to you whether or not we can afford on our eastern Nebraska land to wait for the restoration of this bluegrass land or whether perhaps we had better do something to hurry it along. Pasture Rebuilding Situation Discouraging What can we do to rebuild our pastures? Frankly, the situation is rather discouraging. Prospects for seeding conditions certainly are anything but bright today. We are faced with the lowest soil mois - ture content at this time of the year in 43 years. That means we're going to have to have more than the normal amount of rainfall from now on to provide even average growing conditions. And we also know that valuable pasture grasses such as brome require pretty good growing conditions at best when they are getting started. Coupled with the discouraging outlook from the soil moisture stand - point, we are facing a situation of extremely high seed prices. As an average, I suppose you'd have to go a long ways back (outside of possibly the spring of 1935) to find the conditions as unfavorable from the price of seed standpoint as they are today. Without going into much detail, here are a few prices of some of our leading grasses and legumes as they are today: alfalfa —25 cents; brome grass—2s cents; sweet clover—l 3 cents; orchard grass—2o cents; crested wheatgrass —50 cents; timothy—7 cents, and meadow fescue—l 2 cents. In other words, if you are going to put out what we think is the most practical pasture mixture at a normal rate of seeding this spring, it will cost you about $5.00 an acre for seed. But even if moisture conditions do become more favorable and we raise enough money to buy seed for the pasture, what will we do for feed this year? It's been pretty well established that if we're going to start a new permanent pasture or reseed one that has been "killed out," keeping the stock off for most of the first year is pretty essential. It's usually a waste of seed just to put it out on an old pasture with - out taking the stock off. In fact, where there is still some grass left, a pasture can be completely rebuilt by just keeping the stock off and not adding any seed. What Shall We Plant for Temporary Pastures.. And there is only one way to keep the stock off of the permanent pastures and that is to provide plenty of temporary pastures. About double the normal acreage of rye was seeded In eastern Nebraska last fall. That is very fortunate. It means that we will have earlier </seg>
         <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION . pasture than we would get from our permanent pastures and; it also means that we will have a lot more feed during the early spring months. The acreage of winter wheat in eastern Nebraska was also greatly increased. That may prove to be a good thing from a cash crop stand - point and it may not. But we do know that it will be mighty helpful from a pasture standpoint. Just recently in driving over the eastern part of the state during, a warm period of weather I couldn't help being impressed by. the fact that most of the cattle and the horses on the farms seemed to be out pasturing on tne wheat. I don't suppose all of those farmers thought that was a good thing, but it was one way of getting some feed for their stock. Experiments here at Ne - braska and in Kansas indicate that if done judiciously, pasturing is not injurious to wheat yields. This means that grazing should be done only when the wheat has a good growth and when the ground isn't wet. The stock should be taken off when the little culm or stem is just emerging above the surface of the ground which on an average is about April 28 here at Lincoln. Obviously, if the cattle or horses bite off these miniature heads or part of them, a lower yield is the result. It has been proven, however, that Judicious pasturing of wheat which is rank in growth and likely to lodge may actually increase the yield. Planting Fall Rye In the Spring . If you didn't get your rye planted last fall, you might be able to get it in early enough this spring to have It behave as second year rye. Ordinarily, If seeded extremely early, as In February or early March, it will still head; out that year. But if seeding Is delayed until the time that spring grains are ordinarily seeded, you'd better seed oats or barley for pasture. Fall rye planted at this time of the year is not so good. It assumes a rather prostrate growth and does not head out during that season. The forage yield is rather low. Every so often someone gets Interested In sowing rye in the spring of the year, think - ing that it will remain green and give pasture all of that season and then head but during the second year. Theoretically that sounds all right. Under actual conditions, however, it usually gives very little teed during the spring, and then when the hot dry weather of mid - summer arrives it perishes. We have had reports from northern Nebraska where the rye did live through the first season and then headed out the second year. Unfortunately, a, great deal of .our sweet clover planted in the spring of 1936 perished during the summer. This is really serious because many farmers will find themselves with no second year clover this year to. furnish pasture following the time the rye "plays out."

         <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION ing or what is more commonly known as prussic acid poisoning. What about it? In the first place, most of the prussic acid poisoning cases made the headlines and we heard about them. I was really surprised when out visiting farmers this fall, in connection with our work in the Nebraska Pasture Contest, at the number who pastured their cattle on sudan grass without any difficulty. I rather suspect that in spite of all we saw in the papers, the majority of farmers who had sudan grass pastured their cattle on it without any difficulty. Prior to 1936 most farmers considered the danger relatively small and that should be encouragement that with return to seasons of more nearly normal rainfall, the difficulties with prussic acid poisoning will again be much less. One thing we can do to protect ourselves to a certain extent is to buy pure sudan grass seed, and the way to do this is to get certified seed. Unfortunately, the amount of certified seed for sale here in the state this year will be pretty small. But If any of you are interested and we Can locate a source of certified seed, we certainly will be glad to pass the.information on to you. There is evidence to indicate that even pure sudan can cause poisoning but certainly the danger is much less than is the case with mixtures or crosses with other sorghums. I like to think that sudan will again take its place as a respectable ¦member of our temporary pasture crops, for certainly no grass or legume—temporary or permanent—can equal sudan grass in the ability to produce forage during the hot dry months of midsummer. Preventing Bloat in Sweet Clover Sweet clover, too, offers problems in connection with, bloat. Not turning the cattle on when they are hungry, and leaving them on continuously once you have turned them on seems to help considerably in reducing the danger of bloat. But the best thing to do along this line is to sow either rye or wheat into the sweet clover in the fall. Even oats and barley are sometimes seeded in the spring to good advantage altho they would not be expected to work out as well as the fall-seeded grains. The important thing in using temporary pastures is to have a complete rotation system. Too often we seed just rye, or just sweet clover, and the result is that we have a lot of feed for a part of the summer—-perhaps more than we need right at the time—and then noth - ing at all during the remainder of the season. In our work in the pas - ture contest during the past year we visited over 700 farmers in the state who were particularly interested in this problem of pastures. Based on a summarization of their experiences, together with what we have learned thru our experiments here at the College, we have con - cluded that the following rotation of temporary pasture crops would work out fairly well on an average eastern Nebraska farm: </seg>

FROM RANGE TO FEED LOT By S. R. McKELVIE, By-the-Way-Ranch I assume, Mr. Chairman, that it is on account of it having leaked out that we have been undertaking to operate a ranch that I am invited here to give you something of our experiences. In that I remind you of the story you have so often heard-of the fellow who sold the horse that deliberately ran into a tree, and did it over and over again, and when it was called to man's attention, said "the horse wasn't blind, it just didn't give a damn!" That may apply to what we have done in a good many cases on the ranch. In other'words, we started out Without any inhibitions. We just didn't know any better. We went ahead to do the things we thought might work, and strangely, some of them did. It Is of those lam going to speak, not of the more numerous things that didn't work, and from those experiences —the most satisfactory and successful ones—l hope to be able to draw some conclusions, among them one that will appear to you, I expect, quite radical. In other words, that this title assigned me, From Range to Feed Lot, may not appear as long!a jump as we are accustomed to think. Based upon boyhood experience where it was our custom to creep feed our calves, immediately commended my attention to that practice, or the possibility of it in the range country when we run our cows in large pastures and may not see them very frequently. For instance, the average rancher may not see his cows in a distant pasture oftener than once a week, his cattle near him will be observed more frequently. From those large pastures, running up possibly to several thousand acres on some of them—not unusual to see thousand acre pastures—it might seem impractical to creep feed calves We were told it was. impractical, that we couldn't round up those calves and cows to get the calves started to eat, and that it was just out of the question. Well, we just went ahead anyhow and thought we would try it, and the first year early in August, we made these open creeps out in the pasture near the watering place where our cows and calves were accustomed to come once a day and drink and rest. And there we put some salt near the creeps. If you drive out to the ranch you will see the creeps in all of the pastures there. Then we put hay inside </seg>
         <seg id="p238">_ EPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the creep. I seemed to remember that that was attractive to a calf. When he laid down he tried to find a clean spot to lie down on, and much to our amazement, the very first day after the creep was built, there were two or three calves in it. After that they came every day. One learned, and then the others, until when they were off the cows they went on their own and didn't know they were weaned. Since then we have our calves fed in creeps or self-feeders that they may go to and have all they want at any time. We feel we have been re - warded for our effort. Our March and April calves In middle October weighed about 450 to 500 pounds. lam not going to say that for the average rancher it might always pay. We sell for breeding purposes, much of it.

The gain this year, even with the cost of feed, and If you want to know what a calf wants to eat —in a pasture where we had 45 this year, they put in 200 pounds of feed every other day and those calves cleaned it up. They were eating something over two pounds a day and were giving returns for it. It was rather a bulky feed. A good deal of it was oat hulls and molasses, for which we per - haps paid rather generously. Protein Supplement With Pasture So much for that. There occurred to us something else. It didn't occur to us, it was something of somebody else suggestion and experi - ence. lam going to follow a group ot calves. I shall take the crop of 1934 which year was about the same In the sandhills as down here. Our lakes dried up, we had an extremely short hay crop. So these calves that had been creep fed were turned on one of the meadows. We frankly don't like to pasture meadows. It removes cover that is necessary to hold the moisture, to catch the snow. It wasn't a matter of choice this fall. We put them on meadow and fed them cubes, </seg>
         <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION protein and molasses cubes, and with a limited amount of hay, they came right through. They didn't look so much thriftier in the spring tho, than when they went on grass. In 1935 we had an abundant crop. That is all we gave to them. They had no additional feed except hay and grass until 1936. They had good pastures all this time, and so in July of this year I happened to be in town. I.met up with a fellow who said he was feeding high per cent protein cubes, about 41% and some lower per cent protein and molasses cubes, and that he hoped to accomplish a great deal at it. His steers were making very good progress. The Idea intrigued me. We had a carload of these big steers, two years old, some more than the '34 crop, four or five head from '33. So I just put these steers in a pasture that hadn't been used very heavily and I thought,—it isn't going to cost very much to try this. We had cubes left over from last winter and we began feeding them two pounds of soybean cubes, 47 to 38 per cent protein, and bought molasses cubes that were about 12 per cent protein. Began feeding them two pounds of each. That was about the 10th of August. Fed them for 70 days, changing at the end of 30 days to one pound of soy - bean cubes and three pounds of molasses cubes. Those steers never missed a feed. We never had to go out to bring them In. They were always there to eat. They ate and drank and rested, and then went to the hills to grass. From the Range to the Feed Lot We didn't weigh,them when first put on feed. Our best guess when we sold them was they would average 1000 pounds when put on feed. When weighed on ranch, 1180 pounds for average. They,cost $5.60! Without knowing how much the gains were, and how much the gains can be attributed to the use of these feeds, I am certain that we "upped" the price on those steers $1.00 per hundred, sold for $1.00 more than any steers of that age. lam not saying they were better steers than others in the community. It was the condition, of them that "upped" the price of $1.00 per hundred. They made the differ - ence for us between $5.60 and $11.80. Assuming that feed caused Jhem to gain not more than an additional pound that would just about offset the price that they brought. There are considerable number of angles that may.be followed with reference to feeding operations, but I am not basing my conclusions entirely on what we did. Others are doing the same thing. We were simply following a suggestion/a practice, and you would be surprised at the extent to which these protein and molasses cubes are being used on the range. There was one fellow who fed out some cattle, not good class of cattle at all, from the south. He had them on feed about six months, they sold as high as $9.50 and $10.00 in Omaha. They were </seg>
         <seg id="p240">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fed on the range on these cubes. They were not an exceptionally good class of cattle, which Indicates that it was the feed. Drouth in Corn Belt May Change Practices What are the conclusions? Some one has said that the fellow who controls the feed supply determines the destiny of the livestock farms. He can control it to this extent—that finally when the feed runs out we will quit producing livestock, but in the meantime the farmer will be like the horse which was headed for water. There was a time when the supply of purebred bulls for the range came from the cornbelt country. Not any more. They come from the range country. It was thought it couldn't be done. Some are being sold from the cornbelt, sure, but largely in the ranch country. It may come about "that from range to feed lot" may not mean from the sandhills of Nebraska. It may very easily mean from one pasture to another in the sandhills. That will be determined by conditions as they evolute. It has been brought out that these last two or three or even five years are not significant of what we are going to have perpetually in this country in point of weather or production. But they are sug - gestive. The results of what we may expect in the changes in farm practices if we are not very thoughtful of all the things that enter into the farming industry. In the livestock industry, the bond of relation - ship between the rancher and the farmer who has been feeding his stuff has just been like that (indicating). It has seemed inseparable. Their interests were exactly one, but it may eventually, and I think from the facts I have given you, might very easily come about that the range country will some day be the feeding grounds for large numbers of cattle that heretofore have been finished out in the cornbelt. LESSONS FROM RANGE MANAGEMENT By MARVEL L. BAKER, Experimental Sub-Station, North Platte, Nebr. The most striking lesson to be learned from the history of range and permanent pasture management in this country is the need for the creation of a national consciousness which will cause us to look upon land as our most valuable possession; as a heritage to be preserved rather than a windfall to be dissipated and squandered. Regardless of section; in east or west, north or south, humid or arid, cornbelt or range country, we need to appreciate that the conservation of our soil and water resources, the preservation of scenic beauty and wild life, and the maintenance of a sound livestock industry depend upon the conservative use of range and pasture to maintain a desirable vegeta - tive cover. In short, that sound grass management is essential to a balanced agriculture and a sound national life. </seg>
         <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION Without an understanding of this fact, the alternative methods of control are by government decree or government subsidy, the desir - ability of both of which are open to question. The principles underlying sound grass management are doubtless the same thruout the land, altho their application may vary In detail from region to region. In the consideration of these principles, many things are obvious If considered, but are often Ignored both by operat - ors using grass, and by those anxious to bring about better methods of grass management. Exploitation of the Range One lesson which Is vital Is that land tenure must be such, and per - manent grass land must be capitalized at a level which will encourage range conservation rather than to put a premium upon its exploitation. It must be plain that as far as the Individual is concerned, there may be conditions under which the excessive use of the range may appear not only profitable but necessary. There is surely no disagreement that from the standpoint of sustained profitable livestock production - range conservation is imperative. Range and permanent pasture land should be handled to secure the maximum production of beef, milk, wool, and mutton consistent with the maintenance of a satisfactory cover of desirable grass species. One lesson which years of range management and range mis - management makes clear is that the productivity of grass lands may be depressed or even destroyed and that on the other hand it may be main - tained, restored, or increased. There is no question that serious de - pletion of the ranges is attended by decreased gains of cattle grazed thereon, by deterioration of breeding herds, and by smaller than normal calf crops so that a time comes.when Increasing overhead costs and decreasing returns must meet and the operator be driven from business. Conversely there is no question that improvement in range condi - tions carries with it greater productivity on the part of the livestock population. The summer gains made by steers grazing on good range may run more than 300 pounds. On poor range they may be not far from zero. This striking correlation between the quality of pasture and the gains made by steers grazed on it may account for the ap - parent tendency toward better grass management employed by op - erators handling steers than by those operating on a cow-and-calf basis. Altho not as apparent, .the correlation between quality of pasture and quality and productivity of the. breeding herd is no less marked over a term of years. Deferred and Limited Grazing The reestablishment and the maintenance of desirable grass cover on our permanent pastures and ranges depends upon a number of </seg>
         <seg id="p242">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE factors. In most of these, controlled grazing is involved. It is essential that grass not be grazed too early In the spring. When it first begins to grow In the spring, it draws its substance from food reserves stored in the roots in the preceding growing season. If this early growth is grazed off before the leaves have had an opportunity to function in their capacity as food manufacturers, the plant finds itself with its stored reserves largely gone and with no machinery with which to manufacture Its food requirements. It finds Itself weakened' at the very beginning of the season. Another important factor In the main - tenance of a productive grass cover is the avoidance of overgrazing. Usually early grazing is associated with over grazing. Overgrazing results in the plant being kept down so that over a long period it has no opportunity to replenish its food reserves. As a result it be - comes weakened. Some of It is destroyed and its place taken by less palatable and less desirable grasses and by Weeds. This institutes a vicious circle as the replacement of palatable plants by unpalatable ones results in greater and greater overgrazing of the palatable species until in time the value of the range is greatly depressed and valuable species may almost or entirely disappear. In guarding against overgrazing, the even distribution of grazing is essential, for reasons which are obvious. Its importance is often ignored. The optimum distribution of grazing cannot always be obtained because of differences in topography or accessibility of the range and sometimes because of differences in the palatability of the grasses on different parts of the range. Proper fencing, proper location of watering places, and the proper salting of grazing animals are Important helps in securing even distribution of grazing. As is true of most factors under discussion, it is often easier to agree on de - sirable principles than it is to apply them. Profitable investment in additional fencing and watering places as aids to grazing control de - pends on the value of the range made available by them. Permitting Native Grasses to Seed The manufacture of a proper stand of grass in the case of the species which propogate largely by seed depends upon the ability ot the grass to reseed itself. This necessitates the attainment of seed maturity at least at intervals. This may be secured by the practice of conserving grazing so that a good percentage (perhaps 25 per cent) of the desirable species can attain seed maturity each year, or by the practice known as deferred and rotation grazing, in which a different unit of the range is reserved for grazing each year until after the plants have matured seed. This rotation involves the use of from three to five pastures. Rotation grazing may be handled so that it also permits the grasses in at least some of the units to make satis - factory growth before being pastured in the spring. </seg>
         <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION The most seriously depleted pasture areas In this state are in the general and mixed farming areas and not in the area of eleven and one - half million acres of strictly range country where 80 per cent of the land is in pasture and more than 18 per cent in native hay. In these areas of badly damaged pastures, temporary pastures may toften be used to permit deferring spring.grazing on the permanent pastures until the grass has made satisfactory growth, and to supplement them until their original carrying capacity has been restored byproper graz - ing control which is at present the only practical method of restoration. SOME BASIC FACTS IN SOIL AND MOISTURE CONSERVATION By CM. WOODRUFF, Supt. Soil Conservation Experiment Station, ;i Bethany, Missouri . History and Development of the Erosion Experiment Station Soil conservation as we understand it today has developed through long years of research and study by our state and federal Agricultural Experiment Stations. Prior to 1928 soil conservation was considered largely in the light of fertility maintenance. The need for replenish - ing the soil organic matter, the calcium, the phosphorus, and the potash which were lost through the decomposition of organic matter, through leaching by percolating rain water, and through removal by growing crops, was known to be essential for maintaining the productivity of our cultivated soils. However, very little information was available for indicating the tremendous losses of soil fertility that were occurring every year through the agency of erosion. Many of our leaders In the study of soils realized that erosion was important but the difficulty of setting up costly equipment for measuring the rate at which it was occurring on our cultivated fields prevented the development of this .phase of soil conservation. However a few of our State Experiment Stations were able to make same preliminary studies, the results ot which were so surprising that the Federal Government, in 1928 and 1929, appropriated a sum of money for setting up Erosion Experiment Stations to measure the erosion that was occurring from our farm lands and to develop methods of controlling it. Twelve Experiment Stations were started during the period 1929 to 1931. These were dis - tributed throughtout the United States to meet the needs of the various major problem areas. The climatic and soil conditions of the state of Nebraska are represented by the dry land Erosion Experiment Station at Fort Hays, Kansas; the Bethany Erosion Experiment Station at Bethany, Missouri on the glacial till which gives rise to the Shelby loam and related soils, and the Clarinda Erosion Experiment Station at ¦Clarinda, lowa on the Loessial soils of the Missouri River Valley.

The Effects of Erosion In 1934 a survey of the extent and degree of erosion in the states of agricultural importance was completed. Sheet erosion and gullying were found to be serious on the rolling uplands throughout the United States. Gullying is readily apparent to the farmer. Gullies not only are waste land, but they also introduce obstructions in the field which prevent efficient use of farm machinery on the remaining tillable land. However, study indicates that one of the most serious results of gully- PRODUCTIVE SOIL 7171717^700m^ t&amp;£f__^??jj_&amp;&gt;&amp;_7__*££*A_^ t 'infipM&amp;i SfileH b ' 'J»^sQPfcfcj_jL • j_2*j_^£?£\&gt;_om *___*. ¦^•^^C3_'^Hn^'^P^vl_________________v4B j, ; Virgin Eroded : the Avir Pgi . ._[_"'' °' "'" Pr°f,'C °' S',C"&gt;y ]°am from an eroded field as compared to </seg>

         <seg id="p246">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ing is an increased degree of slope which accelerates the rate of sheet erosion. Sheet erosion is not as apparent as gully erosion. Even when evident following a torrential rain we had no way of estimating the amount of soil that was carried from the fields into the streams. Sheet erosion becomes apparent only after long years of cultivation when the yellow subsoil begins to be plowed to the surface and crop yields begin to decline. In figure 13 we have a photograph of two profiles of the Shelby loam taken from adjacent fields. The profile to the left shows the soil as it now exists under native blue stem and bluegrass. This field has never been plowed. The profile to the righ shows the condition of the soil after 4 0 years of cropping. The composition of the different horizons of the normal Shelby loam as given shows an accumulation of nitrogen In the surface horizon and a leaching of lime to the lower hofzon. The loss of the top soil brings about a reduction in the yields and quality of the crops and an increase in runoff and erosion. This may be partially offset by the use of phosphate fertilizer and lime where soils respond to these elements. Table 1 shows five years' data on crop yields, runoff and erosion from the Shelby loam for normal soil, eroded soil and eroded soil with lime and phosphate. Table 2 shows the effect of erosion on the quality of corn expressed by the average weight of the ears. Table 2 Effect of Erosion on Quality of Corn Subsoil Soil Treatment Yield Average wt.

         <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION The Basic Factors Affecting Runoff and Erosion On the Erosion Experiment Stations, equipment has been installed ifor measuring the runoff and erosion from plots and fields from 0.01 acre to 8 acres in size. The basic factors affecting erosion are being studied so that we can develop practical methods for controlling ero - sion. Some of the more important factors include: the kind of soil, the kind of crops grown, the length and degree of slope, the direction rof cultivating the soil, and the use of plant residues, manure, etc. Table 3 shows the effect of different'soils on runoff and erosion.

Although, the rainfall was slightly less on the Marshall soil the difference is not great enough to account for the wide difference in runoff. Runoff from the Shelby soil did not carry as much soil ai did an equal volume of runoff from the Marshall soil, but the higher percentage of runoff resulted in a greater total soil loss. -. The cause of this difference is explained by Musgrave (Journal of American Society of Agronomy, Vol. 27, No. 5, May, 1935) on the basis of the difference in the infiltration rate on the two soils. Figure 14. Because of the differences which exist in these two soils it is neces - sary to use different! methods of erosion control; One of the most important factors affecting runoff and erosion has been found to be that of cover. Table 4 presents the runoff and erosion from some of the methods of cropping which are .'commonly practiced in the midwest. Erosion has been expressed as the number of years required to lose the plow depth or top seven inches of soil. </seg>

         <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ' erosion is negligible. The value of a rotation in reducing erosion is due to the fact that corn following meadow Is less erosive than corn following corn rather than to the fact that the acreage of corn is reduced. Five years results show an average annual loss of 68.8 tons of soil per acre from corn following corn as compared to 21.9 tons of soil per acre from corn following meadow. . The increased rate of gully, erosion which is occurring on our intensively cropped lands is explained by the increased amount of water which the drainageways must carry. With the land in corn, from one-fourth to one-third of the rain that falls has been lost as runoff. For the three year rotation of corn, wheat and clover, wheat lost one-half this amount while the sod crops, alfalfa and bluegrass, lost approximately one-fourth the amount lost from corn. Factors Which Influence Erosion The burning of stubble land, and corn stubble is a Common prac - tice in the midwest. We have not made a thorough study of this prac - tice but have obtained some preliminary data. In the spring of, 1934 two plots which were in corn the preceding year were drilled to oats. On one plot the corn stalks were removed while on the other plot the corn stalks were disced into the surface prior to drilling the oats. A rain of 3.75 inches occurred before the bats became established. Where the corn stalks had been removed the soil loss totaled 8.1 tons per acre. Where the stalks were disced into the surface the soil loss totaled 3.4 tons per acre. ! Effect of Direction of Cultivation On the Red Plain Erosion Experiment Station at Guthrie, Okla - homa, three years' data from cultivated land in cotton show a higher runoff and two and one-half times more soil loss from land cultivated up and down the slope than from land cultivated on the contour. Effect of length of slope—Length of slope has been found an im - portant factor contributing to erosion. Two years data from corn plots on a slope of 10 per cent are available for these lengths of slope, 90, 180 and 270 feet. The data have been presented in table 5 to show the runoff and erosion for each 90 foot section of the 270 foot plot. </seg>

These studies also pro - vide a limited amount of data on the comparative efficiency of the different methods. The extension agronomists and engineers in the State Agricultural Experiment Stations now have access to information on the crops and cropping systems and proper grades, spacing and cross sections for terraces that are adapted to use on the different soils and slopes in parts of the United States. However, very little is known of the relative effectiveness of the different methods as they are applied in the field. The erosion experiment stations have not been in operation long enough to provide absolute data on the subject. Some data are available, however, which indicates trends that are reasonably correct. Except as noted, the results for terracing and strip cropping have been obtained while using soil treatments, contour operations and plant residues In line with the results reported for the basic factors affecting erosion. Five years' results from the control plots (C ft. x 72.6 ft. on an 8 per cent slope) indicate that a rotation of corn, wheat, and clover with timothy will reduce the runoff and erosion from continuous corn 46. per cent and S3, per cent, respectively. Results from the field studies on terraced and unterraced land Indicate that for a rotation of corn, oats and clover with timothy where the crops are planted with the field borders and no attempt is made to control hillside gullies on the unterraced areas, erosion has been several times greater than from terraced land.

Both fields in this instance are cropped to a system of corn, oats, wheat, and Clover with timothy. On land which has been strip cropped using a system of corn, soy - abeans, wheat and clover with ;ti mothy, two years' data show erosion to be approximately twice that from a similar area which is terraced. These facts have been combined in their various relations to show the value of each practice in relation to continuous cropping to corn with no erosion control (figure 15). 1 Terracing has been found to be one of the most effective means of controlling erosion in the Shelby loam related soil type when used in JV W , 15- COMPARATIVE ERCSIbI.

The moisture be - low this point which may be extracted by over drying is called hydroscopic and non-available to plants. Optimum conditions for plant growth are supplied by a soil moisture content near the field carrying capacity in the zone of the root growth. Growth is not noticeably impaired by reduction of moisture until the moisture content begins to approach the minimum point. The first signs of distress are wilting or curling of leaves during the time of day when transperation is greatest. Revival.takes place at night, but growth becames slower as the minimum point is approached, and de - terioration becomes permanent when the minimum point line Is reached or crossed over. The years are very rare indeed in Nebraska when crop yields over considerable areas are not seriously reduced by a too near approach to the danger line or the crops destroyed entirely by being carried over it. A large number of Nebraska farmers, are therefore Interested in farm practices that will make available for crop use the greatest pos - sible proportion of the moisture supply, and in crops that will make the greatest possible use of that supply. Water Requirements of Crops About 20 to 25 years ago, Kiesselbach working at the Nebraska Experiment Station, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Brlggs and Shantz work - ing. at the U, S. Dry Land Field Station at Akron, Colorado, made ex - haustive studies of the water requirements of crops. These studies under controled conditions where losses other than by plant transpira - tion were excluded, showed that the actual water requirements of crops are not high. Kisselbach showed that the plant needs of a 50 - -bushel crop of corn are only''a little over 9 inches of water or only about one-third of the average precipitation at Lincoln. (Nebr. Research Bui. No. 6). He showed also that the plant needs change greatly, under varying atmospheric conditions, and for different stages of de - velopment, and that if the moisture supply is inadequate to supply the peak needs on hot days and when the plants have reached maximum growth, injury will result that no later amount of moisture will correct. Fully half of the total amount used was shown to be transpired during the four or five weeks following the point at which the plants had attained maximum growth. With a total transpiration of 9 inches, 4% inches are needed for this short period that is frequently the hottest and dryest of the summer. It Is exceptional for the rainfall for this perlodto be sufficient to supply t"he crop need. Cole and Mathews studying the use of water by spring wheat, at </seg>
         <seg id="p254">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the dryland stations, determined the total water used under field con - ditions. (U. S. D. A. Bui. 1004) The amounts of soil moisture lost during certain periods were added to the rainfall for the periods, and the total was charged to crop use. By this method, it was shown that a spring wheat crop during the period of maximum growth, that is for a period of about 30 days after jointing, used about .20 inch of water per day at North Platte. At this rate, 6 inches of water would be required to sustain normal growth for a 30-day period. This is about double the normal rainfall for the highest 30-day period of the summer. It is apparent from these two series of investigations including both corn and wheat that the amount of water stored in the soil at the beginning of the period of most rapid use is highly important. Barring the possibilities of irrigation, crops must depend for their moisture supply upon the rainfall of the growing season plus the amount of available water in the soil at the beginning of the period. When the water requirement of a crop for its period of maximum need exceeds the normal rainfall for that period and no soil moisture reserves are present, the odds against a normal yield are very great. Without a reserve of water in the soil, it is obvious that a normal yield can only result from above normal rainfall, and with normal or below normal rain, reduced yields or failures are inevitable. Crop Adaptations Crop adaptations play an important role in water economy. As previously mentioned, Kisselhach demonstrated that corn has a low water require, ent. Briggs and .Sliants in comparing many crops showed that wheat has a higher water requirement per unit of dry matter produced than corn, sorghum, or millet, and a somewhat lower water requirement than oats, barley, or rye. (Journal of Agr. Research Vol. 11l No. 1) In spite of its higher water requirement, however, wheat and especially winter wheat, outranks corn as a dry - land crop. This is due to its deep rooting habit which enables it to use water from a greater storage area than any other annua] crop, to its ability to use a larger proportion of the water stored in the area actually occupied by its roots than can be used by corn and many other crops, and to its early maturity which permits its maximum growth and highest water requirement to precede the season of highest summer temperatures. Winter wheat is therefore the crop that has shown the greatest re - sponse to tillage practices designed to increase the storage of moisture in the soil. The sorghums on the other hand have gained prominence as dry farm crops not because they escape hot weather but because ot an unusual ability to become dormant, retain life through a long period with available water at a low level, and resume growth if and </seg>

Sorghum gains by playing a waiting game. ¦¦¦¦'.'..- Tillage, Soil Moisture and Winter Wheat Yields Numerous bulletins and articles showing the response of winter wheat to tillage and soil moisture-have been published. Work in Ne - braska and Kansas shows for certain areas increased yields of winter wheat from early after harvest tillage where wheat follows wheat or other small grain. At Lincoln for an 11-year period, early tillage in - creased yields 8.9 bushels per acre over late tillage. (Nebr. Bui. 286) At North Platte the; increase for a 20-year period was 5.7 bushels (Nebr. Bui. 279). At Manhattan, Kansas, the Increase for a 11-year period was 9.7 bushels (Ks. Tec. Bui. 18). At Hays the Increase for a 23-year period was 7.1 bushels (Kansas Bui. 273). The period between harvest and winter wheat seeding is a time of relatively heavy rainfall. It Is also a period of high temperatures arid high evaporation.- Losses of moisture from rapid surface evaporation, particularly when rain falls in light showers, are heavy and unavoid - able. At Hays, TlCansas, the average July, August, and September rain - fall is nearly 8 inches, but the average available moisture stored by the best methods of Ullage during this period was only 3 inches. (Kansas Bui. 273). At North Platte with an average rainfall of 6 inches for a shorter storage period,-less than 2 inches average available moisture was stored by early plowing.' Evaporation decreases rapidly with depth and soil moisture that has penetrated below the surface six inches Is comparatively little affected by evaporation losses. Below the first foot soils will remain for long periods with a water content near the field carrying capacity, unless occupied by the roots of grow - ing plants. The benefits of early tillage are almost wholly due to the destruction of weeds and volunteer grain. For early tillage to be effective in storing moisture, then it is necessary, first, that there be a sufficient amount of rain for some of it to penetrate below the sur - face far enough to exCape loss by evaporation, and, second, that weeds or volunteer grain that would develop in the absence of tillage and re - move the water from the lower depths are kept from growing on the land. • Advantage of Enrly Tillage At both Hays and.North Platte, although the proportion of rain - fall stored by early tillage is not high, it is practically double the amount stored in land plowed late, that is, shortly before seeding. At Colby, Kansas, which Is 135 miles north-west of Hays and 125 south of North Platte, usually no benefits have been derived from early tillage. At this point the season between harvest and winter wheat seeding time is shorter than at Hays, the rainfall is less, and stubble fields are freer of weeds. Somewhere west of Hays and somewhere </seg>
         <seg id="p256">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE aouth of North Platte before Colby is reached from either direction, the benefits of early tillage disappear. Where the change takes place Is not known. It Is of course a transition zone, rather than a well de - fined line, and is subject to seasonal variations, soil fertility, and various other factors. It is doubtless safe to say, however, that early tillage can be expected to be beneficial where stubble fields would normally become weedy after harvest and not beneficial where the stubble fields remain free of weeds. It should be kept in mind that the benefits of early tillage may not be wholly due to the increased moisture supply. Early tillage for weed control and favorable moisture conditions create conditions for Increased nitrification. The encouragement of nitrification is relatively of more importance in old soils of low fertility than in newer soils of high fertility. In the latter soils, excessive nitrates may develop and become detrimental. High nitrate supplies may overstimulate growth and increase the total water requirement, so that there, is greater risk of soil moisture depletion before the crop has completed growth. Where early tillage does not produce results and where crop acre - ages cannot be profitably adjusted so that wheat follows a crop that leaves a larger residue of moisture in the soil than is left by the small grains, the tillage method that remains is fallow or summer tillage. Clean summer tillage has seldom failed at Hays, Colby, or North Platte to store a generous supply of available moisture in the soil zone occupied by the roots of annual crops. The average available water in the G-foot soil zone of fallowed land at winter wheat seeding time at Hays was 7.9 6 inches for a 23-year period. For 19 seasons the amount was 5.16 inches at Colby, and 6.62 inches for 20 seasons at North Platte. Fallow Reduces Failures Fallowing did not always insure yields, but greatly reduced the fre - quency of failure. At Hays one crop was destroyed by hail and three yields of 10 bushels or less were obtained. The highest yield was 51 bushels and the 23-year average was 27.3 bushels. The increase over early tilled land cropped annually, was 8.5 bushels or 45 per cent. (Kansas Bui. 273). At Colby there were two complete failures on fallow, and yields in four additional years were below 10 bushels. The highest yield was 43 bushels, and the 19-year average was 18.S bushels. The increase over land annually cropped to wheat was 9.7 bushels or 107 per cent. At North Platte there were two complete failures on fallow, and yields below 10 bushels occurred in two other years. The maximum yield was 60 bushels, and the 23-year average was 26.3 bushels. The increase over early plowed land continuously cropped to wheat was 9.4 bushels or 56 per cent. In seasons of high rainfall, yields on fallow at Hays and North Platte were lowered by excessive straw growth and lodging. That is, the yields were reduced not by </seg>
         <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION unfavorable but by too favorable moisture and nitrate conditions. At Colby and North Platte some of the failures and low yields on fallow were due to winterkilling or to unfavorable moisture conditions In the upper soil at seeding time, even though there was a supply of available moisture in the subsoil. Apparently the area where fallowing for winter wheat can be most profitably, employed begins about where the benefits from early plowing cease, and lies beyond the areas where fallowing produces an excessive straw growth that too frequently lodges. Correlations Between Soil Moisture and Yields of Winter Wheat In this discussion, we have already made several references to- Kansas Bui. 273. The authors of this bulletin, A. L. Hallsted and O. R. Mathews of the Division of Dry Land Agriculture, U. S. Department of Agriculture, have not only made a valuable contribution to the fundamental knowledge of the relationships of soil moisture and winter wheat yields, but have also developed simplified methods of estimating soil moisture, and relating the results to farm practices. The determination of the exact amount of moisture present in any soil is a somewhat involved process. It requires field and laboratory equipment and numerous painstaking and time-consuming steps to complete, Hallsted and Mathews, using results from three Kansas dry-land cooperative stations, show that depth of penetration of moisture is under certain conditions, a good index of the amount of available water present. Depth of penetration is easily observed when moisture stor - age is taking place iii a soil that has become thoroughly dry. This is the usual condition at harvest time on most small grain fields west of the,9Bth Meridian. Water in penetrating a soil advances to lower levels only as each section through which it passes reaches its field carrying capacity. The line between wet and dry soil is well defined and easily observed. When the soil is not occupied by the roots of growing plants, the sections above the line of moisture advance remain at nearly field carrying capacity, except for evaporation losses near the surface and slow vaporization losses that extend further down. In converting soil moisture percentages into terms ot depth of stor - age, Hallsted and Mathews designated each foot section as wet that contained 3 per cent or more of available moisture. Yields were then tabulated to show the number and percentages of yields of different classes from seedings made in dry soil, In soil wet 1 foot, in soil wet 2 feet, and in soil wet 3 feet or more In depth. Separate results were first given for each station and finally the results for all stations were combined In a summary table. 9 ¦ ...•'¦"¦: </seg>

They show also that a good supply of moisture at seeding time greatly Increases the chances of producing profitable yields. The Kansas Bulletin contains well supported . suggestions on abandonment of winter wheat. The authors show that on dry soil, the first year's yield, plus the yield on early plowing the following year, was less than would have been produced by not seeding the first year, but by fallowing instead and raising one crop on fallow. Obviously the best time for abandoning the crop that would be seeded in dry soil was before it was seeded. At North Platte, results are similar but not so clear cut as at the Kansas stations. In 14 comparisons, the yields would have been improved 8 times by not seeding, fallowing, and raising one crop on fallow, and In 6 cases more wheat would have been produced by leaving the crop and adding the yield from early plowing the following year.

'Agronomist, Division ot Cereal Crops and Diseases, Bureau ot Plant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Department of Agronomy, Ne - braska Agricultural Experiment Station, Lincoln. In the United States in 1934 more than 200 distinct varieties of wheat were raised on farms, while in Nebraska in the same year 24 of these varieties were grown. With such a large number available it would seem that it should be possible to choose one superior for almost any use or condition, especially when it is known that these varieties cover a wide range of types. It is possible to obtain one that will do fairly well under a given set of conditions, but almost all available varieties have flaws or weaknesses that may be uncovered rather unexpectedly and limit their adaptation. Because of this the plant breeders at the State agricultural experiment stations and the United States Department of Agriculture are working to produce better va - rieties. Their idea is not to increase the number now being grown but to give the farmers better ones, which in the end should lead to fewer varieties. The situation in crops such as oats and barley is much the same as •outlined for wheat. Possibly there are fewer varieties in these other small grains, but the need of, and demand for, Improvement is just as great as in the case of wheat. At most agricultural experiment sta - tions the plant breeders work not only on wheat, hut also on oats, barley, and rye provided that these crops are of importance in the state. The breeding and testing of new strains of small grains in a long - time job at best. . It is impossible to turn out these varieties in yearly models as automobile manufacturers turn out cars. Probably it is fortunate that this is the case or our fields might be as crowded with varieties as our highways are crowded with cars, and so cause endless trouble for the trade. Not only must the new variety be produced but it must be thoroughly tested for a reasonable number ot years to de - termine its value. The good one must produce well under a wide Variety of conditions, the wider the better. . It is the purpose of this discussion to describe some ot the methods used in the breeding and testing of new strains of small grain; For the most part wheat will be used as the example but the methods are the same for other small grains.

New Introductions The first, and possibly the easiest, way of obtaining a new strain is to introduce it. This is easy, provided that the desired type can be found elsewhere. The Introduction may come from a neighboring state or from a foreign country. After having been obtained, the va - riety must, of course, be carefully tested In the environment where - it Is to be distributed. Too often varieties are introduced by private sources, accompanied by a flood of advertising containing exaggerated statements as to the value. The most outstanding example of an introduction is Turkey winter wheat brought into Nebraska and Kansas from Russia about 1873. The variety was found to be much better adapted to the area than the soft wheats then being grown. A variety may also be introduced into the state from another state, as Kanred was brought into Nebraska from Kansas. At present there is a free exchange of new strains be - tween states and when Nebraska or some other state releases a new variety its adaptation in surrounding states has been determined fairly well. The United States Department ot Agriculture Is searching the world for new small grains and large numbers of strains of various crops are being introduced and tested. In return much of our material is sent to foreign countries for trial. In more recent years very few new varieties of real commercial value have been introduced from foreign sources, although with much breeding work being done in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics something valuable may be found. Some 7 wheats from Australia have proved valuable in Washington, Oregon, ! and California. Selection for Improvement j The second method of improvement Is to select the desired type from a mixture or a commercial variety. The procedure is to select a large number of heads, each from a different promising appearing plant. These heads are then threshed Individually and any with undesirable seed type discarded. The remaining are seeded in short rows, the seed from each head being put into an individual row. These rows are then watched and studied from the time they come up until they are - ready to harvest and any showing undesirable characteristics or weak - nesses are discarded. Those remaining are harvested, the grain is again studied, and the better ones reseeded, this time in longer rows. The process of elimination is continued for two or three years, after i which time the remaining selections are put into nursery yield trials, and later into larger field plots. Some years later one or two will be- </seg>
         <seg id="p263">Nebraska crop growers' Association •entered in cooperative farm tests over the state and after 10 to 15 years an improved variety may be ready for increase and commercial growing. Some outstanding examples of varieties of winter wheat developed by selection are Nebraska No. 60, Cheyenne, Kanred, and Blackhull. The first three are results of planned programs of selection, that is, the selections were made and the progeny studied with some definite .goal in mind, while Blaokhull was selected because the original heads looked different as they stood in the field. Hybridization The third method of improvement is by hybridization followed by ¦selection. This method Is a little more complicated than either of the first two but offers much promise and is being used extensively at present. The first step in this method is to consider carefully the type of improvement or variety needed. A survey is then made to determine where the desired characteristics may be found, and after the parents are selected the cross is made. Making a wheat cross is not exactly easy and it is even more dif - ficult in the case of oats or barley. As in all grasses, each floret or flower of wheat has a stigma, style, and ovary, making up the female, ¦and three pollen-bearing anthers making up the male part of the flower. Under normal conditions the pollen ripens, the anthers break and the pollen is scattered on the stigma before the wheat flower opens, thus causing self-fertilization. In crossing, this self-fertilization must be prevented. : - The head to be used as the female parent is selected and all but about 12 to 16 of the flowers cut off. From each of these remaining flowers the'three anthers must be removed before they turn yellow, indicating that the pollen is ripe. A small pair of tweezers is used in this work. After all anthers are removed, and the job must be done perfectly, the head Is Covered with a small paper or glassine bag to keep out stray pollen. After 2to 5 days, depending upon the weather, the stigma, style, and ovary will have matured enough to be ready for the pollen. Anthers containing ripe pollen are taken from heads of the male parent and placed on the stigmas of the emasculated flowers of the female parent. In this operation the anthers usually break scattering pollen over the feat. ery-Uke stigmas. Pollen must be dusted into each flower, and in each should develop one seed. Thus it will be seen that for each crossed seed the flower will have been -entered twice, and a seed set of 50 per cent is considered good. Now how will these crossed seeds behave when planted? The plants resulting from the seeds of a certain cross will all look alike. They may look like either parent or they may have characteristics of </seg>
         <seg id="p264">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE both the parents. These plants are designated as the F x or first gen - eration following the cross. The seed from these F, plants gives the F, or second or segregating - generatlon and here all possible types should occur. Some plants will look like one parent, some like the other parent, and the rest will rep - resent various types between the two parents. If sufficient numbers are grown some plants of the desired type will be found; these will be saved', and short rows seeded from each plant. These rows probably will not breed true but selection will have to be continued for two or three more generations until the desired true breeding type is obtained. Determining Factors of Inheritance The segregation or breaking up in the F, follows well defined laws, of genetics or Inheritance. All characters of the plant are the result of the action of genes or factors, carried within the germ cells of the plant. Under different environments the genes may react differently. These genes or factors sort out in all possible combinations in the F, according to chance. Some characters are dependent on more than one factor, the more factors Involved the less frequently will the char - acter appear in a pure form. To Illustrate this method, the steps taken in producing a stem rust - resistant Cheyenne wheat will be described. After careful study it was. decided that the best parent to provide the desired rust resistance would be Hope spring wheat, which is highly resistant. The first difficulty encountered was the growing of a winter and a spring wheat side by side and having them in head at the same time in order to make the cross. To do this it was necessary to use a greenhouse and with the proper manipulation of temperature and light the two parents were brought into head at the same time. The F, generation had to be grown with care since it was intermediate between a winter and a spring wheat; In other words, real cold weather would have killed the plants and if spring seeded they probably would have headed so - late as to have been ruined by hot, dry weather. Again it was neces - sary to use the greenhouse, or Bend the seed to a less severe climate. Breeding Problems The segregating generation or F 2 was seeded outdoors since here selection was started. As the cross involved a winter and a spring - wheat it was known that about 1 plant in 16 could be expected to be a true winter, so the winter weather would eliminate about 15/16. of the plants and this is what happened. The problem was to produce a rust-resistant wheat, so this character had to be considered also. It was known that not more than one homozgouß of true-to-type stem - rust resistant plant could be expected In 16 individuals. So of the 1/16 - -not eliminated by winter only 1/16 could be expected to remain clean </seg>
         <seg id="p265">. NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS* ASSOCIATION ¦under a heavy epidemic of stem rust, or out of each 256 F, plants only one stem-rust resistant, winter-type plant could be expected; thus it was necessary to grow a large F a population in order to have a suf - ficient number of desirable plants left. Since the winters are not always real cold or the rust epidemic heavy there are always "escapes" or susceptible plants that look like the desired type and these can be detected only by further testing. After selecting the material through several generations a number of lines have been obtained that are known to be winter types resistant to rust. Now these strains must be thoroughly tested for other characters such as earliness, straw strength, shattering, yield, and grain quality. Many of the lines will be found lacking in one or more of these characters and will be dis - carded. Thus it is seen that even in a relatively simple cross large numbers must be used in order to give an adequate opportunity for selection. _ It often happens that it is impossible to build up the desired type by a single cross, and in this case the new cross must be again crossed with some other wheat and the whole process repeated. Another variation of the hybrid method is to make the desired cross and then grow the plants In bulk for at least 5 generations, after which selec - tions are made. This method is most successful when nature eliminates the undesirable type as would be the case with winter-killing and stinking smut or bunt. An advantage of the method is that it re - quires less labor and many more combinations can be grown, thus the Plant breeder avoids putting all bis eggs into one basket, and if one combination fails to give the desired type other material is available. Crossing has been used with much success and some good varieties have been produced in this way. For example, Marquis spring wheat was the result of a cross and this variety is an outstanding monument to the method. Other examples outstanding are Ceres spring and Ten - marq winter wheat. : Characteristics Desired So far the description has had to do only with methods of producing new varieties. Now how are they produced to fit your needs' To do this the plant breeder must first have a knowledge of the conditions under which the varieties are deficient' He obtains this information by personal Inspection, Interviews with farmers, and from extension men and county agents., With this information at hand plans may be made to carry out the work. What are some of the characteristics a good variety should have? A good winter wheat must be winter hardy, it should be sufficiently ear y to escape hot winds, yet not too early so as to lack yielding ability. It should have a stiff straw, erect, non-shattering head and be resistant to diseases common to the region. It must have the </seg>
         <seg id="p266">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ability to produce a good yield of grain with a high test weight and of acceptable quality to meet the demands of the trade. In the case - of spring wheat all of the characteristics mentioned above are desirable - except winter-hardiness. In the case of oats and barley the varieties, must not be too late or too early, have straw strong enough to hold up the heads, be resistant to smuts and rust, and have the ability to give a good yield. The grain must be of such quality as to meet the de - mands of the trade if the grain Is sold. The question of quality i_ most Important in the case of wheat. Testing Varieties The problem of testing the new productions is an important one for several reasons. In the first place, the laboratory is the field, as it should be, and no two years are exactly alike. One year winter injury may be severe, the next may be dry, another may be wet with a heavy rust epidemic, while in still another year Hession fly may cause severe damage. To develop a variety resistant to these hazards is a long job and to prove the resistance is an additional problem. The work of testing is made more difficult since the hazards are not present each year and may appear only once or twice in ten years, usually at the most unexpected times, and rarely when planned for. In the testing work in Nebraska the seasons are, of course, taken as they come and the varieties studied for their reaction to the particular conditions. Thus, over a period of years the strains will have been observed under a fairly representative sample of weather and condi - tions, v takes only one year to prove that a variety is susceptible to a disease or reacts poorly under certain conditions of environment, but it may take several years to prove that the strain is really superior. Because of the importance of grain quality, especially in wheat, milling and baking studies are started as soon as sufficient seed of he various strains is available. In this work all strains that are nfenor are discarded. Great care is taken to keep these tests in line with commercial practice so that the approved varieties will not be objectionable to the trade. It is very desirable to obtain samples of a variety rom more than one sonrce as the reaction may vary some - what from place to place. ' For the most part, the trade desires a constant supply of the same var ety of wheat, and in the past has not always been Lvorable^o new varieties. The reason for this is that varieties are not all alike and a onT Tib 0137 77" ' B"ght,y diff6rent treatment thaa d°es the old one If he miller does not know that he Is getting something different discouCng SBme manDer SS the °'d Vari6ty th 6 reSUItS ™* »* </seg>
         <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The policy at the present time is to find out as much about the ¦quality of the variety as is possible. If good bread can be made from the strain by methods available in the bake shop, the variety is con - sidered acceptable for quality even though it may be slightly different from the variety being grown. At the time the new variety is released all Information as to how it should be treated in the mill or bake shop is made available so that the trade will not be caught unprepared. Quality tests are now being made on barleys to test their malting properties, for it is known that varieties vary in this respect. Since -very little, if any, malting barley is.raised in Nebraska this has little interest here. Cooperative Testing In recent years all agencies interested in crop improvement have teen working together more closely to the mutual advantage of all con - cerned. By distributing seed to other stations it is now possible to Save a single strain; tested under 20 to 30 different conditions the same year, thus giving much more information in a single year than might be obtained in several years at a single station. For example, at College Station, Texas, stem rust is always a factor, so it is possible to send selections to this station and be almost certain of obtaining a reading on rust reaction. At Bbzeman, Mont., conditions are ideal for the development of bunt or stinking smut and strains may be tested there so as to select the resistant ones. Likewise at Moccasin, Mont., and Dickinson, N. Dak., winter-killing is usually a factor and strains sent to these stations are soon sorted for resistance to cold. In each case the condition is usually more severe than would be "expected to occur In Nebraska so that a strain surviving should be safe to use. Testing Under Controlled Conditions In addition to the practice of sending material to other stations for testing in the field, controlled equipment is also available for the work. For example at Lincoln, Nebr., St. Paul, Minn., and Manhat - tan, Kans., freezing equipment is available for selecting varieties -re - sistant to low temperatures. At Manhattan, Kans., equipment has been developed to test the reaction of varieties to heat and drought. At other stations various other conditions are produced by controlled equipment. Thus, instead of waiting for the hazard to come to Ne - braska at some unexpected time, the material.is taken to the hazard and thus it is possible to know much more about the strain in a much shorter time. With these more efficient methods now available, it should be possible to produce better varieties in the future and when the variety is released a great deal more will he known about it than has been the case in the past. It must be made clear that the perfect variety will not be obtained all at once,.but step by step advancement is being made, always coining closer to the ideal. </seg>
         <seg id="p268">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE From this it will be seen that the variety that is finally put out to the one that has given the best average record. It may not be first n yield every year but It probably will be close to the top. It is realized that the grower is the plant breeder's severest critic, and he should be. When he grows a new variety he expects a great deal from it. How - ever, the plant breeder feels that it is a bit unfair for a grower to con - demn a variety too severely just because it was not quite up to par for one year. Possibly had some other variety been grown under the same conditions it would have been worse. It would be better to judge the variety after a longer test. The grower has a right to expect the best, and he will get the best available, but this best variety is not yet perfect. , ' \ Recommended Varieties It win probably be worth while to mention briefly the small grain varieties now available and recommended for growing in Nebraska. In other words, these are the varieties we have to offer you now While none of them is perfect it is felt that in each case the variety is good.

Cheyenne differs from Turkey in quality in that the dough requires a longer mixing time, but good bread can be made from it if he dough is handled properly. Due, in part at least, to its high yield the protein content is a little lower than for some other varieties. Cheyenne is susceptible to rust and smut but probably is no worse in these respects than most other Turkey wheats.

         <seg id="p270">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ALFALFAS OF YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW By H. M. TYSDAL, Let us travel back in history to the earliest knowledge we have of alfalfa. The term itself is of Arabian origin meaning "best fodder" and surely this alone is sufficient to give it a romantic setting. Its history lives up to its early tradition because from the very earliest records alfalfa, the queen of forage plants, has followed in the path of historic civilizations and conquering armies from East to West. Indeed its advent into the Americas can be traced to the Spanish con - quests of Cortez and Pizarro in the sixteenth century and it is said that when their conquests had run their course the natives had alfalfa in lieu of their gold. The successful introduction of alfalfa in the United States traces directly to the gold rush days of the lSso's when many prospectors came to California via the all-water route around "The Horn." Many of them stopped at Chilean ports en route and, curious to know how this new plant "alfalfa" would grow took some seed with them. But to retrace our steps somewhat it might be of interest to point out that botanists are pretty well agreed that the native home of al - falfa was in southwestern Asia, from Mesopotamia northward across Persia and Turkistan to Siberia. One of the earliest written records of alfalfa is a report by the gardener of the Babylonian King, Mardukbalidin, about 700 B. C, who states that it was then being grown on the palace grounds in the fertile valley of the Euphrates river. Pliny and Strabo, both early Roman writers, record that when the Medes and Persians invaded Greece'in 490 B. C. they introduced alfalfa into that country for the sustenance of their chariot horses, camels, and other domestic animals. This is believed to be the first Introduc - tion into Europe. During the next centuries it spread to other Euro - pean countries and finally to America. Early Records in United States In the United States, one of the earliest records of Its growth was that of General Washington having tried alfalfa at Mount Vernon in 1798 with some success and it is also recorded that Thomas Jefferson took considerable pride in his lucerne field which was in production prior to 1793. But it did not prove very successful in the eastern states probably due to general lack of well-drained limestone soils and also to lack of knowledge of the necessity of inoculating for nitro - -1 Associate Agronomist, Division oi Forage Crops and Diseases, B.

Alfalfa, however, really got its foothold in the United States on the western coast where it produced remarkably well from the first in the fertile, irrigated valleys of California, introduced, as indicated above, about 1851 from Chile. From here itisoon found its way to Utah where the Mormons found it extremely satisfactory. Thence to Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska. According to Bessey, one , • ' ...--'...

In the center is Grimm, a variety susceptible to the bacterial wilt disease which has reduced the stand to almost nothing, and on the right is Nebraska Common alfalfa, somewhat more resistant than Grimm, but still a poor stand. Plots planted August, 1930, photographed September, 1936. of the first to grow alfalfa in Nebraska was S. P. Baker, otjCurtis, who planted his field in 1879 and he got his seed direct from San Francisco. And so it is that most of our so-called Common alfalfa traces back to the early importations of Chilean alfalfa. At about this time many would-be growers of alfalfa planted the crop, but with indifferent success, often due to the tact that the avail - able types were not hardy enough for severe winters. It required the advent of another circumstance to pave the way to successful alfalfa, culture in northern latitudes. This had its beginning in 1857 when an emigrant brought about 15 pounds of alfalfa from his native home in Germany. He planted this alfalfa in Carver County, Minnesota, and year after year and generation after generation ot alfalfa he obtained seed from his fields. Finally his alfalfa fields were brought to the attention of Minnesota Experiment Station officials and they tested out. </seg>
         <seg id="p272">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTUUii this strain. They found it endured the winters remarkably well and from that time on northern growth of alfalfa was successful, provid - ing the grower obtained the proper seed. The name of the emigrant was Wendelin Grimm and the variety he originated is called Grimm. Thus at this early date it was found, often by biter experience, that no longer could a prospective grower just ask foi "alfalfa" seed—lie had to be sure of the kind of alfalfa seed he was getting. Some con - fusion arose because it was impossible to tell one variety from another by the seed, but fortunately this difficulty has been overcome by certifi - cation and verification services made available by State and Federal institutions. So much for the alfalfas of yesterday, what about those of today. Alfalfas of Today From the period 1905 to 1920 a considerable kmount of selection work was done with alfalfa resulting directly or indirectly in the pro - duction of new varieties or strains which are Commercially grown today. Among these may he mentioned the fol owing: Hardigan, Cossack, Baltic, Ladak, Canadian Variegated, and also Grimm should be included in this group. All of these are comparatively hardy variegated alfalfas. They are called •'variegated" because their blossoms vary in color from dark purple to whitl to yellow. Space does not permit detailed discussion of these varieties but it may be pointed out that all are susceptible to the bacterial wilt disease so common on the bottom or valley lands of Nebraska, with the excep - tion of Ladak which may be considered slightly resistant. They are all comparatively winter-hardy with the exception jof Canadian Varie - gated which is somewhat variable in this respect. Thus there is not much difference between them for growing on uUand in Nebraska where the wilt disease is not severe. Ladak is the latest of the varieties to gain prominence, especially in the northwest and it has proved to be one of the better producing varieties tested at this station. As distinct from the variegated group there are today a number of so-called Common alfalfas. As previously indicated they can be traced largely to the early importations of Chilean alfalfa, but due to cross - ing and natural selection they have changed a gieat deal, resulting in different types depending upon origin. Thus Northern Common today is much more cold resistant than Southern Common, and there are graduations between these two. Ordinarily ii is undesirable to obtain seed of Common alfalfa from an area much (farther south than the locality where you wish to grow it. Thus in Nebraska, Northern Commons, including Dakota Common, South Dakota No. 12, and Nebraska Common have proved similar in response under Nebraska conditions and yield about as well as Grimm. Thl Common alfalfas are again not resistant to bacterial wilt. I </seg>

The strain on the left is a cross between a wilt-resistant Turkistan selection and M. falcata. In the center is Grimm and to the right a cross between wilt-resistant selections from Turkistan and Ladak. All three had an equal number of plants when inoculated, but Grimm has been almost completely killed by the disease while the two resistant crosses maintain a stand. Wilt Resistant Strains More recently two new alfalfas have obtained considerable pub - licity because of their resistance to wilt. These are Turkistan and Hardistan, and also a Turkistan introduction named Kaw by the Kansas Experiment Station. Turkistan, as the name Indicates, is seed im - ported from that part of the U. S. S. R. called Turkistan in southwest - ern Asia. When the disease first made serious inroads on alfalfa growing, it was observed that fields sown to seed from Turkistan ap - peared to maintain a stand much longer than others, and it has sub - sequently developed that most seed from that country carries con - siderable resistance to the disease. Unfortunately this variety has some undesirable characteristics such as susceptibility to leaf spots, relatively lower yield of both forage and seed, and it is unadapted to large areas east of the Mississippi river. Another difficulty is that Turkißtan Is a very large country and seed from various areas differs In cold resistance. ' . </seg>

For example, there are at least fifty strains under test In our. greenhouse now which average twice as resistant to bacterial wilt as Hardistan; whereas approxi - mately 60 plants'out of every hundred of the Hardistan variety die when inoculated with the bacterial organism causing the disease, only approximately 20 to 30 out Of every hundred of these selections would die. Again from the standpoint of seed production some selections have been obtained which outyleld the original strains in all tests in which they have been included. Some of the strains have also main - tained high cold resistance, and probably also high forage yield, but this latter has not as yet been carefully tested. Plans are under way for such tests this year—if we can get some rain. Then there are such possibilities'as a sod forming alfalfa, similar to brome or other creep - ing rooted grasses. We have one strain of alfalfa picked up by Mr. Westover, a United States Department of Agriculture plant explorer, in a sandy, stony goat pasture of northern Turkey. The goats had grazed it so closely that there was no seed on this plant, but Mr. West - over dug up some of the roots, which after carrying around with him a long time he planted and produced plants from these roots. Finklly this' self-same plant arrived in our breeding stock in Nebraska, and by means of stem cuttings, we made 2700 plants from the original </seg>

         <seg id="p277">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'ASSOCIATION Thus there are a great many opportunities in the field of alfalfa breed - ing and improvement which have heretofore been hardly touched. It remains to make the proper combinations and then test these out. Steps have already been taken to assure thorough testing of these new strains before they are given to the grower, where they might give a black-eye to the plant breeder if they did not measure up. This test - ing is going to be done through a cooperative agency known as the Alfalfa Improvement Conference, and we have been assured by more than forty experiment station officials that they wish to have repre - sentative tests at their stations. This will give you some idea ot the Interest attached to the production Of some of these improved alfalfa strains of tomorrow. In conclusion I would like to sound a last minute warning to you who expect to buy alfalfa seed this spring. Recent advices from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics at Washington indicate a shortage of alfalfa seed production in the northern states for 1936, and a slightly increased production in the southern states. Also that Ar - gentina has a surplus of alfalfa seed which is being laid down in New York slightly below domestic prices. The stage is therefore set tor an influx of cheaper, unadapted southern or foreign seed into Ne - braska, but don't buy unadapted seed for your farm!

WEDNESDAY MORNING Dairy Barn MR. SUMNER BARNELL: s Dairymen and friends. lam very glad to see such a large number here this morning and feel sure that the subject that is going to be discussed by Dr. L. V. Skldmore, of the Animal Pathology Department, is very Important to our Nebraska dairymen. Dr. Skidmore is a well-known authority and at this time will discuss the subject of "Problems of Reproduction". He will be assisted by Mr. George Trlmberger, of the Dairy Husbandry Depart - ment. Dr. Skldmore. (The following is a brief abstract of the talk given by Dr. Skidmore.) SOME FACTORS INFLUENCING REPRODUCTION IN DAIRY CATTLE DR. L. V, SKIDMORE Modern dairy cattle are a product of civilization. Surprising things have happened to them. Today the trend in dairy husbandry is all in the direction of inten - sive production. The ultimate aim of the dairyman is the production of a profitable quantity and quality of milk—the calves In many in - stances' are a by-product. There is a real chalienge to the reproductive ability of dairy cattle to meet this demand. Disturbances in reproduc - tion are due t;o a multiplicity Of conditions. No one line of procedure is going to remedy all of these conditions. Such factors as heredity, lousing, diet, disease and disturbed physiological processes either in the male or female have a marked influence on reproduction. If the </seg>
         <seg id="p300">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE best results are to be secured in solving reproduction problems there Is need of cooperation of physiologists, nutrition experts, pathologists, clinicians, chemists and bacteriologists. There seems to be no end to the conditions which interfere with reproduction. For this reason interest in the subject is growing continually. This is evidenced by the great amount of work being carried on along this line in various parts of the world. Even with our vast amount of Information the subject continues to offer many perplexities. ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION IN DAIRY CATTLE GEO. W. TRIMBERGER Experiments concerning artificial insemination in dairy cattle have been successfully carried on, during the past two years, In the Uni - versity herd, and in several other herds located some distances from Lincoln. The semen was taken from the bulls at the Agricultural College and transported to the cattle in the herds where artificial breeding was carried on with very good results. This method of Impregnating cows is commonly referred to as "art. breeding" among the men at the dairy barn. Two methods can be used. One of them, the cow to cow method, is merely a 'transfer of semen from a cow served naturally by a bull, to another cow to be bred. The transfer is made by the use of an impregnator. The cow bred naturally has to be one whose breeding history indicates that she carries no infection in her reproductive tract. Unless the cows are under close observation In a clean herd there is too much chance of transferring disease from one cow to another by this method and it cannot be recommended very strongly. The other method consists of obtaining the semen from the bull by massage ot the bull's ampullae and its injection into the cow to be bred. This eliminates the bull serving the cow and unless the bull already carries an infection you take no risk of infecting either the bull or the cow. I shall try to describe in detail the procedure followed in obtaining the sample and then I shall try to demonstrate it to you. This technique was developed by Dr. F. W. Miller and Dr. E. I. Evans, Bureau of Dairy Industry, United States Department of Agriculture. It is rather easy to understand the procedure but it takes a great deal of skill and practice to actually obtain the spermatozoa. The first step is to clip the hair off of the sheath of the bull and cleansing it inside and outside by means of an irrigating tube and sterile water. The hand is then held to form a cone and gently in - serted in the bull's rectum. Entering about seven to ten inches, the seminal vesicles and the ampullae can be felt through the Intestinal wall on the lower part of the pelvis. The seminal vesicles are massaged </seg>
         <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION- '•-.-. with backward strokes and a slightly turbid fluid flows from the prepuce or sheath into the funnel and test tube. The vesicular fluid contains only epithelial cells and no spermatozoa. When the ampullae of the ductus deferens is massaged a turbid fluid'is obtained and this contains a great number of active spermatozoa. It is advisable to change test tubes in which the semen is collected rather frequently because a drop of urine will kill all the spermatozoa. Frequent changes results in only one tube with dead spermatozoa and the others are alive if any difficulty arises from this source; I shall now try to demonstrate this with the young bull you sea tied to the rail. I wish to call your attention to the harness this bult is wearing. The purpose of it Is to stop him masturbating, an'evlL practice often indulged in by young bulls of this age, especially when - closely confined so they do not get much exercise. This harness was- - designed here and probably is the first one made of its kind. Bulls indulging in this undesirable habit begin losing form and soon appear ungainly and become unthrifty. A poor breeding record'sometimes follows and In many cases the bull is a slow server. The purpose of this first band here in the region of the crops is to keep tho second belt,, which is eighteen inches further back, in place. This first band is. buckled on tight. A stiff metal strip connects it to the other band which is not belted on tight as it is In the region of the paunch and needs about six inches for expansion. The second, band mentioned encircles the barrel and twenty short pieces of small chains eight inches in length attached to it by rivets hang just in front of the sheath. This is very effective and no trouble Is encountered with an ambitious young bull. The demonstration is a success because I have taken only six minutes and here under the microscope you can all observe many sperms with an activity of about ninety per cent. Now I will bring in a cow and demonstrate to you how the cow is served with the sample we have left. The Instrument you see here is a speculum which is inserted into the vagina of the cow and by the means of this flashlight you can see the cervix, which joins the vagina to the uterus. The cervix later becomes sealed when the cow is pregnant. By using this 5 c.c. glasseptic syringe and eighteen inches of capillary tube I will now place the semen containing the numerous spermatozoa you observed into the cervix and the cow is bred. Let me set down the advantages of this method of breeding cows artificially. 1. It prevents the spread of disease, especially trichomonas which is a protozoan infection of the reproduction organs in hoth male and. female and is spread chiefly through the bull. </seg>
         <seg id="p302">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 2. An injured bull could not be used for natural service but could be kept in service when sample is obtained by massage of the ampullae. 3. Young bulls can be used to inseminate large mature cows and small heifers can be bred to a heavy bull without danger of injury to them. 4. The semen can be placed under the miscroscope and the per - centage motility as well as other factors such as longetlvity can be determined. 5. Cows in other herds can be bred without hauling either bull or cow and at the same time involve no risk of spreading disease. 6. With the use of diluter solution a large number of cows can be bred to a good bull. Ten cows could be bred if they were in estrum at one time. 7. The semen is placed directly in the cervix thus checking whether It is open and at the same time reducing the possibility that the sperms will not reach the uterus. 8. After a natural service some cows contract their vagina and arch their back so the semen is expelled from the vagina, whereas an artificial service eliminates this strain on the vagina.. A Jersey herd located seventeen miles out of Lincoln has not had a bull in it for two years and the cows were bred artificially to the bulls here by taking the semen as demonstrated, and transporting it to the farm. Whenever it is carried a number of miles or if several cows are to be bred, diluter is added to the semen. The diluter used is the Russian formula S.G.C. 2-13.6 gms. sodium sulphate, 12 gms. anhydrous glucose, and 5 gms. of salt free peptone dissolved in one liter of water and autoclaved. Test tubes and funnels are rinsed with this to neutralize any slight acidity that may be present. Data on 2 7 cows bred artificially by us show that 17 conceived from the first service, 3 more from the second, and 2 after several more services, resulting in 2 2 pregnancies. Five did not conceive, due possibly to a trlchomonad Infection as this Injurious protozoa was found to be present in several of the cows. All the Holsteins and Jerseys in the University herd are bred artificially at the present time. Three sires outside of the herd are used on some of the cows in the herd. The future will undoubtedly see this method used in many more herds. A proven sire of high transmitting power for type and production can have a tremendous number of off - spring in one year. This method of breeding has great possibilities and one can imagine </seg>

SUMNER BARNELL: Members of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. Ladies and Gentlemen: I note in the program that I am scheduled to make the president's address, but inasmuch as we were a little late In getting our program started and rather short on time, I will just make a few brief remark's and let that suffice for the president's address. In this brief talk I would like to look at the difference in dairying of the past and present and consider other benefits derived from dairy - ing such as soil building and soil conservation. I was born on a farm about 25 miles north of here. At that time the soil was all covered with native grass and a dairy consisted of but one cow tied to a peg driven into the ground. The calf was also cared for in the same manner. The cow was led out each morning after being milked and fastened to this peg to graze. At noon she was led to the creek where the water was flowing clean and fresh to get her daily drink. After being milked in the evening she was staked out to a peg driven in the ground nearer the house. As time passed on father bought a second cow. By this time I was big enough to help mother with the cows and take them to the picket line and bring them home again at the end of the day. This procedure, however, did not last very long as father finally made a 40 acre pasture and bought more and more cattle as the family was getting big enough to furnish more help. The herd grew until we had 14 cows and our dairy op - erations began to be a paying proposition. About one-half of the 200-acre farm was in native grass; some ot it used for pasture and some of it for meadow from which hay was cut and put up. Now when I look back to the days of youth at home I can see how beautifully nature had arranged things. With water flowing in the creek fresh and cool as it moved on its way to the gulf I could bait my hook and with a can of worms go down to the creek and catch a nice mess of fish most any time during the summer. Today there is but little pasture on the old farm. The timber which was planted around the old home has been cut and nothing left but a few straggly trees. The hillsides are badly washed clear down to the subsoil The draws have been practically filled with the top soil from these hill - sides. The willows and cottonwoods which were growing in the short </seg>
         <seg id="p304">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE draws have been cut and the land is now farmed with the rest of the place. In the main draw where water flowed in the creek so fresh and cool it was nearly filled with the top soil washed from the fields. Much of this land should never have been broken up but should have been left in the pasture with cows to graze it. In 1902 I moved to Fillmore county and started farming for my- &#132; self. I soon found out that I must have some cows to make this place pay. I bought a few cows and heifers and started out trying my luck milking cows again. I seeded part of the land to alfalfa and pasture. j However, the price of butterfat was down to 14 cents a pound and I soon became disgusted with the dairy business, fattened the cows, sold them on the market, and built a hay barn In which to store my hay. ! That fall, Mr. W. F. Holcomb, one of the old Jersey breeders In the ! community came over and seeing all the nice hay I had stored on my . j place made me a proposition to take some of his purbred Jersey cows j on a share basis. Before he left the place we made a deal and I have been breeding purebred Jerseys ever since. So I can really attribute my I start in the Jersey business to Mr. W. F. Holcomb, one of the pioneer 7 Jersey breeders in Nebraska. MR. BARNELL: Mr. Lawritson, the chairman of the nominations committee, will now please report. MR. LAWRITSON-.

The motion is carried. Here in Nebraska where we have always had an abundance of feed and in most years we have always had an abundance of corn and corn stalks for our feeding purposes, we flind It hard to adjust ourselves to the shortage which we are experiencing due to the drought con - ditions of these last few years. This feeding proposition has brought up a number of problems and I think it Is only fitting that we should have discuss these problems a man who comes from our neighboring state and who has been working with conditions similar to those here in Nebraska. So, it Is with a great deal of pleasure I Introduce our first speaker this afternoon. Dr. C. Y. Cannon, of the lowa State College, Dr. Cannon. DR. CANNON: Sometime ago when Professor Davis asked me to appear on this program and speak on feeding problems, I Immediately thought of the man who tries to solve perpetual motion. Feed conditions for dairymen vary widely. In some sections farms have produced adequate yields of hay, a good oat crop and fair amounts of corn while in other sections the entire crops were failures. In practically all the state pastures were very short through most of July and August forcing supplementary feeding of cows during this period much in excess of that usually done in a normal year. This cut down by that much the coming winter's feed supply. Of course where the farm feed supply is adequate the problem of feeding the dairy herd during the coming winter is not an acute one so the feeding program can continue in the ordinary channel which has proved successful and profitable. It is on farms where the crops were poor and feed short so that much feed at a relatively high price has to be purchased that rations must be studied and prices of feeds checked and compared. Several fundamental things must be considered in making up a satisfactory ration for the dairy cow. The cow must have the proper feeds in order to make milk. If she does not receive the right kind or enough feed her'production.will be limited. Milk is made from the feed that the cow eats and unless each component part of it is supplied the cow her body responses curtail her milk yield downward to meet the supply she is getting. This is illustrated in an excellent manner by some experimental re - sults obtained by Dr. Eckles when he was at the Missouri Experiment Station. He fed two Jersey cows, one good and one poor, keeping complete records of the feed consumption, coefficients of digestion, and milk yields. Later, when the cows were dry, maintenance trials were </seg>
         <seg id="p308">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE EOAVT) ny Ar.Drrr,,„„„„ run on each of them. From these records he discovered that the _„„_ cow consumed more feed and gave more milk, thmUk * id ofhe two cows being in proportion to the amount of feed each cow o7 — _..„.. 11 -y i^NTENANCE ,'HHU PEGS.' . .'

         <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ... .. Unless the crops which are fed have been badly damaged by exposure to unfavorable weather conditions the vitamin needs of dairy cows need cause no worry to the dairyman as the cows will be well supplied with these necessities. Even when damaged feeds are fed the vitamin deficiencies apparently do not seriously affect the cows themselves but the deficiencies are in the milk and then appear only when animals are fed on a straight milk diet. Feeds differ widely in their value. They, may be readily-eaten by the cow but their effect will vary greatly. The cow cannot use the entire amount of the feed she eats but only that part which is digestible. (See chart.No. .2). Many feeding trials have been conducted to de - termine the digestibility of the common feeds.... pi. ,T. ._" —* Tl "CJf, l£ s -¦_ „ . i-"«r~«V- **"*'* i ~ .vr. '11 111 '.

         <seg id="p310">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This Information is essential to the feeder ff he wishes to mix the best and cheapest rations. Because this information is considered so essential it is published in every feeding bulletin. "Start with a good home-grown roughage and you have solved the biggest share of your dairy feeding problems" stated a successful dairyman. The dairy cow is especially adapted to utilizing roughages and if they are home grown may be the cheapest source of feed nutrients. This year because of the drought hay may be scarce. In that case corn fodder, corn stover or even the late growth of pigeon grass (sometimes called "foxtail" or "wild millet") may be fed. Legume hays are more valuable than are the grasses for roughage because of the higher quanti - ties of digestible nutrients and protein they carry. In feeding the poor types of roughages more grain which should be richer in protein must be fed than with legumes to get like yields of milk. It has been estimated that when legume hay is worth ?10.00 per ton then corn fodder, cane, timothy or sudan roughage is worth approximately $7.00 per ton when based on the nutrients from them which are available to the cow. Underfeeding dairy cows has been shown to be unprofitable by many experimental trials as well as by practical experience When cows are allowed to get extremely thin through lack of winter feed it PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES 5P A COW ON DIFFERENT RATIONS 1000 POUND COW PRODUCING 4% MH.K ,¦..-¦ &#132;¦;¦ Nutrients Consumed.;.. : *•* '"• ::.

         <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ' takes considerable feed to bring the cows back to normal condition, much more feed being necessary than if they were kept in fair condition. Results show that it pays to feed cows for high levels of production for as production increases, it has been found that income over teed costs also Increases. In case roughages in usual quantities cannot be obtained then the nutrient deficiencies of the ration should be made up through feeding extra quantities of grain. Cows are limited in their physical capacity to consume feed. Only by eating highly digestible feeds can cows obtain enough nutrients to produce oh high levels. If a cow is given all the straw she will eat she will probably eat as many pounds of straw as she would alfalfa hay were she given all the hay she would take. Yet you^ll know that more milk will be produced when cows eat hay. We have set up three different rations (see chart 3) one of alfalfa hay, one of alfalfa hay and silage and one of alfalfa hay, silage and grain. You will note that each ration contains approximately the same amount of dry matter so that in each case the cow has about the same amount to put into her.paunch. There are differences, though, in the digestible material contained in each of these rations and proportion - ately greater differences in the part available for milk production. The amount of milk was calculated from Morrison's standard of feed requirements for milk production. This illustrates the probable effect of ration changes on the daily milk yield of a good dairy cow, even though in each case she is fed all she will take. Experimental feeding trials show that feed is wasted by feeding an unbalanced ration. Because the price of purchased feed is high there may-be temptation to use only the feeds on hand without balancing them. Under such conditions there will probably be more than enough feed wasted to pay for the necessary feed to balance the ration. The balanced ration increases milk yield and thus income. The unbalanced ration seriously impairs the cow's producing ability, health and reproduction. It is better to feed a smaller amount of a well balanced grain ration which will fit the roughage available than to feed a large quantity of an unbalanced grain ration In attempting to supply what the cow needs. For example, a large amount of corn may be fed in order to furnish the cow's protein needs,.even though there will he an exces - sive supply of other nutrients, such as carbohydrates. (See chart No. 4). This is an expensive practice, however, as corn is not an economical source of protein. For example, soybeans at $1.80 per bushel or $60.00 per ton provide protein as cheaply as ear corn at 35 cents per bushel or $11.00 per ton. For profltable: milk production and the health of the cow. It would be more satisfactory to trade corn for soybeans or some other high protein feed. </seg>
         <seg id="p312">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In extreme cases where only poor grades of roughage are avail - able and the grain crops were failures we recommend a practice that fUMim,^^*ss_rE_: '-.— -^'—-•v.' &#132;-• i , . — ... —: — '- jrajSsiiQtiiiiT stave units fe^l- "THrCAWWITTC '; :: ;;S ) 11 1 *.iz%sr* wm jtf f"f Jt' -V" If™ ll'" I*-' * "*' •-* • ¦ ¦ ' '¦'.¦...' :'¦' '. ..i'.i ;i' ..".¦!'¦¦:. ,"¦; "¦ ¦ ". ¦ .¦¦• ..;..» r,- ¦ ¦¦¦. ; r &lt;**s ;¦."..!. -- .i- ;« Chart 4 has been found profitable in some sections of Europe. This practice is to feed all the available roughage, be it corn fodder or stover, grass hay or straw, that the cows will eat and supplement it with small quantities of a very high protein grain. Such a grain mixture can be made up as follows: Bran or oats 200 lbs&lt; Soybeans, soybean meal, cottonseed meal or linseed mea1....500 lbs. This mixture will contain approximately 28 per cent digestible protein. The object in feeding this mixture Is to supply protein rather than carbohydrates. About half as much grain feed will be necessary when using this mixture than is usual when a standard grain ration is fed, so one pound of this high protein grain to every 6 to 7 pounds of f I. . .'-¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION milk produced will be sufficient for cows producing up to 25 or 30 pounds of milk dally. Low producing cows can be maintained with one pound of the high protein concentrate daily. Extremely high production cannot be expected on this emergency ration. It does not supply the necessary digestible energy to sustain very heavy milk yields. If cows are yielding above average it will re - quire the feeding of standard rations containing less fiber and more available nutrients. Again we wish to emphasize that it is better to feed smaller amounts of a grain mix fitted to balance the roughage fed than larger amounts of grain unbalanced with the roughages. Every dairyman should make plans now for the care of his herd during the winter. He should take an inventory of all his available feeds and make an effort to divide them up so that they will last as long as possible. If the amount of hay is limited, it will be more satisfactory to feed less per day and spread the supply throughout the feeding sea - son. Other roughages such as straw and corn fodder can be used to satisfy the cow's appetites. A few pounds of good roughage fed daily and spread over the entire winter will help more in holding up the cow's production than if it is fed all alone over only a part of the winter and then the substitute roughages fed alone during the rest of the time.: It Is difficult to outline all the details of a feeding program in this talk. Tbe most we can do is call your attention to some of the im - portant phase of it. MR. BARNELL: I would like to ask this question. In connection with the feeding of high protein feeds, what has been your experience In feeding cottonseed meal straight without any other grain? DR. CANNON: We have worked with the soybeans more than with the cottonseed meal; Our herdsman is an Oklahoma boy and the last high protein feed he bought was cottonseed meal, but we have had most of our, experience with soybeans. MR. BARNELL: When you refer to soybeans, I presume that you mean the soybeans that you grind.: DR. CANNON: We use the cracked soybeans, and feed them up to nine pounds. Our experience with soybeans has been very favorable and we have fed them for five years. MR. BARNELL: Have you had any experience in the different varieties of soybeans? ¦''..'¦. DR. CANNON.v Yes, we have used several varieties with approxi - mately the same results. Apparently our cows don't mind the variety. Of course, there is a lot of work to be done on varieties in this country. </seg>
         <seg id="p314">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. BARNELL: Have you made any silage of this material? DR. CANNON: Yes, and I notice that at New Jersey that they have put up some with the aid of molasses. MR. BARNELL: What about the effect of feeding soybeans on the flavor of the milk? MR. CANNON: The only thing is that we took samples of milk from each cow in two bottles, then we took them from the group and then from the herd and submitted a test to the market milk inspector at Ames, and they couldn't tell them apart. In fact, there was actually more milk from soybean-fed cows picked for top milk than from the other. We have been running iodine tests against feed that we are using. In fact Dr. Bird, dairy chemist, stated that with proper manage - ment a 9.'{ score butter could be made from the fat that these cows give. MR. BARNELL: Have you found any effect upon the percentage of butterfat in your milk. DR. CANNON: We don't have any figures on that, but I would say from casual observations that I believe every cow came up in butterfat production. The interesting thing was that the actual butter - fat was higher and the milk yield wasn't as high. MR. BARNELL: We thank you Dr. Cannon for this fine demon - stration and I might say that right along this soybean line that we finally got soybeans last year from our patch out here. At this time we have the pleasure of seeing one of the demon - strations that has not only been successful in this state, but also in wider fields. Now I know we have some good Irishmen here this after - noon, because [ don't see how anyone but the Irish could belong to the Murphy Milk Slingers club. This demonstration comes from Hamilton County and I will ask Mr. Paul Cook, the county agent there, to introduce the team and they will give us their demonstration that has been so successful this past year. MR. PAUL COOK: Mr. Chairman, 1 would like to take a few minutes before I introduce our team to say a few things about our 4-H club work. I would like to use my own county as a demonstration. Some time ago, the Banker's Association out there bought some Holstein heifers for distribution. Now this was a fine thing to do. This group was supposed to be a perpetual group whereby there were heifers to be given to other boys In the county. Now, as has been the trouble with so many of the things started in these calf clubs, the association drop - ped them after giving them the Holsteins. When the time came for mating these animals the boys didn't have a pure bred sire available to mate these with and if they did have, they probably didn't go on </seg>
         <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION in the production field. It was a shame to give one of these original heifers out to another boy as a project. So that fine start that was made just petered out of nothing. Now with that in view some of us got together and tried to solve that problem. So we organized a Junior Bull Ring Association, and last year organized a Junior Testing Asso - ciation. We have improved the type of 300 to 400 head of Holstein calves In that county just 100, 200, 300, and 400 per cent, and now we are increasing production. We have been able to produce better calves by our association bull than we could go out and buy. What I want to plead for now Is to carry that on. Spread that sort of a program over the state and encourage it from different standpoints. We want these boys and girls to be able to show at a fair and get experience in showing with others which is very educational, but we have got to have help to take care of expenses while we are doing that. A $6 premium is the highest a boy can make at the State Fair. Now you bring a cow or a yearling heifer down here and you know she will eat more than that amount of feed. Now you have to pay for bringing that cow down, the expenses of the boy's transportation, the expense during the time here,.and you can't come out even. Now that is the thing that the state can help us with. Give us a premium for the boys to work for. Help us to encourage their showing, the developing of their own animals instead of buying out-of-state animals. Develop a get-of-slre group, or another class or two to help encourage these 4-H bull ring associations. Help keep their enthusiasm. I just wanted to drop that word because I feel that there is a field that we could do a lot for. We do appreciate the work that you have done for the 4-H club boys and girls over the state. I think you have done a fine piece of work to help them as much as you have, but I just wanted to say these few things so you could be thinking about them and help us accomplish some of them. . We have a lot of what we call extra curricular activities in our 4-H groups, and these give more results than actual hours in the class room. I believe the youngsters, get more out of those kind of enterprises than they do out of many other things. Now from the standpoint of another program, the cream quality production, the 4-H club demonstrations have been.helping materially along that line. In order to get that be - fore the public the committee in charge of that work has encouraged the 4-H club members. We have developed some demonstrations pointing out some of the points to be Considered In carrying out that type of a program. The demonstration that the boys are going to give you this afternoon is presenting the cooling phase of this program. Now without any more time, I am going to present the boys from the Murphy Milk Slingers club, Donald Vetter and John Oswald who will give us their demonstration on how to make a barrel type milk or cream cooler. </seg>
         <seg id="p316">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Demonstration INTRODUCTION: We are members ot the Murphy Milk Sllngers Dairy Calf club of Hamilton county. There are 7 members in our club. We exhibited calves last year and our club has been organized for several years. We aud our parents are In the dairy business as a farm enterprize and are interested in selling our products to the very best advantage and in order to do this we must produce good quality products because we can get a premium for good cream or butter. One Ot the essentials in producing good dairy products is proper cooling. This being a known fact, we have selected for our demonstration today, the making of a barrel cooler. One reason we have selected this for our demonstration is that it can be used in practically every farm in Hamilton county and can be made cheap. We have a plentiful supply of good cold water in Hamilton county as has been demonstrated by temperatures taken in the past. Tests have been taken in this county which run from 45 to 50 degrees. In the State of Nebraska and in many neighobrlng states there is a movement on to improve the cream through a national and state program. Many of the cooperative creameries and centralizer cream - eries are paying a premium for good, clean, sweet cream. They are also rejecting 3rd grade cream as unfit for making butter. The Fed - eral government through their inspection is also condemning much of the cream and butter In the middle west as unfit for human consumption. This is not only a great loss to the farmers but a great loss to the dairy Industry of the country. Act I. The following scene takes place in one of our club members homes: D. Hello John, What are you doing with that big barrel there? J. Why, I purchased that barrel to make me a cooling tank. D. You can't make a cooling tank out of that, what are you going to cool? J. Haven't you heard that the creameries over here are paying a premium for good quality sweet cream? lam going to fix my tank so I can get a premium for the cream I sell. D. What do you have to do In order to get this premium and how much is it? J. A premium of from 2to 5 cents is being paid for clean sweet cream. D. Gosh. That's worth working for. </seg>
         <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION J. Yes it is. Dad and I were at a meeting at the County agent's office on the Cream Quality Program and it was brought out there that there are 3 major points essential in keeping cream sweet and of a good quality. First, keep the cream, clean. Second, keep the cream cool and third, market as often as possible. The first point which I have mentioned —-keeping cream.dean starts with, milking. The cows should be kept clean, the milk palls should be clean and the separator should be clean and fresh before separating the cream from the milk. The second point—keeping the milk cool, is a matter of cooling cream immediately after it is separated, either by a barrel cooler, such as I am going to build, a concrete tank or an electric cooling plant. Third, to market fresh cream. We mean by that that the'cream should he marketed at least twice a week; regardless of how well it is kept it gets old if kept on the farm too long. D. John why don't you let me help you build this cooler and then you can come over some day and help me fix one. It sounds like a good idea to me. I know our cream gets soiir pretty quick and sometimes the cream buyer refuses to take It. J. You bet, I will, get right to work. I have already sawed this barrel off so it is 25 inches high] ..'¦'¦¦¦ D. Why 25 inches? J. We want to make it high enough to take care of a 5-gallon milk can, but don't need the extra space above that. D. What do you want me to do? J. Now we have to put a rack in the bottom of this barrel. Here, help me fix It up. D- What's that for? A dirt catcher? J. No. The idea is to have a space in the bottom of the barrel so that the water can circulate around the can and thus help to cool it. If the can sets on the solid bottom, it won't cool a? well. (Make rack, put in barrel and tip to show) Oh yes, mother said she would like to have a place to keep butter and meat cool so we are going to fix this so we can put a 3-gallon shotgun can here that cream or milk or butter or anything you want can be kept in it. We will make a little stand to set this shotgun can on. (Make stand). D. Let's see what are you going to do with the rest ot this space in here? Are you going to fix anything else? J. Yes, we plan on having room in addition to the 5-gallon milk can and the small can, for a 5-galloh shotgun can. We should have 2 cans in our cooler, one to cool the fresh cream in and one to keep </seg>
         <seg id="p318">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the supply from day to day because if you mix fresh warm cream with the old it starts the bacteria to growing and causes spoiling more quickly. This point is very important and one that the average farmer doesn't think about. D. What is all this metal material that you have here. I notice that you have two straps and some rods, what are they for? .Il WeU ' th6Se Stl'apS We put on the inside of the in order to hold the cans in place. The small rods will fasten to the side of the barrel and have them extend out over the top of the can so that they wil act as holders for the cans to keep them from floating when only partly filled. We have to be very careful in getting these placed at Just the right distance from the top of the can so that they will function Properly (Straps and rods are put on barrel). Here you screw these screws in while I hold the rods in place. D. You know, John, since you mentioned it, I believe that Dad and I don't market our cream often enough, sometimes in threshing or haying time it goes 10 days or 2 weeks and gets pretty sour If we would send a smaller can of cream to town twice a week we could keep it sweet for that length of time in one of these coolers. J. That's right Donald, and that is just what was said at the meet - ng the other night by the dairy specialist. Re sure and get those screws in Ugh and straight. Another thing that makes cream sour quicker is dirt; dirty cream won't stay sweet even if kept cool. D. Aw. What difference does a little dirt make in the cream, we always strain all the hair and straw out and it looks clean. J. That Is just it Donald, it looks clean, but every little particle of dirt even tho it is too small to he seen carries many hundreds o£ bacteria and these bacteria are what start the souring. The County Agent said that clean cows, clean barns, clean hands and clean milking utensils are the first steps in marketing sweet cream. D. I guess you're right, but we always thought that cream just naturally started to sour, and didn't realize that dirt and other things Ihe fcrmi 8 Pl'°CeSS' ™* ""* ty"e °f Coole'' tllat Ca" be "Sed ol&gt; J. No, but this is the cheapest and most satisfactory type for a renter who may have to move from year to year. It can be disconnected and moved any place and set up again. A good concrete tank for a farm owner is better and can be made to hold any number of cans and will last longer, but costs more and doesn't cool any quicker. Or in a large dairy, electric or mechanical cooling systems can be used. D^ Say, John, what kind of a water system do you have to have in order to work this cooler? </seg>
         <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION J. Oh, just an ordinary windmill or power pump and a regular stock or supply tank set any distance away. This barrel cooler, however, cannot be set up on every farm because you have to have the stock tank that your water supply runs Into, lower than the pump so that you can connect your barrel between them and the water will run thru it by gravity. But most farms have their water system so arranged that a barrel cooler of this kind can be used. D. Do you just let the barrel stand out in the sun? It seems to me it would be better if it were in a milk house or something. J. Yes, it is better if a shed or shade of some kind is used over the barrel but it is not absolutely necessary and adds to the cost if you have to build-one. The cold water flowing thru the barrel most of the time keeps the temperature down. D. There all the screws are in, now what. J. This completes the inside of the barrel. Now we must provide an inlet to let the water in and another hole to let the water out. I have already bored holes in the barrel before I sawed the top off. D. What are all these pipe connections which you have here for? Why the different sized pipes, wouldn't it be better to use the same size? . J. No, Donald, you see the water comes in thru the inlet under pres - sure but goes out the outlet by gravity so needs a larger hole to carry it off because it goes slower. Well, part of these are for the outlet and part of them for the Inlet. You notice that the Inlet pipe we bring In near the top of the barrel and extend It to the. bottom so that this will bring the cool water In and down to the bottom of the barrel thus pushing the warm water to the top and out the outlet and by this process we have kept circulat - ing the cool water around the can. If the water stands still around the cans the heat from the cans warms a thin layer of water and this keeps the cream from cooling quickly. D. I see. That is a pretty slick idea. Did you think up that one? J. No, that was part of the explanation given the other night at the dairy meeting. Here will you help me hold these pipes, this Is quite a job putting In this outlet so that we will not have a leak around the edge of the pipe. We have a rubber gasket and a IV_ -inch lock nut on both sides that should hold it. D. By the looks of things, we are about thru with this now. J. No, we have a lid to make. No cooling tank is complete with - out a lid to keep out dust and dirt and hot winds. I have some ship- </seg>
         <seg id="p320">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lap here which we can double and make a lid out of. The lid should be made so that it fits tightly and correctly and has an opening for the inlet. When we get this lid made then we are ready to place our cans and try the cooler out. (Put the cans in the tank). D. I see the cans fit nicely. The instructions you used must be correct. Well, John, I must be going. I think an awful lot of that barrel cooler and I wonder if you would come over soon and help me make one. lam coming back some day next week to see how It actually works when you get it connected. Oh, yes, one thing I wanted to ask you before I leave. How much did this whole outfit cost. I want to get mine as soon as I can. J. This whole cooler as it stands, barrel, pipe connections and everything cost me just 33.25. The barrel I bought at the grocery store for ?1.00, the rods, straps and pipe connections, I got from one of the large creamery companies that is selling the set at cost, in order to encourage more farmers to build and use these coolers, I paid them $1.50. Then the lumber and nails I used cost me new, about $.75. On the average farm enough boards can be found so that you wouldn't have to buy any. Well goodby, Donald. I'll see you some day soon and help you make one. D. This concludes our demonstration, if there are any questions we will try to answer them. J. If there are not more questions we thank you for your kind attention. MR. BARNELL: lam sure that you have all enjoyed seeing these two Irishmen, because I know they must be Irishmen to belong to the Murphy Milk Slingers club, give their very interesting demonstration on how to build a barrel cooler. They have done a good job of pre - senting this demonstration which was worked out by Professor Downs and Mr. Flack. Now it Is my privilege to present to you at this time the man who has charge of the 4-H club work in Nebraska. Mr. Frisbie. MR. FRISBIE: Mr. Barnell, officers and members of the Dairy - men's Association. About nine years ago there was an organization here in Lincoln that started giving a trophy to outstanding animal clubs. There was poultry, baby beef, swine, and dairy animals. During that time there has been a great deal of rivalry in securing that trophy I am Interested to see that three different groups are represented here this afternoon, all of which are in the running for this award this year, and I don't think that they know yet who gets that trophy In 4-H club work we believe that the completion of the work begun is the </seg>
         <seg id="p321">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION all important thing. The winning 4-H club has increased their enroll - ment, they have had exhibits at both county and state fairs, and I am told that In this club every member has shown at the state and county fairs. They have this fine demonstration team to which you have just listened, and they have all made very fine records. lam glad now to present to you the individual representing the Gooch Milling Company who sponsors this trophy. He is also a former 4-H club boy. Mervin Eighmy. MR. EIGHMY: It gives me a great deal of pleasure and I know it does you to see this group honored their third year by the awarding of this trophy for their good efforts in 4-H club work. I want to con - gratulate you and I feel that your honor is well earned: (Presents Gooch trophy to Donald Moore, leader of the Murphy Milk Slingers 4-H club, Hamilton county), MR. BARNELL: We will now continue with our program for the afternoon. This group from time to time has had the privilege of listen - ing to people connected with Hoard's Dairyman. One or two of our annual meetings was addressed by former Governor Hoard. Repeatedly we have had Mr. Glover, and now we take on a younger member and.it is with great pleasure that I now introduce, to you Mr. J. C. Nisbet, associate editor of Hoard's Dairyman, who will now bring us "A Pro - gram of Progress for the Dairyman". Mr. Nisbet. A PROGRAM OF PROGRESS FOR THE DAIRYMAN Man has had charge of the breeding of domestic animals for many generations, in fact from away back before the iron age. The ac - complishments of all this breeding work are splendid as we look at the flocks and herds we have on our farms today. This accomplish - ment becomes all the more a thing of wonder when we appreciate the few tools that our pioneer breeders had to perfect this art. .¦•¦¦• i-.-'. '¦¦ — ! Less than fifty years ago there was no practical measurement fo.' butterfat. The milk from the cow was put into a churn and after much gedunking of the dasher, the butter was gathered enough so it could be weighed and the worth of the cow determined. Everlasting praise is due the men who with such handicaps could build production to higher levels. The world today, however, is not content with small improvements. Efficiency has been made to increase by leaps and bounds. We expect changes in ayear now that took centuries to bring about In years past Consider the improvements in industry that we have become accustomed to expect. Think of harnessing the power in a colorless liquid to send a mass of steel on wheels along a road at 60 miles per hour. Appreciate the use of that same liquid in getting another bulky house on wings 11 </seg>

Or realize what It means to take the rays from a star 40 light years away from us and create enough energy to throw the switch lighting the Century of Progress. Maybe this rapid improvement of our day with all of its rush and tumble is not everything we would want it to be but, nevertheless, no one can argue that the old horse and buggy days with their horse and buggy conveniences and methods would ever meet the needs of these times. Compare the rapid tire improvements of industry with the improve - ments in our dairy cattle. Today we find our barns quite well populated with inferior producers. Just take for an example one state illustrat - ing our present condition. In Wisconsin last year 38,000 cows were tested in cow testing work. Their average production was 306 lbs. of fat or 100 lbs. hi .her than the average in the state. In this much superior group wen- found a certain IS per cent that were eating up the profits of the heller rows. From this fact we can very accurately assume that 25 per cent or ..!»u._i;h rows are annually engaged in the whole - sale robbery of their tanner owner In this one state. Consider the Tn.nut).oo(l lbs. of profitless fat that these 500,000 cows flood into our national milk pail and you get ;i little idea of what this competition of the poor cow really means to the fanner interested in milking a li&gt; m . milkiut; cows. If our present matim. of dairy animals results in such poor herds of dairy cattle certainly then- must be an opportunity for the breeder with a vision bent on bringing about an improvement. The first i|iif.si!on (lie bound thinking breeder-minded man will ask is what is the dlfi'ereuce between a good and a poor cow. This question is answered in a startling fashion by the following illustration. Cows protlu-ing ISO lbs. fat a year have 5 lbs. left over to sell at a profit after their feed bill is paid. Cows producing 375 lbs. of fat have 150 lbs. left over to sell al a profit. You can buy the same amount of groceries, clothing or gasoline from the sale of the product of the better cow at _ cents a lb. butterfat as you can from the sale of the product of the poorer cow at GO cents a pound butterfat. High producing cows then really are necessary if we are interested in a better living. Many folks are interested in getting a better living and this group of folks offer a big market for the breeder who can help them establish a high producing herd. The market demands can be met by the breeder who will furnish sires that transmit uniformly high production. </seg>
         <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Every sire will not do this particular thing. There is no outward meas - urement in common use to pick the good from the poor sire. In fact, the man with a 350 lb. fat herd has not much better than a 50-50 chance of getting a sire that will maintain or improve his herd when he selects from the average run of better sire measurements.' If the breeder is to produce sires that will be dairy herd builders, he must know just what he is mixing together when he decides to mate a certain cow in his herd to a certain bull in his herd. The product of this mixture, if it happens to be a bull calf, is what he will have to offer the buyer who must build a better herd. How much confidence would you have in a druggist who did not know what the bottles on his shelf contained? Would you take the prescription needed by a sick member of your family to this druggist to be filled? His mixture might work, then again it might not. Iti man's breeding work, many poor and unfit animals have been let live and become the parents of future breeding stock. The channel of inheritance, that flows on down from grandsire to sire and from sire to son and daughter has become diluted with low production factors. Out of all the, mixtures have come some successes as well as some failures, and this job .of breeding dairy cattle demands that the breeder know the "Masterpiece of Cowdom" from the "Gangster of Cowdom." The knowledge that the breeder must secure can come only through this testing. He has no measure of the production worth of a sire other than the progeny test. When unselected daughters of a sire are tested, then and only then can we see what production inheritance a sire transmits. Six unselected recorded daughters together with their dams give the necessary records to prove a sire. He may be proved good, he may be proved bad, or he may be proved in between. The important point is that he is proved so anyone can decide what to do with the bull when the evidence is handed in. If he is proved good, his sons carry a valuable herd building Inheritance. If he is poor or just medium his sons will make no contribution and, in most cases, will tear down good herds where they may be put Into service. The sire proved good then is the first tool used in this job of breed - ing cattle. But be must be mated with a dam equally as good if his inheritance is to be utilized to its fullest extent. A dam Is proved good by the records of her daughters In just the same manner as a sire., When we find a cow with two or three daughters all uniformly high' producers we have found a real brood cow. This is the second tool of the breeder. He Knows. Guessing is no more necessary. Mating the sire proved good to the good brood cow promises the fulfillment of the great need in our national herds today. If records were as hard to get, as expensive, and as involved as </seg>
         <seg id="p326">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE they were in the years past this program would be doomed to failure. But science has given us the Babcock test. Our colleges have developed cooperative testing, and now for the small sum of a few dollars a year spent in joining a cow testing association and the Herd Improvement Registry, the mystery, the chance, and the many hazards of our present day dairy cattle breeding program can be almost wiped away. The dairyman cannot afford to be playing a game of blind man's bluff that permits low inheritance to run gaily on down from one generation to another. Improvement of the home is the ultimate goal of this Breeding Busi - ness. It is a longtime program and one that challenges the young man in that farm home. You have an opportunity to give that young man a better chance at making a good living if you leave him a better herd than you started with. Governor Hoard many times told of a little Incident that gives a vision of what we owe to future generations. It was during the Civil War that General Sheridan had left his troop to ride into Washington. Returning he was met at Winchester by a courier who told of the Confederate General Early surprising Sheridan's men and putting them in retreat. They were being followed and the loss was mounting. Sheridan was mounted on his great white charger, "Revenge". His troops were 20 miles away. His horse was put to a dead gallop down the Winchester pike. The body of the noble horse became flecked with foam, his dilated nostrils gave evidence of the wind-burned lungs within him but he never faltered in the mission that he was bred for. Two thousand years ot selection for speed and endurance flowed in his veins. When put to the surpreme test he had that ancestry to carry him through. Sheridan arrived to find his men badly beaten but through his magnetic personality and physical bravery he again called his men to the line and turned de - feat into partial victory. What might have happened to this country had General Sheridan been riding a scrub or a Clydsdale Is somthing no one now wants to even think about. What sort of herds are we equipping our sons and grandsons with? Will these herds be able to respond because their ancestry has been right, and in responding will they bring success and achievement to future generations? MR.

At this time I am very happy to present to you again Mr. Nisbet. ;'¦-"- ,| . ' •'..¦• . . '¦' . RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE REGISTERED DAIRY CATTLE BREEDER Never in the history of dairy cattle breeding was there greater promise of reward for constructive effort. Never did the future look quite so bright for the man who owns good dairy breeding stock. Unlike the promise that comes to the owner of a Derby winner, the reward for achievement in dairy cattle-breeding can go to the many. Small breeders and large breeders have equal opportunity. The promise goes farther in differing from the Derby; the business of constructive dairy cattle breeding will pay its own way. There's more than a thrill waiting for the man who accepts today's challenge to breeders. Any guess as to the future, if it is a good guess, must be based on what is happening today and on what happened yesterday. We can look about us a- bit and get a check on whether the promise suggested above is a good guess or not. Who has owned dairy cattle and who owns them today? The vast majority are men who make a living for them - selves and their families from this business of dairy cattle breeding. Where does the dairy cattle breeder get the Income that makes his business one that.supports a family? His cash income is derived from the two sources—sale of milk and sale of seed stock. : What creates a demand for breeding cattle? The dairy farmer who owns grade cows Is the fellow who buys upwards of 75% of all seed stock. Why does the grade cattle owner buy registered animals? He is interested in cattle that will make his farm income a better one. What does the grade cattle owner sell to get his money to buy? He sells milk. Who does he sell milk to? A population of 125,000,000 people. </seg>
         <seg id="p328">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Boiled down to the real big reason why we are breeding cattle, the - answer can be none other than to produce milk for America's humanity. Any program for a bigger and better future for the dairy cattle breeder will do well to ponder on the above. The final conclusion brings forth our greatest sale's point. America's population is probably the best off of any people on the face of the globe. We all know that the United States has only 6 per cent of the land area In the world and only 7 per cent of the world's population. We are told that our country has 32 per cent ot the world's railroads; 76 per cent of its automobiles; 33 per cent of Its radio broadcasting sta - tions; and more than 44 per cent of its radio receiving sets. In the United States are produced 60 per cent of the world's oil; 48 per cent of the copper; 43 per cent of the pig iron; 47 per cent of the steel; 58 per cent of the corn; and, prior to the coming of the A.A.A., 56 per cent of the cotton. As compared with the most advanced countries in Europe, we have twice the number of home owners per thousand of population; we consume four times as much electricity and we have seven times as many automobiles per thousand of population. With only 7 per cent of the world's population, the people of this country have achieved a standard of living so much higher than other, countries that we consume half of the world's coffee, half of its rubber, one-fourth of Its sugar, three-fourths of its silk, one-third of its coal, and two-thirds of its petroleum. However, we have this stubborn fact before us. The average In - come in America is but $500 a year. If everyone got an equal share of the wealth they would get some $3,000. Of this only $39 could be cash; the rest would be a truck load of feathers, a brick from the chimney of the Woolworth building, a steering wheel from a tractor, or a teething ring for the baby. We are producing milk and manufacturing milk products In America for poor people, not for the wealthy. Competition on other foods is keen. The race will go to that product which is the most economical. If price was our only solution to a more abundant income for the man milking cows butter could be put at ?1 a lb., or $5 a lb. Milk could be set at 25? a quart, etc., etc., but how many customers would we have? Dairy farm income will be increased by cutting costs which means higher production and here is where the registered cattle owner has his opportunity. We can breed cattle that will net dairy farmers 6-8- or 10 cents </seg>
         <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION more per pound of fat. On a farm producing 6000 lbs. fat this means $300 to $500 greater income every year. What a golden opportunity if we but go about building seed stock that will get this job done, seed stock that will deliver the goods. Sufficient to say of the past, is that our breeding methods have not measured up adequately to the job. The trouble was not with our cattle. The superior inheritance for high production still is carried in their makeup. The trouble was not with our breeders. They did not have the tools for selective mating that are available today. Mendel's Law and the Babcock test are more or less recent history. The result on many of our American farms today Is that we are trying to make an income that will buy the modern conveniences of a 1936 industrial world by milking a "horse-an-buggy" cow. The new tool for the dairy cattle breeder is at hand. Records tell the facts necessary for building a better breeding animal. Records point out.the cow that makes the best marketing unit; the cow that pays the most for feed consumed, and produces at lowest cost. But continued record keeping does. more. It points out the individual that has handed on to its offspring that superior ability to produce. j***tttff!aM,^Bo!u9 mw!t99 mio&amp;tifr 43?-4W _OOM?P«__ft2_ ¦'-¦ CHART I .

         <seg id="p330">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Many cows, good producers themselves, do not have that breeding worth that lets them hand on this high production to their daughters. Sires may transmit high production to a high percentage of their daughters or to a low percentage. Records disclose these facts.

Our conviction is that no dairyman should attempt to manage a dairy herd without keeping production and feed cost records, for only through a study of such records can improvement be made. The most satisfactory way to keep these records is through membership in a dairy herd improvement association. There are three purposes in keeping these records all of which can be illustrated by actual examples in dairy herds.

This angle is. a very vital one to a man who proposes to carry on a definite breeding program. So vital Is it that breeders who are produc - ing bulls to be used in our grade herds should be forced to carry on a definite testing program by buyers refusing to purchase such animals unless they are backed by such records. The third Objective of testing is to prove bulls through the progeny test. Even after sons of outstanding cows have been se - lected disappointment in the ability of those sons to "carry on" into the next generation sometimes occurs. Tested bulls mated to tested cows will reduce the number of such disappointments. </seg>

' THE ASSOCIATION'S STATE FAIR, EXHIBIT This year, as always,- the exhibit of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association in Agricultural Hall at the Nebraska State Fair created considerable interest. The large number of people who visited the display is evidence that many people are interested in dairying. Keeping continually in mind that dairy products; in their various forms, are to a great extent consumed by the human family it is naturally important that the food value and economy of dairy products should be stressed. Also in a great butter producing state like Ne - -1 braska continued emphasis should be placed on the production of high quality milk and cream on the farm. This year the exhibit was enclosed with modernistic front with i- openings showing various educational displays. The first booth on the left showed milk as a food in all nations. This was joined by a. </seg>
         <seg id="p336">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE booth showing the value of cheese In the diet. In the center was a dis - play covering the idea of balancing the diet with milk. Next to the right diets, was a display showing bow one can live well at low costs by using dairy products in the diet. On the extreme right was showed the Progressive Nebraska Dairy - man using the Dairy Herd Improvement Association to separate the boarders from the profit makers in the herd. The mechanical devices helped to hold the attention of the observers. The "Butter Statue" as it has become known was housed as usual in the ice box at the east end of the same building. This year it-con - sisted of a fire place and old furniture and utensils. The theme being "Butter Like the Home is the Foundation of American Life".

THE 4-H CLUBS It has been a privilege for this association to find it possible to use a portion of Its budget in assisting in Nebraska's 4-H Club work. This work, where in the younger generation, carries on a project which teaches a lesson in better dairying. Each year money is appropriated to be used in defraying part of the expenses of Nebraska's champion dairy judging and demonstration teams to the National Dairy Show. At the exposition, they compete with champions of other states. Evidence that the money is well expended is found in the letters of appreciation and description of the trips taken by the Nebraska champions. The following letters from Mr. L. I. Frisbie, State Extension Agent Boys and Girls Clubs, and from the individuals making the trips speak for themselves. Enclosed are thank you letters and stories from the 4-H club mem - bers who made the trip to Dallas, Texas as guests of your association. We want to add our thanks to that of the club members for making this trip possible. We assure you that they gained much from the experience. </seg>

They are as follows: " Dairy Cattle Judging 2nd Dairy Production Demonstration 10th Dairy Consumption Demonstration 4th Dairy Manufacture Demonstration — - sth Very truly yours, L. I. FRISBIE, State Extension Agent, Boys and Girls Clubs. I am writing this letter to try to tell you how much I appreciate your helping with the expenses for my trip to Dallas, Texas. We started October 10, early in the morning. October 11 was my birthday and I think that my trip was the nicest birthday present I ever have had. : I had never been more than two hundred miles from home before so this trip was "the thrill that comes once in a lifetime". I learned much while I was there and on the way, to and from. Seeing these different things myself made me realize much more the different Industries that are going on in communities other than my own.. -.-..'" "We saw coal mines, oil wells, and cotton fields that we had never seen before. Again I wish to thank you for the wonderful birthday present which was made possible through, your help. . Sincerely, BETTY JEAN COOLEY, Waverly, Nebraska. 1 wish to express my sincere thanks to you for your great help in financing the trip to the National Dairy Show at Dallas, Texas. I had a lovely time and I'm sure everyone that went enjoyed It as much as I did." .:'.,' Yours truly, '¦..••'¦¦'".. VERNAPENKE, Irvington, Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p342">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE My Trip to the National Dairy Show On Thursday, October 8, 1936, a group of ten people left Lincoln at 8;30 to attend the National Dairy Show at Dallas, Texas. In giving a 4-H dairy consumption demonstration at the State Fair, Margaret Ohrt and I won first prize and received a free ttip to the National Dairy Show at Dallas, Texas to compete in the national con - test. A demonstration team from Lancaster County, a demonstration team from Hamilton County, and a dairy judging team from Douglas County also received free trips. Three leaders. Miss Clara Noyes, who is Home Extension Agent in Douglas County; Mr. H. P. Cook, County Agent of Hamilton County; and Mr. M. L. Flack, State Dairy Extension Specialist from Lincoln, Nebraska were also given free trips. The demonstration team from Lancaster County did not leave until Saturday. We drove down in two cars, Mr. Cook and Mr. Flack each driving a car. We reached Manhattan, Kansas at noon of the first day after driving in rain most ot the way. We spent Thursday afternoon and night In Manhattan. It seemed very strange to see most of the houses built of stones or rocks as they were in Kansas. The reason for this is that Kansas has many rocks. On Friday morning we got up at 4:30 A. M. and left Manhattan. On our way that day we went by some oil fields. We went through Ponca City, Oklahoma where the biggest oil tank farm In the world is located. Each tank holds over ten million barrels of oil and there are more than fifty tanks. At 1:00 o'clock we arrived at Stillwater, Oklahoma and spent Friday afternoon and night there. Saturday morning we left Stillwater about 6:45. We stopped at the Gaylord Dairy Farm just west of Britton, Oklahoma in the fore - noon and at the Meadow Lodge Dairy Farm a little northwest of Okla - homa City In the afternoon. From there we drove on through the Arbuckle Mountains and on to Ardmore, Oklahoma where we stayed all night. Sunday morning everyone was ready to go at 7:00 o'clock. We arrived in Dallas at 10:00 o'clock Sunday morning. While we were in Dallas we stayed at the Lone Star Hotel. When we first got there we received our 4-H badges and our passes to the Centennial Grounds. In the afternoon all of us went out and looked over the grounds. On Monday afternoon Margaret and I gave our demonstration. In competi - tion with ten teams we placed fourth. Two girls from South Dakota placed first. The dairy judging team from Douglas County competed in the National Judging contest on Monday and placed second in com - petition with 21 teams. Oklahoma team won first. All day Tuesday was spent out on the Centennial grounds. At noon •a free luncheon was served for all 4-H delegates and two leaders from </seg>
         <seg id="p343">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION each state at the Century Cafe on the Centennial grounds. In the evening Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. gave a dinner for all 4-H delegates and leaders at the Old English Tavern also on the Centennial grounds. After the dinner all guests were taken to see the "cavalcade" ot Texas. The show was wonderful, covering the expanse ot more than thTee hun - dred feet long and one hundred feet deep. • The Cavalcade stage was &lt;_. three-dimensional panorama of Texas topography, ranging from the high and rugged peaks, the deep canyons, and the cactus deserts of the West to the heavily forested lowlands of the East. The coloring was taken from actual Texas landscapes. Water was shot up from the bottom colored by lights and used as a screen. This show lasted - almost one and a half hours! At night the buildings and everything are very beautiful with the colored lights. The next day we attended a banquet along with the rest of the 4-H folks. The prizes were awarded at that time. Immediately after the. banquet we started for home. We stayed in Oklahoma City that night. The next day we ate breakfast in Oklahoma City, dinner in Eldorado, Kansas, and supper in Lincoln, Nebraska. We arrived home Thursday night about 10:30. The trip to the National Dairy Show Is something, that I will never forget. VERNAPENKE. I have recently returned from my trip to the National Dairy Show in connection with the Texas Centennial at Dallas, Texas. I wish to. express at this time my sincere thanks for your splendid cooperation in making this trip possible. I certainly was pleased to win this trip and I know it will always be. a cherished memory because of the lovely times we all enjoyed. Very truly yours, MARGARET M. OHRT, Bennington, Nebraska. My Trip to the National Dairy Show Did I enjoy my trip and. will it always be a cherished memory?' Yes, I had a wonderful time and I feel that both the time and money spent was very well spent. Our group of ten people was composed of the following: Mr. M. L. Flack, state dairy extension specialist, Mr. Paul Cook, county exten - sion agent from Hamilton county, Miss Clara Noyes, home extension agent from my own county which is Douglaß, Otto and Russel Pfeiffer and Clyde Decker all of Douglas county, who made up Nebraska's judg - ing team, Victor Hunt and Arnold Moore, two demonstrators from Ham- </seg>

After leaving Lincoln at 9 o'clock on Thursday morning we drove to Manhattan, Kansas. We arrived in Manhattan at about 1 o'clock. After having our dinner, Miss Noyes, Verna and I registered In the Gillette Hotel in downtown Manhattan. After resting a while here w. drove to the Kansas Agricultural College Campus In Manhattan where the boys were doing some practice judging. Here we enjoyed a sight - seeing trip around the campus. In the evening after eating In the hotel dining room we all returned to our rooms and studied. By this I mean the judging boys gave reasons and the demonstration teams reviewed their demonstrations. Friday morning we arose at five o'clock and left Manhattan at 5:30. Although it was dark when driving this early in the morning we managed to find out that we came through Fort Riley, a famous military encampment. At Perry, Oklahoma we ate our dinner and from here continued our drive to Stillwater, Oklahoma. We arrived in Stillwater at about 2 o'clock and again Miss Noyes, Verna and I enjoyed a sight-seeing trip around the Agricultural College Campus in Still - water while the boys did some practice judging. After eating breakfast we left the hotel at about 7 o'clock on Sat - urday morning and drove to the Gaylord Guernsey Farms near Britton, Oklahoma where the boys did more practice judging. After eating dinner in Britton we continued to Meadow Lodge Dairy, one of the United States most sanitary dairies. While the boys practice judged here we went through the dairy barns and pasteurization plant and listened to the Nebraska-Minnesota football game. After leaving this dairy we drove through some very beautiful country including the Arbuckle Mountains to Ardmore, Oklahoma, where we decided to spend the night. After eating supper that night I was only too glad to get to bed. The next day being Sunday, I didn't get up so very early but we left Ardmore at about 7:30 and arrived in Dallas, the long waited for city, at about 10 o'clock. After making plans for our stay in the Lone Star Hotel in Dallas and finding out the exact time of demonstrating and judging we ate dinner. We then left for the Centennial, another big moment. Here everything seemed so different and unusual as I was not accustomed to seeing such a large place and so many people. After walking around the greater part of the afternoon we returned to the Lone Star Hotel, the headquarters for all 4-H Club folks of the United States. After eating supper, Miss Noyes, Mr. Cook and Mr. Flack attended a coach's meeting. Monday we arose rather early as this was the day Verna and I were to demonstrate and also the day for the boys to judge. After </seg>
         <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION getting our equipment for demonstrating packed we left for the Cen - tennial at about 9 o'clock. Upon our arrival at the grounds we dis - covered that we would be unable to give our demonstration until the afternoon, incidentally we were to give it at 11:30. After eating a picnic dinner which we had prepared we again returned to the foods building where we were.to give our demonstration. Here we waited until 3 o'clock and finally we were able to give our demonstration. Having had only ten teams in competition because of a little bad luck which we had to encounter Verna and I placed fourth in the national contest. On Tuesday morning I didn't get up very early as I felt I needed a little extra sleep. We left the hotel for the Centennial at 9 o'clock. That was the day that Victor and Arnold gave their demonstration. At noon we had the pleasure of being entertained at luncheon In the Century Cafe, by the Dallas Hardware and Implement company. Here we had ajrery enjoyable time. After this we were permitted to go sight-seeing around the grounds. In the evening we were entertained at a dinner in the English Tavern on the Centennial grounds. This was followed by a show "Cavalcade" which was very realistic and picturesque. In this show was a cast of three hundred people and twenty-seven different scenes. Both the dinner and show were with the compliments of Sears, Roebuck and Company. Wednesday morning we arose rather early and very sadly packed bur suitcases because we hated to think of leaving after we remembered the many lovely times we had while in Dallas. Wednesday noon the official annual banquet was held at the English Tavern with Mr. C. L. Hill, President of the National Dairy Show and many other speakers present. At this banquet medals and other prizes were awarded to the winning club members. The three members of the Nebraska judg - ing team each received a medal as an award for placing second as a team in the national judging contest. After the banquet we started on our journey homeward. On our way we watched a cotton gin at work. This was very interesting. Wed - nesday night we stayed in Oklahoma City at the Alamo Plaza Courts. From here we continued our journey homeward On Thursday. Traveling a good speed the entire day we arrived in Lincoln, Nebraska, our good old home state, at about 7 o'clock after having eaten breakfast la Oklahoma City and dinner in Eldorado, Kansas. Although I was very glad to get home, if I had the opportunity I know I would be only too glad or willing to go again. MARGARET M. OHRT. I have returned from my trip to the National Dairy Show.

I am very proud to say that 4-H Club work has encouraged me so much that I have gained more than I really thought club work ever had in it. 1 was just like everyone else, afraid to tackle It. But I was interested enough in it to try it. And now I know that it is worth trying for. I wait to the last to say a thousand times thanks to you creameries and dairies that have taken so much interest in our 4-H work.

Yours very truly, ARNOLD MOORE, 4-H Club Member and Demonstrator The Trip to the National Dniry Show In starting our trip to the National Dairy Show we left Lincoln about eight o'clock on Thursday morning. It was cloudy and had just started sprinkling. We traveled south and the farther south we traveled we saw more rain. When we arrived at Manhattan, Kansas it had rained about three inches. We arrived here at about 1:30 in the afternoon. We ate dinner at a cafe and then went out to watch the boys practice judging. We stayed at the Gillette Hotel in Manhattan. While we were here we practiced our demonstration a couple of times. The next morning we got up at 5 and left for Stillwater, Oklahoma. Here we practiced some more judging and went back to the hotel. The hotel at wbict we stayed was the Going Hotel. The next morning we drove to Oklahoma City where we visited the State's best dairy. We did this while the boys still practiced judging. They finished at about 2in the afternoon. We then drove to Ardmore, Oklahoma where we stayed at the Whelllngton Hotel. The next morn - ing we got up early and left for Dallas, Texas. We arrived at 10:00, registered at the Lone Star Hotel and then went out to the Centennial to look around for a while. The next morning we got up early because the boys had to be ready to judge at 7:30 on Monday morning. The boys had ten classes to judge and give reasons on. The girls had to give their demonstration in the afternoon about 2. We attended it and then looked around a little more and then went back to the hotel. </seg>

We arrived in Oklahoma City at about nine o'clock ana stayed all night at a touurist camp. The next day we left for home again. We arrived at Lincoln on Thursday night at about 6 o'clock. We ate supper and departed from our good friends and Victor and I went home. ;.;'"'¦' This concludes our trip to the National Dairy Show.

I am writing to thank you for the lovely trip that we had to Dallas, Texas. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it and shall never forget it. Although we differed from the judges in the contest and did not get first, we did our best. Thanking you again, I remain, OTTO PFEIFFER, JR. Elkhorn, Nebraska. My Trip to Texas We left Lincoln, Nebraska from the Dairy Extension building on Thursday, October 8, 1936. May I say this was one of the most wonderful trips I have ever been on. The first day we were to stop at Manhattan, Kansas in the afternoon to practice judging at the Kansas State College. That night we stayed in Manhattan and we practiced reasons which we took on the cattle that afternoon. On Friday we were to judge at the Oklahoma A. and M. College and </seg>
         <seg id="p348">__!'&lt; )RT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we certainly did see some lovely cattle. We spent that night at Still - water and were going to make Oklahoma City the next morning and were going to judge at the Gaylord Guernsey Farm and Meadow Lodge Guernsey Farm. At these two latter places we saw some very fine Guernseys and had a fine workout. On Saturday afternoon we saw the cotton fields in the South. We drove that night until we got to Ardmore. The next morning we went on to Dallas. When we arrived at Dallas, we went immediately to our hotel which was the Lone Star Hotel. That afternoon we went to the Centennial which was even more magnificient than I had expected. The Centennial was very beautiful. We looked around that afternoon and went to bed early that night for the contest was to start at 7:30 the next morning. The next morning arrived and we were all set for the contest. The day was a slow and tiresome chic and we were glad when it was over. That night we tried to figure out about what we might get but thought if w. got in the first ten teams we would be lucky. Yon can imagine our surprise the next morning when we found out that we got second. Dur trip was really sniml and it will never be forgotten. We started back on Wednesday and were home on Thursday. These are the highlights o: our trip hut 1 couldn't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed It. OTTO I'FKIFFER. .111. As a iii'-niliei- of the Pair.

         <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION My Trip to the Texas Centennial ; We left Lincoln Saturday morning, October tenth, about a quarter after six. My mother, father, sister, my teammate Betty Jean Cooley, and I went i:i our car. We had good roads most of the way except for a few miles in southern Nebraska and In northern Kansas. The seen iry in northern Kansas was beautiful with the lime stone fences and buildings. It was the first time I had ever seen lime stone fences. We stopped at Manhattan and went through the Agriculture Col - lege Campus. The Campus was by far more beautiful than Nebraska's. The buildings were made from lime stone also. . South of Heringtoii, Kansais we saw our first oil well. These oil wells were Splattered with oil and did not add much beauty to the surrounding country. We arrived in Eldorado, Kansas around twelve thirty o'clock and ate our luiuh there. Eldorado, Kansas was a large oil center. The pumps on tie oil wells look like big grasshoppers moving up and down. We noved along toward Oklahoma after dinner. The car 'vas needing some gas so we stopped at a Ponca City filling station. We went inside and he had the radio tuned to the Nebraska and' Minnesota football game. Minnesota had the ball on the three yard line and first and goal, boy what,a teiise moment, but Minnesota didn't score. In Oklahoma City we bought a newspaper which said Nebraska lost to Minnesota seven to nothing. The folic wing day we stopped at Meadow Lodge farm, Mort Wood's farm, and a: Norman, Oklahoma. We saw the Campus and buildings of.Oklahoma State University. At these various places we saw many interesting things. &#132;- • We arri"ed in Dallas about six o'clock Sunday evening. While at Dallas we gave our demonstration and took in the Centennnlal and the National Dairy' Show. The subject of our demonstration was "How to Select a Good Dairy Cow." In our class of demonstration there were thirteen different states represented. In the National Dairy Show I saw the cow that holds the world record In n ilk and butter fat production. I also saw judging of all five breeds if dairy cattle. . The thing that interested me most was the grand champion Guernsey female and Ayrshire female. </seg>
         <seg id="p350">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the Dairy Barn I saw an exhibit that showed the Improvement in the Texas beef cattle, beginning with the old Texas Long Horns and ending up with the registered White Face cattle. Wednesday evening Sears and Roebuck had a dinner for us at the English Tavern. After the dinner we all went to the show "Cavalcade of Texas". This had different scenes of Texas history. After the Guernsey show was over we left Dallas and were headed for home. When we came home we took a different route. We stopped' at Piano and went through a cotton gin. We spent our first night at Wetumka, Oklahoma. The next morning we got an early start and by noon we had reached' Independence, Kansas wlifeh is Aif. M. Landon's home town. We went through Ottawa, Lawrence, and Topeka, Kansas before arriving In Nebraska. Our next stop was at our farm just east of Lincoln. We had a swell trip hut it sure felt good to get home. E. L.

National Dairy Show &amp; Texas Centennial at Dallas, Texas We started to the National Dairy Show and Texas Centennial at Dallas, Texas on Thursday morning, October Bth. Mr. Cook took Arnold Moore and I to Lincoln where we joined several other Nebraska 4-H teams. There were seven of us besides our sponsors, Mr. Cook, Mr. Flack and Miss Noyes. We left Lincoln at about nine-thirty and followed highway No. 77 to Manhattan, Kansas where we made our first stop. We arrived there at 12:30. The 4-H and college judging teams judged cattle at the Kansas Agricultural College. We stayed all night at the Gillet Hotel </seg>
         <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION in Manhattai. Next morning we were up bright and early and on our way to Stillwater, Oklahoma where the judging teams again judged at Oklahoma Agricultural College. We stayed at Stillwater, Oklahoma all night. The next morning we went to the Gaylord Guernsey Farm which is nea- Oklahoma City and in the afternoon we went to another large dairy ft.rm near Oklahoma City where the judging teams practiced judging. Alter which we drove on to Ardmore, Oklahoma where we stayed Saturday night. The next morning we drove on to Dallas, arriving thei eat 10 o'clock. It started to rain on us almost as soon as we entered Kansas and it rained on jus most of the way through Kansas and Oklahoma. The most Interesting things to me were the different crops and oil wells. We saw the Wat oil wells In Kansas. They are very numerous and in Oklahoma City they are all through the city, some of them are just across the street from the capltol building. We also saw what lo called a tank farm at Ponca City, Oklahoma. It is a tract of land entirely covered with large tanks filled with oil. Another thing which was Interesting were the cotton fields and watching them pick cotton. It was being done by hand and looked like very hard work. On our way home we went through a cotton gin in Texas. After we arrived at. Dallas we had dinner and drove out to the Centennial we spent all afternoon and also all day Monday. Tuesday afternoon we gave our quality cream demonstration at the National Dairy Show. Tuesday evening we were entertained at a banquet by Sears-Roebuck and Company at the Old English Tavern at the Centennial. After the banquet we all went to the Texas Cavalcade. This was the most interesting play I have ever seen because It gave the complete history of Texas. On Wednesday morning we again went, to the Centennial and at noon we were again entertained to a banquet at which the awards, were given to-the winning judging and demon - stration teams. ;'. After the banquet we started home. The first afternoon we drove to Oklahoma City where we stayed all night. On Thursday we cams on home arriving In Aurora about 9:30. I liked this trip as much as anything I have ever done and I owe it tt 4-H Club work. I think 4-H Clubs are very good because they give you good opportunities for trips and for gaining knowledge of all phases of agriculture. Tbe expenses of this trip were all paid by different dairy and creamery associations in Nebraska which are interested in 4-H Club work and in the quality cream program. Mr. Cook, Mr. Flack and Miss Noyes are very nice people to travel with. They have done everything In their power to make this trip as interesting and enjoyable as possible.' I wish to close by saying that it is well worth </seg>

We passed hough Po uca City which is one of the most beautiful cities I have tint 717 i at PO"Ca CUy We saw the lar Sest ta»'&lt; field in the United States. This tank field is composed of many tanks of oil and gasoline and covers many acres. At noon we arrived at Stillwater. After dinner the team practiced judging at the Oklahoma A. and M. College in Stillwater. We remained in Stillwater that night The next morning we ate breakfast in Stillwater and started on aiioUi r lap of our journey. We stopped northwest of Britton at the Gay ord Guernsey farm and spent the rest of the morning in judging prac ice </seg>
         <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Coming back to Britton for dinner, we then went to the Meidow Lodge farm southwest of Oklahoma City and spent most of the afternoon judging there. Towards evening we drove to Ardmore where we spent the night. On the way there we passed through the Arbuckle Mountains which I enjoyed very much. - -"J ' . ' ¦' -' We left Ardmore the next morning and arrived in Dallas, Texas about 10 a. m. There we registered at the Lone Star Hotel. In the afternoon we went out to the Centennial grounds for a short time. We were tired and soon came back, however. The next day was the day of the contest and we went out to the Centennial Grounds early that morning. The contest started at 8:30. At 2p. m. wehad a box lunch. We were not allowed to leave tne judging arena. The contest ended at 6. That was a long, hard day and we were all pretty tired that night. ¦The nextiday we looked around the Centennial Grounds. At noon we had dinner at the Century Cafe. Most of us spent the afternoon visiting the different halls of exhibition, those that did not havo to demonstrate. The Ford Building I thought very Interesting and educa - tional. Also, Humble *s Hall of Texas History. That night we all attended a banquet at the English Tavern. Afterward we attended the Cavalcade of Texas which was a pageant telling the history of Texas, Both of these were gifts of Sears, Roebuck and Company. The next jmorning we came out to the Centennial Grounds again and spent the morning looking around. At noon we had a final dinner at the English j Tavern. We were entertained by Scottish bagpipers. After this banquet the presentation of awards was made. As soon as this was over we started home. On the way back we stepped and watched a cotton gin in operation. A7s I had never seen anything of this kind before I was much interested. It takes about 15 minutes for the cotton to be made into a bale. Leaving this scene we drove all the way to Oklahoma City where we spent the, night. It was a very Interesting drive because Oklahoma has many lakes and lots of trees. The next morning we left Oklahoma City and our next stop was Eldorado, Kansas where we stopped for dinner. Leaving there we started on our last lap home. We arrived in Lincoln Thursday night. October 15, about 6:30. I thought that quite a feat, having breakfast in Oklahoma, dinner in Kansas and supper in Nebraska. At Lincoln we parted, each of us going to his or her respective home. That is the worst'thing about a trip. The time always comes to say goodbye. This trip i was the longest trip I_ we ever taken and the first time .--'¦"'' .-I '. ' ¦ ¦'-.- "¦..'" / . ... 12 </seg>
         <seg id="p354">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I have ever been south. I enjoyed it immensely and wish to thank those who made the trip possible. CLYDE DECKER. I am very happy to be able to write this letter of thanks to you. I know that no matter what I say, still will not make you feel the appreciation I have of such a fine trip. Thank you a lot for what you have done to make my trip to the National Dairy Show at Texas possible. Our team placed 2nd among the 20 teams represented. I placed sth In the contest as an individual, placing Ist in Guernseys, and 3rd in Ayrshires to win a Gold .Medal. We had a swell time. This was my first trip to the National Dairy Show and possibly the last time I'll ever get to see so many fine cattle at once. On Tuesday evening Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. took us to a show the "Cavalcade", which was a real acting show of the beginning of Texas up to the present day. This was more of an educational show than one can ever learn of Texas by reading its history. Thanking you again for making my trip possible. Respectfully yours, RUSSELL PFEIFFER, Lincoln, Nebraska. My Trip to the National Dairy Show And what a grand trip it was, different country, different atmosphere, different people, different occupations, new friends and a swell time. It was a trip I shall never forget, especially as it marks the ending of my 4-H judging in a 4-H club. We left on Thursday morning for Manhattan, Kansas. We, in - cludes Mr. Flack, our judging coach; Miss Noyes, Home Demonstration Agent of Douglas county and a coach of the Girls Demonstration team; the two girls, Verna Penke and Margaret Ohrt; Mr. Cook, County Agent of Hamilton county and coach of the boys demonstration team; the boys, Victor Hunt and Arnold Moore; and our judging team Clyde Decker, Otto Pfeiffer, Jr., my brother and myself, Russell Pfeiffer. We went in two cars driven by Mr. Flack and Mr. Cook. In Kansas the judging team practiced judging cattle at the college. We judged eight classes, took down notes on them and gave reasons on them at night, in the hotel to Mr. Flack. </seg>
         <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION On Friday morning we left for the A. and M. College in Oklahoma where we judged eight classes in the afternoon, took down notes and gave reasons in the evening to Mr. Flack in our hotel. On Satur - day morning we went to the Gaylord Guernsey farm in Oklahoma where we judged four classes of Guernseys and took down, notes, In the after - noon we went to the Meadow Lodge Guernsey farm in Oklahoma and judged four more classes of Guernseys. That evening we went on to Ardmore, Oklahoma about 160 miles from Dallas. We practiced giving reasons on the classes for our last time Saturday evening at Ardmore, Oklahoma. Sunday morning we went on to Dallas, Texas, to the Lone Star Hotel, where we registered and got settled for a few days Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas have many rocky fields throughout the states, many places so thick that a person can hardly step without stepping on them. Acres and acres of rocks could be seen. In Oklahoma and Texas, of course, we saw lots of cotton fields. People were picking cotton In the fields and the gins were at work cleaning the cotton- On our way (back we stopped at a gin and watched them gin cotton,, which was very interesting. We also saw a lot of beef cattle throughout Oklahoma and Texas out on the ranges. On Sunday afternoon we went out to the Centennial for a few hours to look around. The Centennial was very beautiful, especially at night with the color scenes on the water pools and buildings. We all went to bed very early Sunday evening for our big contest on Monday. Monday morning the judging team started judging a little after 8 and we worked all day until about 5:30, judging five classes of cows; one of each j breed and giving oral reasons on these and judging five classes of heifers of each breed. Guernseys, Jerseys, Holsteins, Brown Swiss and A. rshlres and writing reasons on these. We were pretty tired when the contest wa.s oyer and retired fairly early that night. Tuesday we took in the Centennial. At noon we were given luncheon by the Dallas Hardware and Implement club and we were given dinner in the evening at the English Tavern by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., after which we were taken to the "Cavalcade" a true acting show of the - history of Texas, from the beginning to the present day. It was a very fine show and very educational. Wednesday noon was the official Annual Banquet at the English Tavern where the awards were given to the winning judging and dem - onstration teams. After this luncheon we started for home, traveling: to Oklahoma City yet Wednesday evening and staying at the Alamo Plaza Courts. • On. Thursday morning we started again quite early and arrived Ir Lincoln at 6 o'clock in the evening. </seg>

         <seg id="p384">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOME ECONOMICS SECTION PROGRAM TUESDAY MORNING, JAN. 5, 1937 Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, Presiding The stage setting for the Home Economics program was especially beautiful this year. The background hanging was a heavy taupe colored curtain. On this was hung a cotton textile print with deep rich red tones predominating in the colors. This color blended with the mass of deep red foliage plants which were placed around the stage. On the deep mahogany speaker's table was placed a bowl of red roses. Two tall black candelabra were placed on either side of the hanging and were filled with white candles which added the final touch of distinction to the setting. We are grateful to the committees from the College of Agriculture who provided these decorations. The Thirty-Second Annual Session of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture opened with Community Singing led by Mrs. Altinas Tullis accompanied by Miss Margaret Rosene. The group was divided into two sections, sopranos and altos and special emphasis was placed on directing music in local club groups. The Music Project Song-of-the-Month was used for each of the song periods.' The two songs sung during the first music period were: A Love Dream Stars of The Summer Night A resume of Mrs. Tullis' remarks and her direction of the group singing are included: Mrs. Tullis: "Greetings to all of you—you who are new and you with whom I have had the pleasure of singing and talking last summer at the Mother's Vacation Camps. Let's begin our singing this morning with "The Dream of Love" of Liszt. It Is a fine melody and the words are beautiful. We must phrase at the comas and put the impulse note on the first beat of the measure, "Ah, Love ..." and so on. Sing the song smoothly but with a definite impulse, two beats in the measure ... One of the altos sang a low B flat on the last chord. We had a complete chord with better balance than with only two notes. What perfect singing beauty in the "Stars of the Summer Night!" This song was written about the same time as "My Old Kentucky Home," "Old Black Joe," and other Stephen C. Foster songs. Musical History </seg>
         <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION tells us Isaac Woodbury wrote the music and we know our own Henry Wadswqrth Longfellow was the author of the beautiful poem." Mrs.' Tullis had the group practice speaking the pure vowels in such words as "night," (1) "hide", (1) and'sleeps", (c) "she," (c) then the modified vowels, "stars," (ah), "of" and "the" before the con - sonant having the sound of the short v, and so on. She talked much of the technlQue of singing and used the exercise "Ah" on one tone then on 1 five tones and then on scales with directions as to placing the teeth, loose jaw, standing position, and poise with the weight on the ball of the foot. " Adequate breathing for vital singing presupposes a very consider - able development beyond habitual breathing for merely living, or even for conversational speech. In developing this breathing the singer should not divert from the muscular processes of natural breathing. Development should be in the nature of an extension of those processes. There should be no attempt to consciously "control" the breath in the vocal art. "Breath control" must come automatically resulting from correct and persistent use of the complete vocal mechanism under conditions of proper coordination. All of the "conscious" control of the breathing act must be centered upon inhalation. Drink in the breath through parted lips rather slowly at first, with the sensation that you are inflating the body to the lowest point of the. torso. When this is done correctly your feeling should be that the lower throat opens to its capacity and that the body, expands in a lateral "spread" at front, back, and sides. The most apparent enlargement will be noticed In the front abdominal wall—from the chest bone down to the pelvis. Remember, do not pull up the chest nor alloy, the diaphragm to flatten nor recede during inhalation. The lower ribs will spread like a basket, (not lift) sideways. Remember, remember—the level of the upper chest should neither rise with Inhalation nor descent with exhalation." Following the music period, the audience was asked to rise and to repeatj together the Club Collect: ) Keep us, 0 God, from pettiness.. Let us be large In thought, In. word, in deed. Let us be done with fault-finding and leave off self - seeking. May we put away all pretense and meet each other face to face, without self-pity and without prejudice. May we never be hasty in judgment and always generous. Teach us to put into action our better impulses, straight forward and unafraid. Let us take time for all things; make us grow calm, serene, and gentle. Grant us that we may realize it Is the little things that create dif - ferences; that in the big things of life we are as one. And may we strive to touch and to know the great common woman's heart of us all; and, O Lord God, let us not forget to be kind."—Mary Stewart. - 13 -1 </seg>

"As I plan for the meetings each year, I wonder why the women attend these meetings? "omen Is it to visit with old friends? Is it to make new ones? Is it to find inspiration and courage to face the tasks ahead? Is it to relax and forget problems and difficulties of the past year- Each o„e of „s wi,, probably answer the .uestiou within oursehes'. </seg>
         <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION But this I do know—that we -who attend must have gained something from these meetings or we would not carry the message back so that each year finds more home-makers gathered here for these programs. "The problems that confront the mothers and home-makers of to - day are much more varied than those of yesterday arid yet the rural .mother finds time to read the new book, attend the project club, plan the church social, study the political situation, be a companion to her husband and a counsellor to her children. It's a pretty big task lor us, but with the Extension service teachingxus how to arrange our time, to use methods which lighten our household tasks and to make a wise choice between the essentials and the non-essentials, we are achieving success. "Is it any wonder that the Washington people were surprised when the conference of country women of the world drew 7,000 of our Women to that convention? I had.tiie good fortune to be at that conference and I found that it makes no difference from which part of the globe you come, we all have the same hopes, the same problems, and the same joys. ' :: .-/,¦ ;. . '¦'. &#132;¦ ¦•¦/. ".¦'¦¦ ¦ "In the reports given by the women of fifteen nations, I learned that they are studying health problems, nutrition problems and the wise use of native resources and the marketing of surplus products, just as you and I. They are praying for Peace just as you and.l; and in my mind are the words of Fru Michelet of Norway when she said: "Our communities and our countries have great need of just the values we have gained here — Love The world needs love, a thing which can bs given only in - : dividually. Joy Life should be joy; it should not be what it so often is— loneliness and desolation and fear. Peace It is in the hearts of men and women that we must build peace. The attitude to peace that we build in the home will be the attitude of the world." This,attitude to peace is another responsibility which Nebraska women will want to add to this long list. I am hoping that in. our program of this week, you are going to find something helpful and inspirational. I do think that Nebraska women are going to be much happier this year because we are sing - ing more and we can not feel depressed when we sing. When we started our music work in our project club this fall this memory came to me: when I was very small I heard a man say that smiling mothers are all'right'but to him a mother who sang was a blessed one because a singing mother had no time for fault finding or scolding. </seg>
         <seg id="p388">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The thought I would like to leave with you this morning is in this poem called "Patterns": Patterns In a cozy room of a cottage small «. Stands a great four-poster bed, With its pillow soft, its linen fair And a Quaint old patch work spread. And though each of its blocks Are a different shape and many a varied hue, Yet so deftly placed that the pattern made Is pleasing to the view. And tender hands wove a thread of love Throughout its many seams. And gentle hands tucked it into place As I lapsed into childhood's dreams. .Vow the years have added their weight of cares And stern are the ways of life So today I seek this riuiet room To rest from wearisome strife. And I take the spread from the oaken press And lie beneath its friendly fold And again I feel the sweet caress Of the hands, as in days of old. And I think of my life as a tangled maze Of kindly deeds and abuse And I pray, like the spread, it may prove to be A pattern of beauty and use. —George Timlin. Kxplanation of Exhibits Miss Muriel Smith was introduced as one of the Exhibit Chairmen and was asked to explain the exhibits which were all placed in the lower floor of Student Activities Building this year. Miss Smith: "First I would call attention to the display of electrical appliances ' on the south side of the room which have been loaned through the courtesy of the Lincoln dealers. The rural electrification program in several counties has brought inquiries regarding choice of electrical equipment. Many types of appliances are on display, some are good choices, some are poor choices. Some are pieces of expensive equip - ment and some are less costly. Miss Ruby Loper is In charge of this exhibit and will be glad to demonstrate and explain the various pieces ot equipment on display. </seg>
         <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Attention is next called to the Four H Club Exhibits which are a feature each year at this meeting. These exhibits in the northeast -corner are the ones which were sent to the National Club Congress which is held at the International Livestock Show in. Chicago each year. •Clothing, Girl's Room, and Canning Exhibits are on display. One display case In the north side of the room exhibits a collection of antique glass ware. These were collected and arranged by Miss Evelyn Metzger. The prize winning jars which placed in the Ball Canning Contest sponsored each year by the Ball Glass Jar Company are on display in the next case next to the antique exhibit. The names of the prize win - ners are to be found oh cards under each exhibit of three jars each. This year there were 15 entries in the contest which were judged and placed. Ralph Copenhaver, Recreation Specialist In Extension has arranged an interesting, exhibit of home made games and puzzles. These are placed In an exhibit case on the south wall of the room. Those of you who have been doing hobbles will surely want to see this exhibit. Last, but not least, I would like to call your attention to the fine exhibit which has been loaned to us for this meeting through the courtesy of the Country Gentlemen Magazine Company. Miss Hogeland has come to us from this company and will be with the exhibit to answer question.-' Miss ißrown: "Each year it has been our custom to present to this group the Grand Champion Four H Demonstration Team which won the highest honors in the State Fair Contest.

This year due to poor gardens and crop conditions, we feel that it Is necessary to economize in meal planning where we can without sacrificing food value. The One Dish Dinner which we will make today is one which will use left-over food which might otherwise be wasted. It is called tamale pie." This is 0 „. rec , pe for tama(e p(e; 2 cups thick cornmeal mush 1 cup tomato 1 cup meat 1 small onion \4 teaspoon Chili Powder, salt and pepper Before beginning to cook we are sure that our hair is tidy and neat and we always have our hands washed to insure our food being clean ' * c have washed our hands just before this demonstration </seg>
         <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION First we will prepare our onion. We have found that when we peel an onion underwater, *t WM not hurt our eyes. The term "one-dish meal" is applied to a combination of substantial foods of a meal into one dish. Such dishes usually contain the protein —-meat, eggs Or Cheese; starch—potatoes, rice, macaroni or cereal; and at least part of the vegetables. Sometimes the protein and starch are combined into one dish and a vegetable served with it. One of the chief values of one dish meals Is that they may be prepared iv the early part of a busy day and cooked or reheated just before meal time. Now I -will cut the onion finely. Cold water will remove the onion odor from my hands. I will now put the 2 tablespoons of fat into the skillet and add the onion and the one cup of meat which has been cut into small pieces. We then heat them. This meat might be some which was left over from the canned pork which we opened for dinner yesterday. Any kind of meat which we happen to have left over, either pork, beef, or lamb will do. We might also have used left over meat from a roast. If it has become hard and dry, it might be better to put it through a food chopper instead of cuttfng it into pieces. ¦ ¦¦'.I /:¦-¦ : ¦¦¦ "¦•''¦' ¦ -..'' '¦¦.•"¦ By just using our imagination and staple foods combined in various ways, we may prepare any number of One dish meals. Foods may be combined in a number of ways. We may use a combination of meat and vegetables In soups and stews—we might use fish or vegetable chowders—salads using meat and vegetables—souffles—meat pies— creamed or escalloped dishes—-or cheese and egg combination dishes. Now;, that the meat is heated, we place about half the cornmeal which we have reheated into this buttered casserole. Since we often like cornmeal mush for supper and it does fit into our low cost diet, this could be some which was left over from supper last night. Other left-over cereals might be used or we might use macaroni or cooked rice and mix it with the meat mixture instead of having it in layers. I will now mix one cup tomatoes with our meat mixture. Other vegetables as peas or corn might be used in place of tomatoes. These might be left oyer too or if we opened some we will plan to use the rest of ithem In tomorrow's menu. I will season this with salt and a very little pepper and add one-fourth teaspoon chill powder to flavor it. We have to use the salt in accordance to the amount which has been used in the meat. If-our. meat had been left-over ham it would have needed but a little salt. Now pour this mixture over the layer of the mush In the casserole and cover It with the rest ot the mush. I will now place the tamale pie in the oven to brown. We j think that this is a very practical dish for farm families be- </seg>

         <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION One dish meals are an easy and appetizing way of providing two or more of these necessary foods at one time, thus simplifying our meal planning. Our menu which we have planned for today is: Breakfast: Stewed prunes, whole wheat cereal with milk, eggs baked in cream sauce, whole wheat toast and butter, and hot cocoa. Dinner: Tamale Pie, carrot strips, whole wheat bread and butter, apple sauce and a glass of milk. Supper: Creamed split pea soup with toasted bread strips, cab - bage salad and gingerbread. Checking our menu with the food guide, we find that four cups of milk, one cup for each, breakfast and dinner as a beverage, one cup In the soup and one-half cup with the cereal and to complete the required amount we decided to bake the eggs in cream sauce, in addition the cornmeal mush in the tamale pie has been cooked In milk. For the two friits, we have stewed prunes for breakfast and apple sauce for .tinner. For protein we more than meet the requirements with milk, eggs, meat, and dried peas. We also have plenty of whole grain products in the whole wheat bread for breakfast and dinner and whole wheat ;ereal and the cornmeal in the tamale pie. -This menu also meets the economy needs of this year when our gardenfe have almost failed us. Our raw vegetables, cabbage and car - rots arjs ones which are economical to buy In quantities in the fall and will keep for several months when stored. We like tomatoes for their vitamin C content, their Color and acid flavor, and considering the im - portance of'these, they are also economical. The apples are home products as are wheat cereal, cornmeal, eggs, meat, milk and butter. In planning the low cost diet we use as many of our home products as we can. We have toasted bread strips using old bread which might otherwise be wasted instead of buying crackers. Tressle told you how we also used left-overs In the tamale pie. WeTjfind that full flavored foods as meat, onions and tomatoes, used by perspns living on a low food budget add interest to the meals. These foods, too, lend themselves well to one dish meals and make them in - valuable for our low cost budget. A well balanced diet is one which satisfies all body needs, protein, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins. Tressie will show how our meals have been planned to include sufficient quantities of these. The recent drouth has forced us to face the problem of securing adequate food with a very limited supply of home grown foods and </seg>

We find quite satisfactory amounts of iron in dried ijeas; the molasses in our ginger bread, whole grain cereals, whole wheat bread, eggs, lean meat in the tamale pie, prunes and raw cabbage. Iron is; needed for building blood. The body does not store iron in any amount so it is very necessary that our diet contain foods that are rich in iron each day. Iron is a part of the hemoglobin of the blood which carries oxygen through the body. Foods containing iron are even more necessary when a person has a cold J because a cold destroys the hemoglobin. This destruction con - tinues! even after one Is free from the cold so several sources ot iron should! be included in the diet for a considerable length of time following a coldJ other foods which contain a large amount of iron are—liver, which {is an excellent source, spinach or other greens as kale, dande - lions, or chard. White potatoes are also good sources of iron if the ¦peeling is used.

Carbohydrates and fats produce energy and heat. Foods which are proportionately high In energy or calories are whole wheat cereal, whole wheat bread, prunes, dried peas and tamale pie. Sugar is essentially an energy food, that is, It contains no protein. minerals, or vitamins. !¦ A well balanced diet must include not only enough calories, protein, and necessary minerals; but also enough of the vitamins to protect growth and health.

Vitamin Ais represented by the orange flags. We find milk, butter, carrots, and eggs are excellent sources of Vitamin A. The tamale pie is an excellent source of Vitamin A because Vitamin A is found in the tomatoes, lean meat, and the yellow cornmeal. Raw cabbage and prunes are good sources of Vitamin A, while we find fair amounts in whole wheat bread, whole wheat cereal, and apples. </seg>
         <seg id="p396">* REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE When the diet is lacking in Vitamin A, growth stops and there is loss of weight.

It is also found in milk fat and In egg yolk fat It occurs in germs of seeds, therefore It is in the whole grain products. The other Important vitamin which we studied in club work is Vitamin C. This is represented by the green flags. We find excellent sources of vitamin C in raw cabbage, and in the tomatoes in the tamale pie. Good sources of vitamin C are carrots and apples, while we find a fair amount in milk. A shortage of vitamin C is followed by scurvy, a disorder char - acterized by soreness and stiffness of the joints, soreness of the gums and loosening of the teeth.

We plan carefully the foods to serve with one dish meals as that makes our meals more interesting. We like salads using raw vegetables, raw fruits, or colorful fruits as they add color and crispness to the meals. We also like raw vegetables for the vitamin C content, which is most often lost in cooking. For deserts, we like custards when milk Is not used in the main dish. Fruit desserts and desserts using whole grain products are desirable when these are not used in the main dish. This is our serving of tamale pie for dinner.

         <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE OUR AMERICAN FOLK MUSIC MISS FANNIE R. BUCHANAN, lowa Extension Service There is always a lure and an intrigue about folk music. It is like a mystery story which no one has ever been able to unravel entirely Just as every person has ancestors who reach back behind him until the line is lost in the dim past, so every country has its folk music which reaches back into the beginnings of human life. We do not know when song first began. Someone has said the flrst singer was perhaps the first mother, and song is as old as the human family. The song, "Rock-a-bye Baby" may be one of these early lullabies which reaches back into the tree age for how else would a mother sing about a rock-a-bye baby in the tree top; and at least we have not been able to even discover in which country this old, old lullaby first came to life. These folk songs have been called Topsies in the music world be - cause they "never had no mother, never had no father—just growed " And so these folk songs have grown, being repeated from father to son. from mother to daughter for untold generations. Our American folk music is as different from folk music of other countries as America itself i_ different from other countries Every country has a different kind of songs which date back to the folk era There is the dirge or sorrow song, the love or wooing song, the lullaby the work songs, and the play or folk dance tunes. These are expressed In the medium of the country—lrish songs are Irish, German songs are German, but in America our folk songs are expressed in utterly different mediums because they were made by very different people. We have the Indian songs, but these differ according to the tribes. The war - like tomtom beat songs came from the war-like tribes; the flute call and wooing songs were found in the more developed tribes. The Pueblo songs of the south are songs of grinding maize, of planting and of harvesting. In the times when the Indian set his teepee by any stream and stalked wild buffalo and deer wherever they might be grazing, he had a song for everything. He sang of his moccasins, his bow, his pipe He sang of night and of dawn, of his hunting and of his play at quoits. Each of these songs was used only for its own special occasion and not as songs today are used, merely for entertainment. Imagine being an invisible observer in an Indian village on a morn - ing some three hundred years ago. The squaws are tending little gardens, tanning animal skins or grinding maize. The children hunt berries and bring eggs from the nests of wild fowls. Braves come and go. One carries a young wolf which he has caught In his pit-trap </seg>

An Indian guest arrives. -He has journeyed from beyond the great hills. He is welcomed and given food. Then the villagers gather around him. "Have you brought us any Songs?" they ask. He sings to them a song which he has made of the heavy wind against which he traveled: ¦ I ...¦'.!¦¦¦ ' ¦ I Bejln (One) No din (Wind) Ninga (lam) Nawendan (Master of it) I,t is a strange, chant-like song, scarcely a tune at all. But as the guesjt sings it again and again, in this repetition, the song expresses the feeling of mastery over a pushing wind. In a Pueblo village built upon a high mesa, or tableland, In the south, est country, an observer would hear still another kind of Indian music. There in the early morning the Sun Priest could be seen stand - ing on the flat roof of an adobe house. Behind him an attendant is striking chimes on a large metal plate. As the first sunbeams reach the mesa the priest begins the Sunrise Call. "Rise, arise, arise!" From every doorway, men, women, and children sing back the answer "Rise, arise, arise." While the singers all watch the sky the Sun Priest makes his morning prayer, in song, to the Sun God, and day comes to the Pueblo. ¦ 'I-.-'¦'¦ - i' 7 :" These tribal songs form the themes or "song germs" used by our American composers. Troyer has written his famous Rain Dance and Sunrise Call from themes of the Pueblo Indians. The throb of the Indian tomtom is heard in Skilton: and Prom An Indian Lodge by McDowell. Lieurance and. Cadman have embellished the Indian flute call andused these as themes in their most widely known numbers. Here, Miss Buchanan illustrated By the Waters of the Mlnnctonka with phonograph records and told the legend as it is written in her book "Short Stories of American Music" published by the Follett Publishing Company of Chicago. '-¦•¦: j. - . The Story of an Indian Song "'Long, long ago, a handsome brave of the Sun Clan loved a maiden of the Moon Clan. As children they had ranged the fields together trailing the bob-white to her nest in, the wild grass and making their breakfast of her dainty eggs. Sun Deer and Moon Deer the tribe folk had called them. Now Moon Deer was. a grown maiden, with lips as red as the wild strawberry and with eyes as bright as the friendly stars in the night sky. Of all the tribal maidens, Sun Deer thought her the most beautiful. He said to himself, "I will make a flute-call for Moon Deer, to coax her to the lodge of my mother. She shall be the moon- </seg>

Then Sun Deer made a wooing call to play on Ills flute. It was his love-call. He made It a coaxing call. When Moon Deer heard it she would come from the lodge of her fathers. He made it happy too Moon Deer must follow gladly when it led her to the lodge of his people' Gentle he made his call, for some day Moon Deer would croon this wooing call of his into her "wi-um" song as she rocked their own little papoose in its willow cradle. But all his happy dream faded. There was an ancient tribal law forbidding a brave of the Sun Clan to marry a maiden of the Moon Clan. The heart of Sun Deer was sad. All night on the Beach-of-the- IVh.te Sands he walked alone. From his wampum belt the flute of cedar hung silent. Vow he knew Moon Deer could not answer to his wooing. All night his moccasins wore a path in the white sand "I will walk alone." he vowed to himself, "until I find the Happy Hunting Grounds where tribal laws can be fo,_otten."-But when the morning sky was turning pink and every waking bird was calling to its mate Sun Deer forgot the tribal law. He lifted his flute to his lips and gave his coaxing call. All night, alone, in her birch canoe Moon Deer had drifted under the watching stars. The wavelets had talked to her softly as they rocked the light canoe, but Moon Deer had heard only the crying o! her own heart. Her eyes had been closed to the friendly stars above her All night she had thought of Sun Deer—how tall and straight he had grown, like the standing pine tree. She had remembered how together they hunted tiny shells to weave into her head-band—how as she had worked at It she dreamed that some day Sun Deer would call her to the lodges of his people. Now the dream was over. She knew a tribal law must not be broken. "If only," she said to herself, "if only my canoe could carry me to the Islands of the Blessed, there in the Happy Hunting Grounds I would wait for Sun Deer." Then when the waking birds began to sing and the sky was turn - ing amber and gold, a sweet flute call came floating over the waters Moon Deer lifted her face. The dancing wavelets were carrying her to the Beach-of-the-Wbite-Sands and to Sun Deer waiting there with his coaxing flute to his lips. </seg>
         <seg id="p401">...i. NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION As the lovers stood together, suddenly, out where the sky comes down to touch the water, the rising sun lifted through the morning mists like a mysterious island of light. "The Islands of the Blessed!" cried Moon Deer. From the edge of the sands, the rippling waters made a singing path of amber and silver and gold. "The trail to the Happy Hunting Grounds!" cried Sun Deer. ' An old Indian legend of Lake Minnetonka .tells how, ever since that morning long, long ago, the waters have danced and sparkled to hide the path where Sun Deer and Moon Deer walked hand in hand down the shining trail to enter the Happy Hunting Grounds. There is also an old, old flute call, which each generation of the Sun Clan has passed on. It is a coaxing call, yet happy too. It Is the love-call of Sun Deer. To a paleface friend, Thurlow Lleurance, descendants of the Sun Clan told the old legend and gave the little flute call, i From these, Lleurance made the song "By the Waters of the Minnetonka." The melody, coaxing, gentle, and happy, sings against an accompaniment of rippling piano tones which bring wavelets spar - kling in the morning sunrise, and help to preserve this legend and to show! how, even in tribal days, music could sing of love and devotion." Turning from the Indian folk music to the music Of the American Negro, we find an entirely different type of song expressed in entirely different ways. The Negro spiritual is like nothing else In all music literature. Other folk songs were made with just a melody but the NegrO spirituals were made with alto, tenor, and bass parts, harmoniz - ing with the leading melody. Perhaps they may have happened in some such situation as thls:- Moonlight over slave quarters of the "Old South!" In some Uncle Tom's cabin. dooryard, eager listeners are seated about the Negro preacher. There is excitement in the air for this is "Meettn' Night." In the life of the Negro worker of old plantation days "Meetln'." Is the community event. To his audience the preacher is actor as well as orator, he Is both story-teller and picture book. His words paint vivid pictures which hold his listeners spellbound.' Tonight the preacher is telling the Bible story of the chariot of fire which carried Elijah up to heaven. He reaches the climax—-"The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!" and pauses for breath— The Negro song leader is ready to take his turn. He springs to his feet.i his voice rings out, "Swing low, sweet chariot." The listening slaves take up the song, singing like a great trained choir in soprano, alto, tenor and bass parts, "Comin' fo'to cay me home." Then they pause while the voice of the leader again sings, this time quietly, </seg>
         <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Suing low. sweet chariot," and the chorus, softened to match the leader, gives the response, "Comin' fo' to cay me home." Once more the leader sings his line, now softly and wistfully. In the answering chorus every voice has softened until the music seems wafted down from the choir loft of some vast cathedral. Now, in a stronger voice, the leader sings a new line, "I looked over Jordan, an* what did I see?" Like the tones of a mighty pipe organ the chorus re - peats, "Comin' to' to cn'y me lioine." The leader's voice rises into a great climax, "A bund of angels comin' after me" and with its response the chorus sets the trees of the swamp a-quiver. Now the first part of the song is repeated, each line gradually lingering away into silence with the hush and mystery of moonlight. The Negro themes have been used by new world and old world composers. Dvorak's famous New World Symphony has one movement built on an old Negro spiritual theme. I Illustrated with phonograph records, "Largo" from Xew World Symphony.) Other types of American folk music are the class songs, such as cowboy ballads, the lumber jack songs, and the sea chantey. Then there are the pioneer story sons, the jig, and the dances. When great-grandfather took _r cat-grandmother to a com husk - ing, the party would end with a scene something like this: Tallow-dip lanterns shining down from rafters over piles of corn pushed back into corners. Laughing men and women singing as they circled through Arkansas Traveler or Captain .links. Astride the manger of the oxen there might be a fiddler callinß changes for a cotillion where hob-nail boots passed tilting hoop-skirts in a do-re-do or a grand right and left. But in those times, whether fiddled or sung, the rollicking tunes bad a part In every barn-raising, house-warming, or get-together party. Nobody knows when or by whom they were made, but their fun and snap were real trouble-chasers in the hard life of the early western settlers. With stories of range and "soddy", Captain Jinks and all the rest of them are now familiar from Texas to Maine and from New Or - leans to Alaska. They are the folk-tunes made by untrained singers and fiddlers while young America was growing up to more scholarly music. Simple as they are, their lilt and swing are coveted and bor - rowed by modern composers. Cinema producers and radio script writers depend upon them for atmosphere; the famous musician, Guion, used Turkey In the Straw for one of his fascinating concert pieces. Over and over this fun-music takes Its part in the music-literature of America. (Illustration with phonograph record, "Turkey in the straw.")

         <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION : Stephen Collins Foster, and with these the one song at least by Dan Emmett will live as a part of American folk music. The story of Dixie is like this:-. Young Dan Emmett earned his living by being funny. He was "end-man" in a minstrel show which long before a comedy film made people laugh, was the funniest show anywhere to be seen. The end - man was the funniest part of the show. He must tell a story In a way that would set sober sides shaking. He must dance a clog that would start even a deacon's feet a-tapplng, and his banjo and bones must turn any dirge Into a cakewalk. Dan Emmett could do all, this and more. The foolish songs he made up for the minstrel show "walk-around" would set the audience into such roars of laughter that the men of the troupe dubbed them the "hooray songs." But one season Dan Emmett just couldn't be funny. He had come up from a trip through the sunny south and the cold of the north was getting on his nerves. He was doing his best to amuse his New York audience and, what was more important, his manager. But sometimes he was even afraid he would lose his job. He just couldn't get a smile out of life—which was most unusual for Dan Emmett. One stormy Saturday night, when Emmett was feeling particularly low, the manager came to him. and said, "Dan, we'll have to have a new horray song right away. You get one ready for rehearsal Monday morning." Monday morning! It was then late Saturday night! But the man - ager was not to be put off. "Monday morning for rehearsal," he insisted. Downhearted, Dan Emmett turned toward his lodging house. The wind of the street set him shivering. With a disgusted shrug he ex - claimed, "New York.' Oh, I wish I was in Dixie!" As he hurried along he repeated the wish over and over to himself until without knowing it he was half singing the words in time to his hurrying footsteps. The next morning at his window, looking down upon the cold, wet street with its hurrying crowds, he again remembered the balmy days of the southland and he again repeated, "I wish I was in Dixie." This time he said it aloud and as he said it, he beat an impatient tattoo upon the rain-flecked window-pane. Unconsciously he repeated the words and the tattoo, and unconsciously he fitted them- to the rhythm ¦of his quick steps of the night before—"l wish I was in Dixie!" Days of sunshine, nlghtß of song—in Dixie. The words were a sort of Magic. The end-man forgot the cold New York street. He forgot t From How Man Made Music. Follett Publishing Co., Chicago. </seg>
         <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that he had to make a new song. He was hearing the punk-a-punk of the banjo strings. He was hearing the singing Negroes. He was roaming over a sunny plantation lawn. Horray, to live and die in Dixie! The rhythm of his quick steps as he had hurried along the night before belonged with the idea, so the tune, of course, had the stirring beat of a quick step mingled with the punk-a-punk of banjos. The melody that came to Dan Emmett had the smile of the south and the swing of a New York street crowd. And so, on a bleak day In a northern city, Di.vle, the famous song of the sunny south was born. Monday morning at rehearsal the men of the troupe pronounced the new song a "rouser." and the manager said, "I knew you could do it." Monday night Dan Emmett with banjo and bones sang Dixie for the walk-round, and the people cheered, just as people have ever since whenever and wherever Dixie is heard. The words are nonsense, but the jolly tune has kept the song a favorite when most of the other walk-rounds of the old days have been forgotten. The swinging melody and the dancing rhythm set every heart beating happily, and everyone agrees with the Negro orator who once said, "Dixie is a chune that can git up an' walk aroun* by itself!" That was the very kind of a tune the southern bandmaster needed when the North and the South went into the war of the sixties. But instead of being sung with banjo and bones, the tune was played by fife and drum. It made wonderful soldier march, and soon every man, woman, and child of the South was singing Dixie. It became the war cry of the southern armies. The people of the North loved Dixie, too. When at last the war was over, President Lincoln knew that the jolly little tune would be a real peace-maker. He had It played often at Washington, and North and South listened with mingled smiles and tears. So Dixie healed deep wounds and eased old scars, and became the darling of a united nation. But for all the lame of his song, Dan Emmett received very little money for it. He had not thought to have it copyrighted, so while It was selling by thousands Its popularity brought him not a penny. In his old age, when he could no longer work, he had to live as best he could on gifts of food and clothing. Yet in those hard years Dan Emmett still kept his love for fun and for song. When a show troupe came to his home town, Mt. Vernon, Ohio, he would often manage to make friends with the doorkeeper and have a free seat to hear the new songs. His happiest moment was when, as sometimes happened, Dixie </seg>
         <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION i was sung or played by the company band. It was then that the old end-man forgot his troubles and lived again the triumph of his better days. '•. .. One evening as he hobbled down the village street he discovered that a company he had Once known was to show that night at the opera house. It was a musical comedy and the old end-man forgot his stiff joints in his eagerness to hear the jolly songs. He had no money, but he was sure the manager would remember him, and he tottered up to the ticket window to ask for admission. But the manager was not there. A brisk young stranger shook his head, "Sorry, sir, no free seats tonight." But something about the old man caught the attention of the ticket seller. He asked a lad standing near who the old man might be. "That's Dan Emmett," the boy told him. "He was a comedian and a song writer, but his songs never made him any money. Now he's down and out." The manager was passing and caught the name. "Dan Emmett!" he exclaimed. "Go bring the old gentleman back. He shall be our guest tonight." From the front row the stooped old man watched and listened attentively. At each number his eyes brightened. Yet at the close a shade passed over his face. Dixie had not even been used as an encore. But the curtain was up again. The-whole company had assembled on the stage. They came to the very front and turned toward Dan Emmett.; The band struck into Dixie! The manager signed for Dan Emmet to rise. How the people clap - ped! The stooping spine straightened. His little hooray song, as fresh and jolly as on its first night! The trembling limbs grew steady. The Dan Emmett who stood there was strangely different from the tottering old man who two hours before had turned away from the ticket window. The faded eyes were shining. The trembling lips smiled happily. What if people did give him food and clothing? He had given them a song—a song that would never grow old; a song that had helped to bring peace after war; a song that was the darling of his country. The bowed head lifted proudly. He was no longer Dan Emmett a poor old man, he was Dan Emmett the author and composer of Dixie! Folk songs have lived for untold generations and are proof of the quotation from our own poet, a quotation that almost became a proverb: "The towers, the domes, the temples fall- One breath of song outlives them all." </seg>

This may make It necessary to "run a bill" with the mer - chants about town, and is a type of credit known as the open book system. The dealers with whom these charge accounts are carried expect to be paid when the marketing of the farm products is com - pleted. This Is rather expensive for the dealer for his costs go on as usual, and unless he has enough capital to pay his own bills promptly he cannot take advantage of the discounts which would permit him to sell his goods more cheaply. Naturally he has to add these extra costs to the price of the goods he is Belling. ¦ Many dealers make a special price arrangement when they can get cash for their wares, thus saving the buyer quite a considerable sum when taken over a period of time. This is one source of short-term credit. Another way to get short-term credit for annual needs is to borrow from a bank, firm, or individual, using a warehouse receipt as collateral. When grain is stored in elevators it may be some time before it is sold but in the meantime the farmer can get cash because of this security. The fact that interest must be paid on the loan made on his warehouse receipt reduces the net profit on the grain. This credit usually costs from 5 to 7 per cent depending upon the local interest rates. Installment buying is another form of short-term credit. On'farms this is usually restricted to farm machinery, clothing, or household equipment. The cost of this credit usually starts at 12 per cent and may run to almost any figure. Reputable firms are reducing these costs as much as possible but there is a low point beyond which they cannot go. -: A firm with a great deal of money can discount its own purchases from the manufacturer but there Is still much bookkeeping expense connected with the recording of the contracts, the credit report on the buyer and his references, the mailing out of notices for pay - ments due, and receipts for payments made.. One of the largest mail order houses says that only 3 per cent of their sales to farmers are made on the installment plan. Even so, the November financial state - ment by this house showed that farmers had bought from them nearly a million and a half dollars worth of goods during that month alone. In a year's time these purchases would amount to over 17 million dollars. With many mall order houses operating on this installment payment plan this sum is probably multiplied several times. Some firms selling farm machinery urge a cash payment when possible, but if not, they arrange a budget plan of payment. This, means, for instance, that if a farmer buys a tractor he arranges to pay for it at intervals which are best suited to his periods of Income. We should not overlook the Small Loan Agencies which are some; times used by farmers as a source of short-term credit. Because farm income is so irregular except where dairy or poultry products are sold these companies do not always solicit farm business, though in certain </seg>
         <seg id="p408">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE areas they operate to considerable extent. The name, Small Loan Agency, refers to the size of the loans. Banks And it unprofitable to lend small amounts running from $50 to ?200 or $300, for they are allowed by law to charge only 6 or 7 per cent interest as a rule for they can't afford the overhead expense involved in loaning small sums. They frequently do it as a favor to their customers or as a bid for the business these borrowers might bring in later on, but it is costly unless easily salable collateral is given as security. In 28 states these small loan agencies operate under what is called the Uniform Small Loan Law. These loans are practically identical in all these states and limit the Interest rates to 3 or 3V_ per cent a month, which means 36 to 42 per cent a year. This cost may seem excessive but there is a con - siderable expense in servicing these loans since they use Chattel mort - gages as security. Some states have passed small loan laws calling for such low rates of interest that companies cannot afford to operate In them. This has led to "bootlegging," that is, financing companies operating Illegally, and consequently at terrific rates. However, just as with Installment buying, there are times when there seems to be no other way for the family to finance its needs, and when honorably operated these financing companies may serve the customer well. One should always look for the state license of the loaning firm, check - ing its date. It must be for the current year and is required to be prominently displayed. Since, however, net Income on a farm is only from S to 7 per cent, paying five times this rate for borrowing money is hardly good business. So far our discussion has been confined mostly to the farmer's use of credit for consumption goods. But he also needs credit for the pur - chase of seed, fertilizer, livestock or equipment. Borrowing for this type of goods is a sound practice for these goods produce income. They may pay for themselves and more besides. Thoughtful planning must precede the request for such a loan, and it must be followed up with thorough execution if It is to fulfill its purpose. This use of credit is the kind that can build a family's reputation with loaning agencies. Wisely used, It does not add to the burden of the family but eventually it achieves the whole objective of credit, which Is to take the family out of debt. All lending agencies prefer to place their money where it will produce the income to provide the articles the farm and the family need. No matter what the farmer buys, the money to pay for it eventually has to come from the farm itself. Where can this type of credit be secured? Sometimes from the local bank or an individual at the usual rates of interest prevailing in the state. Since business is only now beginning to relax a little the principal sources of these have been through the production credit associations, which were authorized by the Government in 1933. The Rehabilitation division of the Resettlement Administration makes this </seg>
         <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION type of loan to farmers who are not eligible for the PCA plan. These production credit loans, calling for 5 per cent Interest, In addition to furnishing a, satisfactory period and rate of interest, are budgeted. Under this budget plan the farmer, draws his money as he needs it. For example, a farmer might wish to go into potato produc - tion. He would make an estimate of the total amount of money he would need through the season and would plan with the association to draw as he needed it, taking some money for his fertilizer In the spring, later more for seed; then for his spray materials, and perhaps, in the fall, a digging machine. This same kind of planning would work out for corn production, or for a man who wants to enlarge his poultry business. Here he might wish to buy an incubator in the winter and later build a new brooder house. Both of these would involve consider - able cost,-so by dividing the periods for borrowing he reduces the inter - est he must carry until he begins to market his birds. While production, credit associations loan primarily fori goods which will produce farm income they will also loan money for im - provements for the farm home, such as the installation of running water, a new furnace, for a washing machine, refrigerator, or other household equipment. There is no reason why efficiency in the home should not be as necessary as efficiency on the farm. Some labor saving devices are essential to health, md make for better family living. If money can be borrowed at 5 per cent from the production credit associations, and the cash price with its discount paid for the washing machine, this is simply, good business. Money for college expenses can also be borrowed here. The point the family must decide is the need of the article for which they are considering borrowing. A new car, for example, might be desirable, but not practicable when the probable Income from the farm will not carry it comfortably. The principal point on which the association wants to be informed is whether or not the farm can produce the money necessary to pay for the articles in question. As was indicated earlier in this talk there must be careful planning in a family council before making the loan application. This is how it is done. First, see if the farm can purchase the things needed without the loan. Thus: Gross income anticipated from the farm . ? Family living expenses ..$ minus Farm operating expenses —$ Taxes, Insurance, interest and repayments on old debts ...... $ Net income—Can it purchase what is wanted?... $ </seg>
         <seg id="p410">REPORT OF iVEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE If not, the family should consider what type of production goods it should borrow for, basing it upon the facilities the farm affords. The amount of money that it is safe for them to borrow Is determined by the farm's ability to support the stock or give the yield ot a certain crop. Thus: Gross income plus added income earned through the new - loan $ Family living expenses $ minus Farm operating expenses 5 Taxes, insurance, interest and repayments on the old debts and this new one $ Net Income—Now can it purchase what is wanted? $ Time spent in this preliminary figuring will do two things. The husband and wife will each understand what their respective respons - ibilities In the loan are. and they have a perspective of the way ill which they are going to manage their business. In a production loan, which sometimes is only for a few months, she divides the yearly estimate into the period for which the money is being borrowed. Before seeing the lending agency there is another step which will save much time in the making of the loan. This consists in preparing a list of the family's assets and liabilities. This is called a "net worth" statement. Armed with this and his loan needs carefully worked out the farmer can show the lending agent that he and his family are looking upon their farm operation as a real business and that they know the value of good management. Every lending agency has a great deal of respect for this attitude on the part of the applicants and it is far more ready to consider a loan to them than to a family which does not seem to know where it stands financially and is vague about planning for the loan. So far we have looked only at the borrower's problem. Let us see what the lender's views are. The first thing the lender considers, as In the case of the real estate loan, is the character and reputation of the borrower. The security given for these short-term loans is more or less hazardous for it is usually in the form of a chattel mortgage on personal property, such as horses which may die, cows which may become unproductive, or crops which may be damaged by drought or hail. Again, these chattels may easily be sold without the knowledge of the lender by a conscience - less borrower. Then when the loan falls due and is not paid the security has disappeared. Carrying this to court involves a good deal of expense. If, as the time approaches for the repayment of the loan, the family sees it is going to be impossible to do it, the creditor should be visited, and the case laid before him. This is the honorable thing </seg>
         <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION to do. Perhaps the agent can work out some arrangement tor extend - ing the loan. At any rate there is a mutual understanding of the case, which serves to emphasize in the creditor's mind the responsibility the debtor feels for the loan. No loaning agency wants to foreclose on chattels. Selling them is an expensive process and it requires the services of several people to see such a sale through. This is why the character of the borrower is so Important. In the last analysis, these loans are character loans. Many.times parents take the stand that they do not want their children to know the financial problems of the family. This is a mis - take. As a rule, children of high school age are keenly Interested, and they are old enough to realize that these matters are confidential. The. repayment of a loan frequently calls for sacrifices on the part of everybody in the family, and it is only fair that they have an under - standing of the responsibility from the time the loan is being considered. If allowed to share In planning for it, they will have an Interest In the purchases made with money, the way in which the plans work out, adjustments in the plans that unlooked for circumstances may demand, and in general, an education in the use of credit. The Farm Credit Administration has been especially interested in teaching young people the use of credit. This is being done through a special device by which 4-H club members and the Future Farmers of America may borrow money from production credit associations. They are taught principles we have just discussed —that borrowing should be done for production goods wherever possible, thus enabling them to pay back what they borrow. This Is to stem the tide of wants that children have. They do not always translate these into terms of ability to pay. Parents whose children are in a club whose leader - ship Is strong will do well to encourage this experience In their chil - dren. Through It they learn not only the purposes for borrowing, but business management/and they establish a credit rating for themselves. Because today's work has emphasized the short-term loan problem, it will be well for us to summarize the principal points involved so you will have them clearly In mind: , 1.1 It should be for a conservative amount. _.j It should have a reasonable term to run and the lowest possible interest rate. 3. It should provide for budgeted repayments or borrowing pe - riods.; 4. It should be for a productive purpose, Including consumption goods only when the income will carry the responsibilty of their cost. .The aim of this discussion has been to show that credit wisely </seg>

His eyes were upon "c </seg>
         <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION top of the flagstaff, where in the morning sun, the Stars and Stripes rippled proudly in the sunshine. As he walked, the right hand of the band master moved as though It held the time-beating baton. Under his breath he whistled a new tune, a tune which today is familiar to every sailor and to every citizen. It was John Philip Sousa who came to a halt, still gazing up at the flag and speaking.to himself. "It will be a wonderful march," he said, "a wonderful march!" He whistled the new tune again. "I shall call it The Stars and Stripes, yes, the Stars and Stripes Forever!" The famous march was born with the roll of the ocean in its com - pelling rhythm, the light of the sky in its singing melodies and the thrill |of the floating flag in Its clean, crisp chords. Yet even Sousa himself little dreamed of the dramatic scenes through which he and his "wonderful" music would go marching together. There was that inauguration day in Washington when throngs of loyal people gave a great cheer for the new President, and then a great cheer for John Phillip Sousa and the U. S. Marine Band as with pipes and horns and drums the music of The Stars and Stripes Forever filled the air. There was that day in the London palace when King Edward and his court gathered to hear Sousa in a command performance. Royal feet were tapping the floor in time to the music of a democracy. Royal heads were nodding to the rhythm of tunes which American newsboys whistled on their beats. And then King Edward was speaking his thanks and bestowing the medal of the Victorian Order upon John Philip Sousa, the first American musician to receive an English decora - tion. The "March King," he was called. A Story of a Famous March It was Flag Day. The new flag had been raised and the children had marched back into their classes. Then Bob Bates made a dis - covery.. Through the window he could see the new flag, high among the green, rees. "Look, look, everybody!" he cried, "It's like a picture. See how the window makes a frame." For a moment the class sat looking at the bright bunting floating out against the white clouds. Then Miss Carol asked, "Who can tell the name of the music that was played as the flag was raised this morn - ing? jJeah said it was a march. "Yes," Miss Carol agreed, "but why was this particular march played today?" She turned to the black - board land wrote "The Stars and Stripes Forever." "A march about our flag;" Jean said. "Yes, what else?" "For what does our flag stand?" "Our country!" the whole class answered. Miss Carol wrote beneath the title the name John Philip Sousa. "Of all his marches," she told the classi "This was the favorite of Mr. Sousa. His. bandmen always stood when they played it. There </seg>
         <seg id="p414">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are four different tunes In the march. Each one brings a new Idea. I wonder if the first will make you feel as it always does me?" She set the phonograph playing. At the first chords everyone in the class sat straight up. In another moment Bob rose, faced the flag and stood at attention. Miss Carol smiled and did the same. By the time the tune ended the whole class, with eyes on the flag was standing at attention. Miss Carol lifted the needle. "I am sure Sousa Intended that tune to say. "The Flag Goes By.' Now be ready for the next tune." The children listened as the first tune was repeated and then every one caught the beginning of the second theme. It was a proud tune and no one moved until the needle was lifted at Us close. Then Bob said, "In that part Mr. Sousa was thinking about our country and how grand it is." Miss Carol smiled, "As if he stood on some high tower and looked over all the lakes and rivers, the fields, cities and roadways, homes and factories of our country. Yes, the music is like that." She turned to the blackboard and under the title of the march she wrote, Thome I : The Flag (Joes By Theme _: Our Country "The third thpinp." she explained, "is about the flag. It seems to make a good wish about the Stars and Stripes." The children listened thoughtfully while the first two themes were repeated. Then, as the new theme ließan. Miss Carol turned to the window. The eyes of the class followed hers. There like a living picture the flag rippled in a little breeze. Then a strong wind li'ted it straight out from the staff with every bar and star gleaming ,'„ the sunlight. As she lifted the needle Miss Carol asked, "What was that tune saying about the Stars and Stripes?" "I think," said* Jean, "that is where Mr. Sousa put the 'Forever' part in." "Just exactly," Bob cried, "I could hear the music say it, "The Stars and Stripes Forever!" Miss Carol wrote: "Theme 3: Forever" Then she smiled and gave the class a hint for the next part. "In the fourth theme the trombones are so noisy and tile snare drums rattle so Importantly they sound as if they were playing for a foot - ball game." She set the needle well Into the disk and the new tune that blared out was not at all like the other tunes. Nobody looked at the flag. Everyone looked at Bob. He stood in the aisle and pretended to be a cheer leader. "Rah! Rah.' Rah!" he said In a loud whisper. They all laughed and as Miss Carol lifted the needle Mary answered for the class, "That just has to be a (.heeling tune."' So Miss Carol wrote </seg>
         <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "Theme 4: Cheering" Then she added below: "Theme 5.: Grand Ending" "For this last," she explained, "you will notice the Forever theme is used, but there is something in the music which makes you want to have a part in the grand end. Let us go back over the themes and see what there is left for us to do."' ; Pointing to the blackboard she said, "We stood at attention while the flag went by; we thought of the grandeur of the country for which it stands; we hoped that the Stars and Stripes would float forever; we cheered our flag and country. But this,grand ending makes me went to do something more." Then the Forever theme came ringing out so crisp and clear that almost at the same Instant the whole class arose with glowing faces and reached pledging hands toward the flag. When the last tones died out Miss Carol turned to them. "Shall we repeat it together; meaning every word as Sousa's music did?" So while the new flag rippled proudly every voice repeated, "l pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."t Radio demands for this musical CCC program a fourth C—that of CONTROL. Parents should not do as the Irate father and mother in one household owned to have done. Said the father: "The word 'radio' fairly makes me ill.

Fine! I can see all of you (mentally) wiggle your heads and then your erect position almost frightens me—because your fine poise makes you appear so dignified. Let us sing "Deck the Halls" with a vital and refreshing tone. The first speaker on the Wednesday morning session Introduced by Miss Fedde was Miss Bess Steele, Associate Professor of Home Eco - nomics at the College of Agriculture. The demonstration given was one which was originally prepared for presentation before the National Home Economics Association to show how ingenuity in finding and using inexpensive materials may add to the attractiveness of the borne fur - nishings. The talk was Illustrated by the use of panel arrangements showing fine relationships of color. '•_.-'.'-. TEXTILES FOR THE LIVING ROOM AND DINING ROOM FQR THE LOW INCOME FAMILY MISS BESS STEELE The theme of this talk is that beauty may be achieved in the home regardless of how much or how little money there is to spend. This was studied and proved,ln the college Home Economics.De - partment last year. A class was divided Into three different groups, the students electing where they wished to work. Group No. 1 was to find a number of objects exquisite in character which could be used in a related composition. Group No. 3 was to find and compose a number Of objects of the most menial character such as a social worker would find In the poorest home. The No, 2 group worked with the average things, obtainable. It was surprising to many to find that group 1 had the greatest difficulty in .finding truly exquisite things. Group 3 lo - cated the most interesting things and surprised themselves and all the others with their achievement—a gunny sack, paper bag, a wooden mixing bowl, a tin can with a colored paper tied around it, colorful 14 </seg>
         <seg id="p418">RE. ()RT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fruits and vegetables, a mixing spoon and a fork put together with critical care produced an arrangement that was a joy to everyone who saw it and started them to thinking, if they hadn't thought of it before, that aesthetic thrill and satisfaction are the result of the use in an individual way according to some laws, any kind of materials, and that real beauty is now shallow prettiness. So when it was learned that the subject "Textiles for living room and dining room for low income family" was to be considered at the convention, these same students took keen delight in working on the problem. They decided to consider the monthly income for the family of five to be $85—After food, clothing and shelter were provided there would I), very little left to spend on decorating the house. They went out to the barns and begged some gunny sacks. They washed them and dyed them and embroidered them with yarns'reclaimed from something or other and they combined them with other materials and finally were able to exhibit chair pads and backs, window draperies, footstool ,-over:.. and table (overs that were really things ot beauty. They made things in sets because they realized the necessity of asso - ciating tilings of .similar character. Another material which seemed to those studeus t» have possibilities which would require little or no ,ash outlay were the materials In sugar and feed sacks-unbleached muslin. Again some were dyed and lined and decorated and combined with things of similar ,nullity and resulted in window draperies, glass curtains, and luncheon sets. A beautiful hooked rug made from the yarn in ten old sweaters would have been most acceptable to any of the type we are considering. There were also ruges crocheted and braided from r.-i lainied materials. Pongee was found to be inexpensive and to take dye nicely and when lined with unbleached muslin which was either dyed or not was satisfactary for draperies, glass curtains, table covers, and cushions A large meshed „;-i in colors was found for 5C per yard and used as glass curtains with pongee and with unbleached muslin. Ball fringe for 5. per yard was another find which delighted them. Good looking glazed chintz was found for 25c per yard and when Its edge was accented with cable cord and a wall paper balance board edged with the same cord, any house would have been enhanced thereby. So far as inexpensive materials go, it is possible to find them if one uses discrimination and a liberal amount of imagination as to how they can be used. We are all familiar with those stores which handle low cost goods. The basements of department stores are good places to buy Sales may be taken advantage of. If one explains the need, good low cost fabrics may be found in the regular departments. Let us assume that the following statement is true: A home which </seg>
         <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION radiates comfort, cheer, and friendliness and is inviting must be bright and attractively furnished. Of .first importance then is color which is closely tied up with the emotions and which may do much to determine the atmosphere of the home. The colors of light and heat speak to us of cheer and optimism. Yellow in one of its various forms is best for wall color—cream, ivory, ecru and even a greenish yellow. They tend to relate all the colors In the room to each other and to the background. Yellow is said to be one of the most successful colors in Inexpensive fabrics. Orange, modified to tan, peach, rust,.is cheerful and warm. Red, modified to Chinese Red, rose and pink, is very good. Of course the homemaker who uses color successfully will not select a colored object for Its own sake alone. She will reason that in order to have harmony among the members of her family they must have similar tendencies and similar thoughts—enough differences to be stimulating but the general trend must be toward harmony, So the colors put together in the home are. to be based on the law ot relation - ships. There will be dark values; and light values, bright and dull intensities, large areas and small areas, figured surfaces and plain, all combined from the angle of relationships with variety. The color effect sought then will be rich, cheerful and finely related —no discords to irritate or confuse. This has nothing to do with the amount of money one has to spend. . This matter of. fine relationships has to do with not only color but lines and areas, the manner of hanging and draping the fabrics at the windows, each piece of furniture and its covering, each lamp and small decorative object is a study in form and proportion Individually and hi Its effect on the things with which it Is combined. The homemaker who is keenly conscious of these facts is constantly alert for new and stimulating achievements and is constantly making improvements in home surroundings. She observes what is being done in the stores. She studies the better home furnishing magazines, and thiis accumulates new ideas adaptable to her own home. She gains satisfaction from a sense of new achievement. She realizes the im - portance of having leisure to linger over this home beautiflcation and manages it somehow. Only leisure will make it possible for the imagina - tion to. function and for her to have that emotional enjoyment which brings such great satisfaction. In order that she may be constantly alert, the element of novelty is very Important—new experiences stim - ulate the imagination. Are we wise in demanding quality in fabrics for interior decoration which endures until out of date? Perhaps it is wise to choose the less expensive thing and change more often. </seg>

The farmer and his wife must'not only agree to follow the plan developed but to keep a complete record of the farm and'home business. Loans are approved on the basis of this agreement. There are two divisions of the Resettlement Administration con - cerned with the development of rehabilitation plans and making loans to lo\v income farm families. The Rural Resettlement Division Is the division set up to assist farmers, now living on unproductive farms or in undesirable areas, to move to farms better suited to their needs. This division also assists worthy farm.tenants to become farm owners. ' The Rural Rehabilitation Division is concerned with the rehabilita - tion of farm families on the farms on which they are now living. Rehabilitation loans are made for the purchase of livestock, machinery and tools, seed, feed, or other items needed to carry on the farm enter - prise. Loans may also be made for certain types of household equip - ment and subsistence goods needed by the family. The loans bear five [per cent interest and are made for a maximum period of five years. A farmer desiring to secure a rehabilitation loan must make ap - plication at the local Resettlement Administration office which is usually in the county seat town. In filing his application he states that he can - not secure credit elsewhere and cannot continue without help. The local Rural Rehabilitation supervisor will verify the applicant's state - ments and present his case to the local advisory committee. The Advisory Committee In each county is composed ot representa - tive citizens who have been reasonably successful financially and are in a position to know the applicant and his needs. The committee mem - bers will also know his reputation in the community and will know the opportunities offered by the community which will contribute to his success. If the Advisory Committee makes a favorable report on the ap - plicant, the supervisors are ready to visit the family and help develop the rehabilitation plan. The farm management supervisor and the home management supervisor, who represent the Resettlement Admlnlstra - tioh, (both visit the family since the rehabilitation plan includes both a farm and a home plan and they are to be developed together. </seg>
         <seg id="p422">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Before a loan will be approved It must be shown that the enterprise will, under normal conditions, support the family, pay the farm operat - ing costs, and enable the family to pay off Its old debts and liquidate its indebtedness to the Resettlement Administration. If the old debts are so large that this would be impossible, the county debt adjustment committee will make an effort to have old debts scaled down or pay - ments deferred until a greater Income can be realized. The farmer and farm supervisor make a careful analysis of the farm business. They agree on the best use of the land and the best method of handling the crops and livestock. They determine the most economical use of farm power and labor. They estimate the probable income from various sources and make a financial plan for the year. The farm plan must be designed so that "the farm will make the largest possible contribution to the family living throughout the year In vegetables and fruits, dairy products, eggs, poultry, meats, cereals, and fuel. In order that the cash required for family living may be kept to the minimum and insure the repayment of the loan. The home plan developed simultaneously with the farm plan Is developed by the home - maker with the help of the home management supervisor but involves the whole family. A part of the home plan is, of course, the family living budget for the year which is a part of the financial plan for the family, but this is not all. The plan must show that the enterprise will support the family on an acceptable standard of living. Almost every farm homemaker hopes that the farming enterprise will provide for her family a comfortable home in which to live, suf - ficient and proper clothing for each member of the family, adequate food, healthful surroundings and opportunities for education, recrea - tion, and development. The resources of the homemaker in providing these things are her time, energy, knowledge and ability, the co-opera - tion and help of her family, the earning power of the family, and the economic and social opportunities offered by the community in which they live. Many of the families applying for Resettlement Administration loans are heavily in debt. Large numbers of them have been on relief. Even though a farm plan could be developed which would show a fairly good Income, it Is absolutely necessary that cash expenditures for family living be kept to a minimum in order that debts may be liquidated. The goal of the family must be reached with a limited cash outlay, therefore, careful planning is essential. The family living budget provides for the known needs of the family and is flexible enough to provide for some of the emergency needs, without upsetting the financial plan. </seg>
         <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION All known needs are considered separately. Food is the largest Item in the budget of any low income family, therefore, much thought Is given in developing the home plan, to determine the best means of providing the family food supply. The Bureau of Home Economics has set up for us certain dietary standards which can be used as guides In determining the amount and kind of food required by any sized family."' The food preferences and food habits of the family will, of course, influence the choice of food, but these are standards of consumption below which a family cannot fall and be adequately, nourished. The standard known as the •['Adequate Diet at Minimum Cost" is the One recommended for low income families who buy all their food. This standard provides only simple wholesome food, no specialities or out of season food and only a minimum for safety of the health protective elements. There is no reason, however, why foods which can be produced on the farm should 'not be consumed In more liberal Amounts, especially if these foods are not marketable as is often the case with vegetables and fruits in rural areas away from markets. After the homemaker has determined the kind and amount of food required by her family, she must determine, in the plan, how this food is to be provided. If it were all to be purchased, it would cost from '$100 or $125 per person per year. This would mean a cash-outlay ot .500 or more for a family of five which would be out of the question. How much, then, can be produced on the farm? If It Is produced on the farm how will the present practices be altered? Shall the farmer plant a larger garden or simply plan it differently to extend the producing season? Shall the family milk more cows or cut down the number and feed costs by getting rid of the cows they now have and getting better ones? Shall the poultry flock be increased or culled down? Shall they butcher more animals or shall they butcher fewer animals and increase the cash income by increased sales. What canning equipment must be secured if more food Is to be preserved in the home or would it be more economical to store food rather than can it? Is the storage space for food adequate or should there be a new or repaired vegetable cellar? Shall the family process more of the food in the home or shall they pay for such service? Could the family Increase the variety of foods produced oh the farm </seg>
         <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE such as honey, sorghum, cereals, cheese, and so forth, which the family has not produced In the past? These and many other questions must be answered relative to the food supply for the family. Every homemaker answers these questions one way or another every year, but this is one time when the home - maker put some thought to the matter in advance, weighs her objec - tives against her time, energy, and money and decides to the best of her ability the plan for her family. A similar procedure is followed with clothing, furnishings and equipment, operating costs, education and so forth. The cash required for these items constitutes the cash living budget for the family but gives only a partial picture of the complete home plan. The activities on the farm and In the home in providing for the family are a part of each rehabilitation plan. As the home plan is being developed and carried out, the home - maker may become aware of her lack of information along many What are the recommended varieties of vegetables and fruits to plant? What is the approved method of canning? How can certain old garments be renovated? The home supervisor will be a frequent visitor in the home and will be able to direct the homemaker to the proper sources of such infor - mation or to pass it on to her if the homemaker is not able to particlp - glven" Son Clubs or adult classes where such information is _._ Th f Vf r? er aDd Q'S W'fe agree t0 keep fam and home accounts when their loan is made. The posting and summarizing of these ac - counts is an excellent way to determine the soundness of the plan We have many rehabilitation families completing their first year's accounts and they can now check up on their plans. For various rea - sons many of the plans could not work out, but we feel safe in saying that they have been valuable guides and the women have followed their plans with great interest. I believe one rehabilitation homemaker expressed the opinion of a £rge number when she said: "It is such a relief to have a plan Money has always been scarce and I had the thought always in mind that I must spend just as little for family living as possible. Now with a Plan, the whole thing is before me. I know what the farm operating costs are, how much we are expected to pay on our debts this year </seg>
         <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION -'.'.-. and how much has been set aside for family living. I know when I ¦spend money for family living that I am not using money planned to be used for another purpose. It is a comfort to have a plan and a satisf - action to keep a record and determine how the plan is meeting our needs'." In Nebraska there are 5,025 rehabilitation loans. Because home economists were not in the field as. soon as the farm supervisors only 2,979 of these have, both farm and home plans. We have evidence to show that when the family is not adequately provided for that money will be used, for family living before loans are repaid, so if for no other| reason than to safeguard loans, complete rehabilitation plans, including both farm and home plans, will be developed this next year for all farm families now Indebted to the Resettlement Administration. ; The use of a farm and home management plan in Rural Resettle - ment [is somewhat different from that in Rural Rehabilitation. Before a farm is accepted In a Rural Resettlement project a farm and home management plan for a typical family suitable for living on that farm miistjbe made. This plan must show that the farm is capable, if properly managed and operated, of providing a comfortable living for a family and providing sufficient net income above farm and home expenses to liquidate the loan on the farm over a period of forty years; When the family Is actually selected for a farm, their farm and home j plan is developed with them as In Rural Rehabilitation and Is ¦checked with their records of farm and home business. The next speaker was Miss Buchanan talking oh the subject HOW MAN MADE MUSIC j MISS FANNIE R. BUCHANAN, lowa Extension Service Imagine a day without a sound of man-made music! To find such a time would take us back to the days when man was learning to speak, to count, to make his first rude shelters and his primitive garments of akin or of woven grasses. How did he learn to make musical instru - ments? How did he even learn to make a tune? When the first builders made their crude houses they got their ideas by looking at arching caves and tree boughs. The first primitive artist drew wild animals which he saw about him. The first printer, in his sign language, saw and copied things which he wished to represent. But the fi^st maker of tunes had nothing visible from which he might copy. The only musical sounds he had ever heard were those made by the wind and water, and by the singing birds and insects. Legend and myth from ancient Egypt, China, India and Greece show that from earliest times people believe music to be a gift from their gods. There was a mystery about it which they could not under - stand. There was mystery too in the sunshine, in the winds and in </seg>
         <seg id="p426">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the moonlight which was all about them but which they could not touch or hold! These they believed were gifts from their gods to make them happy. Music was even nearer than the sunshine. It came from within them. It expressed feelings they could not put Into words. It, too, was a gift from their gods. Through all the centuries it has been so, for even today when every school boy knows how sunlight and moonlight are made, music which comes from within, and which still expresses what cannot be expressed In words, has come to be called the Divine Art. The making of musical instruments has been a long process. Every musical instrument may be given a nickname to tell how It is played. It is either a Banger, a Blower, a Picker, or a Scraper. In a large orchestra all of these kinds are heard playing together. Here it is easy to discover in which class each instrument belongs. The drums are not the only Bangers nor the horns the only Blowers. The golden harp looks too splendid to be called a Picker, but even so, the harpist sets the strings to singing by plucking them with the fingers. Because violin strings are rubbed by the bow, even this king of instruments must answer to the nickname of Scraper. Bangers, which properly are called percussion instruments, are probably the oldest of all because they were easily made. They had their beginning away back in the times when man was making his first crude tools. All primitive people had Bangers. They clapped pieces of wood together. They stuck wood against stone. They beat hollow logs with pebbles. These different kinds of sounds were only the beginning of music, but they pleased the tribesman and helped him to express his feelings. One day man discovered that striking a tightly stretched dried skin gave him another kind of sound. He began to invent drums. When he learned to work with metal, he found that by striking it he could make still another new sound. He began to make bangers of metal. But the drum was his great invention. He probably began by cov - ering a hollow stump with a stretched skin. Some accident must have given him this Idea. How it really happened may only be guessed. Drums as large as hollow stumps and as small as toys are older than man's oldest records. In the days before man learned to make bowls of clay he used an animal horn from which to drink. No story is old enough to tell when or how man first discovered that the hollow horn or tusk of a wild animal could make a startling sound. But there are very ancient stories which show how these have long been used to give commanding signals. In drinking, the large end was raised to the lips. How did primitive man get the idea of turning the horn about and blowing </seg>
         <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Unto t!he small end? Perhaps the story might have been like this: Some tribesman had an especially fine drinking horn. It was long and slender. He had polished It inside and outside by rubbing it with sand [and pebbles. He prized it greatly. In Borne way the tip became .broken. He was looking it over as a boy would examine a broken knife. By chance he put the tip to his lips and blew Into it. Then came a most surprising blast of sound. From near and far the tribe people came running. What a wonderful.signal! A great discovery .had been made! '.1-7 ¦:¦.-¦' . 7-1. . Man used his first tools to help him make music. In the days of the saber-tooth tiger, boys made flutes for themselves. Among the •oldest relics of mankind is a little whistle made from a hollow bone. It was found in an ancient cave dwelling In France. For thousands ¦of years it had been buried with-some little flint knives siich as man used before he learned to work with metals. A little bone flute with three j finger holes was found in another such cave dwelling. The boy who made this must have had a few crude tools. He had found out how finger, holes would help his flute to sound more tones. There are flute myths and stories from every age and from every country. The children of ancient Egypt: believed that the flute was givenjto them by the water-god of the river Nile. This was because their early flutes were made of river reeds or. rushes. { In those days the people of Egypt painted pictures on the walls of their [tombs. One wall has a picture showing seven musicians, each playing a flute as long as a man's arm. Two flutes made from slender grass reeds were found in a tomb of one of the great pyramids. The Hindu children of India are. taught that one of their gods in - vented the flute for them. The Chinese have no story old enough to tell who first made their soft-toned flute from a bamboo stalk. The old myth lof Pan and his pipes is told in many school readers. Almost •every [child knows how this boy, who never grew up, bound river reeds together, and made a set of singing pipes. The great pipe organ had a humble beginning in a set of Pan-pipes. One of the most interesting of all music stories would show how step by step these pipes grew into the splendid organ of today. An organ which was built in Jerusalem fifteen hundred years ago is described as having twelve brass pipes and a wind chest made of two elephant skins which needed fifteen bellows to fill it. The old story also said this organ could be heard at the Mount of Olives which was a mile from Jerusalem. The harp and violin family story has romance and mystery.

The hunter of those times had to be sure of his bowstring. A good string on a well-bent bow always hummed as it sent the arrow flying The hunter learned to listen for this humming sound. He noticed tha. hong bowstrings twanged with a deeper tone than the shorter strings. He liked the sound of the short and long strings humming together. Perhaps at night about the camp fire these old-time hunters twanged the bowstrings with their fingers, just for the sake of hearing them hum Perhaps as they sat there they made a little song to go with the hum - ming sound. In some way the bowstrings must have been used for Pleasure as well as for protection, because somewhere in those for - gotten times man began to make music from stretched strings. He had learned to make pipes that would sing to him when he was lonely and he p him keep his flocks from straying. Now he was to learn to sin. for him 6 Bl''lneS' afterwrd t0 flnd new wa? s t0 ™ke them There was a long, long time, thousands of years, from the first singing strings to the magic violin. Just as the ancient cave dwelling tell of the first flutes, so ruins of ancient cities tell of the first harps. In Babylonia a few years ago explorers discovered a buried city. Among the ruins was a slab of tone ornamented with carvings representing musicians, one of whom is seated and playing a harp with eleven strings. When this sto__ Picture was made more than four thousand years ago, man had already earned to tune strings. He had a way of stretching them with vary! ing tightness, for in this way strings produce tones of different pitch All this can be certain from the picture, although it can never be known what melodies the strings sounded. The tombs and ruins of ancient Egypt are picture galleries of the pas which tel, fascinating stories about music.

         <seg id="p430">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE WISE USE OF CREDIT MISS BARBARA VAN HEULEN Perhaps the principal question farm women have in mind con - cerning credit is "How can it be used without making it a worrisoniP burden on the family?" The Farm Credit Administration believes that a better understand - ing of lending policies, together with a thorough explanation of when and how much to borrow, will take away this doubt of credit. To quote from one of our publications, "There is no magic about credit. It Is a powerful agency for good in the hands of those who know how to use it, and dangerous in the hands of those who do not understand it." The farming business Is strictly a family one. Father, mother, boys and girls, all take an active part In Its operation and share its obliga - tions. In many families it is the wife who takes over the responsibility of keeping in mind the dates when interest and repayments are due; who puts away money, little by little, to meet these obligations; and who voluntarily assumes most of the responsibility whether there is occasion for it or not. It isn't that the husband is indifferent to his responsibilities; but the homemaker Is likely to take them upon her - self of her own accord. That's a woman's way. Men have more self - confidence in their ability to meet situations as they occur and there - fore are not as prone to be concerned. Many women, because they have had no special training for making a living, lack this self-confidence. This contributes to their anxiety concerning the family's debt prob - lems. A thorough understanding of the basis on which the husband has planned to meet the mortgage payments would do much to relieve the wife's doubts. The wife plays a very important part in the success of the farm's business. The United States Department of Agriculture, as well as several of the state colleges, have made studies of farm family in - comes, and almost without exception the farms which earn the most are those on which the wives are enthusiastically cooperating with their husbands. Those farms earning the least have consistently been those where the wives are disinterested or where the farmers are unmarried. Many a woman's poultry flock has bought the family's food and clothes, and in thousands of cases these earnings have paid the interest on the farm's mortgage. Almost as important as her business interests is the harmony that exists in the family. One of our district banks esti - mates that 25 per cent of its foreclosures are due to family trouble Divorces are costly and they drain the resources of the farm. The spirit of the operator changes too, and In every way the farm's busi - ness suffers. </seg>

Going through our files you might find such a report as - this: "Loan not recommended. Son a bootlegger." Indictment ami a judgment of guilt would doubtless involve the family in much expense,, endangering the loan. So each one of the family is.really responsible - for the whole family's reputation as a financial risk. Family credit is a very important thing. This credit may not nec - essarily be banking credit, but a reputation for honest dealing. A banker once said, "Credit is a commodity you can inherit." That this: is true: we see evidenced again and again when loans are being con - sidered. The local banker is well informed on "who is who" in the families of his area. The agent or committee representing absentee loaning agencies make careful Investigations on this score. Knowing when, and how much, and what to borrow for is the secret of the wise use of credit. The family which can best judge on these points is the one that keeps accounts. There is no farmer with whom a lending agency would rather deal than the one who knows just how much he takes in and how much he spends. It isn't the spending alone that makes for success in repaying the loan, but it is the attitude that farming is a business worthy of good business management that is im - portant. Good management consists in seeing what part of the busi - ness has been profitable—what part has been a liability. Bookkeeping takes steady application, and many people don't like to take the trouble to do it, Often the wife keeps the accounts for.both farm and home; sometimes only for the farm. Curiously enough, in these cases she can seewhy her husband should want a record of.his spending but she doesn't always see that she should do it for the household. Almost always-she says, "I am very economical and I don't spend any more than I have to." As a matter of fact, she often actually spends as much cash for the family's living as is spent on the farm's operation. In one; of these western states the average family expenses, in 154 family accounts analyzed, was .685. Over a period of twenty years these housewives spent over ¥13,000 each. Surely that is a business worthy of a, few hours of bookkeeping a month. A budget at the beginning of the year, estimated from last year's accounts, means getting more for the money. It means that there will be a watchfulness of prices of the articles needed, and a better seasonal expenditure. It will not be the last minute spending whidh, as we all know, usually costs more than a more deliberate use of money. There is no couple with whom a bank would rather do business than a man and his wife who show these evidences of appreciation of good business management. Just how accounts and budgets are employed in the planning for a loan will develop later in our discussion. We are going to discuss first the kind of credit which has to do with </seg>
         <seg id="p432">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the farm mortgage: (a) When purchasing. Few people have enough cash on hand to pay outright for a farm. The seller may accept some money as a down payment, and take a mortgage on the property for the balance due. (b) To refinance old mortgages. 1. Sometimes a family is unable to pay a mortgage in its entirety when it falls due. A new mortgage may be made to take care of this unpaid balance. 2. If better terms of interest and repayment than were in - cluded in the one already on the property can be effected through making a new mortgage, it is wise to take ad - vantage of an opportunity to make such a change. ic) To pay other debts. These are the occasions briefly answering the problem "when". Kow we will consider the other part of the problem—"How much should be borrowed." Buying a farm and giving a mortgage on it means assuming a responsibility for a rather long period of time. Be sure the farm is worth what is asked for it, and get more than one opinion on It if you can. Try to find out what the earning of the farm has been, or what it Is capable of bringing in under good management; for on this de - pends certain repayment of the mortgage as well as giving the family its living and carrying the farm's operating expenses. This is the point at which the husband and wife should do some careful figuring. There is as much variation in the abilities of the operators in planning, executing, and in business management as there is In the standards of living of the families themselves. A farm which —under good management—might very comfortably support one fam - ily of eight or nine might not be able to carry the burden of one having but four or five members if good management is lacking. Thus the history of a family's progress on the farm in question, as'told by the seller, may not repeat itself with the family who are considering its purchase. The husband should now make an estimate of the income he thinks It is reasonable for him to expect from his place and figure his outlay for operating expenses as he sees them. The wife should make out a budget for the family's living expenses. This she can do by reviewing her food-buying habits of other years as a basis for those of the coming year, estimating the cost of the clothing to be purchased, furnishings the house may require, the cost of the children's school expenses, together with the various other needs the family has. By looking ahead a few years she will know that they will need to anticipate changes in </seg>
         <seg id="p433">¦''•-) NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the budget; just as her husband knows that by good farming practices he may [be able to Increase his income. Each should make conservative estimates for the first few years of the life of the mortgage before agree - ing to liurchase the farm. By subtracting the operating and family ex - penses, the taxes and insurance from the year's income, they can see whethe ¦• or not there is enough left for the interest and repayment ot the mortgage. , Having determined that the farm is a good investment for them, the next step is to secure good terms in the making of the mortgage. This means getting one calling for a long-term, low-interest rate and a schedule for paying out the principal at regular intervals. It should include' also the privilege of paying up the principal more rapidly than the plan calls for. If the owner of the farm cannot see his way clear to accept the mortgage terms; which seem best for the family, some shopping for a loaning agency which can furnish such terms should)be done. Local banks, Insurance companies, farm mortgage companies, and.the Federal land banks,: which are really farmers' cooperatives, together with the possibility of accompanying Commis - sioner's loans, may be able to do What the individual seller could not afford. ''.'.'¦'¦¦.-¦ .It is essential that the farm mortgage extend over a long period of time as compared with mortgages on other income-producing prop - erties, Ifor it sometimes takes many years for the receipts from goods sold from the farm to equal the capital the family has invested in it. A long period allows, too, for fluctuations in land values..'-'.. The interest rate should be low, for the margin between the cost of production and the selling price of farm products is usually not very great, and every possible way of reducing the cash outlay on the farm has to be carefully considered. The mortgage should.allow for regular repayments on the prin - cipal. ) This will reduce very materially the total interest which has to be paid. A carefully arranged plan for regular semi-annual repay - ments shows that the actual amount of interest paid over a period of a 33-year mortgage is just half what it would have been had there been ho repayments made. Surely this is worth saving. The privilege of repaying in even larger amounts than those scheduled should be given so that in good times the family can get out of debt faster. . Figures show that a farm carrying a thirty-four year mortgage of $1,000 at 5 per cent interest can save $260 interest if at the end of the first 6 years an additional repayment of principal of $100 is made. One would hardly think that 28 year's interest on $100 would amount to bo much. It is a great temptation to spend money tor various kinds ot new equipment, or new cars, when income has been especially good; but planning ahead for the leaner years may mean the difference </seg>
         <seg id="p434">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE between peace of mind and despair for the borrower and his family. When shopping around for mortgages, be wary of a very high ap - praisal with a large mortgage allowance. Remember that this debt has to be paid eventually. While it is flattering to have a high valuation set on your property and the extra money may be temporarily an ad - vantage, this may mean paving the way for some unnecessary worry. So far we have talked only about the borrower's side of the mort - gage problem. You need also to know the lender's side. First consideration is given to the farmer himself—his character, his ability, his sense of responsibility, his good judgment, his ambi - tion. The unity in the family also is a matter of concern, for where there is little or no cooperation between the borrower and his wife the earnings of the farm are likely to be markedly less, thus endangering the repayment of the loan. Evidences of good business management prior to the application for the loan make a very favorable impression on the lender. Accounts, for example, kept over the period of a few years, or a clear statement of assets and liabilities, are proof that the farmer understands the im - portance of thoughtful farm management. Of next concern is the property involved. Its location on a good farm-to-market road, its marketing outlets, Its nearness to schools and churches, and the character of the neighborhood have their bearing on the loan, but are not as important as the productive power the farm itself has. Any loaning agency prefers to make a generous mortgage on a good farm rather than a small mortgage on a poor farm, for the repayment Is much more certain. It is not safe, unless there is an assured outside income, to count on any earnings beyond those pro - duced by the farm Itself; so this is the basis upon which a careful loan - ing agency decides the amount it can give you. The appraiser sent out by the loaning agency learns about the productiveness of the farms in the vicinity on his way to Inspect the place. He wants to see if in general the district seems to get fair re - turns. He looks over the farm with an eye to erosion possibilities and tests the soil with an augur so that he can see how deep the top soil is, and what the drainage underlying it may mean to crops. The presence of a lot of weeds, particularly obnoxious ones, may show that for the time being the productiveness of the fields may be lowered. The condition of the buildings and fences shows the kind of interest and management which is back ot the loan request. A man who has lived for some time on a farm which shows evidence of carelessness in these matters would not be considered a very good risk from the standpoint of his working standards and industry. </seg>
         <seg id="p435">'¦'¦"[¦ NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Sometimes people feel that they should get a high appraisal for their farms If they lie close to a city. This does not necessarily follow, for frequently this very feature Increases the taxation without adding proportionally to the farm's income from its goods. Mineral deposits often create a problem in making a farm mortgage. Sometimes the rights to take the gas, coal, oil, or other minerals from farms may have been leased. The appraiser determines as far as possible what the effect of the farm's productivity may be should these deposits be mined, and includes this in .his report to the loaning agency. Many times the buildings on a farm are out of proportion to its needs. When too large, or unnecessary, they add to the amount of money required for upkeep and Insurance and thus are likely to inter - fere with the repayment of the mortgage. Applicants for loans are often disappointed because they feel that their fine buildings should be given more consideration, not realizing that they may be more of a liability than an asset to a farm where a long-term mortgage is concerned. The Federal land bank, with whose appraisals I am most familiar, bases its loan estimates solely upon the productiveness of the farm, as is required by the law under which it;was organized. It uses normal values jrather than current prices on land. Over a period of 130 years the prices obtained for farm goods during the years 1909-1914 most nearly (represented an average. This gave land what is called "normal value.'f Our appraisers use these years as their standard, making adjustments to offset shifts In agricultural production, Increases, in taxes, changes in diet habits of the public, and other similar tendencies. This system is beneficial to the farmer through good times and bad, and consequently the mortgage retirement is more certain and less of a burden. Many large loaning agencies are coming to see its advant - age and are following the example of the 12 Federal land hanks. In'summarizing, the principal points to be remembered regarding farm mortgages are these: Bejsure the farm is worth what is being paid for it. ¦ i . . '...;¦;¦-' '-"¦'.. . ¦¦¦ • Beiwary of high valuations and large loans. Get the longest term, the lowest rate, and the best repayment plan possible. Make a business of your farm and home management. Keep ac - counts of your expenditures and your income, and analyze them each, year to see whether you are following good practices in production, : marketing, and buying. These four suggestions, if followed, will prove to you through your own experience that credit wisely used does not involve a burden. </seg>

With the thin muscles from the under side of the carcass removed, it only remains to separate the thick meat of the shoulder, rib, loin and round according to the natural tenderness of them. The two ends,, the five rib chuck and the round are normally less tender and more suitable for braising than the thick muscles of the rib and loin. Natural tenderness and palatability in beef depend upon several factqrs|. It is impossible to classify all chuck meat as a pot roast, an 4 all ribicuts as an oven roast. Attention must be given to the natural quality of the particular carcass that is being handled. Some of the factors affecting this quality in meat are age, finish, and degree of ripening. Meat from young animals is normally more tender than that from older animals. Calves yearlings, and tvyo-year-olds normally produce more tender beef than mature cattle. Lambs will make more tender; chops and roasts than ewes and pigs more desirable pork than sows. Fat is finish and the meat from fattened animals will normally be more desirable than the meat from thin, poorly fed stock. Even if the family does not enjoy eating straight fat, they will enjoy the quality that fattening adds to the lean meat. Beef and lamb carcasses ripen when held in cold storage after slaughter. Beef that has been held at a temperature above freezing and below 40° for a week or ten days after the animal Is dressed will normally produce more tender steaks than that same carcass the day after it was dressed. Where it is possible to wait at least live or six days before using or freezing the meat from a freshly slaughtered beef animal, the family will enjoy the product more completely. In brief then, more meals from the animals that we dress upon the farm or from the dollars that we spend for meat in the retail mar - ket, depends upon selecting meat with the youth, finish and ripening that is and then selecting the cheapest cut that is adapted to the cooking method chosen for tie coming meal. This talk was demonstrated by Mr.. Warner with a beef cutting demonstration. Guides in judging quality of meat were pointed out. He discussed the various cuts and their respective uses, and emphasized, the principles in handling meat in the home. </seg>

We truly are arbiters of lour fate through organized intelligence. ¦'¦'¦ !¦ -. ¦ '• ¦ '.. - - Social security is not a plant of magic growth, full blown over night, it has foil-wed the course of natural development, seed time, growth, maturity i.nd fruition. It is not my purpose to trace the development of every ihase of social security, only the children's phase as I have observed 1:. I would say that the seed time of children's social security came w. th the first nation-wide conference to consider children's prob - lems called by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. "Unless we make American good place for everybody to live in it soon will not be a good Wee for anyone to live in". Theodore Roosevelt said this and he hadjobkeryed that Blums and blighted rural and urban areas where poverty prevails were the breeding places of more poverty, crime and disease! They were social cancers which would, unremedied, weaken and event tally destroy our social and political fabric. As a direct result of the deliberations of this first conference there was instituted in the Department of Labor in 1912, the Children's Bureau, which has since been the medium for organizing programs for the betterment of children. Public welfare and child welfare bureaus resulted in many states. The Shepird-Towner legislation that gave us a maternal and child ; health pr Dgram somewhat similar to our present one under Social Security, .as administrated by the Children's Bureau. Again in 1919 after the draft for inducting our youth into military service disclosed the appalling mental and physical conditions of our young men, President Wilson decided we needed to overcome the physical and mental handicaps of our children to produce a better race and ne called a second nation-wide conference. This conference might be described as the watering and cultivating of the plant that had grown from the seed sown by Theodore Roosevelt in the first conference. A wave of social investigation and legislation followed this conference. Our own State Child Welfare Bureau was instituted at this time. Then you know as well as I how far the false prosperity of the twenties dulled oui sensibilities to both political and social abuses and conditions developed that hindered the sturdy growth of the precious plant, social security for child welfare." Childhood was becoming rather a hazardous state in 1929 and President Hoover called a third conference, known as the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. This </seg>
         <seg id="p440">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was the largest and most ambitious of the three. Some three thou - sand specialists and lay persons attended, and the result of theifr deliberations was the Children's Charter, the Magna Carta of childP hood. We should be as conscious of this document with its nineteen sections, as we are of the food we give our children. The provisions of this charter are and should be as necessary to the well-rounded de - velopment of childhood as is food. This third conference hastened the growth of our social security for children. This should be the time for maturing the plant and continued operation of Social Security for our nation's children will bring it to fruition, a better race of mankind. After Congress, in August, 1935, passed the Social Security Act, it became the duty of the several states to pass legislation to meet the requirements of the Federal law and make Social Security operative. Governor Cochran met this challenge and called a special session of the legislature In 19 35. This session gave us our State Assistance Act, Nebraska's Social Security laws. State Assistance made the State Child Welfare Bureau responsible for the development of the children's programs, three in number. These are, Aid to Dependent Children Aid and Service to Crippled Children, and the development and ex - tension of Child Welfare Services. Aid to Dependent Children con - sists of direct money grants and extension ot the Mother's Pension or mother's aid, long advocated by the Children's Bureau. Mother's aid was limited to mothers. Aid to Dependent Children Is granted to fathers and other near relatives in whose home the children may be living and to whom the grant may be paid. Recently a widow, the recipient of such a grant, died of scarlet fever contracted while caring for her family who were 111 of this malady. Undoubtedly the family would have been committed to the State Home for Dependent Children, but the Aid to Dependent Children grant was immediately transferred to a married daughter who can keep the family together and care for them more nearly as the mother. (County case.) If a little more time bad been taken, as was later revealed by one of our workers relatives could have been located, the children would have been given a norma] home environment and the cost to the State would have been much less than the care in our State institution where the cost is about $45 per child per month. The County Assistance Directors write to us and say home conditions have greatly Improved under the Aid to Dependent Children program. Children are better clothed better fed, homes have been fixed up, and the children hold their heads' up once more and display much better attitudes toward school and school-mates. Would we abolish our Aid to Dependent Children program with a loss of health and morale indicated by these reports from County Assistance Directors? Would we abolish our Aid to Dependent Children program and fill our State Home and orphanages to over-flowing? </seg>
         <seg id="p441">j NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Our. |Crlppled Children's program is a direct fulfillment of Ar-' tide XIII in the Children's Charter, "For every child who is blind, deaf, crippled, or otherwise physically handicapped, and for the.child who is mentally handicapped, such measures as will early discover' and diagnose his handicap, provide care and treatment, and so train him that he may become an asset to society rather than a liability. Expenses of these services should be borne publicly where they cannot be' privately met." We now have under care 107 children. Almost every crippled child presents a behavior problem. He is either over-indulged and difficult) as a spoiled child may be, or he is hardened and embittered by bis consciousness of his handicap. Thus restoring his mental health is as difficult as his physical rehabilitation. Many parents are afraid of operations, many think their children could not be helped so that - a part of the work of our Bureau is to convince reluctant parents that - there is help for their afflicted children. Some parents fail to realize" that the; process of physical restoration must extend over a period of years and lose heart because the first operation does not perform the" miracle they expected to see. You may help some discouraged parent - by interpreting to him that the physical restoration process for most - children is not complete until their period of growth is complete. No - wonder so many children have gone without care, tor tew families can - carry the burden oyer a long period ot years. The glaring weakness' In Nebraska's crippled children's program is lack of educational facili - ties, for the child who cannot attend school regularly during the years of treatment. It is to be hoped that we can remedy this weakness. Would we abolish our, crippled: children's program and let our unfor - tunate" children develop into bitter, unhappy adults who must be sup-' ported by society and never know the satisfaction of a day of h. nest - toll or the joy of physical exercise? Our Child Welfare Services are described In many sections of the Children's Charter, particularly Section'XlV: "For every child who is in conflict with society the right to be dealt with Intelligently as society's charge, not society's outcast; with the home, the school, the church, the jourt and the institution when needed, shaped to return him whenever possible to the normal stream of life." Money available for this service makes it possible to have five trained workers whom we call District Child Welfare Consultants. These people visit the counties in their district periodically, consult with County Assistance Directors, County Attorneys, County Judges, County Superintendents and teachers. Through these persons neglected and problem children are reported and plans made for their adjustment and future happi - ness. We hive been able to secure the services of a psychologist to interpret to teachers the reasons for the behavior of some of their problem) children and to make suggestions for better I adjustment. Here again we find children of such deficient mentality that institu - tional life is the only answer. The saddest of all is the hopelessly </seg>
         <seg id="p442">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mentally defective crippled child for whom institutionalization is the only answer. Our workers here are of service in interpreting to parents that such a child is much better off in an institution and that other children in the home have a better chance for normal life. The hope - lessly crippled child takes more than his due share of time and attention and other children in the home suffer thereby. Any child that can properly adjust to normal society should be kept from in - stitu ional life. Those who cannot adjust are the only ones that should be placed in institutions. The delinquent child is most often a desperately unhappy child. When a girl or boy from a dilapitated beaten home breaks a moral or civil law, we say "just what I expected", not reading that it is an indictment against you and me, against society. When a child from a better home is guilty of the same offense, we express surprise and regret. Often the underlying cause is the same in both cases, misunderstanding, thwarted ambition and a craving for love and affection. Trained workers can often analyze the situation and save the child from Incoming truly delinquent. Children who must be placed in foster homes are often living illustrations of either good or bad placements.

WARREN BELL A new Division in the State Department of Health has been organ - ized and established recently. It Is called the Division of Maternal and Child Health. The funds which make possible the work of this Division are provide!, by the State Health Department of Nebraska with the assistance .1! the Federal Children's Bureau under the Social Security Act. ' The plan for this Division was conceived in the spring and summer of 1936. J'- What does this organization do? This organization forms an official structure by which the advances in knowledge in maternal and child health may reach the citizens of Nebraska. Through committees of the Nebraska State Medical Association and the Nebraska State Dental Society, these two professions assist in the selection of the material distributed, and are cooperating in the development of the Entire program. The Division is fortunate in having both medical and dental viewpoints represented by a physician and a dentist employed on full time within the Division itself. In the selection of subject matter for the program, biologic values will be emphasized. Anatomy, physiology and pathology must take a prominent place In health or - . ganization, if such organization is to be efficient in the prevention of disease.; The prof ram of this Division is an educational one embracing several .procedures with a common objective. The program attempts to relate the need fOr saving lives of mothers and children with methods to accomplish this end. A very important objective in this program is, "Every pregnant woman under competent medical care". A broad interpretation, of medical care should include, where Indicated, dental supervision as well. Nothing is of greater importance to the welfare and general health of the new-born baby than that its mother should have been well nourished throughout the entire period of pregnane). The Nebraska State Medical Association has issued In its own journal very important suggestions in connection with the importance of prenatal care. The Division of Maternal and Child Health is working now with the Maternal Health Committee of the Nebraska State Medical Association in the development of postgraduate work in the form of refresher courses. These, it is hoped, will be offered to each of the twelve medical councilor districts in the state. It is through methods such as these that physicians continually keep themselves informed ot new develop - ments lin the care of women and children. </seg>
         <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Division has purchased an Animatophone, which is simply a new name for a combined talkie and movie machine. By this means, the staff of the Division may bring their program before medical, dental and lay organizations. Because of the enormous area contained in the State of Nebraska, plans for presentation of the program by means of this machine will require several weeks advance notification. As of December Ist, the Division acquired the leadership in dental hygiene of Dr. J. R. Thompson, D.D.S. Dr. Thompsdn has been inter - ested In the public health aspect of his profession, and is particularly interested in preventive dentistry for children. Interest in children's dentistry is widespread throughout the dental profession and con - sequently more and more minds are being focused on the importance of the combination of good nutrition and dental supervision in preg - nancy and early childhood. Parents are encouraged to think for them - selves of the advantage which their three to five-year-old child may secure from visits to the family dentist at intervals not farther apart than every six months. It is during the visits of the expectant mother and the preschool 'child that the dentist has a most excellent opportunity to inspire his clients with the knowledge of how to keep their teeth in the best of condition. This Division is continually watching the progress which the various 93 counties are making in the saving of infant and maternal lives. Colored maps, which may be obtained from the Children's Bureau in Washington, have been distributed to various councilors and officers of the Nebraska State Medical Association and to officers and com - mitteemen of the Nebraska State Dental Society. In the areas showing the least progress in the possible saving of human life, the Division has proposed the establishment of local demonstration areas. In a demonstration area, the particular problem will be studied and special effort will be made to develop adequate resources to make possible further saving of human life. In one area the special problem may be that of deaths of mothers; in another area, the acute problem may be loss of Infant life; a third area's problem might involve preschool health; etc. Communities which recognize the presence of a grave problem in this field are counseled to consult the Division with regard to ways and means of developing a solution. In very acute situations the Division has been able to offer temporarily some public health nursing service. Another aspect of this far reaching educational program in maternal and child health includes the provision of graduate public health In - struction. A few of the many applicants are being sent to nearby universities where public health instruction includes Held work in an established county unit. When these nurses return to the state, after having had experience with a type of public health administration found </seg>
         <seg id="p447">'" • NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION most effective in conserving human life, the citizens of the state as a whole will receive the benefit of this individual experience' on the part ot the public health nurse. The Division of Maternal and Child Health is gradually recruiting a Btnall number of public health nurses to meet the growing challenge for more Intensive public health service, particularly in rural and needy areas. The Division of Maternal and Child Health Is intimately concerned with problems which are vital to the human race. The Division seeks to enlarge the interest of the medical, dental and nursing professions in the contribution which each can make toward lifting the general standard of health for our whole: population. The program itself seeks to he an all inclusive rather than an exclusive activity. It is reasonable to expect that the services of the special professions will make their greater saving in human life when and only when the General Advisory Committee through Its manifold lay organizations secures for them the widest and most sympathetic local and state - wide interest to the focusing of this vast array of human resources in the field of maternal and child health. To this end, the Division has been conceived and established and is now dedicated.

         <seg id="p452">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE braska. "The best reading for the greatest number at the least cost" was the motto adopted by the American Library Association at its organization in 1878. The establishment of Library Commissions, traveling libraries and county libraries have each marked definite steps In carrying out this motto and the use of book trucks or book - mobiles as they are commonly called is another step towards the goal. Many in this audience have read "Parnassus on Wheels" by Christopher Morley. You remember the lovable little red-bearded R. Mifflin who traveled over the country in a robin's egg blue van drawn by a fat white horse, peddling his books and giving to each one with whom he came in contact something of his wholesome, cheerful philosophy. "When you sell a man a book you don't sell him just twelve ounces of paper and ink and glue—you sell him a whole new life. Love and friendship and humor and ships at sea by night—there's all heaven and earth in a book, a real book, I mean. Jimmy! If I were the baker or the butcher or the broom huckster, people would run to the gate when I came by -just waiting for my stuff. And here Igo loaded with everlasting salvation— yes, ma'am, salvation for their little, stunted minds- -and it's hard to make 'em see it. That's what makes It worth while—l'm doing something that nobody else from Nazareth, Maine, to Walla Walla. Washington, has ever thought of. It's a new - field, but by the bones of Whitman it's worth while. That's what this country needs—more books." Several years before this hook was published, however, a librarian In Washington county. Maryland, had conceived the idea of taking books from hei- library out to the people in the surrounding territory. She, too. made use of a horse drawn wagon, driven by the janitor of the library, a man who was familiar with the country and with the people and who was interested in books. From 1905-1910 this wagon made regular trips through the country stopping at the farm homes. When It was demolished in a railroad accident the work was temporarily discontinued, but two years later It was resumed and a specially con - structed auto truck which carried three hundred books was used. From that time on the idea of giving library service to outlying areas through book trucks has spread until the sight of a book van on country roads in some states is not unusual. From California to New Jersey and from British Columbia to Louisiana book trucks make daily trips just as rural mail carriers do. The type of truck used varies from a second hand delivery truck into which boxes of books are loaded to the deluxe model which costs several thousand dollars and has room inside for twelve or fifteen people at a time to select books from the large rolle.lion carried on its shelves. </seg>
         <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION In J. 925 Katherine Tappert, librarian of the Morristown, New •Jersey library wrote: "The growth in the use of the automblle has rushed life along and brought many changes in the twenty years that have passed since the book.wagon, drawn by two smart black horses, stopped at the first gate on a Maryland turnpike and offered a winters' reading for the choosing. The automobile has carried the book to thousands of country people since-then and it has as certainly brought the farmer to the town and to the book that is housed in the central library,! whether that library be a county library, a city library or an endowed library. Maybe the work has reached its peak and maybe the automobile book van will pass into history, while the airplane will come on to pick up a best seller at the publishing house on Long Island to drop it into the reader's hand in Wyoming. However mar - velous, developments may be, It will:be difficult to equal in charming simplicity and Incalculable good the work done by the first book wagon in 1905." Twelve years have passed since then and records show that more bookmobiles are being used each year. Library extension agencies use them for demonstration purposes; county libraries need them to ex - change collections of books between the central libraries and the de - posit stations, and several large cities use book trucks to supplement their branch libraries. The Greenville, South Carolina county library operates two trucks on regular schedules. One truck serves the textile mill districts and town schools, while the other; one goes'to rural schools and communi - ties. Tlie truck serving the mills parks In the mill yard and the people come oilt during the noon hour or as they change shifts and make personal selections from the books on the truck. At the larger schools the children in each room come together accompanied by their teacher and return books and select others. Practically every child is a patron of the "library on wheels." An average of 55 trips of from one to five hours each are made each month. Four branch libraries in the larger towns in the country receive new collections of books from the central headquarters once a month. There are eighty-one school deposits, groups of books selected by the librarian in cooperation with the teacher and left at the schools for two month periods. Collections ot books are also left at selected rural homes where they are checked out to the neighbors. The truck which serves the mill districts has missed only one day In twelve years. Through ten routes which cover all districts in Knox county, Ten - nessee, twice each month the bookmobile brings books within reach of many people who cannot come to the main library or its branches in Knoxviile. Deposits of from 300 to 500 books are made in the various high schools and classroom collections are loaned to 185 teachers in elementary grades. </seg>

Nebraska has applied to the Carnegie Corporation for funds for such a demonstra - tion, but so far has not been successful in securing them. Records show that in the majority of Cases where an experiment or demonstra - tion has been made it has led the way for the, voting of taxes to make the library permanent. As y^u know, Mrs. R. L. Cochran has been very much interested in library extension for Nebraska and this last year she became convinced that the (Library Commission, as,the library extension agency in the state, could use to advantage a bookmobile in its program. Through her interest others became Interested and funds were given by a group •of Omaha business men for the purchase of a book truck and the Ne - braska Bookmobile became a reality. A caijeful study was made of the book trucks now in use in other places and the executive secretary of the Library Commission gathered data and| visited several states and inspected their trucks. Finally a model was decided on and tentative plans made. A collection of three .hundred books was carefully built up to show the types of books which a well rounded collection might be expected to have and which could be borrowed from the Library Commission, if they could not be obtained locally. When September, 1936 came the staff of the Library Commission was ready to start "adventuring" with a bookmobile. To be sure, it was not expected that the undertaking would involve any great risk or hazard but to us it was a "stirring" event and one which we hoped would blaze a new trail in library work in Nebraska. Following a week at the state fair the bookmobile was exhibited at seVeraj county fairs, fall festivals, state meetings of several or - ganizations and has traveled over 3,000 miles in the state contacting .groups of [people interested in securing moire adequate library facilities lor themselves and their communities. It has gone to small towns without any libraries where the people have eagerly surrounded It Mothers yere interested in seeing lovely editions of old childhood fa - vorites, such as Little Women or Treasure Island, or some of the newer books for children, such as Caddie Woodlawn, the last Newbery award. Women were also glad to see books for their club programs. Men found books on economic problems, consumer cooperation, Diesel ¦engines, ahd many other subjects. As for the children, many of them would have liked to sit down and read their choice from the many •books offered them. . We have visited the county superintendent who is much concerned •because so few of the rural schools in her county have libraries of their own or are making use of books borrowed from other libraries. We </seg>
         <seg id="p456">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have talked to the high school teacher in a town with no public library and only a meagre collection of books in the high school library who - feels that the students who come into high school do not have the - background of knowledge they would have If they had had access to - library books in the grades and had learned to like to read. They have - been taught the mechanics of reading, but they have not had sufficient supplementary reading material. One of the first queries made to the attendant with the "library on - wheels" is "How much do you sell the books for?" This is a natural Inquiry for so many commodities are sold from trucks and it happens that the books being carried at present are all new books. When It Is - explained that the books are to be loaned rather than sold other ques - tions follow. "How can I borrow books and what does It cost?" The - answer to this is that anyone in Nebraska who Is unable to secure theße books through a local library may write to the Library Com - mission for them and the only charge is the cost of transportation both ways. Many people have learned for the first time of this service and are delighted to know that there Is a library from which they can bor - row books. The follow-up of these contacts has been surprisingly good and has resulted in many new patrons for the Library Commission. The Commission cooperates with other libraries and urges those who can do so to use the nearest library. However, there are many people in Nebraska who live 50 or 100 miles from the nearest public library and that one may be too small to serve non-resident patrons. There are still three counties in Ne - braska without a single public library and several other counties with only one small library with no regular source of income and a collec - tion consisting largely of worn out gift books. Open only a few hours a week and often taken care of by volunteer workers these libraries cannot do reference work or supply the type of books needed for sup - plementary reading In the schools. True, these people may borrow books through the traveling library service of the Library Commission and the report just being published shows that during the past fifteen months 95,019 books have been sent out from the Commission to all parts of the state and the majority of these books have been read by a number of people in each com - munity to which they have gone. 41,419 of these books went to rural and small town schools helping to provide the additional supplementary reading material required by the present day curriculum. Individuals over the state borrowed 11,889 books and the remainder of the 95,019 books were requested by clubs or other organizations, groups of residents or small public libraries. Valuable as this service Is it cannot and should not take the place of local library service but should supplement it, supplying the reference- </seg>
         <seg id="p457">I NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION look that the local library has only a few calls for or the more expensive book which local funds cannot supply. There should be sufficient library coverage in the state so that everyone can have the opportunity ¦of going to a library to make a personal selection of books, or can have booksbrought to him by a book truck whose shelves are loaded with a collection offering him a wide range from which to choose. ' Practically everyone who sees the Nebraska Bookmobile wants to know how it could be used to deliver books and this gives an oppor - tunity to explain the county and regional library law and to show how a truck would be one means of getting books from a central library to the outlying districts. It is obvious that the state is too large to be served! from one bookmobile working out from the Library Commission In Lincoln. And since we do not, as yet, have county libraries, Nebras - ka will have to work out a plan suited to its needs and conditions. ¦ No doubt many ot you are from the 50% of the population of Ne - braska without local library service. Would you like to know how the people in your, county can establish a library which will brine books to you and to your children?, The electors of any county voting at * general election may vote to establish a library, or the electors of two orjmore counties may vote to cooperate to form a regional library The property valuation In some of the small counties, especially in the western-part of the state, is too low to produce funds large enough to support a library which will give county wide service even with the maximum levy of one mill on the dollar, but several of these counties could, combine resources and support one good strong library. With all of the books bought and catalogued in one place by a trained and experienced librarian duplication ot work and of titles would be avoded and for the same amount of money a wider range of books cou d be supplied than if several small libraries built up duplicate col - lections. From this central library books would be sent out to deposit stations located in accessible places and kept in stores, schools or iomes [and as soon as one collection had been read it would be exchanged for another. ..bus, everyone in the county or region would nave adcess to all of the books in the central collection.

This county with a total population of 26.189 1 . ¦'.'¦¦' w </seg>
         <seg id="p458">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE has eleven libraries, this being the largest number of libraries in any county in Nebraska. They range all the way in size from a township, library of 9,115 volumes and the county seat library of 6,353 volumes to the baby library started within the last three years by a woman's club. Three of the libraries are supported by clubs, but the eight tax - supported libraries report an annual income of $7,337.95 or 20 cents per capita for the county. Together they possess 32,137 volumes. The titles In the libraries naturally represent many duplications, since each library works Independently of the others. There is still a large part of the county which does uot have local library service. That the people in this county are a progressive, reading public Is shown by the large number of requests received by the Library Commission for books. If the total income for the libraries in this county could be put together and a strong central collection built up It would be more economical and each town could retain Its own library and yet have the advantages of belonging to a larger system. Books which had been read in one community would be sent on to another community and there would be a constant inflow of new books. A bookmobile could take books out over the entire county on a regular schedule. Then there are other parts of the state In which we have groups of small counties which could very well combine into one regional library. They have no towns large enough to support libraries and the property valuation of each county alone Is too small to build up a county library. The population is small, running less than 2,000 in several counties. The law provides that a county library may be established at the county seat or some centrally located town and that a reasonably centrally located town or city be selected for headquarters for a regional library. In starting such a library roads and trading centers would be taken into consideration. This Is a subject of vital importance to a group such as this which represents the progressive rural population of Nebraska. Adequate library service for everyone in Nebraska is not an impossibility or a dream. Libraries, like schools, are building for better citzenshlp and libraries offer one way of continuing education beyond the school. Some states have now reached the stage in their development where everyone in the state has access to libraries and we have faith to believe that with a return to normal economic conditions in Nebraska, steps will be taken to extend library service in Nebraska until we, too, can say that everyone has library service. It seems apropos that there should be a talk by a librarian on this program for Nebraska has just been selected as one of a few states to serve as demonstration centers for cooperative projects between libraries and Home Economic groups. It was no doubt because there had already been a beginning made along this line that Nebraska was chosen for the demonstration. Just how this will be developed I cannot </seg>

It may be that the Bookmobile will play some part in this demonstration, and if so I shall hope to meet many of you in your home communities.

And if such a deed is possible, may we wish the angel gave her the cool drink of water She was going to ask for on entering heaven! To her, her life's work was not ended —but she has passed through the ever-changing labyrinth of life. She was an untiring worker in our Community and her family's church, loyal to her ever conviction of right and duty. She lived to do good, ever ready to aid, comfort, and protect those with whom she mingled. She was a leader In the community activities, an inspiration to all who knew her, happy in trying out new experiences and we know she was glorified when God passed her on to a larger, grander experience of life.

Second: may I men- ' tlon the circular which she prepared on "What Are Our Children Learn - ing About Taxes?" Miss Grace Frysinger of the U. S. Department of Agriculture thought this circular was such an unusually fine one that she asked to have copies sent to the Directors of Agricultural Extension In each state. This was done and soon letters began to come to us In appreciation of the splendid philosophy in regard to taxation which Mrs. Davis had used. Letters came from the east and west, the north : and the south and as far away as Honolulu. There have been 9 216 copies of this circular mimeographed and sent out. Mrs. Davis helped ' not only the Nebraska Extension Service but also the work in other states." Miss Wolph: "Mrs. Davis has given to us an example of true womanhood, and in her passing has left ideals which she has inspired us to attain At ! Mother's Vacation Camps she was always present. Mrs. Henry Tool who has been with her so many times will express her sentiments in an original poem. Mrs. Tool." </seg>

Each woman pres - ent was Invited to write on this card any suggestion which she cared to make for next year's program. These suggestions were put into the suggestion box at the registration desk. The County Chairmen Recognition Service took place next. In in - troducing Miss Brown, Mrs. Gard said: "There Is no one who has done more to promote Home Demonstration Club work in our state than our State Leader. It gives me great pleasure to present at this time Mlsb Mary-Ellen Brown, our State Home Demonstration Leader." COUNTY CHAIRMEN RECOGNITION SERVICE MISS MARY-ELLEN BROWN "At this time we have come to one of the important parts of the week's program. It is a part to which I look forward each year and I trust that you do also. The Nebraska Home Demonstration work keeps growing in num - bers for the map on the wall shows there were 19,505 members in 1935, 26,923 in 1936, and there are probably over 28,000 now. There are several reasons for this growth. One reason is that the state specialists are a fine group of people who prepare their demonstra - tions carefully. Another reason is the splendid work done by the County Home Demonstration Agents. But the biggest factor ot all Is the fine spirit shown and the splendid work done by the County Chairmen, the Group Chairmen, and the Project Leaders throughout the state. It Is Impossible to express our appreciation by words. We want to do more than talk about." At this time, Miss Brown introduced Director Brokaw who spoke briefly on the value ot leadership to a community. He then read the following list of County Chairmen who are serving for the year 1936 - -193 7 and asked them to come forward.

Director Brokaw then read the following Appreciation ot Leadership and presented each chairman who was present with a copy ot the charge: An Appreciation of Leadership Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairman of home demonstration project work. They believe you to possess that ability to serve and that spirit of self sacrifice so necessary for success - ful leadership. 7 By this choice there devolves upon you that duty of inspiring your fellow workers with a loyalty to service and a desire for achieyement of those things in home making and home lite that are necessary tor 'better agriculture and more complete Hying on Nebraska tarmß. Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties to perform and obligations to fill. Your regular duties have not pre - vented your meeting these tasks and we recognize that only bußy people .are successtul leaderß. , </seg>
         <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACRICULTURE By a faithful performance of your duties, you have inspired a con - fidence in you and a friendship for you that can only be secured by having been a friend to others and by a faithful performance of obliga - tions assumed. One is not worthily a leader who is not doing all in her power to enlighten her community by becoming, in so far as humanly possible, an example of right living and service to others. While the work you have done and the goals achieved are highly commendable, you have but entered into this field of leadership so essential to Agriculture's welfare and to National progress. Others may assume in the coming years your tasks of the present, but leader - ship accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields. Do not misunderstand, that leadership in any field tho it may appear to have greater possibilities for accomplish - ments, is no more essential than the proper leadership In your own field. Your community, your county, your state, the nation, are observing the character of your service. They will expect much of you and ill this we are sure they will not be disappointed for into the hearts of all humans there has been implanted, and it depends only upon proper cultivation for growth, that desire for leadership so essential to an occupation such as ours and to the welfare of a Christian Nation. Miss Brown continued: "For a few years the gold leadership pins for County Chairmen were presented at this recognition meeting but it has been decided that your pin may mean more to you and to the people of your county if the pin is presented to you at your County Achievement Day pro - gram. That plan will be followed this year and the pins will be given to you at that time. There is another group of workers who very much appreciate the help which the county chairmen give. This is the group of county home demonstration agents. Through their president, Mrs. Ethel Bowen, they wish to present the new chairmen with a token of their appreciation. Mrs. Bowen." Mrs. Bowen. "It is a privilege each year in this service to express our apprecia - tion of your service. We appreciate the service of both the new and other chairmen. You do not do your job for money or for recognition but for the accomplishment of better homemaking. You are working toward the furthering of the home demonstration program. The Home Demonstration Agents appreciate what you are doing. We want to say "Thank You" with a little bouquet. May the fragrance of it convey our appreciation to you. There are some of us who do appreciate the work you are doing and the time you are giving." </seg>
         <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION i Mrs. Bowen and Miss Jessie Baldwin then presented corsages to each of the'new chairmen. Miss Brown then continued: "We will be glad to have the newly recognized County Chairmen remain standing and we will ask all ot those who have received the ; gold leadership pins in the past to stand. You are the group which | helped us to have such a good representation at Washington: 135 Nebraska women attended the Association of Country Women of the World. You are the group which will be helpful in the home dem - onstration work which will come in the future. ; Mrs. Bowen will be glad to express to you the appreciation of the County Home Demonstration Agents. (Mrs. Bowen then presented flowers to each of the past county chairman.) Miss Brown: We now have two groups of leaders standing before us.

When we look around and see the women who are filling one office or another in the Agricultural Extension Service Program we do not wonder that the work grows.

         <seg id="p470">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PART n. MOTHERS' VACATION CAMPS Four district Mother's Vacation Camps were held In Nebraska during the summer of 1936. The days of rest, recreation, and in - spiration linger in the memories of the homemakers who were privi - leged to attend. The Chadron Camp was held at the Chadron State Park from June 25 to June 28. Forty homemakers from eight different counties attended this camp. The Curtis Camp held from July 23 to July 26 was located at the Curtis School of Agriculture. Seventy-five campers from fifteen coun - ties attended and were housed in the Girls Dormitory. The Stanton Camp began on July 26 and ended July 29. Thirty - five women from seven counties came to this camp which was located at the Stanton County Fair Grounds. Camp Brewster, the Y. W. C. A. Camp south of Omaha, attracted thirty-eight homemakers from ten different counties. It is doubtful if the Camp enrollment fee which ranged from $3.50 to $4.25 could be spent elsewhere for more satisfaction than that re - ceived at a Mother's Vacation Camp. Attendance at programs is of course optional since everyone is on vacation and is urged to do that which she wishes most to do. Each program is well attended, however, for no one wants to miss anything, especially If the camper is a club representative who is trying to take back to her group a report of all of the camp activities. Programs are varied so that something during the duration of the camp will appeal to every woman present. The program given at Camp Brewster is typical of the Mother's Vacation Camp activities con - ducted in 1936.

THE MOTHER'S PERSONALITY MRS. ALTINAS TULLIS Before I start upon my talk this morning, I wish to read this verse to you, you mothers who have now become my friends. "Life Is sweet Just because of the friends we have made And the things which in common we share. We want to live on, not because of ourselves But because of the people who care. It's the giving and doing for somebody else; On that, all life's splendor depends; And the joys of this life, when you sum them all up, Are found in the making of friends." My subject this morning is without doubt one of the most impor- </seg>
         <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION tant subjects of our civilization, "The Mother's Personality". I would like to use as my theme, the mother's Influence in the home. Homes are built with two viewpoints Interwoven into one, namely, a family. Mother is the pivot around which circles the life of the home. Usually the first face the baby remembers is mother's face. His first reaction is the reaction of comfort when mother has relieved his hunger orlthirst. His first remembered emotion is when mother kissed the hurt finger and made it well—eased the pain. To the baby, mother is hisj world, and the family, other than mother, are but incidental dur - ing the first few months of his life. Of course, he lisps "Da-Da," but "Ma-Ma" usually comes first. On through babyhood, childhood, young manhood and parent - , hood, too, mother still remains the pivot around which the family re - volves itself. In India the "mother" Is the head of the woman's world; the first ¦wile reigns supreme. Should the mother-in-law pass away, the first ; wife of the eldest son reigns. ' In ancient Egypt the mother was always queen in the household. In China the grandmother is perhaps worshiped, I might say. Though we see these mothers wield such Influence in the home, they i haye little public freedom. However, I am glad to say our mother i friends in these.far away countries are gaining more freedom as time goes on. ";. Now we shall.discuss American mothers, we who enjoy greater ! freedom than mothers in many other parts of the world. American mothers, you are individually a g:enius. You know, we never hear the old story any more about women being the weaker sex. Sinfie fainting is out of style and we vote, we find women trained in all walks of life. Even so, being a mother entails greater responsibilities than we realize unless we analyze a mother's task in raising her fanily. Being a mother involves tremendous responsibilities, but we weak sisters are capable of handling difficult tasks, especially when these tasks are tasks of love. ' JThe rank and file of American mothers in the pursuit of daily homemaking are dressmakers, milliners, interior decorators, cooks, dietitians, governesses, and superintendents of the home school work of from one to eighteen children, while some women do barbering, tailoring, landscape gardening/painting; many are good carpenters and many help outside when necessary, and goodness knows what else! Oh, yes, we must not forget the most important task, doctoring and nursing. . </seg>
         <seg id="p474">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE But we must be sweet, as our children learn not so much from our words, as our example. Inasmuch as happiness is contagious it must become a part of us. It can if we but think it can. If it is not a great part of our lives, we can make it so through forming the HABIT of happiness. Laugh, laugh till it hurts. Practice laughing EVERY DAY. It is good for your soul, as well as your family. Remember that laughter Is "soul food". It has been said that a baby of nine months of age forms habits which are carried on throughout life, and often make themselves felt in no small degree. Even if we do not recall consciously happenings of babyhood, there is imprinted in a little groove, in these wonderful brains of ours, the habit then formed and even though we do not recall consciously these happenings, the habit which was then formed will In unguarded moments color our lives. So you see, mothers, it behooves us at all times to be on our toes. When we realize that a mother's personality touches all lives first, what a wonderful opportunity and profession motherhood becomes. Robert Summervflle has said, "The strongest evidence that there is a divinity within man is the fact that he has the capacity of imagining that which is beyond his present state, gradually building himself up to It." You mothers picture the life you hope for your child, therefore you exert your divinity of motherhood from within, to color the lives of living generations. Thus through your personality you pour your soul around the soul of your child and therefore create the greatest miracle of all—life. Spencer says so beautifully: "So every spirit as it is most pure, And hath in it the more of heavenly light, So it the fairer body doth procure, To habit in, and it more fairly light, With cheerful grace and amiable sight; For of the soul, the body form doth take, For soul is form and doth the body make." Thus mother builds around her family, using her quality of con - sciousness that heavenly light, LOVE, to perfect her family. Ingersoll, in his illimitable language says of love, "Love; is the morning and the evening star. It shines upon the cradle of the babe and sheds its radiance upon the quiet tomb. It Is the mother of art, inspirer of poet, patriot, and philosopher. It Is the air and light of every heart, builder of every home, klndler of every fire on every hearth. </seg>
         <seg id="p475">I NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "It was the first dream of immortality. It fills the world with mjilody, for music Is the voice of love. Love is the magician, the en - chanter, that changes worthless things to joy, and makes right royal kings and queens of common clay. It is the perfume ot the wondrous ¦, flojwer —the heart—and without that sacred passion, that divine swoon, j. wt are less than beasts; but with it, earth is heaven and we are gods." I One of the greatest evangelists of all times, Dwight L. Moody, said, "I owe to my sainted mother my deep religious nature. She, untiringly, through EFFORT and EXAMPLE, taught me that all wlich occurs to the individual in life, is the result of his EVERYDAY ; T_ INKING. My earliest recollections are of my mpther kneeling wi:h her arm about my shoulder, as we said our goodnight prayer." Personality is a light pattern formed by thoughts. Every idea con - ceived by the human spirit Instantly shapes itself into a light pattern, ami the stronger the concentration and knowing of the thinker, the mere enduring these patterns become. As you are the example for your child, your actions and words each day form a pattern in his sensitive little brain and though you may not . realize it and he may not be conscious of it, he, in some way, emulates evjry day of his life the pattern he has formed as a result of your exs.mple, and those of his playmates as well. Again I repeat that if we could all but realize that our. example is more lasting than our words, I am sure we would have a happier world In which to live. Pity the child who is told one thing and deep down In his heart he realizes that actions prove another. It has been said that most of our great leaders in all walks ot life statesmen, ministers, generals, etc.—had mothers of remarkable peißonalities. Though some mothers lived but a few years, we find that their EVERY DAY EXAMPLE left a lasting impression. Edna Dean Baker, President of The National Kindergarten and Elementary College dedicates her very helpful book, Parenthood and Child Nurture, to her mother by saying, "To my dear Mother, who understood us children and gave us every opportunity for JOYOUS ACTIVITY." I might add that this book was written to use especially in jparent training classes in Sunday Schools. Its scope includes the . physical, mental, social and spiritual life of the child from birth to twjlve years of age. It contains unusually helpful suggestions re - garding songs, games, stories and other material suitable for the child. This book is not. the latest published work upon this subject but I fee| it is far superior to many of the later works. It was published by The Macmillan Company, New York City, In 1922. In looking through a book of poems I found this lovely "Boy's Prayer". It is quite different, and lam sure the boys will enjoy </seg>
         <seg id="p476">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE memorizing and using it. It was written by H. C. Beechling, and is entitled "The Boy's Prayer": "God who created me Nimble and light of limb, In three elements, free To run, to ride, to swim; Not when the sense is dim, But now from the heart of joy, I would remember Him; Take the thanks of a boy." The mother of John Quincy Adams was an unusual mother. Her husband, John Adams, was the second President of the United States, and later her son, John Quincy Adams, was President. It is said of her that she was a delicate child and this is probably the reason why Bhe was never sent to school. She married when she was twenty and started housekeeping in a cottage a few miles from Boston. When, in 1774, war clouds gathered, John Adams was sent to Philadelphia, and his wife was left alone to care for her little children and carry on the home In difficult and trying times. She managed the little farm and helped garner the crops with her own hands. She was purely a woman of unusual energy and intelligence. The letters she wrote her husband have been preserved. They show that no matter how heavy were the burdens laid upon her, she remained cheerful through them all. Her husband knew she was constantly in danger from Indian foes and in his letters would say, "Fly to the woods with our children." She watched the .ghting, hut even worse than this were the epidemics which swept over the country; and as she said in talking of those hardships later, "I had to see my lovely babies stricken down." She wove the cloth for their clothes, then fashioned them for wearing.. John Quincy Adams was six years old when his father kissed him goodbye and rode away to be gone long and dangerous years. His mother explained to him why his father had gone; he did not under - stand but accepted the explanation and dried his tears. After the war, John Adams returned to his wife and children and he was very proud of the way his patient and uncomplaining wife had managed everything. Positions of honor came to him until he was one of the greatest leaders of the Republic. When he became President, his wife wrote to him and said, "My feelings are not those of pride and ostentation, they are deeply solemnized by a sense of the obliga - tions, the important trust and numerous duties connected with the posi - tion. That you may be able to discharge them with honor to yourself, with justice and Impartiality to your country, and with satisfaction to this great people, shall be my daily prayer." In another letter she wrote, "I am a mortal enemy to anything but a cheerful countenance and a merry heart, which Solomon tells us doeth good like a medicine." </seg>
         <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION In 1825 John Quincy Adams was, like his father before him, elected President of the United States. His mother had died seven years previously, but the memory of her noble unselfish life, her magnificent courage, her unfailing CHEERFULNESS, were influences which the sixth President never forgot. Before he died, he wrote this tribute tojhis mother: "My mother, was an angel upon earth. She was a mi lister of blessing to all human beings within her sphere of action. Her heart was the abode of heavenly purity. She had no feelings but of kindness and beneficence, yet her mind was as firm as her temper was mild and gentle. She had known sorrow, but her sorrow was SILENT. Had she lived to the age of the Patriarchs, every day of her life would have been filled with clouds of goodness and of love. She had been fifty years the delight of my father's heart. If the^ is exintence and retribution beyond the grave, my mother is happy. But if virtue alone Is happiness below, never was existence upon earth mo :e blessed than hers." To the Adams family came great honors. John Quincy Adams' moiher was the only woman In America to have a husband and a son as President of the United States. And now, years later, we read in the biographies, that the outstanding qualities of this very unusual with and mother were her UNFAILING CHEERFULNESS and MAG - NIFICENT COURAGE. But most of all was her cheerful countenance and merry heart. Yes, indeed, great mothers are cheerful mothers. We cannot all be mothers and wives of Presidents,, but it is just as great and important to 1 c.-wives and mothers of happy families. -,-.'.'¦ : I have read recently the lives of such mothers as The Mother of Augustine, one of the saintliest and most scholarly of early Christians. Augustine's father was a Pagan nobleman of violent temper. He insisted theh- son must be educated as a scholar, so he was sent to Roriie to school. There he became quite taken with worldly affairs, andj his mother in talking to a Christian teacher, was told, "Go thy way Land God heft) thee; it is not possible that the child of these tears shojld perish." And shortly after, Augustine was consecrated Bishop of Hippo. He is referred to as one of the greatest Intellects the world has ever seen. He has paid many beautiful tributes to his mother. One of these is, "It was owing to the faithful and dally prayers of my inbther that I did not perish." George Washington's mother was left a widow at thirty-six years of age, with seven children. She was at that time strong, capable and de - termined above everything else to bring up her children and to fill the place of both father and mother. She directed the affairs of a large estate. She was energetic and industrious. It is said there can be no doubt that George Washington's mother taught him those principles of </seg>
         <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE straight-forwardness and manly honesty which marked him as a man She was a most affectionate mother, but she was also a woman of sound common sense, and wanted her children to TELL THE TRUTH AT ALL COSTS. As years came on and great honors came to her son, she was a wonderful example of cheerfulness and simple living. She never permitted complaining in her presence. "The mothers and wives ot brave men must be brave women," she said. George Washington is remembered as one of the greatest men ot alt me But there can be no doubt that much of this greatness was due to the wisdom and goodness of his mother. One of the greatest German poets of all times, Goethe, had an un - usually wonderful mother. After losing her husband and all her children excepting Wolfgang, she was a SWORN ENEMY OF GLOOM In he,- late years she wrote a friend, "I ,-ejoice in my life because he lamp still glows; look for no thorns, treasure up small pleasures.

" After the speech th^y solemnly placed their hands upon Ben's head and wished him God's blessings in his career as a painter. The boy was quick to see, not only that his mother was sympathetic, buf that her judgment of his pictures was generally correct, and he used to say he would rather have a compliment from his mother than from anyone else. He went to Philadelphia to study and later he stiidied in Rome. As a boy living in the back woods, he had almost bein denied educational privileges: He was quite a big boy before he sa^ his first painting. What he now saw in the art galleries of Rome thrilled him and opened up a new world for his endeavors. For days he gazed with awe and admiration at the pictures he saw there. j ¦ In 179 2he succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds as "President of the Royal Ackdemy of Arts", a position he held until his death in 1802. Some of his famous pictures are familiar the world over, "Christ Healing the Sick," "The Death of Wolfe/' "Death on the Pale Horse," and "Perm's Treaty With the Indians." It is safe to say that without such a mother Benjamin West would never have been heard ot. It was not simply a son's devotion to a mother, but rather the sound judgment ot a thoughtful man, which caused Benjamin West to say, "A KISS FROM MY MOTHER MADE ME A PAINTER.", , And so it is we realize that a mother's example becomes Impressed upon the child's memory and mind to stay with him as long as life shohld last. We must not become discouraged; remember the child who looked out while it was raining and said, "Mother, has God made anybody today?" His mother said, "Yes." "Well," he Bald, "I donj't see how he could because there isn't any dust." Then too, there is the small reasoning mind of the child who went to school the next moijning after the church burned down, "Gee, teacher, that was a funny joke God played on himself last night, burning down his own house." . !¦ "¦¦.. -.;. ¦ During these early years of the lives of our children, we must be wise as parents and wise as teachers.

What we as mothers need to teach the coming generation of mothers and fathers is that it is just as easy to explain intelligently every day to children, as It is to say, "Run away now, don't bother me, I'll explain some other day.

I grant you sometimes it seems Impossible at times to keep up with these young minds. Child needs are so simple. They are only made complex by their parents.

Each year a part of the budget has been set aside for the purpose of fostering this work. In 1936, seventy-five dollars were given to en - courage the Girls 4-H Club Activities. This money was divided among the four girls judging teams who won championship honors at the State Fair to help defray expenses for their trips to the National Club Congress in Chicago where they participated in the National Judging Contests. Developing of good judgment is a worthy goal. Judging contests helps to develop judgment. The girls are trained to recognize stand - ards in quality, to weigh comparative values and to give clear-cut reasons for their placings. The Nebraska delegation to the Club Congress made a very creditable showing for their state. The eight girls who represented the four judging teams this year were Baked Foods Canned Foods Dodge County Otoe County Wilma Bender Rachel Nash Margaret Ann Ferguson Maxlne Porter Clothing Girls' Room Webster County Buffalo County Velma Reigle Marjorie Lunsford Zelma Reigle Verla Worthing All of the girls have written letters of appreciation for the assistance which this organization gave them, thanking the Home Economics Section for the financial aid which made their trip possible. They have also submitted interesting detailed accounts of their experiences In Chicago. Lack of space prevents the printing of all of these delightful letters so two of the eight have been selected for printing in this report. These stories are typical of the other stories and show the many educational features which are made possible through these trips to the National Club Congress. The following story was written by Velma Reigle of Red Cloud, Nebraska: My Impressions of the 1936 Club Congress In this summary, I will attempt to briefly describe what I call the </seg>
         <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "high lights" of the 1936 Club Congress. T will attempt to give them in the order as they impressed me As being educational. First, I would say, would come our visit to the Planetarium. Here wei saw the movement of the planets, including the sun, moon and stars as they will appear on earth for the next six years. Since the movements of these planets are always in a fixed orbit, it; was possible to portray these movements quite accurately. It seemed' so real that at times we would have to stop and make ourselves remember that we were not really adding that many years to our ages. The lecture an d demonstration was given in a large dome-shaped building with a horizon outlined with tall sky-scrapers, making it appear like the city of Chicago itself. Next, comes the Field Museum. Here we saw first the human ra.ces in its four divisions: the white race, the Indians, the Negro and the yellow race. Some of the different characteristics of each race were illustrated in the various statues and pictures. We were taken from the very primitive man down to the modern man. 1 Another division took up the study of geology and marked the pi ogress of the countries in general. Botany was another phase illustrated. We saw a miniature swamp forest as It was supposed to hive appeared many many years ago in southern Illinois. The Insects ar d plant lite was patterned from Imprints found on fossils. The colors could only be guessed at by the botanist who had no way whereby the colors might be determined. (',. A study of zoology was the fourth division which illustrated very ; piehistoric animals down to the present day animals. Bones had j been put together to show the life size of many of these. Others were portrayed in large pictures or stuffed and put in apartments by them - selves with surroundings suited to their ways of living, making them seem very real. In the center of this hall was a mammoth pre-historic animal skeleton. Not all of the bones had been found but it was very large, one thigh bone.alone weighing 400 pounds. The stuffed i. animals were not stuffed with saw-dust as many are. A clay was fixed on the bones in the shape of: the muscles before the skin is stretched over and the animals were left hollow inside. This gave them a life - like appearance. The trip through the International Harvester Company building was very Interesting. The life and dangers ot factory workers cannot be realized until they are seen at work. In the smoke filled room many men are busy handling red-hot iron which is placed between two large iron weights, which when the top one come down upon the red hot Iron, It is shaped into a wheel, bur, axle, or what ever that particular man may be making. These molded articles are then put on a long Iron tray where they are cooled and then 1 are ready to go a step further </seg>

The machine make the fibers of the heniquin, a tropic plant, into binding twine Of course, this was only one of the various processes which it must go through before it is ready to be shipped out to retailers. On Thursday, we were taken through the Museum of Arts and Sciences, where various devices that are used in modern science were demonstrated. We saw one of the first cotton gins, a stoboscope (an instrument which makes moving objects appear as if they are standing still); a weight-testing device whereby architects determine how much weight a certain size steel rod will bear in the building of large build - ings; a miniature Ford motor plant; and last, but not least, a trip through a coal mine. The fifty mile sight seeing tour over the city on Sunday afternoon was not time lost. We were taken through the foreign parts of the city One street, especially was quite interesting. Even though it was Sunday afternoon the small markets along the street were doing bi - business and everybody seemed as busy as if they were the last minute holiday shoppers.

The Art Building was interesting to anyone who has studied any an at all. s„„ c a large number of the original painting* are displayed on its walls. Other things of interest were: Colleen Moore's Doll House, the Livestock Exposition, a visit at the Thomas E. Wilson Packing House and the Style Show at Orchestra Hall. Of course. I am sure we all greatly enjoyed being entertained by bears Roebuck and Company, Montgomery Ward and Company Chi - cago Mail Order, Thomas E. Wilson, and the International Harvester Company, along with everyone else who helped make the week a grand success.

T wasn't going to Chicago as an individual, but as one of j Nebraska's representatives. \ Our train left Omaha at about 8 p. m. As none of the berths were made, the girls went into the boy's Pullman car. It was there that we had our most important meeting. We were given instructions and each delegate was given the privilege of entrusting his money with our State Leader, Mr. Frisbie. ; We arrived in Chicago Sunday morning and went to church after resting in the Harrison Hotel for awhile.

This room commanded a splendid view of Lake Michigan. Monday was one of the few days that the atmosphere was clear while we were in Chicago. I From our judging room you could see miles of water and boats in the distances. \ From Monday until Thursday we were kept busy all the time. We would just get to the hotel and be off to some other place. It was sur - prising how far people went out of their way to entertain us. Everyone treated us kindly and we received many souvenirs. We even had motor cycle police to escort us to many places. : While waiting for the group to move Into the Dining Hall of the Stevens Hotel I saw some of the most beautiful yellow chrysanthemums I have ever seen. Few times was lat a table where only Nebraskans were sitting. The delegates of one state got acquainted with those from.other states very easily. Itwasn't unusual for a person to ask you who you were and where you were from. We were asked to sign so many autograph hooks that a person should have been able to write any place, any time, and in any position. i In the Field Museum of Natural History I saw many things that were directly related to what we were studying in our history class </seg>

The presenta - tion of the winners was the high light of the Tuesday night program. Wednesday morning I went to the Auditorium Hotel to a breakfast given by the Chicago and North Western Railway to educational prize winners. It was my first breakfast engagement. During our whole stay in Chicago we had to buy very few meals. The trip through the McCormick Twine Mill was very interesting. I could remember of having seen parts of it in the picture shows put out by that company. At the Matinee Horse Show Wednesday afternoon at the Inter - national Livestock Exposition I found how little I know about horses. I would pick the winners of a class, wait for the judges decision, and see how far wrong 1 was. I have often wanted to see a polo game. We saw a portion of a small game there. Thursday noon most of us girls went shopping. We didn't have much time but we saw the Colleen Moore Doll House. It was a beau - tiful little house. I would liked to have stayed there longer. It was so real and yet so beautiful that one hardly dared to breath for fear it would vanish in a puff of smoke. Wednesday night we had the chance to see the 4-H club seam - stresses at the Style Show. I think that our tour through the Museum of Science and Industry was the most educational feature of our trip We went down into a coal mine located under the building and saw how science rules the mines. We left for Omaha Thursday night and arrived there in the morn - ing. By changing trains in Omaha, my team mate and I arrived home at about 2:30 p. m. Thursday. In a report like this I cannot tell everything I did and saw but I can say that I had an excellent time.

DAVIS Recently our home demonstration project clubs studied In the regular project work the subject of the Important Job of Homemaking. We realize that the job of homemaking is one of the most real of all professions and one which requires our best efforts and thought. Per - haps one of the biggest jobs of homemakers is this very thing which we have for discussion today—strengthening the family morale. The farm population January 1, 1936, was 31,809,000 people. Agriculture Is the nation's primary industry. It involves the largest capital and the greatest number of workers. It is made up of six millions of family partnerships. Farming is the only occupation in which the entire family operates as a unit. The very nature of farming business makes it different from all other occupations. In no other occupation is the home and business plant so closely related. This fact makes the farm woman of greater importance to the economic success of her husband than in any other type of business. You can think of business and professional men in your own acquaint - ances who could live in a rooming house, take all meals at a restaurant, and get along very well In a business way without the aid and assistance of a wife. In fact, some people go so far as to say that from an economic standpoint, city wives are a liability instead of an asset. But not so with the farm wife. She Is too much of a necessary partner in this business of agriculture to ever be called an economic liability. From an economic point of view, the farm homemaker is a partner in the farm business. Often she steps in during an emergency and helps with outside work, some of It heavy work. And almost always she manages the poultry flock. Some women have found it to their financial advantage to develop money-making hobbies. They </seg>
         <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION first started as sidelines and then developed into regular enterprises. We have some very good evidences of this here in Nebraska where women have become interested in raising a few turkeys, finding them so interesting and profitable that they have developed their hobby into a real money-producing farm enterprise. In some caseß, it has beish the turkey flock which has been the cash income, paid the Interest an I even the principal of the farm mortgage. : Some women have found it profitable to spend some of their time — [ won't say spare time—but have found It worthwhile to devote some of their time to other money-making activities, such as baking cakes, pastries; bread, making butter, cottage cheese, or even bee raising. Last summer when we were attending the Associated Country Women of the World Conference in Washington, it was our privilege to spend some time at a farm women's cooperative market in Bethseda, Maryland. This is an outlet for surplus commodities which the farm homemaker can turn into cash. Here a farm homemaker may bring anything she has to sell—products we saw included milk, cream, cot - tage cheese, fried chicken, baked chicken, raw chickens, canned products, fresh vegetables, cherries, candy, home-made ice cream, cakes, bread, flowers, and so on. Each woman had her stall and stayed until her products were sold or until she wanted to go home. One of the secrets of success of this market is the very high quality of product which is sold. Each product must be uniform and no woman is per - mitted to sell inferior products. Perhaps we can't set up a market of this kind, because of lack of consumption demand, but perhaps it might be suggestive of what an individual homemaker could do to receive more for her raw products. Time, energy, and originality might be capitalized on by those who live near the larger towns. Just what is the role of the farm homemaker? In the first place, the atmosphere of the farm home is of vital Importance because of the close contact which the husband has with his home and the im - mediate effects on his work. It a non-cooperating wlte decides to sleep until she feels like getting up, and the farmer must get his own break - fast, valuable time worth dollars and cents is lost right there—to say nothing about other losses in serenity of mind and disposition. I Perhaps one of the unifying benefits of rural life is the splendid cooperation which exists in farm homes. All members of the family work together, plan together, and pull together for benefits enjoyed by all. In contrast with city homes, the pull of the town or city on the younger members of the family is OUTWARD. Demands are con - stantly being made, many of them fine and worthwhile, but never - theless the pull is OUT of the home. The pull of the farm home is IN. </seg>
         <seg id="p490">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE More of their desires are satisfied within the family circle. The habit of working together, and yes, the habit of work itself is a marked characteristic of rural boys and girls who go out from their homes and work in other places. The guiding hand in the growth of the forward moving young people in the farm home is, of course, the mother. She Is the hub of the wheel, the force that binds them together and directs their activities. She is so much more than just a housekeeper! The homemaker's real job, is in building a home which results in human satisfactions and happiness. She directs the personal life of the home and probably carries the larger responsibility along this line. Someone has said that the family which is unhappy and badly adjusted usually manifests it in a vocal way, while the more satisfying relation - ships are taken for granted. One of the current magazines carried an article recently the title of which was "How to Quarrel if You Must." This article brought out the effect on children who listened to family arguments and it gave serious food for thought. A study of satisfactory family life undertaken by Mrs. Chase Going Woodhouse was entitled "Does Money Make the Marriage Go?" This study was sponsored by the Bureau of Home Economics and Child Development and Parental Education Committee of American Home Economics Association. The families studied were chosen because the husband and wife were well adjusted to each other and they were doing a good piece of work in rearing their children. The money question was studied carefully in these families and these conclusions were reached: Management of the financial side of family life was found to be greater importance for harmony than the size of the Income. The size of income was not so much the real source of worry. Rather, it was a question of attitudes toward its use. The wives who did not worry were those who had a plan and followed it. Worries which were talked over disappeared, or at least seem less serious. Perhaps there is food for thought In these conclusions. Another study on the essentials of a successful home was made in which 344 individuals were closely studied. Altogether they listed 2208 essentials which were important in building a successful home. However, those which were stressed most often were: Attitudes Personal traits Relationships Economic factors The key word In these successful family studies seemß to be adjust - ment.

The satisfying home is dependent on the ability to get along with others. Happiness of life is. dependent on that. Happiness depends on service to others, and work. . One of the marks of an educated individual is his ability to get along with people and that is dependent upon a number ot factors: Physical Health Mental Health—complexes, mood- Language—Someone has said "A soft word turneth away wrath". 7 How we treat the people around us. The subject "Strengthening the Family Morale" implies that there ar. ways of facing some of the perplexing questions and problems before the homemakers today. We are all familiar with the old say - ing, "It Isn't the load one carries, but it Is HOW it is carried." In the time we have for open discussion, let's talk over some of the pr iblems before us this winter and profit from each other's experience." Some ot the questions discussed were: How may hard times be made a challenge instead of a catastrophy?... ¦ Are there ways of adding to family income now? What is meant by the expression "Can you take it?" What have we for which to be thankful this year? History shows that our civilization has been carried on by the survival of the fittest. Fighting to survive brings out the best in one. Is this true? What is the most precious thing on earth? Has it been affected by drouth? How can one develop a sense of values? What is the value of a hobby? How can family hobbles be de - veloped? Are the facilities for rural library service adequate at the pres - ent.time? "The mother's attitude toward life and her job has been a great inluence on the family morale. In closing, let me mention the little mother who attended a meeting similar to this one and after listening to the discussion, she said, "I am going home and I think I'll complain a little less and smile a lot more." </seg>
         <seg id="p492">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WHAT'S AHEAD FOR RURAL AMERICA MRS. CHAS. W. SEWELL Administrative Director of the Associated Women of the American Farm Bureau Federation In the Constitution of the American Farm Bureau Federation appear these words, "the object for which it is formed is to provide, protect and represent the business, economic, social and educational interests of the farmers of the Nation, and to develop agriculture". The social life of rural America then becomes one of the major in - terests of the Farm Bureau. The phrase "enrichment of rural social life", like many others at various intervals of American experience, became a catch phrase dur - ing the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. This dynamic per - sonality appointed the famous Country Life Commission. The findings were made the basis of magazine and newspaper articles and sur - veys of one and another sort for a period of the next decade. One of the most widely discussed conclusions was the one which said, "Far too often the hardest worked laborer on the farm is the farmer's wife". In one interesting survey carried on by a metropolitan magazine, sev - eral questions were presented to the farm woman. They ran some - thing like this: If you were unmarried, would you prefer a farmer to a man ot any other occupation, all else being equal? What do you consider the hardest part of women's work on the farm? Would you want your daughter to marry a farmer? The answers which were received were not very complimentary to the profession of farming or of being a farmer's wife. One woman, telling of how her husband had sacrificed everything, including the farm family, to buy more land, coined the expression "farm phobia". Another clever little woman said, "It would be necessary for a woman to possess the faith of a Methodist, the perservance of a Presbyterian, the penance spirit of a Catholic and the cleanliness of a Baptist to be a success as a farmer's wife." They all plead for more conveniences In the farm home, more time for leisure and the enjoyment of the cultural arts. Twenty-five years ago in most farming communities, the roads were impassable for long periods of the year. There was no daily delivery of newspapers, magazines and mail order catalogues, few telephones radio was unknown, while if one enjoyed the blessings of heat, light and water systems, it was necessary to retire from the farm and move Into the near-by town or village. The changing years have brought </seg>
         <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION at out a reversal of this condition and until 1920 the changes took:, pi ice very rapidly, transforming rural America into a most beautlful - an d livable place for the most part. The word "enrichment" Is synonymous with "abundance" and', "irofusion" as relates to soil, crops, food, material possessions and. still better, the arts of real living. A group of several hundred leaders,. in\l93o, attempted'to project a more adequate basis for ail programs - which advance better living. They decided that there were 7 great arts implied in the standards of living: 1. The acquiring of financial income. 2. The effective use of income and supplementary resources. 3. The profitable use of human time and energy. 4. The creating and appreciating of beauty. ! 5. The adapting of benefits from science and Invention! fi. The advancing of effective types of cooperation. 7. The perfecting of faiths, attitudes and philosophies of life. For many years there was little or no distinction between rural' and urban America, but with the development of the' years urban America began to be regarded as more desirable—the place of .bright lights, fun and pleasure; while the rural areas were gradually allowed to become dull, drab and dingy places in;which people worked rather than lived. In spite of the changes which have been brought about by the depression of the past several years, anyone who travels through the country as a whole feels quite sure that urban America today stunds as badly in need of enrichment as regards better living, as can possibly be the case of the countryside. Many things, like charfty, begin at home. So perhaps the first direction for the enrichment of rural life should be to make your own home the pleasantest possible place in all the world for the members of the family who reside there. The devolpment of an appreciation of the beauty of every-day living, of the blessing of toil, of the companionship with one another, with m ture and with nature's God, are things which cannot be purchased with mere money. Time for practicing the little social amenities, of politeness between parents and children, of courtesy to one's elders, toj teachers and those in authority, the habit of gratitude for simple things and the encouragement of an ability to entertain one's self can or ly be applied within our own homes. From the home one goes to the community as a natural sequence. In one of Thoreau's delightful essays, he suggests to a friend whom he is inviting to spend the week-end with him, "You will find at the camp excellent meat, bread and wine, if you bring it with you". A study of this simple statement has much food for thought. There are - persons who get a great deal out of life no matter where that life is lived, while there are others who live within a poverty of soul and. </seg>

A careful analysis of the steps needed to be taken in the enrichment of rural social life will soon result In a realization that there are many things which are needed to be done In order to realize the fullest and most profitable existence, that cannot be attempted or accom - plished by the individual effort alone. The oldest type of cooperative enterprise known is that expressed by school and church, which oc - cupied a permanent part in the lives of the people who settled America. A traveler In South America was several years ago asked the ques - tion as to why North America had excelled the southern continent in invention and advancement. The reply was made that it was largely because of those who settled the two countries following the discovery Of the western hemisphere, the pioneers of North America had come seeking religious freedom and the foundation of homes wherein they and their posterity might work and worship according to the dictates of their own conscience, whereas South America had been comparatively little developed even to the present time because the people who were attracted there went seeking for gold. Our present day needs call for the same attention paid the original enterprises for an enriched rural life, with the inclusion of a few new projects or the modification of those generally accepted. A church which has a weekly program designed to fit the people who attend it for life here as well as here - after and a school which is to prepare those passing through its various grades for life rather than entrance into college or university roads which will carry the farm family and the products which it raises every day in the year, adequate library facilities and various provisions for safety and protection, are still as badly needed as they were in the days of the original thirteen colonies. Better rural hous - ing, rural electrification and collective measures for the purchase of medical and hospital care can do much for the enrichment of rural life. There Is a great need for a program of recreation in every rural community in America, fitted to the life of the people who dwell there, rather than an adaptation of the recreation enjoyed by urban dwellers. The writing of a great American novel, properly portraying the Ideals of country living, can add much to the enrichment of rural life. Such a novel must be written by a real farm woman and constitutes a challenge to one of our number. Preparation for journal - ism that will tell the story of the needs and hopes and aspirations of rural people to those who live in our crowded cities is very much needed. The women of the Farm Bureau have taken the lead in the de - velopment of music festivals, dramatic tournaments and public speak - ng contests, while their part in the promotion of community meet - ings, like unto the forums of ancient Rome and the debating societies </seg>

H. Hoppert, Lincoln 7 MR. C. C. WIGGANS: In the absence of our President, Mr. Frank Sim, it falls to my lot to present the speakers of the morning. I will do this very briefly and then they can do their stuff. The program has been arranged largely around the question of hardiness ot trees. The experience of the last few years has given us a different viewpoint of that question, especially as to the-'drouth resisting qualities of ¦ our shade as well as our ornamental trees. ¦ The first speaker this morning will be Dr. TRosenquist of the De - partment of Agricultural Botany, University of Nebraska. Ho will ;B peak on "What Alls our Street Trees". Dr. Rosenquist. </seg>
         <seg id="p500">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE DR. C. E. ROSEINQUIST: Dr. Wiggans and friends. Dr. Wiggans was just saying that on account of the small crowd, I might not get so much done because I am accustomed to large classes but I'm sure we will get along all right. I gave this same talk to the Garden Club last fall and perhaps some of you have heard it before, if so I hope you'll pardon me. WHAT AILS OUR STREET TREES C. E. ROSENQUIST There is no doubt that farm properties all over the state have de - preciated greatly in value due to the dying of trees on the farms and roadsides. In like manner, the loss of trees in the city depreciates property value and detracts from the beauty and attractiveness of the c. yas a whole. Trees in the country have been dying in wholesale lots, the farms often becoming completely devoid of trees. The cities artincialif mUCh beUe'' **** *°™ "^ * USUa"y SUpplied During the great drought of 1934 I made several trips over the eastern half of the state in order to observe the behavior of our trees A few ot these trips were to Fairbury a „d vicinity where trees were reported dying by the wholesale. A few miles south of that city on bottom land was a wooded area of a few acres in which all trees except he Honey Locusts appeared dead. The bushes also appeared dead I counted the dead and living trees and checked them again in the spring of 1935. The results of this count showed that there were 29S trees on this area 121 Honey Locust, 46 ash and 118 elms The remainder were boxelder and Cottonwood. The survival percentages were ash 96; honey locust 93; small elms 24; large elms 16; boxelder and Cottonwood 0. Soil samples were taken to a depth of 8 ft. which showed no available water below the 2nd floot. Below the 2nd foot was nothing but sand. _&#132; 77°7 er "^ °f g °°d SUbsoil bur oak3 ' elms ' and Li"den were studied Bur oak survived 93%, elms 88%, and Linden 85%. Again from the 2nd to the 10th foot there was very little available moisture. A study of the moisture content under a medium sized mulberry ree near Shickley showed no available moisture from the 2nd to the 14th foot inclusive. In these studies it was evident that the large trees were much more susceptable to drought than the smaller ones. Dr. Wiggans of the Department of Horticulture has found in his sampling experiments that orchard soils at Union and near Falls City contain very little subsoil moisture down to 30 feet in depth. Beyond a doubt such lack of subsoil moisture would be found under the trees in our cities if moisture studies were made. In Fairbury I sank a soil </seg>
         <seg id="p501">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY tube about 6 feet In a lawn where trees were suffering only to find dry sand below the 2nd foot. It was evident that this was the cause ot the early effects of the drought in that city. At the risk of being thought queer I canvassed some of the Fair - bury streets classifying the street trees, as far back as the houses, into dead (i.e. dead or more) and surviving. By this means I determined that Red Cedars, Austrian Pines, Honey Locusts, Hackberries, Ailanthus and Norway Maples survived 100%. Chinese elms, ordinary elms and ash about 93%. Silver maple and catalpa survived 65%, cotton - wood and Linden-50% and boxelder 45%. About 700 trees were classified. Common elms composed 42%, silver maples and boxelders 21% of the total population. These figures are important when we remember the poor survival of the last named trees. About 15% of the trees of Fairbury died in 1934 largely because of the abundance of poorly adapted varieties. I In the fall of 1936 I made a similar survey of the street trees of Lincoln which indicated that about 18% of our trees are now, or soon wll be dead and another 18% are injured. The trees ot Lincoln ranged in drought resistance almost exactly as those of Fairbury. Elms compose 46% of our street and front lawn trees; boxelders and silver mapes 14%. The dead (d) and injured (I) percentages were re - spectively (d) 10, (i) 15; (d) 46, (i) 42, and (d) 55, (i) 21. Most of these trees were found In the narrow and usually hilled up space between the sidewalk and the curb. Such trees are almost wholly de pendent upon the adjoining lawns for their water. If these lawns ha ire not been watered even sufficiently to save the grass they can hardly be expected to support their own stand of trees and those near this curb besides. If subsoil moisture In our lawns has been badly de - picted how can it be replaced? Dr. Wiggans has shown that mulching a vineyard will retain moisture even better than clean cultivation or farming practices. But a mulch is well-night, an impossibility unless gr iss can be made to act as a mulch, which I. believe it does to a certain ex;ent. In cities with water available it can be added to our soils by several methods. The "splatter" method is very popular in Lincoln. You have no doubt seen people splattering just enough water on their lawns to aggravate the grass. Trees are Conscious of this moisture only as it might slightly increase the humidity as it evaporates. A very good methods is to allow a sprinkler to run a few hours at each setting. Tnen there are irrigation methods i.e. some means ot introducing water into a more or less limited area which will soak the subsoil fairly well. If a low area of considerable size can be produced around a tree water can be made to stand and settle there. This method Is im - portant on farms where run-oft water could be directed to a tree and </seg>
         <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE impounded. The lance method is held In favor by many people and If used methodically should be quite economical for water is actually added some distance below the surface by means of a lance attached to a hose. Considerable water pressure is needed in this case. Tiles are sometimes inserted a foot or two into the soil at regular intervals around a tree and water applied in abundance within each. These tiles can be plugged when not in use or can be filled with gravel or cinders. The tree roots will increase greatly In number and spread around these watering places so that water will reach the roots very quickly when applied. One wonders then where in the soil are the feeding roots now so that one can apply water almost directly to revive and stimulate injured trees. It is my belief that they are concentrated in the upper few feet of soil and possibly in the depths of the soil i.e. from 20-3 0 feet in depth. Many of our large trees have been accustomed to send their roots a little deeper year by year to obtain more needed moisture. Now they have come to a place where this subsoil moisture is no longer available and they must depend greatly upon surface moisture. Many trees are especially well adapted to this since they have a wide spread of roots. I have found roots the size of a pencil 45 feet from a 20 ft. cedar and sprouts 45 feet from a 25 foot Ailanthus. Deep rooted trees, according to F. H. Hayes, Senior Soil Scientist, Bu. Soils &amp; Chemistry are: Ponderosa pine, hackberry, Bur oak, Honey locust, mulberry and Osage orange. Medium rooted trees are: Green ash, common elms, red cedar, Russian olive, Caragana, black locust and boxelder. Shallow rooted trees are: Jack pine, Scotch pine, Norway spruce, willow, cottonwood and catalpa. These trees with a few ex - ceptions are fairly arranged in point of drouth resistance with the shallow rooted oues the poorest. Many people are interested in the possibility of saving the badly injured trees now on their lawns or streets. Severe pruning and topping back may be necessary to attempt the salvage of such trees and it should be done any time now before spring or in early spring. Above all one should apply plenty of water by any means best suited to the individual, and save our trees. In that way all properties containing trees will be greatly enhanced in beauty as well as intrinsic value. MR. WIGGANS: lam sure Dr. Rosenquist would be glad to answer any questions you may have to ask him. Q. I didn't understand about the tile system of watering. How deep should the tile be laid? DR. ROSENQUIST: Use about one or two foot tile, placed vertically so that the upper end of the tile is an inch below the level of the lawn. </seg>
         <seg id="p503">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Q. What about the lance system? MR.. WIGGANS: I haven't had any personal experience with this - system but it has been successful in many cases of which I have heard. No water is lost through evaporation. The trees must accustom them - selves to reach down for the water. Of course, it is useful only where - wa;er pressure is available. REMARK: In the country, where we do not have a water system, only windmills, I have had good success trenching from one tree to - another and pumping directly into the trench. DR. ROSENQUIST: May I say a word about that. When you plant your trees, look for a lOw place or dig out the soil and make it a foot or (two lower than the surrounding area so snow and water will ac - cumulate and help to keep the trees alive during dry weather. MR, WIGGANS: We have been having a little experience with that problem in our orchard. W fe planted trees several years ago where old trees had died. We hadn't realized that the old trees had died for lack of sufficient moisture. These young trees have just been surviving and that's all and this fall we decided to water them. We started a stream of water through a %" pipe and let it run for nearly a month in some places and the ground soaked it all up. Q. Is the death of trees due entirely to lack of moisture? MR. WIGGANS: No, sometimes it is due to insects. Borers of various kinds have been on the increase since 1934. These troubles, of course, are greatly aggravated by lack of moisture. Q. I would like to ask about winter watering. I have been putting about two pails of water a day on two trees near my house. Would it damage the trees to keep this up during freezing weather? MR. WIGGANS: lam sure there would be no damage. There are times-when an excess of moisture early in the fall causes trouble byj causing activity and growth too late in the season but later on in the winter, it would cause no trouble. ')¦&lt;_. Do you not think that extremes in summer temperatures have caused much loss inspriice, pine and fir? ' MR. WIGGANS: Yeß, Indeed. There have been instances where the subsoil showed plentiful supplies of moisture and still such trees died. .-".''.. -[ MR.

MR WILLIAMS: Dr. Wiggans, members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society and friends. ._ ' 77 a C6rtaln day back ln the summer °£ "34. It was one ot those blistering hot August days and I was discussing the weather with a group of fellow nurserymen. This day stands out in my mind be - cause of the fact that this was the first time I had heard any of the stories that were being circulated that summer to the effect that Ne - braska was reverting to a great American desert. It was said that the proof of this was in the fact that you couldn't find a tree in Nebraska over 50 years old. This indicated, according to the stories, that a great drouth had wiped out all of our trees 50 years ago and that we were due for another such happening. This idea rather startled me, even though I did not believe it. These same stories were told again in 1936. Now, I don t think any of us really believe that we are reverting to desert conditions. However I do have some definite convictions about the drouth in relation to trees. I believe we are passing through a period of drouth that will wipe out a great percentage of our larger and older trees. Younger trees in many species will survive, but larger and older trees will continue to die except in favored locations, or unless heavily watered. I think this loss will take place even though our moisture gets back to normal in 1937. In my judgment, it will take a very sharp upturn above normal rainfall and an improvement in the summer heat situation to foresta the continued loss of our trees. There are three reasons for this belief on my part. First, the larger and older trees have rooted deeper and have exhausted the sub-soil moisture to a point which will no longer sustain plant life. Second, larger trees have a greater leaf surface and there is. therefore, a greater transpiration of moisture 77 77 U dl 7 BUmmer months- Th,rd ' t]l°usands °* large trees which to the casual observer, are ln a thrifty condition are really badly infested with borers and it is doubtful if they will survive.

Last September the Nebraska Nurserymen's Association met in Fremont and a little time was given over to the discussion of trees, what species had endured the drouth best, etc It soon became apparent that there was a wide difference of opinion on several matters, and that we would not get very far in the brief time ndavr 3,r a,la!' le- ' WaS ' ther6fore ' asked t0 Colltact ambers individually and report my findings later.

         <seg id="p505">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY QUESTION: 'It you were limited to a single species to grow and sell, what would it be?' In the vicinity of Lincoln and further west, Chinese Elm Is the : answer. Most nurserymen seem to feel that they would rather have !•' a tree that can be depended on to grow under adverse conditions, even j though it has some bad habits. Farther east, along the Missouri, nurserymen picked the American Elm in answer to this question. If ..; we go still farther east into lowa, we find at least one well known j nurseryman who would prefer Pin Oak. ... Q. 'Name the ten best trees In the order ot their importance.' In all but the more favored sections of the state, the selected order seemed to be Hackberry, Chinese Elm, American Elm, Thornless Honey Locust, Pin Oak and American Linden with Molina Elm, Russian Olive, Green Ash and Burr Oak bringing up the rear. Q. 'Answer the following about Chinese Elm: Is It suitable tor - street, lawn and park planting or do you use it for want of something | better?' There is considerable difference of opinion on this subject. Most ¦j nurserymen feel that It has a definite place, especially where quick j results are desired. There is a wide variation and difference in types j of Chinese Elm. Considerable work is being done now to insure a j better type tree by careful selection of seed from trees ot definitely known superior characteristics. Eventually we probably shall resort : to budding or grafting in order to perpetuate some definite type. This j is the method used in propagation of the Moline Elm and a uniformly i superior type American Elm has resulted. Then, too, some of the new Chines Elm, hybrids may develop into something exceptionally good. i." However, it will take several years to determine just how superior j they may be. Now, as to the bad features ot the Chinese Elm, there are several which can be mentioned. It is apt to form bad crotches and break in the wind as It becomes older. Personally, I believe that by judicious pruning, starting in the nursery rows, it can be developed into a speci - men tree with a strong, desirable top structure. Some authorities disagree, with this and will use it only as an untrimmed, wlnd-break type of tree. Other bad features are that it has been known to winter injure in some localities and it is subject to canker occasionally. The Chinese Elm, it is generally agreed will not prove to be a long lived tree. The oldest tree that I have a report of is 25 years old. . The Chinese Elm has received.a lot of favorable publicity and is the most popular tree with the public at the present time. ¦ It resists borer attacks and grows remarkably fast. It is little short of marvelous </seg>
         <seg id="p506">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE how fast It has been known to grow under favorable conditions. In the more difficult situations, it Is pretty much of a toss up as to whether Chinese Elm or Hackberry is preferable, with the odds slightly In favor of Chinese Elm. The Hackberry has held up well through the entire drouth area, and tops the list of the ten best trees In the minds of many nursery - men and horticulturists. It grows rather slowly, however, possibly almost as fast as American Elm under favorable conditions, but by no means as fast as Chinese Elm. It is a hardy, drouth resistant tree and is much less subject to insect and fungous troubles of all kinds than Is the American Elm. It is subject to a nipple gall on the foliage which is not seriously detrimental, however. It also occasionally has a for - mation known as witches broom which is caused by a small mite or louse of some kind. Trees so infested show twiggy—bird nest—like formations through the branches. In severe cases, this disfigures the natural beauty of the tree. I have been informed that this can be controlled by spraying. Q. 'Do you think the damage suffered by the American Elm this year and the potential threat of elm wilt and Dutch elm disease is sufficient to justify our discontinuance of this tree?' In spite of some sad experiences with this tree, it still has a place. In areas where watering is done freely, or in the more favored sections of the state, it can still be safely used. I will not be greatly surprised if it returns within a few years to its former position as our No. 1 tree. Q. 'Is the Soft Maple definitely out of the picture as far as future planting is concerned?' The answer seem sto be uniformly, 'Ves'. This was the first shade tree to show the full effects of the drouth. I saw large soft maple trees in Omaha last tall which still seemed to be in good shape, but I think they will find almost no place in any Nebraska tree planting program for several years to come. Q. 'Do you have any comments to make on the relation of tree spacing to drouth damage?' We must space our trees farther apart unless the situation is such that watering will be done freely as the trees grow and exhaust the subsoil moisture. Q. 'Those who attended the September 15th meeting of the Ne - braska Nurseryman's Association at Fremont saw large American Elm and Sycamores seriously injured by drouth. If the Fremont water level Is as close to the surface as it is said to be, why should these trees suffer?' </seg>
         <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY The explanation for this Is that these were fairly old trees, some of them 50 years or more and they had exhausted the subsoil moisture dovn as far as their roots extended. They had adjusted their root systems to a fairly high water table and were unable to adjust them - selves quickly enough to a rapidly lowering water table. Now, about Oak trees. The Pin oak is a fine, symetrical tree and, in the deeper soils along the Missouri river does very well. Locally and west and south from Lincoln, this tree does not always do so well. Our soil apparently is lacking in certain elements, and chlorosis some - times results. However, there are many fine Pin oaks in this section of Nebraska, and due to its comparative rapidity of growth and the ease with which it stands transplanting, it still remains a worthy tree. The Red oak is one of our native trees that is possibly more widely adapted to Nebraska conditions than are some of the other oaks, it is lot so popular, however, as It does not hold Its foliage over winter and Is probably not so attractive as the Pin oak. Q. We had a very large oak tree near our house that died sud - denly last summer. It got as much moisture apparently as any of the other trees which survived. What do you suppose was the cause? MR. WILLIAMS: I would hesitate to say what was wrong. It looks like a deficiency of moisture. Q. Will you name again the trees as listed on your questionaire in order of hardiness? '-&#132;.'. MR. WILLIAMS: You understand, of course, that this list was summarized from all parts of the state. Hackberry, Chinese Elm, American Elm, Thornless Honey Locust, Pin Oak, American Linden, Moline Elm, Russian Olive, Green Ash and Burr Oak". MR. WIGGANS: lam sure we are all grateful to Mr. Williams for bringing us this summation of his questionaire. The next speaker on our program is a man from the section where it is even harder to'grpw trees than it is here in Nebraska. Sometimes I think of the Dakotas and western Nebraska as being right on the firing line as far as hardiness in trees is concerned. Mr, A. F. Yeager, Secretary of the North Dakota Horticultural Society, will talk to you on "Hardy Ornamentals for the Northern Great Plains". MR. YEAGER: May I make a comment in connection with the discussion on Chinese Elm. We have:arrived at some very definite conclusions as far as Chinese Elm is concerned in our. state. Up north, this tree is decidedly on the questionable list because it can not withstand the severe cold of North Dakota. It simply shows that in different localities, a tree differs in hardiness: It may withstand drouth and be hardy but would hot he considered hardy ln North. </seg>
         <seg id="p508">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Dakota because of low temperatures. We found the American Elm to be much more favorable for our climate. SOME NEWER HARDY ORNAMENTALS A. F. YEAGER North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station Before discussing hardy ornamentals, it is first necessary that we have an idea of just what is meant by hardiness. People in different parts of the country rarely agree as to which plants or species are most hardy. Plants which we class as hardy in North Dakota may be tender here in Nebraska. I believe the most practical definition for hardiness we can give is: The adaptability of a plant to the environ - ment n which it finds itself. Environment includes many factors. ¦We think first of "cold", but there are many other factors which in - fluence the amount of damage which may be done by cold. Immaturity of the plant at the time of f,ost, due perhaps to high nitrogen soil or excess water in th. fall, may result in the killing back of the tips. Drouth, combined with cold during the winter will result in the killing of branches and trunks where without it there would be no damage. Snow in connection with fluctuating temperatures and bright sun may result in sunscnld. Periods of warm weather during the winter months which tend to renew growth make the plants susceptible to a.rly moderate cold thereafter. Snow cover which increases sun - sea Id may at the same time reduce freezing of the roots. Other factors besides cold which affect the ability of the plant to survive are its resistance to such thin s _ as extreme heat, or drouth in the summer, the effect of wind, or even insects and disease. Fire blight may destroy Bechtels c,-al, apple trees, for example. Red spider may cause the death of things susceptible to it. Conditions which prevail in North Dakota differ considerably from yours. In the first place, our summer growing season is much shorter normally ranging from 100 to 120 days. Rainfall ranges from 22 lw S .„ .? 6aSt t0 " inCheS in the W6St' Winter temperatures often sink to 30 degrees, or even 40 degrees, below zero and these may pre - vail for some length of time. In the eastern part, at least, it is common for snow to fall in the early winter and remain on the ground until spring. The state as a whole does not have extended periods In winter when temperatures rise above freezing such as are common this far souin. Of the newer ornamental plants, the following are some which under our conditions show desirable characteristics: Prinsepia sinensis is a very attractive hardy shrub introduced by </seg>
         <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY plant explorers of the United States Department of Agriculture from Asia.

It produces yellow flowers and purple fruits." ."¦'"'.'."¦;•'¦'':' i . ' ' . .-i ' The common Tamarix has not been hardy In North Dakota, but we apparently now have plants which have the ability to withstand our conditions. These are a form of Tamarix pentandra amurense. These Bhrubs are willow-like in their growth, reaching a height of 15 feet and carrying feathery foliage and pink blossoms which appear in mid - summer and continue until fall. Euonytnus nanus Is a low growing form of the burning bush. For us, it supplies a specimen for low plantings which is hardy and attrac - tive both in winter and summer. Cnrngana pygmea is a dwarf species reaching only 3 or 4 feet in height. It bears the characteristic yellow flowers of other species of this genus. It is useful both as an ornamental on the lawn and as a dwirf hedge plant. . Betty Bland Rose. Ordinary roses, such as hybrid perpetuals, are not hardy without protection in North Dakota and even if they were their value as a shrub is small. Betty Bland is a variety produced by Mr Frank Skinner of Dropmore, Manitoba,' which seems to have possibilities for use in shrubbery plantings. It Is a cross between the wild Rosa Wanda and a cultivated variety. The stems are bright red, flowers semi-double pink, rather small in size, foliage attractive. Prunus nana, Siberian Almond, is another dwarf shrub reaching about 3 feet in height. It is very hardy and is one of the earliest plants to bloom In the spring, reproduces by suckers. Berberis vernae; This barberry appears to be much more hardy than the Japanese barberry. It is somewhat larger in plant, with, very dark glossy foliage. The objection to this at present lies In the fact that It Is on the suspected list as a carrier of wheat rust.; Plant patho - logists at'the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station, however, have never found pustules on field grown plants. Philadelphia virginnl is a variety of mock orange which, through not completely hardy in North Dakota, produces an abundance of large double white flowers even though it does kill back to some extent. In our trials, it has been the most attractive plant of this genus even though it is not scented. Splrea arguta, Snow Garland Spirea, seems to vary somewhat in hardiness.

Spirea Douglas Is one of the pink flowered summer blooming splreas. It grows about 3 feet in height and where there Is sufficient water, seems to be fully as hardy as S. bill.-mli, but produces larger clusters of attractive flowers. Spirea trlcbocnrpa. The plants we have of this appear to be identical with the ones secured as S. Henryi. It is perhaps a bit less drouth resistant than S. Van Houtll but more resistant to cold. The plant resembles Van Houtil to some extent, but the blossom clusters appear about two weeks later, hence It supplements the blooming season of that attractive ornamental. Cotonenstcr acute folia is one of the newer shrubs which has become quite important In our plantings. It is a medium sized plant with dark green glossy leaves. It is especially useful as a hedge plant and pro - duces one of the best autumn effects of any shrub because the leaves remain on until late in the fall and display unusually brilliant colors. The berries are black in color and hold on well. Cotoneaster intoßcvrinuv Is a second species of this genus, which seems to be hardy. The plant itself is less attractive than acutefolia, but the fruit is red which makes it more desirable for some locations. Daphne cncorum Is a very small shrub reaching only one foot in height which is making a place for itself in the rock garden. It is one of the few hardy broadleaved evergreens. Rhamnus dahurica: This species closely resembles the ordinary buckthorn but is superior to It for general planting in that it is not a host plant for oats rust. Its black berries remain on the plant through - out the winter. Viburnum Amcricanum: This is one of the best plants for winter fruits, which are red in color. The plant somewhat resembles its near relative the snowball, but the bloom clusters are flat insteady of round. If you are familiar with the European highbush cranberries this too would be recognized since they are much alike. The fact that the berries of this American species are edible has attracted our nursery - man to it. Several very desirable selections are being propagated at the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. Our Canadian friends are producing new varieties of lilacs which seem to have much promise. We are indebted to Mr. Frank Skinner of Dropmore, Manitoba, for Hiawatha and Haudel, hybrid varieties which are late In season of bloom but start blooming young. Plants which made a foot of growth the first season produced large clusters of pink blossoms the following spring. </seg>

Regal is not hardy in North Dakota unless well mulched, which really means that the plant only escapes freezing because of its heavy cover. The same Mr. Skinner mentioned previously has a goodly number of hybrid lilies ot his own production which, while we have not tested them in North Dakota as yet, have won awards from the Royal Horticultural Society of England for their excellence and which because of their northerly origin might be expected to prosper in North Dakota and perhaps farther south. Other ornamentals worthy of special notice but which space forbids more than mention are Amolie Gravcreaux rose, Silver Berry, Band thorn, Dwarf nlnebark, Peonies In variety, PotentiHa lruticosa, Junlp - erus horizontals and ornamental gooseberry hybrids. In closing, I would like to demonstrate a little hobby of mine. I brought along a "buttercup" squash that has been in my basement since last September and, if you don't raise them here, you will he interested in this one. We cannot raise sweet potatoes ln North Dakota and have found this squash to be a very good substitute. It doesn't have the hard shell of most squashes, is small ln size and contains only a small pocket of seeds, leaving a thick meaty portion. Q. Does the squash bug bother that variety? MR. YEAGER: Yes, I presume it would but we do not have that bug in North Dakota, . ' Q. Does the spray used for destroying scale on trees do any haiin to bird life? •''¦¦• A. None. We do not spray with poison but, even so, birds are able to withstand a lot of poison. . ' MR.

HOPPERT: Dr. Raymond Pool ot the Botany Department of the University of Nebraska Is here to show us some slldeß and to lecture on "Views of Mother Nature's Flower Gardens". Our meet - ings are running a little late and, since Dr. Pool has a class at five o'clock, I am not going to take up any more time with an introduction. Dr. Pool. DR. POOL: I have fleeted a number of slides which have been made from photograph|Ao Illustrate some of the most striking wild flowers of Nebraska ap'd the United States. One of the greatest necessities of our wild flowers is the necessity of ah abundance of water. Here are some Lincoln trees which show just what Douglas firs do in the matter of gathering a supply of water through the winter. This scene is in the Pine Ridge country In the northwest corner of Nebraska. You will notice the pines follow the ravines which carry water down from the ridges. If we have plenty of water for our trees both In winter and summer, they will look like this one in our own back yard. I am going to show you now mostly illustrations of plants which are more commonly thought of as wild flowers. Here is a bed ot "Chiming Bells", a close relative of the "Forget-me-not". It grows ln high altitudes In the Rock Mountains and needs a well soaked soil. The cones in this fir tree illustrate the fact that some of the beauty of the tree is at the top. The "Queen's Crown" is shown here and it grows with Us feet literally in the water. The roots follow down through the rocks and find their way into the open water. This "Gillardia" does not demand so much water. This wild flower is common in western Nebraska and farther west. There is nothing much more beautiful than an ordinary thistle such as shown here. This Nebraska wild flower is worthy of attention and is easily cultivated. Many of these wild flowers are truly'ornamental for our gardens. This "Snow on the Mountain" is just what Its name implies. At a distance, a patch of these white flowers looks very much like a small bank of snow. This plant, however, gets to be a pest if farmers allow pastures to become overgrazed. We find some of the finest wild flowers in the world on the prairies </seg>
         <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY of Nebraska. This picture shows wild flowers on native prairie near Lincoln, Nebraska. This "Horse Mint" and "Yarrow" grows near woodlands. This "Sand Lily" will be familiar to those of you from western Nebraska. It seems to grow right in the sand. Covers the ground closely and appears like snow at a distance. These violets are of the pansy family and some of them are as fine as any cultivated pansy. This wild pansy or violet, common to eastern Nebraska, is a plant that would be fine in anyone's cultivated garden. This is a dog-toothed violet, which really is a lily. Those of you who have tried to transplant them know that they grow from bulbs. The "Partridge Pea" is the brilliant orange plant which you have seen along roadsides. The "Bee" plant Is another of the beautiful wild flowers. It makes itself conspicuous often where we want to grow something else. We will go to Yellowstone Park for this picture. It really is an illustration of wild plants. An overflow from a hot spring basin forms a fan-shaped structure with brilliant coloring which is composed of microscopic plants developing in the hot water. This shows the Arizona and New Mexico giant cactus. There are 1,200 varieties in the United States. This is the famous cactus forest a few miles out of Tucson. Now a close-up of the cactus bloom. This photograph was taken/however, in the greenhouse here at the University. A branch of cactus was sent up here and the blossom developed.

Miner's Candlesticks are a member of the Forget-me-not family al - though the flower is white This one Is what is known as Indian Paint Brush. It is a close relative of the cultivated Snapdragon. Here is one called Wild Buckwheat or Sulphur Ball. This one Is the New England Cowslip or sometimes called Shooting Star. This is the familiar Brown-eyed Susan, native to Nebraska, but found in many other places. In northwest Nebraska in the very early spring, you will find the anemone, sometimes called the wild evening primrose. In the Rocky and Cascade mountains, we find among the rocks a myriad of wild flowers. One of them is shown here, the true primrose. Above the timber line is another place where nature spreads out a different type of garden. It looks rather barren but, among the rocks, you will find the wild carnation and many other hardy flowers. Other high meadows contain this Alpine Forget-me-not. In Oregon and Washington the wild garden plants consist maiuly of gigantic trees. Another view of giant trees (Douglas Firs) near Ranier National Park. In this locality, the Rhododendron is found in abundance. This flower is protected from plant collectors by a heavy fine. About the middle of July, the profusion of Blue Gentians and various other flowers are worth traveling tar to see. Even among the glaciers are wild gardens, as shown here. Paradise Valley is as near Paradise as you will find when the heather and anemone are in bloom. Our last slide shows Avalanche lilies growing in soggy bogs and looking like a bank of snow. </seg>
         <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY WEDNESDAY MORNING January 0, 1937 | Plant Industry Building j MR. FRANK SIM: The meeting will now come to order. We are a little late but, with the weather as It Is, I am not surprised. The first thing on the program this morning is a talk on "The Use of Lights injthe Control of Codling Moth" by Don Whelan of the University ot Nebraska. Mr. Whelan. j USE OF LIGHTS IN THE CONTROL OF THE CODLING MOTH By DON B. WHELAN University of Nebraska Many experiments have; been conducted on the use of light traps-, to laid in the control of codling moths in orchards but, so far, they have not shown enough promise to be generally recommended. The use of lights for this purpose is still in the experimental stage. In this paper It is the purpose to review what has been accomplished and to show its possibilities, if any. Herms and Ellsworth (1) write that "Light exerts a powerful influence over probably all insect life. We have hardly begun to realize the power of its influence." Activity of the Moths Before discussing the use of light traps In orchards it might be well to first review what Is known about the activity of moths as Individuals and their reactions to outside stimuli, According to many Investigators moths are most active just before and just after sunset. Herms (2), writing from California, says: "The records show that the flight of the moths may extend over a period of approximately 2 hours when weather conditions are favorable, and that the maximum number in flight is usually to be found from about 20 minutes before sunset to about 20 minutes after. The deposition of eggs took place mainly during this sunset period at temperature ranging from 60° to 69°F, and when there is almost no movement of the air." Borden (3), also from California, states: "The flight of the moths is un - doubtedly greatly governed by several ecological factors including light intensity, humidity, temperature and air movement. The time when the first moth has been repeatedly observed to appear is previous to sunset and when the sunlight is still on the upper third of the tree with the lower two-thirds in shadow. The flights at this time are very short and close to the tree. Then as the light intensity decreases the flights widen and are of longer duration. Usually, however, the moth does not sustain its flight for any great distance for it has repeatedly </seg>
         <seg id="p516">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE been observed to travel along the upper third of the tree for a distance of from two to three trees in a row (a distance of from fifty to seventy - five feet) but rarely more than that." Its flight "may be described as a quick zigzag movement at various angles and it may rise or drop rather suddenly." Are these moths strongly attracted to lights? Studies on the physiology of the eyes of codling moths, by Collins and Machado (4). show some very interesting facts on this subject. They found that the degree of attraction to lights depended upon the pigment in the compound eyes. They say of the three kinds of motile pigment present in this eye, the irls-plgment appears to be the most sensitive to light. When the eye, is illuminated by a sufficiently strong or continuous light the iris-pigment recedes to an extreme proximal position where it so effectively masks the retina that not enough light can penetrate to evoke the positive phototropic response." Orchard Traps In experimental orchards there are two kinds of traps, the light traps and bait traps. Then again there are two general kinds of light traps, the electrocution trap which is a light surrounded by closely set charged wires. It attracts the insects to the light In the trap where they come In contact with the charged wires and are killed. The dead Insects are caught in a pan or iv water placed below the trap. The other kind of light trap is designed to attract the insects and they are killed by some kind of poison after they come to the light. Probably the simplest kind of trap is one consisting of a lantern hung over a tub of water. This is more efficient in catching May bettles and cutworm moths than it is for the codling moth. Yothers (5) found that the stronger lights, such as 100 watt lamps were more attractive than those of 10 watt intensity. He also tried the attraction of various colored lights and found that purple ultra, violet and blue lights, in the order named, were preferable to orange, yellow or red lights. Herms and Ellsworth found that blue light was better than either white or red lights, the latter being the poorest. Bait and Light Traps Compared Are bait traps better than light traps to catch codling moths? Very few experiments have been tried comparing these two attrahents in the same orchard under similar conditions. Some of the advantages of light traps over bait traps are that the source of attraction is uniform over a longer period of time and can be set in operation very easily, when once installed. Bait traps vary from day to day in their degree of attraction due to the varying effects of heat, wind and rain. As Shelford (6) puts it: "Traps of this nature (bait traps) are likely to be selective, cat-.hlng only certain forms." Again "baits are not </seg>
         <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY likely to be uniformly effective under all weather conditions. Wind ¦causes odor to spread in only one direction, moisture weakens the bait unless It is covered and lack of moisture dried the bait, thus re - ducing its effectiveness." Light traps can attract for a longer distance than bait traps but whether they can attract codling moths further, has not been proven. : Some of the advantages of bait traps over light traps are that they can be placed in almost any part of a tree in any part of the orchard at little expense while the light traps are usually dependent upon electric current which is often expensive to install. Even after installation thej cost of the electric current is more than the bait solutions. Of course in many orchards the lights are only run for a couple of hours, just before and just after sunset. Bait traps are usually available for twenty-four hours a day and may be of service during dark, cloudy days. On the other hand light traps are only good while the lights are on. At Lincoln we have run both a light trap and bait traps in the same orchard. There was only one light trap situated at some Week ¦ Bait Traps Light Traps of | 1933 1934 1935 1933 1934 1935 May 8 0 11 0 0 13 0 15 5 20 78 0 9 7 22 71 16 151 3 0 11 29 101 ' 36 92 5 19 2 June 5 .134 20 21 11 9 5 | 12 38 14 I 69 2 5 3 19 . 7 '&#132;-' 73 17 1 15 3 26 20 69 . 43 '.''• 17 12 July 3 26 16 94 1 11 12 ! 10 18 16 :43 4 .18 84 | 17 -41 14 17 6 4 33 ! 24 32 . .12 6 1 10 11, , j 31 2 ¦ 51 12 3 11 9 Aug. 7 19 21 5 11 1 3 ! 14 50 36 1 14 3 3 j 21 61 27 "'_."¦ 22 1 4 : 28 ¦'.•'¦¦ 97 11 3 3' 1 0 Sept. ¦._ . 16 16 1 2- .. 0 0 7 11 2 42 l 1 3 0 ';'¦' 18. 2 0 3 2: 0 1 i 25 . 0 0 0 01 0 0 742 483 623 92 150 203 * Light not In operation </seg>

The following table shows the total catch of moths for each week dur - ing the summer for both the light and bait traps: Benefits of Bait Palls or Light Traps Bait traps and light traps serve a useful purpose. Either, or both, are useful in measuring codling moth abundance from year to year or j In foretelling peaks of abundance during the year. This latter helps ' ¦. j In getting spray applications on at the proper time. Every grower j knows the value of properly timed sprays and the cost to him of a ' ' "" i few days delay in getting this spray on the trees. We cannot go by j the calendar for no two years are just alike. During some seasons we have well marked peaks of codling moth emergence while during • 7 other years this emergence is long drawn out. Traps like these help the grower understand the nature of moth activity in his orchard. It is better to count the moths caught in a trap than the worms boring into an apple. Light traps tend to keep the moths from laying their eggs and in some cases may take the place of some of the cover sprays. Parrott and Collins (7) say: "In general, the sprayed trees which were lighted . :i supported a population that was conspicuously smaller than the popula - tion of trees which received the same spray treatment but which were j not lighted." In support of this they offer a summary of their experi - ments as follows: Number per 100 apples Caterpillars Clean apples j 1933 1934 1933 1934 Without light traps No lead sprays (check) 38.30 3.80 1 cover spray 27.59 20.51 2 cover sprays 31.39 6.42 16.00 49.91 3 cover sprays 3.14 6.49 47.57 52.70 4 cover sprays 4.41 4.05 47.99 61.61 With light traps Light traps only 11.49 5.24 32.80 59.27 7, Calyx spray 3.01 .' 75.88 7] 1 cover spray 10.37 34.88 ¦ 2 cover sprays 6.25 1.06 41.33 83.41 I 3 cover sprays 4.50 2.37 60.58 77.99 i 4 cover sprays 0.39 0.53 90.30 93.03 ') Conclusions i Both light traps and bait traps play a very important part in orchard ' :j </seg>

Light traps hot only serve to indicate the presence of moths but, if properly placed, may aid in keeping down the percentage of wormy fruit. The cost of properly lighting an orchard is still too high but with cheaper electricity promised for rural districts and by running the lights for a few hours when the moths are active this expense will be greatly reduced.

A California observer made ob - servations in the field and found they would travel 50 or 75 feet before they would alight. Very few field observations have been made on the'activities of the codling moth. Around packing sheds, they have been seen to fly out to the third row of trees. Q. Would the amount of the crop aflect the distance ot flight? For instance, If we had a crop failure, would they travel to where there was a crop? A. I believe you would get only a very small migration within a limited zone^ Q. How far should these growers haul their culls in order to be safe? -.•.;¦¦¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p520">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A. That is hard to say. It might not make any difference because - the codling moth gets into other things beside apples. For instance, walnuts, hawthornes, etc. Q. What Is the duration of the egg laying season? A. That depends on the temperature and upon the emergence of" moths. In a season when cool spells come regularly until July 1, Moths might emerge from May Ist to July Ist. In such a year the early moths, of the 2nd brood as you call It would start laying eggs before all of the socalled first brood moths have finished their activities. In another year we might find that a sudden warm spell early In May might cause a decided peak in emergence. Then the egg laying activities might be confined to 2 or 3 weeks for the first brood. Then there would be no eggs laid until the larvae of the first brood changed to moths. The - individual moths lay eggs only a week or two at the most and then die. MR. SIM: I wish to thank Mr. Whelan for his interesting talk on the codling moth and his answers to our many questions. The next speaker is W. W. Yocum, also of the University of Ne - braska, and he will talk on "Recent Spray Developments in Codling Moth Control, Dynamite Spray, Etc." MR. YOCUM: The subject assigned to me sounds rather danger - ous as though it had some explosives in it and you may think we aro - using some drastic measures In our program but perhaps you will not find that true. RECENT SPRAY DEVELOPMENTS IN CODLING MOTH CONTROL, DYNAMITE SPRAYS, ETC. The subject given for this discussion would seem to Indicate that some drastic changes are being made in our B pray program or that dangerously explosive materials are being suggested for control of codling moth. The fact is that pest control is not so extremely difficult in Nebraska that we will have to resort to radical and dangerous methods. In certain Irrigated sections of the west, however, codling moth control Is bo difficult that very unusual and severe measures must be resorted to. The thing I wish to do briefly, is to review some of the more im - portant recent spray investigations. Some of it will be more or less - applicable to some situations in Nebraska and much of it will not, at least not until it has been tried more thoroly and widely. You know that no orchard spraying investigations have been con - ducted at this station during the last two years, so please do not give </seg>
         <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY jib credit for any of the work which I am reporting. There is, how - over, an enormous amount of work being conducted on codling moth throughout the apple belt. I have here a 67 page report of the last codling moth conference held-at Ames, lowa last March. There were 87 men in attendance from 20 states. Seven distinct methods of con - trol were: discussed and six distinct types of spray materials were re - ported on. The first control measure which I shall discuss with you is the one mentioned specifically in the title, —dynamite sprays. The term is used to designate spray combinations where unusually high quantities of arsenic adhere to the fruit. " They were at first believed to be dangerous to the fruit and difficult to clean. These were developed in the Wenatchee Valley, Washington, using either lead arsenate or calcium arsenate in combination with mineral oil, emulsified with oleic acid, with or without triethanolamine.; This last substance Is said to combine the properties of glycerine and ammonia in the same compound. The special value of these emulsifying agents is that they make it possible to build up a very heavy deposit of arsenic on the fruit. Be - cause, of the danger of being unable to remove such a heavy residue by washing, the dynamite sprays are used only for first brood worms. It has I been (found that where five applications of the lead arsenate— mineral oil—triethanolamine oleate combination were made for the ; first brood that very good control was obtained even if no more sprays were applied. In a certain Winesap block sprayed with the usual lead arsenate and fish oil or mineral oil combinations in 1934 there was 50 % damage to the fruit. In 1935 there was only 1.8% damage following 5 applications of the dynamite spray. But it is still regarded as a dangerous spray, for use only in extreme cases. There list a definite trend all over the country toward very thorough and] frequent spraying for the first brood ot worms. By getting more nearly perfect control ot the first brood worms, little or no spraying Is apt to be needed for later sprays. Some of our Nebraska fruit growers havC been thinking and acting in this direction for some years. Several reliable methods of timing codling moth have been de - veloped but none have been generally adopted by orchardists because of their complexity. ¦ This hewer practice of concentrating on the first] brood worms offers a more simplified method of control. It has proyed to be quite effective in the small extent tested and if it should continue so, it should be readily accepted by growers. Work carried on in Indiana and reported by G. E. Marshall, for two seasons concerns the control ot the first brood worms by using a lead arsenate, oil and soap combination. After the calyx application 4 or 5 applications were made at intervals of 7 to 10 days, especial care </seg>
         <seg id="p522">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE being taken to do a thorough job of spraying the trees both inside and out and in the tops. In Indiana over 99% of the moths from over-wintering larvae emerged by June 20. So if spraying is discontinued after that date there will be a good cover of material which would be effective for some time. Increase in the surface area of the fruit is not so rapid after mid-June, and by harvest much of the residue has weathered off. One orchard with a record of 125 worms per 100 apples in 1933 —was reduced to 1.6 worms per 100 apples in 1934, by this spray program. Another 8 acre orchard with 65 to 95 worms and 150 stings per 100 apples in 1934 —was reduced by this treatment to 1.3 worms and 4 stings per 100 apples in 1935. Other things pointed out in this study are, (1) that moth traps do not always indicate the earliest moth flight; (2) and more than one cover is necessary to insure complete coverage of fruit and foliage to prevent entrance of first brood larvae, which are potentially many times more dangerous than later worms. If entrance of first brood worms could be held to a minimum there would be little trouble later. In this test it was found that the trees will tolerate the necessary spray materials when applied more frequently and over a shorter period early in the season with no more injury than when the same number of applications are made over a longer period. Such a program fits in admirably with the control of other insects, as well as diseases. For scab this program is a decided improvement. Calcium arsenate has been widely tested for some years and does not seem to offer any advantages to us. Tests have shown that where an equal deposit of calcium arsenate is maintained control has com - pared favorably with lead arsenate. However, it is difficult to main - tain a heavy coating of calcium arsenate without the use of oil. There is greater danger of burning from calcium arsenate than from lead arsenate. Burning can be prevented by the addition of a small amount of zinc sulfate and lime. When used in this combination calcium arsenate costs about as much as lead arsenate. The Sherwin-Williams Company has an interesting new develop - ment In dry lime sulfur, although we will reserve our judgment of it until it has been widely tested. They claim that their dry lime sulfur may be used as a wetting agent for sulfur. One part of their dry lime sulfur will make wettable as much as 4 parts of 325 mesh sulfur. This Is claimed to make a saving in the spray bill of % as compared to the cost of a standard wettable sulfur. Another Interesting development In the control of orchard diseases Is being worked out by Professor Keitt, a Pathologist of Wisconsin. In the past 50 years practically all fungicides have been developed </seg>
         <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY as protectants. Dr. Keitt is now developing control measures based on! the principle of eradication and designed to reduce the disease organisms to such a low level of survival that they can be easily con - trolled by simple means. Eradicant sprays are relatively new, although lie points out that the control of peach leaf curl by a dormant spray of lime sulfur Is In fact an example of an eradicant spray which has been In use for many years. f - ¦ . . j Keitt has worked much on eradicant sprays for apple scab control. The sprays are applied after harvest and shortly before leaf-fall. A mejre -drastic spray can then be applied safely. Mixtures of arsenites and copper sulfate and lime are being tested.; Numerous small scale experiments have shown many formulae to be highly effective in pre - venting or sharply limiting asCospore development on the dead leaves th 6 following spring. There is some danger of injury to the host plant unless these materials are applied with due care. For this reason Dr. Keitt is not yet ready to give much publicity to these control measures. Such treatments are not yet developed and tested sufficiently to deserve a place on the spray program of the. ordinary grower. MR. HOPPERT: It looks to me like there would be a possibility tor the control of blotch with this eradicant spray. It shows more promise there than with scab, it seems to me. MR. YOCUM: It occurs to me that those cankers might be too ! -deep seated for the spray to penetrate. j MR. SIM: In regard to the heavy spray, why do they not recom - mend any later sprays? j MR. YOCUM: They do not because there 4 or 5 early sprays applied to build up a very heavy residue during first brood period so that later ones are not necessary and, too, they are afraid they cannot clean the fruit should they continue spraying. I MR. HOPPERT: It seems to me that all these new sprays must bejtaken with a grain of salt; so many things enter in. For instance, their weather conditions are not like ours. In the west, they have very little fungus trouble. We Occasionally have to spray for black rot and on some varieties for blotch. I expect we will have more trouble than ever with frogsye next year. It is hard to control on Jonathan. Q. is it possible to combine any of these sprays and save the work of spraying |several times? A. No, sprays cannot be combined. MR. KIMMEL: A lot of the wounds on my trees have a white .fungus growing in them. Is that black rot? </seg>
         <seg id="p524">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. HOPPERT: No, that Is a dead wood organism, a saprophyte. It does not attack fruit or foliage but only dead wood or bark. MR. KIMMEL: On the small ones, one can easily rub them off. Should the bark be scraped as well? A. I believe the bark should be scraped off and wound painted. MR. WIGGANS: I happened to be in the Wenatchee valley this past summer and talked with some of the men who used this dynamite spray. They are not thoroughly convinced about its value yet. They are experimenting with it, of course, and I saw their experimental outfits. They said that unless conditions were just right, the spray mixed right, etc. that results are not satisfactory. They often fail to get the curdling effect which seems to be necessary to make the spray stick. They don't feel that it is perfect yet and will contine to work on it. MR. HOPPERT: We should emphasize this fact again, I think, in regard to the codling moth that if the first brood is controlled, we will have less trouble with the later ones. Most of us here at the Station feel that it is a hopeless task to control the moth if you have not done so by July Ist. By that time, the population is so numerous that you would have no chance of getting more than 50% control. Q. What do you say about banding? MR. YOCUM: That is one of the many things that we must do in our control program where the infestation is very heavy. Spraying alone is not sufficient for good control in such cases. Q. What is meant by double banding? A. That is banding the main limbs as well as the trunk. Q. Do you think that we have any injury from bands put on trees? A. No, I think not. The bands leave a mark on the trunk but I believe there has been no damage. MR. SIM: This discussion on spraying has been of interest to us all. Our next speaker this morning is Dr. A. F. Yeager of Fargo, North Dakota. He will speak on "Fruit Growing in the Northern' Great Plains". Mr. Yeager. </seg>

YEAGER • j North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station . j What has been said with respect to the hardiness of ornamentals applies to fruits. The fact that a certain variety has proved to be hardy in North Dakota even though our climate is supposed to be much more severe than yours does not necessarily mean that it will be successful under your conditions. The experience of your own Experiment Station will be much more reliable than opinions any one may give who comes from a distance. It is also necessary to remember that hardiness of trees and the hardiness of fruit buds are a | very different matter. We frequently find varieties in which the tree does not winter kill but in which the blossom buds rarely survive. On the other hand there are varieties in which the tree may be badly damaged during severe winters but on which the fruit buds will be found in good condition. j I do not propose to cover all varieties of fruits but merely to men - tion a few of those which are comparatively new or which are not widely grown that have shown themselves to be of value under North Dakota conditions.

Macey, a production ot the lowa Experiment Station, has more than usual hardiness and carries vlth it considerable quality. Anoka, one of Dr. Hanson's varieties, while not extremely hardy and not of the best quality, has nevertheless made a place for itself in North Dakota because of its early and heavy production Red Duchess, a bud sport of the old Duchess, should replace that variety for, commercial purposes. Blush Calvllle is one of the older varieties of (Russian origin which stood our test winter of 1935-1936 better than any other large apple. It would seem to deserve more attention at the hands of nurserymen in northern United States. The fruit is only medium in quality but is large, yellow and attractive All these varieties are little affected by fire blight which is very serious in our short intense growing seasons. Among the crab apples Dolgo, while small in size, nevertheless ranks. </seg>

This variety incidentally is being planted quite widely over the United States as an ornamental on the lawn. Florence is perhaps our other most satisfactory crab apple. It is an early, heavy producer of medium sized red cheeked fruits. The old well known Whitney stood our extreme weather of last year better than most. A new variety resulting from our breeding work at the North Dakota Experiment Station comes from a cross between Dolgo crab apple and the Delicious apple. It was one of the few varieties that bore a good crop this season. With the assistance of the Minnesota nurserymen It was recently christened Red River. Among the plums a newcomer of promise is Feibing. This is a very large fruited variety of good quality, a product of Charles Haral - son. Excelsior, Minnesota. Other hybrid plums Of quite recent Introduc - tion that are among the best with us are Red Wing from the Minne - sota Experiment Station and Toka from tbe South Dakota Experiment Station. Sand Cherry hybrids, which are mainly crosses between plums and our native Pruni Besseyi are of considerable importance in northern fruit plantings. Among the older varieties Opata and Compass still rank at the top. A newcomer which seems to have considerable merit Is Oka, a round, purple variety which is quite good to eat out of hand. Two Canadian introductions which are worthy of more testing ar,e Mansati and Mordena. These two varieties are probably hardier than Oka hut our cooking tests this year indicates that they may not have quite so good quality. Cooper, a Compass cherry seedling from the North Dakota Experiment Station is now being tested quite widely. Fruits of this variety are light red in color, not good to eat raw but produce a cooked product move nearly resembling the white sweet cherry than any other fruit we have in our state. Among the new strawberry varieties which seem to have consider - able merit are Dorsett and Fairfax, June bearing sorts, Wayzata and Dry-Weather are promising ever-bearing varieties. The first of these is making great headway in Minnesota because of its attractive fruits. The latter in our tests has shown unusual ability to withstand drouth. This variety is a product of the North Dakota Experiment Station. While too soft for commercial production it has unusual quality for home use. There is a very successful planting of this within 25 miles of Lincoln. Among the gooseberry varieties that have been able to withstand the combination of cold in winter and drouth and heat in summer, the ones which have made the best showing have been those varieties of our own production Plxwell, Perry and Abundance, all of which have as a one parent, the native wild gooseberry.

Among named sorts only such ones as Beta, Alpha and Hungarian produce crops without cover and that in only part of the years. It seems we will be obliged to produce new varieties carrying the hardiness of our northern wild grapes before we can count on this crop. Breeding work under way indicates that this is quite possible. Named varieties of pears such as you are familiar with will not withstand North Dakota winters. . The hardiest ones we have are Patten and Mendel. These are not very satisfactory. Pyrus ussuriensls, however, seems perfectly winter hardy and does not blight. The fact that some hybrids with this species have fair quality indicates that we may expect good pear varieties eventually. i None of the standard varieties of black raspberries come thru our winters unhurt. Red varieties such as Latham and Chief survive most winters and if the following summer is not too hot and dry will make good crops. In hot, dry seasons Red Spider is too much for them Except for this pest the red raspberry may be considered to be fairly satisfactory. Breeding work is now. being done in an effort to produce varieties with the winter hardiness of the red and the ability to with - stand heat and drouth possessed by the black. There are no satisfactory named varieties of apricots but work is being done at South Dakota, Manitoba and North Dakota which points with reasonable assurance to the. probability of our having varieties of this fruit fully as hardy as hybrid plums. Cherries too, are beyond their normal range but breeding work being done with the Russian type of the Morello cherry which shows much promise. Native traits which can be produced with a reasonable degree of certainty Include' such fruits as/ black currants, of the two species Ribes aureum and Ribes Americanum, The first species Is the one to . which the old Crandall currant of the trade belonged.

The native sand cherry can be grown practically any Where that grain can be produced and produces a goodly quantity of fruit of fair quality If given reasonable care. Dr. Hanson of South Dakota has done much in raising the qaulity of the sand cherry as grown from seed. While it might be questionable whether one could afford to pay he price of a grafted tree for a sand cherry plant there Is no ques - tion of its value if it can be propagated from seed. The American Highbush cranberry has been mentioned in our dis - cussion in connection with ornamentals. I believe there is no ques - tion that in proper locations it might well be planted and grown as a commercial fruit plant. The jelly produced is considered by many to be the finest produced from any fruit. The June berry grows wild over nearly all of North Dakota It is galled Blue berry in some sections. Because of its early blooming habit t fails to produce a crop of fruit some years and in the years when it does fruit one needs a good sized planting if he is to harvest any because the birds are very fond of it. Buffalo berry is another useful native fruit. It grows in very exposed locations and produces a crop useful for jelly and preserves One of the objections to the cultivation of this plant comes from the fact that it is diocious, that Is, the pistillate and stamen flowers are borne on different plants. It is, therefore, necessary to have a few male plants in order to get a fruit crop. This plant which reaches 15 feet in height is worthy of consideration as a windbreak shrub. While there are satisfactory cultivated varieties of plums tests have shown that our best pollenizers and surest croppers are the wild Plums. North Dakota is on the northern limit of Prunus Americana but on the southern border of another equally desirable species Prunus nigra. We recommend to our people the planting of a row of these as part of the orchard shelter. Q. In western Nebraska, we had those 'Buffalo Berries' you men - tioned but we did not get a crop every year.

At this time, we will hear the report of our secretary, Mr. E. H. Hoppert. SECRETARY'S REPORT FOB 1036 E. H. HOPPERT Winter Meetings. The annual; meetings ot the Society were held In cooperation with Organized Agriculture at the Agricultural College at Lincoln, January 7 to 9. President Richard Kimmel presided at all jot the meetings. The first day of the sessions was devoted to ornamental phases ot Horticulture and the second and one-halt ot the third day were devoted to fruit phases. The details of the entire program are to be found in the Sixty-seventh Annual Report which has been distributed to members and to most of the libraries in the state and to some of the larger libraries in the United States. I Orchard Sanitation Project. An attempt was made to have a W.P. A. project for orchards similar to the F.E.R.A. project of 1935. A survey was made in several Missouri river counties by Dearie Baker rep - resenting the society and the findings of this survey presented to a meeting of governors and project'supervisors at Dcs Moines. It was felt that the drought had killed and weakened a great many trees that would have to be removed. It. was proposed to have the W.P.A. workers remove these trees and the wood turned over to the relief organization. Nothing came of the proposal, however. Apple Grading Bill. A committee was appointed by Chairman Kimmel consisting of Chet Marshall,; Gus Beavers, Val Keyser, J. L. Stivers, Grove Porter, and W.B. Banning, together with the officers of the Society which was to. investigate various other state grading laws and work out a bill suitable to Nebraska conditions. Then the proposals were to be discussed at meetings of growers in the prin - cipal apple growing sections at which time the Secretary and other committee members from the local district were to lead the discussion. Criticisms and additions were to be noted and these brought before the committee as a whole and discussed. If the committee deemed changes desirable these were to be incorporated and the bill gotten ready for the unicameral. Further progress on this matter will be taken up In the next report since only the preliminary steps were taken in 1936. </seg>
         <seg id="p530">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Tours. A blossom tour in the spring was arranged through the Cass and Otoe county orchard section. The local growers cooperated in marking a route for visiting cars. Newspapers in Omaha and Lincoln carried stories and Invitations to visit the orchards in bloom. Several thousand cars made the drive. The regular summer tour for the fruit growers, even though authorized and planned by the Board of Directors never came to pass The conditions in the latter part of July were so unfavorable for the developing crop and the heat and dust so aggravating that the Ne - braska City growers whose orchards were to be visited urged the postponement of the tour. The weed growth had dried and was dry as tinder. A match or burning tobacco tossed into these weeds might start a serious fire and the orchard owners were reluctant to take such chances. Exhibits. By State Fair time showers had started and fruit sized and colored sufficiently to make a creditable show as the accompany - ing pictures indicate. The election being near at hand the logical subject to choose for a feature was of a political nature. The display of fruits and flowers were a credit to the state considering the hot dry season which preceded the fair. Many visitors marvelled that fruits could be grown under the extreme drought and heat of the season. The Secretary was authorized to attend the meetings of the Great Plain. Horticulturists in Saskatchewan, Canada. The group consisting of Horticulturists from Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, lowa, and the prairie provinces of Canada, met at the Prairie Nurseries at Saskatoon. Here the visitors saw a very modern nursery devoted largely to ornamentals. The surprising fea - ture of this visit was the excellent development secured on blue spruce fir and pine. This area was suffering from drought almost as badly as North Dakota. In fact the small grain crops were no better in the southern part of Canada than in the northern part of North Dakota and Minnesota. Fifty miles north of the border, however, the grains began Improving. From Regina to Winnepeg the crops looked splendid. At Indian Head we visited the Experiment Station where Forestry and Horticultural investigations are stressed. Fruits came in for con - siderable attention as well as ornamentals. The principal tree fruits that are hardy enough to withstand 40 to 60 degrees below zero are Crab apples and American plums. Pears and cherries are much too 1n.,.!'

The early orchards planted in the Prairie Provinces were all started as they are else - where but experience showed that the trunk was a very vulnerable spot so far as winter Injury is concerned. Of the trees with trunks, planted 25 to 30 years ago at the Indian Head Station, only one Prince crab remains.

The strawberries as a whole looked very well but most varieties suffered from chlorosis (a lack ot available Iron). A locally developed variety called Gem was outstanding in its resistance to chlorosis. The most outstanding horiticultural development at Indian Head seemed to me to be the flower gardens and borders. The ac - companying picture shows one view ot the wide mixed annual and perennial border at the Experiment Station. It is seldom that one sees a border in Nebraska with such general bloom. Delphinium, Golden Glow, dahlia, snapdragons, primroses, lantana, lobelia, sweet alyssum,—that was the; arrangement of one part of the border and every plant blooming profusely from early August to the middle of September, they told us. '-. Some of the new shrubs that are showing promise are Cotoneaster, acutifolla, Cotoneaster luclda, —the former a better sort than the later. Dyers greenwood with its yellow waxy flowers is a promising shrub for either hedges or as a specimen plant for the border. Caragana pygmia is a dwarf caragana that can be used as a formal hedge or as a small shrub. It too has yellow flowers. The Betty Bland rose, a hybrid developmed at the Morden Station, shows up better than some of the other hybrid rugosas like Grootendorst. The work done in these northern prairie provinces indicates that there are many horticultural plants being developed that will find a place in western Nebraska. : MR.

We have four speakers and are starting a little late but they insist that the President must give a little talk. It will be sort of a "post-mortem". It seems to me that the president ought to make his address, when he takes office rather than when he leaves. He (may then map out what should be done during his year of office. I wasn't up here when elected and didn't know it for some time after - wards so I must make my talk how. I was surprised, to say the least, to be elected president. I was advanced from one office to another. It seems that is the way they do whether you are capable or not. I think as my talk this afternoon my subject will be "Problems ot the Commercial Orchardist" from the standpoint ot the grower. I put out my first commercial orchard about twelve years ago and, at that time, made some studies of the thing and and got what help I could from the Extension Service. . The first and the hardest problem that we have to contend with is the lack of moisture and the intense heat of the last three summers. As a result of it, two insect pests have developed that have damaged the trees quite severely, the red spider and the flat head apple tree borer. '. The red spider developed suddenly in the summer of 1935. We were at a loss to know what to do about it. A number of different sprays were tried, some of them quite expensive, all of them with very poor results after the spiders reached the damaging stage. The Experi - ment Station finally discovered the best control can be obtained by the use of lime sulphur in the early summer. Next comes the flat head apple borer, I think, by far the worst insect that we have to combat. In my mind, it is enemy No. 1. Here - tofore, the codling moth has been considered the worst, but we have it (under fairly good control by the use of good sanitary measures and timely spraying. The apple' tree borer attacks trees of all ages from May to September. In my orchard, it has destroyed all of my re-sets for several years. It has also damaged and destroyed a number of older trees. We have found a number of ways to check it some hut nothing very effective. I think It is No. 1 job. for the station to work on. Next, we have winter injury .which was never very severe until the winter of 1936, when it killed arid severely injured a great many trees. I think some of the badly injured ones may be savedfor a lew years by bridge grafting. The Station has advised a white-wash that they think will check it by deflecting the rays of the sun. Those injured </seg>
         <seg id="p536">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE spots are fertile places for the borers to get in their work. A thorough cleaning off of the dead bark and an application of PDX and cotton seed oil will help stop them. What are the chances for a profit in the business ln the future? I think they are very good for the person who will give his orchard good care. According to the United States reports, there has been a large loss of fruit trees the last few years. There has been but a small amount of new planting. The older trees have been injured from the east to the central west by severe winters and drouth. In Washington there have been very few trees set in the last few years. According to the information that I get through the Kansas City Packer there has been ten to fifteen thousand acres taken out by the De - partment there. They have a law in that state that requires an orchard to be kept ln good condition or destroyed. Ninety per cent of the trees there are from 25 to 30 years of age. The raising of apples In that country is more expensive than in the rain belt. Without irrigation, they would grow no apples in the Yakima or Wenatchee valleys. The growers in that district have become business-minded and are using measures to help steady the apple market. The exports this year are somewhat below last year, I presume because of the higher markets in the United States. Not much attention has been paid to systematic marketing by the growers in the central west. We have the entrance of the trucks into merchandising the last few years and placing on the market of fairly good fruit of a low grade, lower than used to enter the market before the truck appeared. That kind of marketing has come to stay. It is up to the grower to try and systematize that mode of marketing. The lower grades of apples that are too poor to have good value should be sold to processors but, In my opinion, the processing of apples should be bo that it will not conflict with the new crop when they come on the market. Therefore, I would advise making vinegar, sweet juices and apple butter but I believe that the canning of that cheap grade of apples would interfere with next year's market. I also think that apples should be packed in a large packing shed. The average grower hasn't enough acreage to build the proper kind of packing shed. There are only two or three outfits ln Nebraska that have enough acreage to build an ample shed. I think that distribution by trucks should be limited to a certain number of men who have business ability. The way it has been, any - body goes to an apple shed and buys a load of apples.

Results soon indicated that trees do take from the subsoil such moisture, provided there is any available, as is required to supply the needs of the tree. Apparently this withdrawal is a progressive process. Moisture loss occurs first near and just below the tree but eventually the roots extend outward far enough to occupy all the space between the trees and downward to a depth of 35 feet or more when soil conditions permit their penetra - tion. Thus a condition may finally be reached where the trees must depend upon annual rainfall for their entire needs since the subsoil reserve is entirely exhausted. This seems to be the present situation ln many mature orchards in Nebraska. Conditions have been ag - gravated by the fact that in many instances trees have been planted entirely too close together and in few or no instances has any par - ticular effort been made to conserve annual rainfall. During the past summer considerable sampling has been done in new orchard areas and also some resampling, particularly at the University Fruit Farm, at stations where determinations had been made the previous season. Sampling in a few cases has extended to depths of 40-45 feet. Also the hygroscopic coefficients have been de - termined for many of the soils under consideration. An idea as to the actual deficiency in rainfall during the past three years may be gained by examining the precipitatioii record secured at the University Fruit Farm.

In all years it must be remembered that a considerable share of the rainfall came in the form of light showers which were ot little or no benefit so far as the tree was concerned aside from the fact that they may have lowered the atmospheric temperature and thus checked somewhat the evaporation from the leaves. The data secured since last year are presented in graphic form. In Figure I will be found a graph showing the situation existing in the region of Omaha In the early part of the 1936 season. Iv the case of the Smith orchard and also the Beaver's—both now mature,—there appears to be grounds for assuming that depletion has occurred to 3 0 feet or even slightly beyond, while In the Soutter orchard (7 years) very little of the reserve has been used. In the Tomlinson orchard in spite of the fact that it Is still young, much moisture has been used by intercrops, particularly (n that portion where alfalfa was growing. In all these cases sampling stations were located in the intersection— as far from the trees as possible—and hence represent the optimum rather than the average condition. Figure II shows the situation existing in the Smith orchard both at the intersection and near the tree. Hygroscopic coefficients have been eliminated from this figure. The total space between the outside lines In each case represents the maximum available capacity of the soil. The cross hatched portion indicates the proportion of this which has been used in the various five foot zones. It is quite evident that relatively little water is now left for these trees in the upper twenty feet of soil. Another set of samples taken in the vicinity of Arlington gave very similar results. In young orchards there had been only slight depletion while in orchards 30-35 years of age nearly all available moisture to a depth of 30 feet had been used. A series ot samples secured near Nebraska City showed that soil depth there is quite a factor. In some cases a chalky, sandy or rocky layer 8-10 feet from the surface inter - posed an impenetrable layer so far as root extension was concerned while in other locations 25 or 30 feet of good soil was present. Naturally in the case of the shallow soils the proportion of available water which has already been used Is high even though the orchards are only 12-15 years old. In the deeper soils the situation in these orchards is at present still quite favorable.

This sampling was done at the University Fruit farm, Union, —in the Banning orchard at Union, in the Kimmel orchard at Nebraska City, and in the Howard and Hoppert planting near Rulo. The actual change in soil moisture content between July 31, 1935, and August 19, 1936 in a block of Delicious, 19 years old at Union, is indicated In Figures Ilia and Illb. Figure Ilia is from the station near the tree. All hygroscopic coefficients have been accounted for and hence the figures given indicate the percentage of available moisture. The single cross hatched portion represents the total deple - tion of soil moisture which had taken place previous to July 31, 1935, —-while the double hatched portion shows what was used between that date and August 1936. It will be seen that nearly all moisture with - drawn came from below the twenty foot level. Soil in the higher levels had already had removed most of the available moisture and hence the roots had to extend into new territory. Over 70% of all water avail - able for plant use has already been used by the trees. On the basis of calculated rainfall the soil moisture loss was equival - ent jto 11.56 Inches. This amount combined with the rainfall 23.39 Inches coming between the sampling dates amounts to 34.95 Inches. This total moisture used Includes, Of course, that lost by runoff, direct evaporation and usage by other plants as well as that given oft through the jtree. It is, therefore, impossible to determine just what amount is actually needed for tree growth, but in any event it is a considerable amount. Since these trees were practically barren, because of hall damage, It Is possible that this amount represents minimum rather than average or maximum needs. In Figure Illb is seen a comparable chart showing conditions at the intersection station. (22.3 feet from the tree) in the same Delicious block. Here approximately one-half of all available water has been withdrawn. The total moisture removal from the soil was 7.85 inches which combined with the rainfall makes a total usage of 31.24 inches. Combining the results from these two charts it is evident that the, 1936 season made a very severe drain on the reserve moisture in this mature orchard. This drain was so great that if it continues for another three seasons practically all available moisture to a depth of thirty' feet will be gone. After that the tree must depend upon annual rain - fall,'and, if this is deficient then the tree will die. Figure IV shows the conditions in the Jonathan block In the Kim - mel orchard hear Nebraska City. In only one case can a direct comparison be made with the data from the Fruit Farm.

IRRIGATION AND MOISTtmE CONSERVATION FOR NEBRASKA ORCHARDS IVAN D.WOOD, Extension Engineer University of Nebraska (Nebraska State Horticultural Society) The drouth of the paßt years has taken a heavy toll of trees in all parts of the state. Orchard varieties have proven no exception even in pastern counties which normally have an annual rainfall of more than 30 inches. Recent research carried on by the Department of Horticulture, University of Nebraska, has shown conclusively that much of the available subsoil moisture ha. been depleted. The result has been a heavy mortality due partly to disease and partly to drouth. </seg>
         <seg id="p548">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The lack of subsoil moisture, while primarily due to low rainfall of the past few years, is In part caused by heavy run-off from orchard lands which are invariably steep. It Is probable that the supply of available moisture In the deeper subsoil of many orchards has been gradually depleted each year since the trees reached maturity. The effect, however, has been more evident during these years of low humid - ity and hot winds. The relatively high per acre investment In mature orchards has been responsible for more than one owner investigating the possibilities of supplemental Irrigation and means of conserving rainfall.

In many old orchards, the supply of available subsoil moisture Is so low that there Is little hope of replenishing It quickly enough to save the trees even If all rainfall could be retained in terraces, contour furrows or basins. Supplemental irrigation by pumping from wells or streams seems to be the only answer. A brief description of the irrigation system contemplated at the University Fruit Farm at Union will serve to exemplify one method of .supplementing the rainfall.. As many of the growers will remember, this orchard is planted in rectangular fashion on land which is very steep, the.hills varying in slope from 8 feet to 10 feet per 100. Tho source of supply is.Weeping Water Creek located 670 feet north ot the north line of the orchard. This stream is subject to high flood stages but has flowed a fairly uniform stream even during drouth years. .¦ It is planned that a low, plank, sheet piling dam will be placed across this stream to raise the water level about two feet. This dam will be arranged sO that by removal, of several loose plank the imponded water can escape carrying with it any silt which may have collected. On the creek bank will be placed a well lined with concrete pipe 48 inches in diameter. Water will be conducted from the creek through on 18-inch corrugated culvert pipe to the well from which It will be pumped through 3,250 feet of 5-luch and 600 feet of 4-inch standard wrought iron pipe to various parts of the orchard. The highest point in the orchard is 120 feet above the water level in the creek and to this lift must be added the friction head of from 20. to 30 feet due to re - sistance of water flowing in the pipe. The total head or lift against which the pump must deliver approximately 170 gallons per minute is thus 140 to 150 feet. It Is evident that ordinary pumping equipment cannot be depended upon to.perform this task. It is planned that a seven or nine stage turbine pump will be installed in the Concrete lined well. This pump •operates much like an ordinary centrifugal pump except that instead of one rotating impeller there will be seven or nine of them. They will be submerged beneath the water surface and only about 6 inches in diameter. In a small, concrete house built over the well will be a ten horsepower 22 0-yolt, three-phase motor which will be direct connected to the impellers of the pump by shafting. Current will be supplied T&gt;y tapping a transformer into the high tension line which passes along the highway almost directly over the pump house. The five-inch wrought iron pipe line will be so arranged that the ¦water contained in It can be drained through the wrought Iron culvert pipe leading from the creek to the well to clean out any silt which may </seg>

The problem which has caused no little concern has been the Irrigat - ing of the trees after the water is pumped up to the orchard. It is evident that a stream of 170 gallons per minute can not be turned loose to flow where it will. The present plan calls for a number of 4-lnch risers which will come to the surface from the main 5-inch pipe line. Each riser will be capped when not in use. When water is desired at any riser, the cap will be removed and a 4-lnch valve carrying an elbow and a short length of 4-inch pipe will be screwed on. To this will be attached any number, of lengths of 5-inch waterproofed canvas hose necessary to reach any given point down the slope. Risers will probably be placed at intervals of 200 to 300 feet along the pipe line. .' j7. ..

It is apparent that some sort of basin will be necessary to hold -water near the tree until percolation takes place. Negotiations are now under way to secure W. P. A. aid. It a work project is secured, basins from 10 to 15 feet across will be made around each tree by throwing up a semicircular dike on the downhill side. Into these basins, water will be conducted with the hose and allowed to run from one basin to another where there is no danger of erosion. It is also planned that a number of irrigation laterals will be carried across the hillsides among the trees.

During the summer of 1937, It is imperative that all trees get some water at the earliest possible time if they are to- Burvlve. The Department of Horticulture of the University of Nebraska plans to carry on a number of research problems in connection with the use of supplemental water. On the more level portions of the orchard, whole blocks of trees will be surrounded with a dyke forming a large basin Into which water can be pumped. The amounts of water neces - sary to saturate the subsoil can be measured and, perhaps the water using capacity of the trees can be calculated. Increased yields due - to irrigation will be observed. A number of orchard men have installed irrigation systems of one kind or another. Richard Kimmel, north of Nebraska City, pumped to - his orchard last season with a small centrifugal pump driven by an old Model "T" engine. He used 3-inch pipe line some 3,500 feet long. Next season he plans a new high efficiency pump, a 6-inch pipe line and a Model "A" Ford engine rebuilt to burn tractor fuel. The drive from engine to pump will be through the "V" belts which permit short coup - ling and will operate with little power loss. Marshall Brothers of Arlington are using a well and a well is con - templated for the old orchard at the College of Agriculture. It is probable that most of the new orchards will be planted with the tree rows on the contour. In many cases the land will be terraced first and the trees planted on the terrace ridge. This system would pre - sent many advantages, the more important of which are: 1. Prevention of erosion. 2. Conservation of moisture from rainfall. 3. Ease of application of Irrigation water. 4. Ease of cultivation and servicing since steep, objectionable slopes are eliminated. A part of the university orchard at Union has been terraced prepara - tory to planting on the contour. Many of the problems of irrigation will be eliminated when water is applied to this portion. It will be necessary only to conduct the flow to the terrace channel, which will be filled capacity to provide moisture to all the trees planted on that terrace ridge.

The chances are that the time will come if this weather keeps on that if we raise apples in southeast Nebraska, they will be placed on the second bottom land or we will have to use some method of irrigation. Mr. Wiggans' charts have demonstrated this fact very well. Our next talk is "Problems in the Management of Orchard Soils" by Mr. M. D. Weldon. MR. WELDO.V: It is evident from what has been said here this afternoon that moisture is probably the most important problem that we have to face in connection with our orchards at the present time. Soil management, however, does have some other phases. Erosion and sol! fertility are two of these problems. SOME CONSIIIE HATIONS IN ORCHARD SOIL MANAGEMENT M. D. WELDON The principal soil management problems of Nebraska are those of conserving moisture, controlling erosion, and maintaining fertility. In orchards these problems become more acute by reason of the large amounts of moisture required by trees and the restrictions upon the choice of crops which otherwise might be used for controlling erosion and maintaining fertility. Every growing plant uses soil moisture, and this fact has made clean cultivation a common practice in Ne - braska orchards, so that every bit of soil moisture may be available to the trees. Clean cultivation has serious disadvantages, however, for it permits greater run-off, erosion, and evaporation than where vegeta - tive cover protects the soil surface. The loss of fertility is also most rapid under clean tillage, but in orchards, soil fertility is largely a matter of nitrogen supply, which can be maintained by the use of nitrogenous fertilizers if no legumes are grown. The loss of soil by erosion and of moisture by run-off and evaporation are more serious. According to Missouri Experiment Station Bulletin 366, the loss of soil by erosion from clean-cultivated Shelby loam soil having a slope of 3.7 per cent was 41 tons per acre annually, while that from similar land under a good rotation of crops was 2.7 tons and under bluegrass sod, 0.3 ton. The rapid loss of rich top-soil under clean cultivation is a serious matter, and we may well inquire whether it will not be - </seg>
         <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY ¦woith while to reduce tils loss by some of the methods recommended *y the Soil Conservation Service, namely terracing, contouring, strip ¦cropping, and the use of cover crops. jTerracing and contouring should certainly be considered in the planning of every new orchard. The trees can be set in the terrace ridges,.and run-off and erosion will be entirely avoided. Incidentally, the engineers tell us that tillage and hauling operations may require as much as 20 per cent less power when done on the contour instead of i p and down the hills; In established orchards it is difficult and often impractical to build teriaces and attempt to follow contours, but cover crops, particularly in the form of strips between the tree rows, deserve consideration for the I purpose of reducing erosion and especially run-off. For example, .at the Missouri Station it -was found that the water lost by run-oft from clean-cultivated Shelby loam soil is 30 per cent of the total precipita - tion^ while that from similar land under Kentucky bluegrass sod is 12 per cent. Under a good rotation of crops it is 14 per cent. If it is assumed that these figures will apply approximately to our rolling and hilly orchard lands, where the rainfall averages about 30 inches an - nually, then a clean-cultivated orchard will lose about 9 inches of moisture by run-off annually, while an orchard in which a suitable cov^r-crop is growing may lose only 4 inches, making a difference of ¦5 inches. At first glance it may seem that this difference is small and that the cover crop is likely to draw from the soil and transpire much moie water than it saves. Cover crops offer such advantages for erosion com ;rol and soil fertility, however, that it seems desirable to assemble all the information we can obtain as to their effects upon the soil moi3ture and the possibilities of controlling these effects by suitable matagement. flfany varieties of plants have been used as cover crops In orchards. The grasses generally have been found to be unsuitable because they compete too seriously with the trees for both moisture and fertility. Our common legumes, alfalfa, sweet clover, and red clover, contribute substantially to soil fertility, but they use large quantities of moisture and therefore are out of the question for use as cover crops in Ne - braska. There are two reasons for the heavy use of water by these crop|s; they are heavy producers and they use a relatively large amount •of -vater per unit of crop produced. Table 1 shows the water require - inert ratio of several common crops. This ratio is defined as the number of pounds of water used by the crop In producing a pound of dry matter. The table also shows the tons of dry matter produced by good acre yields of the crops, and the amounts of water used in produc - ing these yields, expressed both in tons per acre and in inches. </seg>

Even the small grains use too much water. Millet, while it does not contribute much to soil fertility, does offer possibilities with regard to the economy of water and protection against run-off and erosion losses. Millet however, has several serious disadvantages. It grows most rapidly and draws most heavily upon soil moisture and fertility during the early summer, just at the time when the trees need them most An Ideal cover crop should not only have a low water requirement but should have several other characteristics. It should grow relatively little in spring, should remain more or less dormant during hot dry weather, and should make most of its growth in the fall, when the trees no longer need large amounts of moisture and fertility It would be particularly desirable if it were a shallow-rooted low spread - ing perennial or self-seeding annual legume for it would then cover the ground surface all the time, holding back run-off, preventing erosion, and putting organic matter and nitrogen into the soil. It is perhaps needless to say that the ideal orchard cover crop has not yet been discovered, but there are some plants that under suitable management ought to conform fairly well to our requirements. The lespedezas are legumes that tend to be low, spreading, and shallow - rooted. They do not produce a large tonnage as do sweet clover and alfalfa. They tend to start slowly in spring and make most of their growth in late summer and early fall. The amount of growth and the amount of soil moisture used can be reduced by mowing several times dur ing the growing season. The perennial varieties of lespedeza seem to stand up well under frequent mowing, and both perennial and annual varieties will seed freely if not mowed too closely. Presumably lespedeza has a water requirement ratio approximately that of sweet clover or alfalfa, if the crop produces three-fourths ton of dry matter per acre, It may be expected to use 675 tons or 6 Inches </seg>
         <seg id="p557">: NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY of water. In the orchard, however, the cover crop should be allowed", to occupy only one-half or one-third of the ground area, consisting of strips of sod between the trees, and under these conditions should use only 2 to 3 inches of water annually. Evaporation causes serious losses of moisture from the soil, especially under clean tillage.. At the North Platte Substation, only about one-fourth of the seasonal rainfall Is stored in the soil by clean - tillage. Most of the remainder escapes by evaporation. Results at Linc - oln have been about the same. The principal factors influencing the - rate of evaporation are the soil temperature and the wind velocity.. By shading the soil and protecting it from the wind, thus lowering - the temperature and the rate of evaporation, a cover crop may save considerable amounts of water. j In conclusion, it may be repeated that a suitable cover crop, prop - erly managed, offers advantages over clean tillage as to the mainten-' ance of soil fertility, the control of erosion, and the reduction of mois - ture losses by run-off and evaporation. iQ. What about blue-grass as a cover crop in an orchard? I MR. WELDON: It requires too much water. JQ. What about'fox-tail'grass? |A. All of these grass covers require moisture. I know that in plowing small grain stubble,, you will find the plow layer is extremely dry where fox-tail has been allowed to grow unmolested. To what depth it extends, I do not know. If it was only to the depth of the plow layer, that wouldn't affect the orchard much but I don't know. ,|MR. SIM: What would you estimate the run-off in a 2" or 3"!raln would be on a. 5% slope where the ground was pretty well covered with grass and weeds? MR. WE.DON: .1 wouldn't know just how to estimate that. We have no figures that would show it either. In the heavier rains, of • course/the run-off is considerably greater than in several small rains. MR. SIM: Suppose you had a piece of ground turned with a plow and left rather rough. Would there be more or less run-off if the ground was harrowed down smooth? A. My guess; would be that there would be less run-off where the ground was left rough. MR. HOPPERT: In strip cropping then, if you did not want to - strip every row, you could cultivate one and put a strip crop in the other. This would make It easier when spraying in the spring if it happened to be wet in the early spring. i </seg>

         <seg id="p559">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY THE SOIL CONSERVATION PROGRAM IN RELATION TO ORCHARDING ! ELTON LUX ¦I 7 -' - -..-'¦ ''--"¦ | During, the past few years there have been agricultural programs - to. help stabilize agriculture and conserve our natural resources. The triple A wheat and corn-hog programs were the beginning. At present we think the soil conservation program will take the place of these early programs and accomplish some desirable things that these early programs failed to take Into account. The wheat and corn-hog, tobacco,, and cotton farmers got all the best of it in the early programs. Under our present program the vegetable and fruit growers can also receive some benefits by cooperating with the new soil conservation program. At present many of the details have not yet been worked up and approved but in general we know what Is being proposed and what has a chance of being adopted. In developing the program for the fruit growers remember that this industry is much more important in the east and far west than it is in the corn belt. Since most of the rules and regulations pertaining to field crops have come from those states where these crops are most important it is only natural that the regulations pertaining to fruits would come largely from those states where these constitute an important part of the state's agriculture. I hope therefore, that you fruit growers will bear with me while the new regulations are explained and then we can criticize and suggest improvements. First of alllet us look at the so-called docket for the fruit growers: Here It Is: "ORCHARDS means the entire acreage in tree fruits, not trees, vineyards, bush fruits, and nursery stock on the farm on January X* 1337." (It is our understanding that cropland planted to orchards in 1937 will be classified as neutral if no other crop excepting the trees is growing on the land; as conserving if the new orchard is interplanted to a conserving crop; or as depleting if the land is inter - planted to corn or some other depleting crop.) "COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS means the entire acreage in tree fruits, cultivated nut trees, vineyards, and bush fruits on the farm on January 1, 1937, from which the principal part of the production is normally sold, including also the acreage of young nonbearin. orchards from which the principal part of the production will be sold." Entire acreage in orchards planted before January 1, 1937, -win be classified as neutral even though interplanted with some other crop in 1937. j The soil-building allowance for a farm shall be computed at the- </seg>
         <seg id="p560">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rate of $1.90 for each acre in commercial orchards on such farm. $1.00 for each acre of cropland on such farm on which one crop of commercial vegetables was grown in 1936. The soil-building allowance set up on orchard and vegetable land is added to the other allowances tor the farm. The farm allowance may be earned by practices on the farm and also by practicesl applicable only to land in commercial orchards and commercial vegetables as given below: "Practices Applicable Only to Land in Commercial Orchards "(r) Winter Cover Crops. Incorporation into .the soil by plowing or discing between March 1, 1937, and June 30, 1937 inclusive of a good vegetative growth of any of the following winter cover crops- Rye, oats, barley, buckwheat, annual grasses, annual legumes or mixl tures of any of these-?!. 00 per acre. Provided: such crop has attained at least sixty days' growth and is not pastured or harvested for grain or hay. "(s) Seeding* of Winter Cover Crops. Seedings after May 1 1937 of any of the crops listed under subsection (r) of this Section S except soybeans and cowpeas—so.so per acre,—Provided- (1) There is a good vegetative growth of such crops on such land on the date as of winch final inspection of the farm is made for the purpose of determin - ing performance. "(t) Seeding Soybean* and Cowpeas. Seeding, after May 1 1937 soybeans and cowpeas at the normal rate— ?1.50 per acre. Provided-' There is a good vegetative growth of such crop on such land on the date as of which final inspection of the farm is made for the purpose of de - termining performance which is not pastured or otherwise taken from the land." (This provision is likely to be changed to require Incor - poration of good vegetative growth into the soil in 1937.) "(u) Mulching. Application of mulching materials, other than manure—?l.oo per ton (air-dry weight). Provided: (1) Not less than three and not more than five tons per acre are applied; and (2) All materials produced on such land from interplanted crops are left thereon. Orchard and vegetable allowances on farms within a farming unit are set up on the individual farms where the acreage of orchards and vegetables are located. Soil-building payments are earned on the individual farms where the practices are adopted but are always limited for the landlord to his share of the building allowance on the ndividual farm. The operator's soil-building payment is limited by he operator's share of the allowance on the farming unit. Payments in the territory where commercial orchards and vegetables are com- </seg>
         <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY moily grown In Nebraska are likely to be divided by the crop-share landlords and tenants on the basis of two-fifths to the landlord, and thrie-fifths to the tenant. Now let's see how this will work on a farm. I find that people generally grasp the application of these rules and regulations if illustra - tions are used. Let's use an imaginary farm with an orchard on it. Let us take a 160 acre farm which has 80 acres In orchard, 10 acres pasture, 10 acres alfalfa; 60 acres grain (corn, wheat, oats). The allowance for this farm would be figured about as follows: 80 acres x 1.90 = $152.00 on the orchard 10 acres x I.oo= 10.00 on the alfalfa if maintained. 9 acres x I.oo= 9.00 on 9 acres new alfalfa seeding. Total allowance 171.00 In addition for the 9 acres of new alfalfa there would be a diversion allowance of 6.00 x the production factor and if a good stand is shown In ;he fall, $3.00 per acre more. 9 x ?6.00 = ?54.00 9 x 3.00= 27.00 .Sl'.OO :.'.¦ His orchard allowance can be earned as follows: I Straw mulch 50 tons on 17 A.@sl per ton = ? 50.00 | : Terrace 2000 feet @ .40 '¦"¦=. 80.00 1 Seeding Lespedeza on 39 A. &lt;g&gt; 1.00 ". = 39.00 ¦ I ~ Total =$171.00 jSome of the other ways of earning the allowances set up could be used in vineyards. For example soy beans could be seeded In a vine - yard and for each acre seeded $1.50 per acre could be collected. •i As explained previously most of the provisions of this docket are better suited to orchard practices of the eastern fruit regions and are not so well suited to this territory. For example as I understand it the seeding of cover crops in the fall and discing or plowing them under are not adopted here. We will just have to grin and bear it I suppose. Some of the delegates from Missouri and Illinois tried to secure changes that would be better suited to their conditions but the folks from the sections farther east argued that the corn belt had been favored on some of the other programs and now the fruit and vegetable growers of the east and south should be given greater consideration. The people from Illinois and Missouri saw the logic ot these arguments and no important changes were made. Here in Nebraska we have even fewer orchardists than they do in these two states and I feel that we would </seg>

Since we are a Hi tie behind time in getting started, we will turn the meeting over to cur first speaker immediately. Mr. J. C. Schilletter of the lowa State College at Ames, lowa, will talk to you about "Advertising the Apple". Mr. Schilletter. APPLE ADVERTISING—A CHALLENGE TO THE GROWERS By J. C. SCHILLETTER, Ames, lowa /~ . 'Apples", as I recall, was one of the first words of my vocabulary, bees .use it was about the time that I was learning to talk that my father and two other men bought land and planted an apple orchard in Rabun County, Georgia. In the years that followed I took many trips and spent many summers in this orchard. I can still hear my father say, "son, when this orchard comes into full bearing you will havo a good job." I entered college, enrolled in horticulture and plan - ned to become an orchardist in Rabun County, Georgia. This orchard was sold to take care of the mortgage before I had my chance, and I took the line of least reslstence, you might say, and went Into college work. Since that time T have visited with orchardists in all parts of the United States, and have discovered that my father was not the first man, nor probably the last, who never reaped the golden harvest fron an apple orchard that had been planted with the thought in mind of a good investment for his family. However, the experience of my father did instill in me an interest in apples and also a realization of the many problems that an apple producer has to face. Very often, men like myself appear before you and talk In academic terms. We say that we ought to cooperate, that we should do this, that, or the other thing but we do not come to the specific terms of the action. - l-.v .-. . ¦-..¦¦¦:- ' ¦¦• Today I wish to discuss with you a problem that is really a chal - lenge to you as growers or a call to action to you as apple producers. This problem -has to do with keeping the apple In Its rightful place with the consumers of America. The apple has all the characteristics that make a good commodity for advertising. Advertising has been of great value In increasing the demand for products that do not have near the appeal of the apple. ' A few mornings ago, over a cup of coffee, I had a chat with a very good friend of mine at Ames, Dr. H. V. Gaskill of the Psychology de- I ¦ ¦ .... i .-'-..:' :. .. -' ' .'-' . ¦¦ ¦¦''. '.-."

         <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE partment, who teaches the courses in advertising, and with whom I have been working cooperatively on some problems having to do with consumers' wants and consumer appeals in the merchandising ot apples. I said, "Gaskill, it seems to me that an apple has as much appeal as an orange, yet there are, perhaps, more Americans drinking orange juice for breakfast than are eating baked apples for breakfast." He said, "Yes, I'll wager that even you have orange juice every morning for breakfast, and that you have had impressed upon you, thru adver - tising, that it is almost an absolute necessity. Go over and walk down the food line in this cafeteria, look at those baked apples, and then tell me your impression." When I came back, I said, "they do not have an appeal." Then my friend continued, "think what It would mean it we could discover a want or a desire on the part of the American consumer which would make him feel it was a very necessary thing for him to have apples with certain food. For example, back in Ohio where I was raised, my mother never had pork without apple sauce Here in Ames, among my friends, I discover that apparently that was not and never has been a very pronounced custom. To cite another type of thing that probably does not help apple consumption, I believe that many people probably associate apple pudding with the idea of using up old bread. Then Dr. Gaskill asked me this question, "Suppose that you persuaded one million Americans who do not eat apples at all that they should eat one each day, how many bushels would you have?" Have you apple producers thought of that problem in arith - menc? One million people would eat 365 miliion apples in the course ot the year. Figuring 125 apples to the bushel and you have 2 920 000 bushels of apples. Enough to take care of ten per cent of the apple export trade. The domestic market Is going to have to absorb a greater part of the export market than it has in the past because many foreign countries are developing their own orchard business and apples will not be imported when local apples are available. Why should we worry about the sale of apples any more today than we did a few years ago? One of my students remarked to me last year when I assigned him a problem to determine how much the house - wives in Ames knew about apples, that he thought that the apple was the king of fruits, and that he could see no reason for doing such a problem. My reply to this student was based upon a few figures that I had seen relative to the decrease in the per capita consumption of apples in the United States. Perhaps some of you remember an article in the Blue Anchor magazine showing a decrease of ten per cent in the per capita consumption of apples from 1920 to 1930 in contrast with oranges which had increased sixty-eight per cent in the same time. The Food Industries magazine also had an article on fruit con- </seg>
         <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY sumption.showing a decrease In apple consumption in contrast to an Increase with almost all of the other fruits. However, I decided to Investigate the problem further and see If more data were not available. I lave prepared a few Charts based upon some figures obtained from Bureau of Agricultural Economics.' I believe that the most valid comparison Is with commercial crops. The following table brings out a few startling facts. Table I Per capita consumption in pounds of fruits based upon commercial crcps. 1919 . 1934 % Citrus 20.65 55.54 62.8(1) Apples 36.22 : 24.70 31.6(d) All fruit 119.36 159.07 25.0(i) Consumption of citrus fruits has increased by 62.8 per cent, con - sumption of all fruits by 25 per cent, but the consumption of the apple has decreased by 31.6 per cent. The table below shows the per capita consumption of the apple for a number of years. Table II \: 1919 36.22 lb. 1929 30.81 lb. ; 1930 31.881b. 1931 . 34.07 lb. .'. 1932 27.62 lb. 1933 23.96 lb. 1934 ¦.-;'."¦..' 24.72 lb. The six year average 1929-1934 shows a decline of 20 per cent in the per capita-consumption of apples. The fact that our domestic consumption of apples is on the decline is certainly pictured to us in vivid fashion with the above figures. In addition to the decrease in per capita consumption of apples in ou:- domestic markets, we are also faced with the loss of a part of our ap] ile export market. Mr. A. G. Phillips gave an excellent picture of the export situation, in an address before the American Pomological Society, last December. He said, briefly: "The apple industry is faced with the greatest trade barrier in 50 years. Although attempts are being made through trade agreements to rectify the condition, the export industry will probably never reach the peak that it once held. For over 50 years the orchards in the United States; were grown and developed to supply the export trade. I ¦'. ¦ ' - - </seg>

         <seg id="p567">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY The National Apple Institute received its first impetus in the sum - mer of 1935 with the efforts of a small group of men who were inter - ested in telling the people of the United States about apples. The National Apple Institute has a plan which Is national in scope an 1 deserves the support of every fruit grower regardless of whether he Is spending money for local advertising or whether he belongs to a sec tional organization. The National Apple Institute is doing a splendid piece of educational work. The campaign is to tell the housewives of the United States about apples. It fosters no particular variety, no specific brand, no particular section. It's 'watchword' Is to make America apple conscious. I- . The method used by the National Apple Institute is as follows: The clip sheets that I have here are copies ot the ones that have been sent out to date. In preparing this talk the other afternoon I looked ov;r a few of these sheets In order; to get a little Inspiration. It acuaily made me hungry for apples just to read them. I want to call yoir attention to a few of the headings: "Apple Pie Greatest Favorite ot All"—some interesting facts about apple pies are given here. Did yoi know 'that of the $60;000,000 spent annually for bakers' pies that the greatest proportion Is for apple pie? I didn't realize that that much money was spent for pie. [Here Is another breakfast head - ing "Breakfasts Ahoy!"—:one of the suggestions is bacon and fried apples. The other morning I suggested to my wife that bacon and fried apples made a good breakfast, j She remarked, "Yes, if we just had some apples." It shows you that she had not been reminded sufficiently during that past.week to bring home apples. Most of us have to be reminded often because we are thinking of other things. Here are a few more headings occurring In these clip sheets —"Steamed Apples and Cold Roast", "Apples for Breakfast", "Old Fashioned Aiple Cobbler"—"Apple Tea". They make you hungry just to read them. I shall place these sheets somewhere so that you may see later wl at material is going into them. Dr. Barnard, Secretary of the National Apple Institute, reports that the clip sheet has circulation covering the following fields: Daily and Sunday Newspapers 16,997,904 Women's Magazines 7,914,394 Farm Papers and Magazines .._..... 9,732,868 Horticultural Papers 176,595 Trade Papers and Publications .:....... . 48,576 The total distribution shown in the above summary is more than 34000,000.

         <seg id="p568">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Another important use of the clip sheet recipes has been In con - nection with food advertising. Flour has no particular interest to house wives, but flour suited for making crisp apple pie crust is some - thing to talk about. So recipes for using apples in baked dishes went into a million sacks of flour. The above type of thing can be done with other articles, as well as with flour. Electrically transcribed apple recipes were sent to 90 radio stations and used as food talks. There is also a mimeographed booklet known as "The Apple Bowl" containing interesting news material on apples and on apple recipes that has been sent to workers on the various papers and home economic directors. Last year the institute carried on the program at a cost of $1750. This year's budget calls for $5700. It is imperative that every grower support the work of the institute in order to maintain and increase the market for the champion of all fruits, King Apple. When you consider that the California Fruit Growers Exchange invested well over $2, 000,000 in advertising oranges, lemons, grape - fruits in 1934-1935, and that they have spent since 1907 ?21,G00,000 over 38,000,000 in the last five years, and that other companies such as Welch Grape Juice. California Walnut Exchange, Ivory Soap put out anywhere from two to ten per cent of their gross sales into advertising, it seems very little to ask an apple grower to give one-tenth of one cent per bushel to help support such a worthy enterprise. &lt; Is the National Apple Institute getting results? If the requests for the clip sheets and the general interest shown by newspapers, magazines, public utilities companies, and others is any indication, it is certainly off to a good start. Now relative to a few of the sectional organizations and as to what they are doing. The programs of all are quite similar but of course they are pushing the apples and the varieties of their own particular regions. The sectional organizations now include the fol - lowing: The New York New England Apple Institute; Washington State Apples, Incorporated; Appalachian Apples, Incorporated; Ohio Apple Institute; The Michigan Bonded Plan. Perhaps, there are others that have not come to my attention. Your attention is now called to the most recent development in the campaign to increase the consumption of apples. The International Apple Association has been asked to take over the directorship of the national project for increasing the consumption of the apple. The request came as a result of the conference held in Cleveland in Sep - tember by the representatives of the regional apples institutes, the National Apple Institute, horticultural societies and other allied interests. </seg>
         <seg id="p569">NEBRASKA STJATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY At the Cleveland conference in September three points were empha - sized throughout the conference. First—There was to be no infringement upon or interference with the local or regional advertising and publicity institutes or units now soiwell under way but to cooperate with them and be helpful to them in every possible way. This was emphasized and agreed upon as fundamental. The regional units were highly commended for their initiative and the vast amount of work which had gone into them. .'. Second.—-The Industry was confronted with a situation that re - quired broad and sustained effort to promote its interests not only by publicity and advertising, but through such broad and fundamental projects as research which are so extensive as to require national support. I Third.—The best interests and welfare of the industry were the sole objectives of the conference. I The following approaches were suggested for the project, which the International Apple Association has been requested to direct. (1) To initiate and promote efforts seeking conclusive evidence of the food value of apples. This is to include: j (a) A scientific investigation by a duly qualified agency of the health and food values of apples. I (b) The development through research of the new uses for apples. ' . I" ¦ • - - - j (c) A scientific Investigation of spray residues by a thoroughly qualified independent institution. .(¦-.'- ¦ '-'¦¦';¦ j (d) To act as a coordinating agency with local or regional in - stitutes and units and render as much assistance to them as possible. j (c) To foster promotional service with retailers. j (f) ' To foster publicity, educational and otherwise including observance of apple week. j (2) The Budget.

         <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY published on pruning, soil management and production problems, our research on merchandising' and advertising the apple is very meagre. Dr. Gaskill and I started some work last spring with a few of our own students. For example, we had one boy spend time upon an experi - ment in a grocery store to determine the sales appeal of apples ln mesh bags in contrast to apples in paper cartons and apples in bulk. In my course In marketing at Ames, I have assigned the problem, for the last three years, of having one of my students determine how - people used apples and how many varieties they knew. The results of thp above work are rather meager, of course, because the boys are undergraduates and don't have sufficient time to go into the thing thoroughly. However, it is a beginning, Personally, I feel that in thfe future we should devote more of our research efforts along this line than we have in the past. We have a bigger problem today in the marketing of apples than we have In the production of apples. Market - ing research is absolutely vital. We must not offer this as a positively "sure cure" remedy or another "prosperity around the corner" sign but we all know It will turn on the green light at that well-known corner. QUESTION: Do you know what the growers that are sponsoring th;s type of advertising donated toward the campaign? MR. SCHILLETTER: About 3 cents a bushel"when packed. Q. Is that organization composed of growers themselves? A. Yes. They hire an advertising agency and also a merchandis - ing man who goes from city to city. Q. ; Do all the growers who subscribe to this fund back it up with a standard grade? A. The grades which they put out are up to a certain standard. The advertising people set a certain standard which they must have. Q. Ordinarily, does the retailer make a bigger margin on citrus, friit than on apples? '".-.-•'' A. There are figures on that but Ido not believe I have them with me. As I recall, They are pretty close together; not a great deal of difference. Q. Oranges are always sold by the dozen and apples by the bushel or basket. Do you think apples would sell better by the dozen? A. In a recent survey, sales people found that apples put up in 25&lt;! quantities sold better. Whether 'or not they would sell better by the dozen, I do.not know. -.[ MR. HOPPERT: In some southern states, they sell them that. </seg>

Don't you think it would be a good idea to have stamped on the; container that the apples were packed according to certain rules and regulations and then the dealer knows exactly what he is getting and exactly what he will have to get for them. JMR. BAKER: We are very fortunate here in Nebraska to have the; Ak-Sar-Ben organization in Omaha. The Board of Managers of the Ak-Sar-Ben are ready and willing to match dollar for dollar with the Nebraska apple growers in advertising Nebraska apples through con - tact with housewives or radio advertising. I think when the apple growers will organize and tie up with them, we'll find it well worth while. However, I think we should tie up with the National organiza - tion as well. MR. HOPPERT: There Is another thing we must be conscious of and that is that the citrus sales are on the increase. Their plantings have been Increased by 68% and thjat means that they will spend still more money in the future in advertising and we must be prepared for it. .¦''.-¦• ¦..-¦{"- Q. Do you have any figures on the amount of citrus exported? MR. SHILLETTER: Ido not have the figures with me and, while I know it has decreased, I can't quote'figures. MR. HOPPERT: There was another thing I wanted to bring up here. There has been a feeling that] some of the chain stores have been trying to beat the prices down on apples and some of the growers just didn't try to sell to the chain stores on that account but I believe their attitude has changed. I was talking to a manager of a chain store a short time ago and he said their new president had an entirely different attitude toward the growers and encouraged them to market their fruit through his chain of stores and at a fair price. I think that is a hopeful.attitude. Some of us growers, are.interested in making as many sales contacts as possible and sometimes have passed up these chain stores thinking that they would keep the price down but I believe you will find that they are reajiy to give a reasonable price. MR. KIMMEL: If we had fewer Varieties, I wonder if we would not be better off. People are not familiar with the different ones and could choose from a few better than so many. MR. SIM: The subject of advertising apples would take too long to finish so we will leave it now and get on with our meeting. Mr. W. B. Banning of : the State Department of Agriculture will lead a round table discussion on "The Proposed Apple Grades". Mr. Banning. MR. BANNING: Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen: I intend to let you do </seg>
         <seg id="p574">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE most of the talking but I was much Interested in the talk regarding conditions under which fruit was put up. That is one thing which I think we have neglected. Oranges are always uniform in size. Now, I don't think you would find that is so in a basket of Nebraska apples. That is what we must do, put them up in the way the merchants'want them and the way the buyer wants them. Take the Poultry Department. We want their products graded as to size and weight. Eggs will bring a much higher price If they are of uniform size. I have found in talking to merchants that when a customer picks out apples, she picks the bigger ones every time. The merchant would rather have them uniform in size so he won't have a lot of small apples left in the bottom of the basket. Besides that, they don't show up as well. In a grading law, however, we must not have too many rules. We want a grading law short and to the point. If you are going to pack a 2'_" apple, pack that; if the size is 2%" or 3", see that there is no variation. I have concluded to use four belts on my machine in grading and I believe it will pay me to do it. We have worked out a bill to present to the legislature but I be - lieve it Is too long. I thing it will have to be shortened somewhat. I believe that uniform size counts more than color. I don't think we Nebraska growers have packed our stuff In the way the people want it. What we want in this grading law is just that and it should be short and to the point. The Attorney General has recommended that a bushel of apples weighs 48 lbs. and cannot be sold for a bushel unless it contains that amount. We are trying to compel these fellows to put 4S lbs. In a basket. Some of those baskets contain only 40 lbs. but that must be marked on the outside of the basket. We have three fellows here in Lincoln who ship in bulk apples and pack them into baskets. They put only about 40 lbs. to the basket but we are trying to break up that or compel them to mark the basket. Now, what do you want to do? Do you think there should be a net weight on this fruit when packed? GROWER: Winesap apples around 2V. ' in diameter will weigh nearer 50 lbs. to the bushel when packed. MR. HOPPERT: That's the trouble. Different kinds of apples weigh differently. MR. SIM: Could each variety be named and their approximate weight given? </seg>
         <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY MR. KIMMEL: That would be almost impossible for apples vary in weight from year to year. Q. Who. decided that 48 lbs. make a bushel? MR. BANNING:. The state legislature. REMARK:- It seems to me then that the only fair way would be to sell apples by the pound instead of by the bushel. MR. SIM: How could we pack the stuff? j MR. KIMMEL: Why not put the approximate (number of apples on the basket rather than the weight? :.', MR. SCHILLETTER: This same problem came up In the Minne - sota legislature. They finally based their law on the cubical content. MR. BANNING: Yes, but in Nebraska the way it stands now, unless it weighs 48 lbs. it isn't a bushel. I - I MR. SHUBERT: It seems to me that where we have a standard baßket, we might sell a.basket full of Winesaps as a bushel, a basket full of Jonathans as a bushel, and so on. MR. BANNING: Your dealers might not all agree on what is .'ful', heaped or otherwise. MR. BAKER: In the Internatio _al Shippers Association, they accept Ben Davis, Duchess, Grimes.and Wealthy as not weighing over 44 lbs. other apples they accept as heavier. jPerhaps the law could be amended and have a basket show the nunlber of pounds contained in it. MR. BANNING: That would not take care of the shipper who brings in bulk and then packs the baskets. MR. HOPPERT:. Some apples are sold out of storage and some varieties shrink considerably. They would have to be marked as weighing a certain amount when packed. They might shrink four or five pounds to the basket. ! MR. BANNING: These are somejof the questions that enter in when you are trying to police the industry. |VIR. KIMMEL: T think this uniform grading rule that we drew up would cover that. It is covered under the heading 'deceptive pack' and we could corner them that way.: MR. BANNING: But could you corner them on a 'jumble' pack? The 'ring' pack could be checked. j Q. Could we say the 'jumble pack'! must be sold by the pound? </seg>
         <seg id="p576">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. WIGGANS: What is the objection of the grower to stamping the weight of the basket on the lid? A. They shrink and then the weight varies. Q. Would you vary the selling price according to the weight' That would bring up more difficulty. _&lt; M .vY I.^ ANS: A year ago we put UP our aPPles according to sizes _y 4 , 2% and 2%" and we put a differential price on them and got it. Larger apples weigh less per bushel but are more desirable to most people. MR. BANNING: Don't you think if we put this stuff in a closer class as far as size Is concerned, we are getting near to what we want? MR. WIGGANS: It seems to me there is another problem the grower has to face besides the selling according to sizes, etc. We visited the orchards in the Wenatchee valley and talked with a grower here. They have trouble getting rid of the lower grade apples. He told me they had sold apples that he knew were started toward a vinegar factory but later those same apples went through their town on the way east to be sold to consumers. MR. BANNING: If we get through a law controlling pack ac - cording to size, you have some chance. This bill we have is too long It must be shortened before we can get anyone down at the State House to do a thing with it. MR KIMMEL: You mentioned three grades. How would you label them. MR BANNING: Just as 1, 2, and 3. Perhaps have two or three sizes of l , etc. but have only three grades. Uniform size seems to me to be the important thing.

HOPPERT Winter injury o-i ins to fruit ti-ees in pome part of Nebraska nearly every year The i-liinaiii- conditions in the state are so variable from east to west and from south to north that this phenomenon is not to be considered unusual, larticularly since folks will plant peaches, apricots, ini'diuiu hardy plums and apples in regions where injury is to be expected fairly regularly. But when severe injury occurs to sup - posedly hardy varieties of apples l|ke Black Twig, Winesap, Stay men, Jonathan. Red Delicious, i.e., in the commercial apple sections along the Missouri river, naturally il is of more than passing interest. A survey of on hards was made by the writer in April In Richard - son, Nemaha. Otoe. 1 ass. Sarpy, and Douglas counties to determine the extent of the damage, the varieties most susceptible, the particular sites or locutions ivlicie injury was most prevalent, and any other factors that seemed pertinent to Hie question. At the time v! 1 his survey _•_ orchards were visited ill tile six counties mentioned. Some injury was found in every orchard. The most general type of injury was in the crotches where the main scaffold limbs joined the trunk. This type or" injury was common on nearly all varieties except the early ones like Duchess and Wealthy. It was worse in low. rich i;vMind. It was not as serious on Winesap as it was on llelicious. Crimes and York. Crotch injury was not as serious on .011111: trees as on old trees nor as serious on trees maturing a light crop or having no crop as on trees with a good crop the previous season. Trunk injury was fairly common on old Black Twig, Staymen and Virginia Beauty, the first two being more seriously hurt than the latter. Where these varieties were growing on low rich ground many of them were practically girdled. On high ground medium in fertility, the injury was largely on the south side between the ground line and the main blanches. On some large limbs v strip of dead bark extended 3 to sle -l from the trunk. Practically every tree of these varieties 20 years or older was injured to a greater or lesser extent. At the time of this survey (April) not all of the injured areas were discernible. As the summer progressed and another drought period ensued, many of the partly injured areas died and in late summer these </seg>
         <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY dead areas became conspicuous by the development of a saprophytic shelf fungus. Some injured trees blossomed and set fruit. By tho middle of June the worst of these showed a chlorotie condition (leaves turned yellow) and these trees died before the season was over. Others actually matured a crop of fruit and, then died. No doubt there will be others that will struggle along for a year or two and then pass out of the picture. i Young trees as a general rule were not seriously Injured by the severe "winter unless they had previously been Injured by sunscald, borers or mice. In low, wet places there was some crotch damage but no trunk damage to speak of. The reasons for the extensive injury to Nebraska orchards can be definitely fixed when we examine the weather records from October 15ih to February 15th. During the last half of October, it was abnor - mally cloudy and misty. The rainfall for October was about 4 inches, about 2 inches above ( normal. On the 25th and 26th of October heavy frosts occurred, temperatures reaching 24 degrees. On October 30th the temperature reached 20. degrees F. The damp misty cloudy weather continued through the first half of November, a period when we normally have clear, dry weather to harden the wood and bark of trees. The older trees weakened by drought and crops were slower about this than were younger more vigorous trees. Came then a very severe and extended cold spell in January and February. The tem - perature went below zero on January 16th and for the next thirty days it was zero or below practically) continuously. No wonder then that apple trees were injured. Old peaches were virtually wiped out as were also the very young trees, wtiereas those trees between 3 and G or 7 years were less seriously hurt.; Prune trees and lender plums were killed. Even Chinese elms were! killed in eastern Nebraska. Winter injury was also reported from lowa. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Yoj-k and the New England states. Indiana reported serious damage to trees that were pruned prior to the cold wave in January. New Hampshire reported serious injury to supposedly hardy Mcintosh trees that were fertilized heavily in the fall. A Pensylvania survey indicated that overly vegetative trees were more seriously damaged than were those of only medium vegetative grtwth. Maney of lowa reports serious damage on most varieties of apples, except, where .they were top-worked on Hibernal or some other haydy stocks. Maine horticulturists, after seeing practically 100% of their Mcintosh, trees affected with injury to the crotches or trunks during this same winter, agree with Maney that It pays to have their good varieties top-worked on some stock that can be depended upon to withstand these test winters. Perhaps Nebraska orchardists ought to do.likewise. ..' . • '-1 ] </seg>

As a result, many are in - terested in this campaign of bot control, others are not actually sold on its benefits and must first see results before they will react favorably. It is necessary that large groups treat their horses before success - ful results can be obtained—at least several adjacent counties. As an illustration, South Dakota has conducted an extensive campaign and produced very desirable results. The project divides itself into three parts—the need, organization and action. The need is determined by contacts and interviews with farmers over the county during the summer and fall. It is obvious since flies in summer are readily observed as are horses that are in poor condition through the fall and winter months. These bot flies de - posit eggs on the horses' legs and bellies, later entering the animals' 7; bodies causing internal disturbances. During October and November, it is necessary to get the organiza- ¦" tion set up and ready to function. It sometimes proves quite a task t to stimulate Interest among the farmers and get them in a proper state 77 of mind. This can be accomplished by the aid of a veterinarian as well as calling meetings of representative farmers from each county pre- 1 cinct. These precincts each select a committee of nine men who in- ! ' vestigate such things as condition of treatment, methods and prices 1"7 In addition three of these nine men serve as precinct captains in the &amp; final drive. V-h if During the last part of November, December and part of'january 1 action really takes place. The farmers who are receiving the service 1 are spotted on a precinct map which is placed in the hands of the veter- - v </seg>
         <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION innrian. The veterinarian then notifies the farmer as to the time he can treat the horses and proceeds to do so with the aid of the precinct captain. . 7: In a campaign such as this, the chief duty of the County Agent was to keep news articles in the localpapers as well as informing each farmer by correspondence, the calling and conducting of meetings and general supervision. ! In our county the campaign was very successful both financially and from the standpoint of the horse. There were 3000 horses treated by veterinarians at 25£ per head. : Q.

VAX ES, Agricultural College With our present large hog population it is not strange that Ne - braska soil contains a great deal of disease. Hog cholera germs are always present, however, in recent years a new disease is creeping into the picture. This disease, known as swine erysipelas is transmissible and caused by a specific micro-organism which manifests itself by </seg>
         <seg id="p587">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Ta:her acute and chronic phenomena. Swine erysipelas is widely distributed in many countries of the Eiropean continent where for many years it has continued to present a perennial problem. This appears to be particularly the case of the centrally located countries which maintain a large hog population. Until more recent years the.United States enjoyed a favorable reputation in regard to swine erysipelas. Outbreaks comparable to the acute, fatal form were first observed, followed by the milder or chronic form of the infection. It is not impossible that earlier fatal outbreaks may have occurred without identification. The marked incidence of hog cholera, combined with the manifest difficulties encountered in the differential clinical diagnosis of the two diseases may readily have caused swine erysipelas to escape prompt recognition. It has been observed that outbreaks on Nebraska farms nearly always beirin with a sudden onset. Some animals may unexpectedly be found deid or in some outbreaks individual Animals would succumb at intervals of a few days, the deaths persisting for a month or more. As a general rule, however, herds become rapidly Involved after the 'flrit- death has taken place. Occasionally, a serious out-break will extend beyond the limits of its original focus. It is, however, relatively uiibommon that the disease maintain itself permanently in a newly in - vaded territory previously exempt from the infection. Only now and then does the disease obtain a firm'foothold In a previously disease - free area or acclimate Itself there from the first so as to establish a nev center of the malady. ' The spread, of swine erysipelas, its transmission from place to place, is subject to a number of contributory factors among which the geographic position, density of swine population, commerce and traffic in hogs and the type ofsoil, may have a place. Direct contact, stable manure, body waste, slaughter offal, birds, rodents, infected soil and contaminated water courses are recognized as possibilities for thi i disease spread. The incidence of swine erysipelas is subject to the influence of the season. It Is highest during the third quarter of the year and lowest during the first. In the course of the second quarter cases the out - breaks become more numerous.and they decline in the last quarter. Whether or not this phenomenon can be entirely explained by taking into account prevailing temperature alone, is not certain. It is quite possible that other factors not yet fully appreciated may also have an influence. \ The susceptibility of swine erysipelas is least marked in the age grcup under three months, the preponderating majority of the cases falling within the age group of 3-12 months. It remains possible that </seg>

         <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION As a general rule, the malady runs a rapid course. Death within 24 hours after the first symptoms is not uncommon. In the ones of slower course the sickness lasts 2 or 3 days and death occurs on the 3rd or 4th day. If the animal survives the fourth day of illness the chance for recovery is greatly increased. However, recovery may be only ap - parent and after a period of good health evidence of chronic erysipelas may come to light. J The results In case ot this form of swine erysipelas must always be unfavorable, unless very early serum treatment Is possible. The case mortality rate ranges between 50 and 100 per cent with 75 per cent as a probable average. The urticarial form or "diamond skin disease" as a rule is of milder character than the septicemic form of the malady. Commonly the temperature rises to 104° - 108° F., the appetite fails and the animal seeks a cool place to conceal itself. The affected animals show stiff - ness accompanied by pain and muscular weakness. This general indisposition rapidly improves after the appearance of j the characteristic skin eruption which manifests itself by the ap - pearance of light red or pinkish patches of the integument of the chest, belly, loin, shoulders, etc. As the name indicates many of the patches are of diamond shape, others resemble rectangles, quadrangles ¦or] rhombus forms. Size varies between %ths and 114 th inches, when close together they tend to become confluent and may give rise to (patches of considerable area. Unless interrupted by certain com - plications the evolution, of this form of swine erysipelas is usually completed within 8 to 14 days, with recovery as a result. The case mortality of "diamond skin disease" has been estimated at 2 per cent. Without a doubt these.deaths can be attributed to various complications resulting from the disease. The fact that apparent re - covery may be followed by chronic forms should also be taken into account. Joint involvement is a common sequel to swine eryspielas infection. It may occur as an independent manifestation or it may follow in the wake of acute disease or as an accompaniment of other chronic forms. (At a given time we may notice that some of the joints of exposed animals are enlarged, and that the swollen parts are hot and painful. When Inflammation tends to subside the lesions assume a chronic character, leading to, bony enlargements and thickening of the soft parjts producing deformity and distortion of the limbs. In most caseß locomotion is considerably hampered; the animals become stiff and show a stilty gain and prefer to lle^down a good part of the time. The desire for food declines and the swine becomes unthrifty. </seg>

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON SUDAN POISONING PAUL TAGGERT, Omaha, Nebr. Sudan in Nebraska has become an important crop both for pasture and for hay. Its use lias increased materially in the past few years. There are-several reasons for this: Ist. A large yield per acre is obtained. 2nd. It is relatively easy to produce. 3rd. It fits into a temporary pasture rotation and can be used as a supplement to the permanent pasture. 4th. Many of our permanent pastures have been killed out during the extreme drouth, necessitating the greater use of temporary pasture. Iti spite of the above reasons and the greatly Increased use of sudan. as a forage crop, two criticisms are offered: Ist. Sudan is hard on the soil. 2nd. Particularly In a year like the past, some livestock is lost due to hydro-cyanic acid poisoning. In my. opinion both of these criticisms have been over emphasized and particularly the second one can be largely avoided. We are told by the people in the agronomy department and it seems only logical, it we stop to analyze the situation, that for tonage raised, sudan takes no more plant food from the soil than any other crop; However, we are told too, that the cane family, and sudan be - longs to this family, does have a faculty of withstanding drought. In order to withstand drouth sudan utilizes the available moisture from the soil and is able to draw this moisture from the soil to much better advantage than some other crops. Unless sufficient rainfall occurs to re - place this moisture in the soil naturally the next crop Is going to be short. Since the problem is one of moisture instead of fertility Ido not believe we need be alarmed especially since some day It may rain again. We only have a small acreage of sudan In proportion to our total crops and after all the thing we want Is pasture. Since we are not able in a good many instances to get pasture, In any Other way such moisture as might be sacrificed is probably worth It for the pasture. With reference to the second criticism, I have told you before that Sudan belongs to the cane family. The cane family under certain </seg>
         <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE conditions produces hydro-cyanic acid more commonly called prussic acid. Some of these conditions seem to be more prevalent in dry periods. As a result of my experiences and observations, I am of the opinion that sudan, while it is related to the cane family and receives a lot of criticism, is not as guilty of hydro-cyanic acid poisoning as a lot of people think. I am of the opinion that the following things convict sudan on circumstantial evidence when in reality it should not be. Ist. Pure seed is difficult to obtain. 2nd. Proper precautions are not taken by us as feeders. With reference to pure seed, I wish to call to your attention that I previously stated sudan was related to the cane family. Since it is related it becomes crossed with cane and what we think is pure seed and so far as the naked eye can descern is pure seed, in a good many Instances is not pure, but is a cross and instead of sudan poisoning/"we have cane poisoning. In addition in the handling of seed, unless extreme precautions are taken and even though they are, if seed is relatively near the same size, it is possible to get the seed mixed. Whether this mixing be due to the fact that the bins are ill close proxi - mity to each other or whether there might have been a few cane seeds left in the wagon, in the threshing machine or have been scattered on the road or in the field whereby they have come up and matured as volunteer cane, that possibility of mixing seed is always prevalent. In my opinion then the problem of obtaining pure sudan seed is rather remote except that seed which is produced in areas which raises no cane and Is pure seed to start in with. With reference to proper precautions being taken by the feeder, there are numerous ways in which we can avoid sudan poisoning if we are confident that it is sudan poisoning. Ist. If there is any possibility of sudan poisoning, by all means we should keep livestock out of the field at the time the sudan is in such a condition that poisoning might result. 2nd. We should see that our fences are in repair so that in case an epidemic of sudan poisoning is prevalent, the livestock will not break out and get into the field. My experience during the past year has been such that I have arrived at the above conclusions. We have, out on the Two Rivers Project, a herd of pure bred Holstein cows, as well as some other live - stock. Since there was very little if any pasture available during the </seg>
         <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION past season as our permanent pasture had been broken out it was nec - essary to provide temporary pasture. Along with such other pasture as was necessary In the form of rye, wheat, sweet clover and so forth, we had quite a little sudan. As I remember this sudan was planted the latter part of May and a very good stand was obtained. At the time this sudan reached the helghth of about six inches we started to pasture it. It was pastured continuously from that time until about November 15, with the exception of about two weeks Immediately after the first frost and no ill results were obtained. In addition, some hay was cut from this sudan which had been pastured and as soon as the sudan had obtained sufficient growth, stock was turned into this field again. From October 3rd until November 15th, we had in addition to the dairy cows, about 120 head of white face feeders on this sudan with the exception of the two weeks period of frost as I mentioned above. As much livestock as we pastured and as much trouble as was ex - perienced In our neighborhood, I attribute our good luck to the fact that we obtained sudan free from cane. It so happened that the seed which we used was California seed and if lam not mistaken was certified seed. At any rate, I feel that our sudan pasture was.very profitable to us and that we experienced no difficulty either in the pasture or the hay which we cut. It so happens that we are on river bottom land and perhaps it was not affected by the drought so severely. However, I am firmly convinced that pure seed and proper management practices would largely eliminate a good deal of the trouble, many have experienced in using sudan as pasture. FEEDING MOLASSES TO CATTLE H. J. GRAMLICH, Agricultural College Fal.tening cattle upon corn and alfalfa Is a very costly business under present price conditions. Not only is corn high but other grains have kept pace with it. As a result feeders are in desperate need of a good grain substitute. Of tbe high carbohydrate feeds, molasses Is the only one which has not greatly advanced in price. It is unusual that this molasses should be available in such large quantities and low prices. The supply coming into Nebraska at the present time is being shipped from the Tropics; a large percentage trom Cuba which is their last yeir's crop. At this time molasses is selling at seven cents a gallon:at gulf ports. It is coming into Nebraska in tank cars at approximately $20 a ton. The price for molasses out of Omaha is $24 and in various parts of the state ranges from $24.50 to $27 depending on freight charges. This price is approximately the same as before the drought. </seg>
         <seg id="p594">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE At the present time with molasses selling at $25 a ton and corn at $1.20 a bushel or about $45 a ton, it is only logical that feeders should be interested In this comparatively cheap feed. Unfortunately its feeding value in comparison with corn when fed in large quantities Is sot known. There Is a current scarcity of corn. Coupled with 'this, prospects do not indicate a material advance in the price of molasses before mid - summer. Realizing the interest of Nebraska feeders, we started last fall a test with five lots of 506-pound yearling heifers. The heifers in one of these lots ate 10 pounds of molasses per day for the first seventy-five days and since that time have consumed as much as 15 pounds per day without digestive disturbances. Heifers full-fed on corn made slightly raster .litis but the molasses-fed lot bad the decided advantage of cheapness of gain. These molasses-fed heifers put on 100 pounds gain at an average cost of $11.71 against $11.47 for the corn-fed lot. ah i„t,s in addition to their grain and molasses were allowed a full feed of (lii.uubi-dania._ed corn containing no grain. 1 '_ Hounds of cottonseed rake and 1 ln pound of limestone per day. Prom Die result-- obtained thus far it looks as though molasses will work into our i-attie fall. uin_ rations to good advantage. It is not as _ood as corn, pound tor pound, bin with the present spread in prices, it looks as though tin- relative price factor will favor molasses. MOLASSKS IN HO(i RATIONS WM. .). I.OKFFI. .. Agricultural College No one feed has caused as many inquiries at the present time as molasses. At this time it is the cheapest source of carbohydrates and when fed to comprise not to exceed SO per cent of the ration may be considered St) per cent as valuable as ,-orn per unit of weight. Because of the possibility that beet molasses may be excessively laxative to pics for the present at least, it is recommended that for hog feeding cane molasses only be used. However, beet molasses is equally as desirable as cane molasses of equal sugar content for feeding cattle, sheep and horses. One of the chief difficulties in feeding molasses is the mechanics of handling it. Where it is to be used for slop feeding, the problem is a relatively simple one since the molasses may be dis - solved in the water used to soak the feed. With the advent of cold weather, slop feeding becomes increasingly difficult. Better mixtures may be obtained where molasses is dissolved in water before being sprinkled on the grain feed. This method, of course, is very objection - able In very cold weather and might result in some fermentation during bot weather. </seg>
         <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION As much .as 15 per cent molasses can be incorporated with ground feed and the mixture still fed through a self-feeder. Much will depend upon the feeds used and also the fineness of grinding on the percentage of molasses which can be incorporated. Alfalfa meal, shorts, bran and ground oats are particularly absorptive of molasses. Finely ground feeds will absorb more: molasses than coarsely ground feeds. It might uasily be possible with certain feeds and combinations to use in excess of the 15 per cent molasses suggested. In nixing molasses with dry ground feed, we have found it ad - vantageous to spread a layer of ground feed, then a layer of molasses and so on and permit the mixture to stand overnight before stirring it. In ;his. way a more uniform mixture can'be secured with less effort than if the stirring were undertaken at once. With a burr type mill, the feed may be "regroniid", thus getting a more uniform mixture. Some feeders report good success with self-feeding molasses. One Cull-feeds molasses on alternate days. Our own experience with such methods is that a large amount of waste occurs. While molasses is very palatable to cattle, horses and sheep, pigs do not'appear to have a "sweet tooth", and never eat it with much relish. In a test now under - way at the Experiment Station, from ten to thirty per cent of the grain ted hogs is being replaced with molasses with good results. With molasses as with all feeds, the law of diminishing returns is operative. Without doubt, small allowances of molasses are used more efficiently than where this feed makes up a more sizeable propor - tion of the ration. Of course, when the price of molasses is very low or where hogs are very high in price, the efficiency with which molasses is used may become of secondary importance. Although the pork from molasses-fed hogs is of gojjd quality and the fat exceptionally . firm, the primary place for molasses in hog rations is for breeding stock -where it is mixed with the ground alfalfa. MOLASSES FOR SHEEP : M. A. ALEXANDER, Agricultural College Mo asses may be used in the ration for fattening lambs as well as in the ration, for ewes that are to be retained in the breeding flock. In the breeding flock cane molasses may be used to replace all of the grain nation fed before lambing time. Normally the allowance of grain is about % pound per ewe beginning six to eight weeks before lambing time. One-half to two-thirds pound molasses may replace the abbve grain for the ewe that is expected to lamb. After lambing time the molasses may be safely used to replace % to % o£ the </seg>
         <seg id="p596">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE normal grain allowance {or the ewe. Most generally after lambing time the ewe is allowed approximately 1 to IVi pounds of grain per day. This all depends, of course, upon whether the lambs is to be rushed along for the early spring lamb market. When ewes are lambed in March and April, there is no reason why molasses could not replace all the grain ration after lambing time since the ewe will probably not need more than V_ to % pound of grain. Naturally her grain allowance will depend upon her physical condition. The molasses may be fed In a trough along with the protein supplement and some mineral in case the ewes are not receiving a full allowance of alfalfa hay. A still better way to feed molasses in case silage Is being used or chopped hay, is to spread the molasses over the silage or cut hay in the feed bunk. It is very doubtful whether molasses should be used in the ration for the spring lamb. Since the lamb takes a very small amount of grain, it would probably bo much wiser to furnish as high (luality of grain for the spring lamb as it is possible to obtain. This usually is made by [¦•.ding the lamb cracked com with possibly a small allowance of linseed oil meal or similar supplement and all the bright green leafy alfalfa hay the lambs will consume. in the case of .feeding molasses to feeder lambs for the purpose of finishing them for the fat lamb market, it may not be Wise to count on replacing all the grain with molasses. From observations of a lamb feeding experiment now in progress all Indications jjilint to the tact that when molasses replaces all of the grain ration in a lamb fattening ration, the lambs will not become properly finished at a desirable market weight. Observations made in the same test seem to indicate that when the molasses replaces as much as \'« of the grain in the ration the lambs will probably be properly finished by the time they reach the desirable market weight. Some of the lambs In the test arc consuming as much as i-% pounds of molasses per day without showing any ill effects from the feeding. 11l one lot the lambs are receiving in addition to this, an equal amount of grain without ill effects. A ration of alfalfa-molasses meal mixed at the rate of 50 per cent alfalfa and 50 per cent molasses and full feed to the lambs seems to indicate that the lambs will not be properly finished at the time they reach a desirable market weight although they are eating ap - proximately 4 pounds dally of the mixture. Lambs that have had the above mixture of alfalfa and molasses but in addition have received i_ pound of corn per lamb each day have made approximately 1/10 pound greater dally gain for the sixty-day feeding period. There Is some doubt that lambs limited to this amount of corn in addition </seg>
         <seg id="p597">;¦• NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION to the alfalfa and molasses will not be properly finished for the market, without being too heavy. A group of lambs finished on equal parts of molasses and grain and fed at the rate so that the lambs receive an average of about 1% pounds of grain and I*4 pounds of molasses for a period of sixty days in addition to silage, cottonseed cake and mineral produced carcasses that were very desirable on the market and had no criticism in regard to color, or appearance. In fact, approximately % of the lambs in the shipment produced prime carcasses while the remaining one-third all produced choice carcasses. There were no inferior carcasses or medium carcasses in the group. After the lambs in the above experiment have finished their test and are in a markable condition, a report will be made on the test. It is possible that our preliminary observations may have to be changed after we have analyzed the final data. UNCONVENTIONAL FEEDING H. J. GRAMLICH, Agricultural College : In appearing before you to discuss the topic "Unconventional Feed - ing" I am going to open on the premise that we in Nebraska have re - ceived mighty unconventional handling by Mother Nature during the past few. years and accordingly it may be permissible for ius to do things in handling our livestock which in the usual order of procedure would be considered exceedingly unethical. ¦..'.,' I believe it is only necessary for me to remind that the sum total of all husked corn in the state of Nebraska for the three crop seasons of 1934; 1935 and 1936 is just one-half of what one normal crop would have been. In other words, we have a IG% per cent average produc - tion for the past three years. When one bears in mind that (Nebraska normally'"produces and shucks 230 million bushels of corn and that practically all of this is fed to livestock, it surely takes no great amount of reasoning to anticipate some mighty unconventional feeding. Federal and State Statistician, A. E. Anderson, has just released some material indicating that only 10 million bushels of corn were husked in Nebraska this fall. This would be but I per cent of the usual amount. Think of the problems which this has thrust upon us. Is is any wonder that the boys who have preceded me on this program have talked considerable about the feeding of molasses, I think I can say that the feeding of molasses on a wholesale scale to the livestock of Nebraska is unconventional—certainly unusual. A few years ago I was afforded the opportunity of spending some time in Louisiana. I was impressed with the freedom with which they fed cane molasses </seg>
         <seg id="p598">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to the work mules on the sugar plantations. In many instances I found them permitting mules to take the molasses at will from barrels and troughs. In others, about six pounds of molasses per head dally was being fed in conjunction with a mixture of ground grain and ground hay. Little did I realize at that time that molasses was destined to play such an important part in the conventional, if you please, live - stock feeding of Nebraska during the season T936-37. The situation this year Is two-sided. While our Nebraska live - stock folks have very little grain, practically no new corn and almost negligible supplies of old corn, they do have a considerable quantity of ensilage, fair supplies of other roughage and are possessed of a de - ternil!i_tl__ to stay hy livestock. This latter phase is responsible for some ot the so-called irrational feeding which is being done at the present lime. Two years ago following the drought of 1934 there was very little incentive lor the livestock farmer to try to take good care of Ins charges, Hogs had been low for several years. Fat cattle were selling at a low level. AH feed was high and scarce.. This year the bog market during the drought remained at a high level and has con - »»i"'&lt;l -n relatively ..Itracf,.. levels since. Fat cattle advanced three dollars per hundred in September. October and early November thus giving encouragement ,„ steer owners and to prospective steer owners to try to stay by the game. Nebraska is lousy will, trench silos. Partially as a result of an organized campaign put on in the summer of 19..6 by the Agricultural K.vtension Service of this institution and partly as a result of satisfied customers who had used these useful farm units in previous years some l.'S.noo additional trench silos were built in the state. Today there are :!2.00.i of these inexpensive, practical and usable farm units virtually all filled with ensilage. In addition there are some 9 000 other silos, consequently Nebraska with 41,000 silos does have quite .'I supply of ensilage. Calculating that each silo holds 125 tons there would be enough silage in Nebraska to fill a trainload of gondola cars each containing 50 tons with an engine in Chicago and a caboose in Denver, in other words a train 1,000 miles long. Using this silage made from drought-damage crops possessing little or no grain is one of the problems which is calling for unusual feeding practices this winter. Molasses is high in sugar content. Sugar in the animal's body docs what the starch of corn Would do. By adding three to four pounds of molasses to a full feed of silage, one would be virtually replacing the kernels of corn which the drought failed to let nature develop in the ensilage crop. Professor Thalman has for a number of years been conducting experimental trials with wintering stock calves. His work has shown </seg>
         <seg id="p599">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION consistently the wisdom of adding a little protein supplement to the wintering animal's ration. I believe there is splendid justification for this year feeding through the winter on ensilage, 3 to 4 pounds of molasses and from 1 to 2 pounds of cottonseed, linseed, soybean meal or some other high protein supplement. Where alfalfa is avail - able this can be used as a part of the ration. It is quite possible that one would be justified in feeding 1 pound of protein supplement even where some alfalfa is fed. The relative price of the two would tend to justify this. - Speaking again of unusual conditions, for the first year in the history of most of us, protein is cheaper than carbohydrate material. Generally we are skimpy with our protein supplements because they are considerably more expensive than corn and other farm produced high carbohydrate feeds. Today corn is costing In most communities in Nebraska from $1.15 to $1.25 per bushel. This in terms of cost per ton ranges from $41 to $45. Forty-three per cent protein cottonseed meal was coming into the state last week at $40 per ton. Other supple - ments were available at about the same prices. Under such unusual circumstances there is ample justification for using a protein supple - ment, even when a limited amount of legume hay is fed-to cattle. While in the Platte Valley recently I was Interested to note a good many feeders procuring an alfalfa njolasses mixture containing 30 per cent ground alfalfa and 70 per cent blackstrap molasses. This product was moved in,bulk, truckloads of it moving distances of 100 miles from the mill where mixing was done. Some feeders reported they were using 6 to 8 pounds of this mixture per head daily for cattle in the feed lot. This would be unconventional feeding under normal conditions but as we are leading an abnormal life this year, I contend that such practices may be entirely conventional, especially when one remembers that this particular feed is available at the mill at $23 per ton and that corn in that particular commuuity is costing virtually $4G delivered at the farm. Normally the price of corn in Nebraska is on a Chicago minus level. In other words, the going price with us is sufficiently under Chicago to cover the cost of shipping from Nebraska to the windy city. Today the opposite condition prevails. In other words, we now have a corn market which is on the Chicago plus basis. No. 3 yellow corn in car - load lots is quoted at the Omaha market at from 6 to 9 cents per bushel above the same grade on the Chicago market. By the time this corn is delivered to the feeders in Nebraska it costs from 10 to 14 cents per bushel more than the Chicago quotation. Again we have a condition which justifies unconventional feeding. Usually corn Is the cheapest feed we have. We build all of our livestock operations around It. </seg>
         <seg id="p600">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This year, corn is one of the most expensive feeds which we have and we are trying to skimp and get along with the minimum of it. During prohibition we heard quite a good deal about a certain product called "Near Beer". I am predicting that during the next six months we are going to hear quite a good deal about near beef, near pork and near lamb, especially the first. Nebraska has made an enviable reputation as a finisher of prime fat animals. We did this when we were harvesting a quarter of a billion bushels of corn per year and feeding practically all of it to our livestock. Now that our cribs are empty and our facilities with which to buy from without the state are limited, we are going to have to conduct our livestock operations in a somewhat unconventional, or to say the least, unusual manner. My prediction, ia that with an average crop of corn in 193 7 we will get back into the livestock business very rapidly. We have held on to our herds of cattle nobly. We are making less beef than usual, however, we will have a liberal number of young cattle to put on feed as soon as It becomes obvious that we are to harvest a fair crop ot small grain and a good crop of coru in the fall of 1937. The hog situation in Nebraska is likewise unconventional. We used to say that practically all of the hogs produced in Nebraska were fattened upon the farms where farrowed. I dare say that in an average year 90 to 95 per cent of all hogs produced in the state went through this process. In the spring of 1936 we farrowed 3 million pigs. In July, August and September when it became obvious that we could have no corn of consequence, over 1 million of these pigs were sold. They went to the west coast, to the east coast, and to the Gulf of Mexico. Many localities are this year fattening Nebraska hogs for the first time. Those pigs which were kept in the state for feeding pur - poses have had a variety of rations. Barley, wheat, oats, patented products, molasses, in fact most everything that might be thought of as consumable by a pig. Federal Statistician Anderson has recently put out some figures which would indicate that over half the sows bred to farrow fall litters were sent to market during midsummer. He estimates that approximately 400,000 sows will be bred for spring lit - ters. This should give us a crop of a little better than two million spring pigs. Bear In mind that an average spring pig crop in Nebraska ap - proximates five million head and that the average fall pig crop is almost one million head. With a fall pig crop in 1936 of less than 600,000 head and less than a 50 per cent spring pig crop for 1937, it does not take a very sharp pencil to tell the story that Nebraska is under normal in pig production and that some unconventional prac - tices must be followed in the pig pen as well as the cattle feed lot. </seg>
         <seg id="p601">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The unusual feature about the lamb situation this year is the relatively large number on feed east of the Mississippi river. We have in the Scotts Bluff Valley of Nebraska about two-thirds what we had a year ago. Other valleys in the west are light, however, an unusually large number of western lambs were shipped to areas throughout the eastern part of the corn belt and to the extreme eastern borders of the nation. These lambs are on feed and will be marketed during the early winter. Lamb feeders in eastern Nebraska are operating light. They too, like the cattlemen are using ensilage. One large commercial, lamb feeder in central western Nebraska has upwards of 15,000 tons of ensilage. Many lamb feeders are using molasses as part of the concentrated ration. It would seem as though they could fatten lambs to a fair finish with a comparatively small amount of corn. Maybe the lamb will be better able to use the feeds which we have available this year than the pig. The pig is adapted to the use of concentrated products. He can use only a limited amount of alfalfa hay. Ensilage and corn stover have no value to him other than as a playground. ¦ .-. i- ¦'-.'.'¦ . . • The people of Nebraska realize the importance of livestock. I pre - dict that. following this year of unconventional feeding we will be back Ir. the livestock business on a normal basis and ready to practice methods which will be recognized as characteristic of those usually followed in producing top animals for the great markets of the nation. THE 1037 FOOD SUPPLY AND PRICE TRENDS LEONA S.DAVIS, Agricultural College Food has always been man's first and chief concern. The entire nation is concerned when something happens which affects its food supply. This "something" happened this past summer and now we are seeing the effects of the drought on the food supplies and prices. In our own state, our homemakers are faced with a food situation far different than normal. Ordinarily the Nebraska farm produces at least half to one-third of the total family food supply, but the per - centage of home produced foods has been greatly reduced this year. Homemakers find that they face this situation. They are forced to buy more food than usual at a time when the family income has been reduced materially and.furthermore they pay higher prices than usual for what they have to buy. Recently Secretary Wallace warned that food prlceß may climb 10% early this year as the result of the past year's drought. He re - called that after the 1934 drought "retail food prices as a whole aver- </seg>

Now for the products which affect meat prices more directly. Salmon. Output of Alaska salmon for 1936 exceeded the pack of any previous year. It was estimated at the end ot the canning season to be 8,234,000 standard cases of 48 one-pound cans. The total domestic output should considerably exceed that of any previous year's sup - plies. Other fish products such as sardines, mackerel, frozen fish and tuna fish have on the whole increased in supply and consumption. Foiiltiy. The heavy marketing of poultry during the late summer and fall is reflected in the stocks of poultry in storage. On October 1,. .82,076,000 pounds in storage as compared with 37,720,000 year ago. This was a new high record for poultry storage. This heavy marketing has brought about more than usual seasonal price declines. Some rise in poultry prices is expected later in 1937 when stored sup - plies have become less. '-Larger poultry marketings are due to feed situation and an unusually large hatch in spring of 1936. Probably marketings will be less in 1937 as spring hatch is expected to be less. More turkeys than usual were produced in 1936 with an all time high of 20 million birds. This beats the production records by 1 million birds. Consumers in general are better able to pay for poultry than last year so demand is expected to be good. Turkeys have gone to market at lighter weights than is usual due to demand for small turkeys to flit into small roasting pans and oven and to feed storage and high costs of feeds. In regard to beef supplies, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics predict fewer cattle on farms at this time than a year ago. But there are enough cattle to supply a larger inspected slaughter of cattle and calves than the ten-year average. . With fewer hogs for slaughter in prospect for the next two years, it is expected that the cattle produced will be in. a rather favored position even though supplies of slaughtered Cattle and calves are large. It is expected that the total slaughter of cattle and calves this present year will be smaller. In: regard to lambs, the number that will be marketed from now to April depends upon the number already on feed. The supply of feeder lambs was larger this year than last; A large part of this increase was in Texas. With feed conditions unusually good there and with present prices of wool, many of these lambs may be kept over for shearing next spring and sold as grass-fat yearlings. </seg>
         <seg id="p604">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE As far as meat prices are concerned it is expected that during the first half of 1937, prices will be about the same as during the first half of 1936. However, toward the end of the year when stored supplies are not as great, prices will be higher. Consumer demand for beef and veal has considerably Improved during the past three years and it is ex - pected that this demand will increase due to increased buying power of consumers and the smaller supplies of available pork. It Is significant to note that as income rises and more cash becomes available for food, usually more meat Is purchased, meat is served more frequently and higher priced cuts are purchased more often. Conditions in general Indicate that prices for beef of all kinds will average higher in 1937 than in 1936. The reduction in available meat supplies will be greatest in pork and the better grades of beef. The general level of prices for meats is expected to be higher in 1937 than for 1936 and higher than since 1930. This will be due to a reduction in meat supplies due to 1936 drought and to expected In - crease in consumer demand. This increase in demand is anticipated because of expected Increase in industrial activity, more employment and larger payrolls. WHAT IS GOOD MEAT? W. J. LOEFFEL, Agricultural College Wm. J. Loeffel—Every year the University of Nebraska has a men's meat Judging team. This team competed at the American Royal Live - stock Show at Kansas City against other college teams and in this contest were first. At the International Stock Show at Chicago, the boys placed fourth. Presenting this team to you we have Chester Walters, Grant; Norman Weltkamp, Nickerson; Earl Hedlund, Chap - pell; and Clyde White, Tecumseh. I will turn the meeting over to these boys who will discuss the topic "What is Good Meat". Chester Walters—ln judging meat three points are given major consideration—(l. Shape and conformation, (_) finish or covering, and (3) quality. We have decided among ourselves to each discuss one of these phases. Shape and Conformation Animals vary considerably in this respect; compare our Texas Long - horn with the lowset, block beef animals of today. Also, we find con - siderable variation in the amount of lean or red meat. Some animals are naturally thicker-fleshed and heavier-muscled. In meat judging, therefore, we give preference to the carcass showing the deep, plump round and the thickly-fleshed rib and loin. </seg>
         <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Norman Weitkamp—Finish or Covering Discussing the topic of finish we find that fat is necessary for quality meat]. A certain amount is very desirable although excessive fat or wastiness is objectionable. In meat judging bur chief difficulty comes in determining at just what point this fat ceases to be a virtue and becomes a waste. From observations we find that considerable variation exists in. this point with regard to various sections of the country. We give preference, however, to a cut of meat or carcass which Is. relatively thickly covered. This covering must be uniformly dis - tributed and firm, with a creamy white color. Marbling in beef and mixture of fat and lean, both indications of finish, will be discussed under the point of quality. Clyde White—Quality Quality is the most intangible of all the points considered in judging. Under quality we will consider the following details: (a) Marbling Is without a doubt one of the best indexes of quality. By marbling we mean the mixing ot the tat in the lean. This generally assures the purchaser of tenderness, juiciness and flavor. The marbling should be finely divided, coarse flashes of fat being undesirable, in other, words it should present a snow storm effect. The meat from young animals such as yearling cattle and lambs show relatively little marbling. In pork we do not speak .of marbling, but rather mixture of fat with lean. •. ¦ | (2) Texture indicates the size of the muscle bundles. On looking at a cross section of the cut of meat/across the light or T&gt;y gently rub - bing the finger across the lean, one gets a reaction of the fineness ot this muscle structure. Some cuts of meat feel similar to that of draw - ing your finger oyer a piece of velvet; others of stroking a Turkish towel: Within every carcass there are fine-grained muscles and also coarse-grained muscles, therefore comparisons should be made only between the same muscles. (3) Firmness is exceedingly Important in judging pork. Any tendency toward softness Is a severe fault. In beef and lamb, firmness is also desirable, although not to as marked a degree. (4) Youth. It is well recognized that as an animal Increases in age the muscles become less tender. We, therefore, like youth in a cut of meat because It gives us a general assurance of tenderness. Youth is Indicated by the softness, redness and porosity of the bones. The chine bones, that is, those which constitute the split backbone, are usually used as a guide. In young animals a button or cartilage will be found in the upper top of the feather or chine bone. As the animal matures this cartilage turns to bone and the bone itself becomes </seg>
         <seg id="p606">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE hard, white, and flinty. In beef and lamb cuts the inside Of the ribs may be used as an indication of youth. In young animals they are red due to their rich supply of blood. (5) The color of lean is an Important factor in determining com - mercial value. Beef and lamb should be a bright cherry red. Dark lean 13 very objectionable. In many cases certain muscles or portions of muscles are dark whereas others are bright. In veal and pork we look for a bright pink color. (Gi Color of fat. Creamy white fat is desired. Objection is raised to a yellowish cast which indicates dairy breeding. Occasionally we find a condition which is known as fiery. This is due to blood being left in the tissues as a result of slaughtering an animal while it is excited or overheated. Wm. J. Loeffel—ln addition to the men's team, the College of Agri - culture was represented this year by a girls' meats judging team. This team competed in the contest at Wichita. Kansas In which they placed third. The girls who competed were Lillian Rohwer, Ainsworth; Bonnie Spaniard. Omaha: and Margaret Deeds. Lincoln. THi; (JO \|, |\ n.oi.i ( i\(; &#132;H rhxra __EKF I- O. BAKU. South Omaha Introductory remarks. This subject. "Th- Goal in Producing 4-H Club Beef," in some respects is a difficult subject on whi-h ,„ talk, because it is. to say the least, extremely indelinite and capable of a great variety of interpreta - tions. However, i, is made less difficult by the knowledge that it is a subject in which we are both interested, yon as producers of beef probably fathers and mothers of 4-H Club members, and we as the processors of beef which you produce. It is with that in mind that I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter which is of common interest to us. My time will have been well spent if I succeed in some small measure in clarifying „,„• problems and attitudes concerning this work and thus lead indirectly to an improvement in its scope and value. To begin with, I do not believe that the important goal of 4-H Club beef production is for the young feeder to wind up a contest year with more silver jingling in „is pockets than he had when the contest year began. Making a profit is important, of course, because profitable operation is as necessary to the success of his small business as it is to the success of any other business enterprise. But it would be absurd </seg>
         <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION to stress profit to the boy and neglect to give him that knowledge of and skill at his business, which, after all, are the first essentials in any plan to ensnare that almighty dollar. It is understood that he must know the business well before he can expect to realize a regular profit on his feeding operation.. This thinking then leads me to the conclusion that the most im - portant goal of 4-H Club beef production is to make each and every feeding project a working laboratory in which to lay the foundations for sound business thinking and sound agricultural practices. I firmly believe that every feeding project offers ample opportunity to lay these foundation's, broad though they may be. Let me illustrate: To start with the beginning of the project, a boy can be taught the elementary principles of feeder cattle buying; such as, what breed is the most suitable for his feed and his conditions, what size and type of animal makes the best feeder, what feeder cattle are worth, and many other so-called "tricks of the trade" which you yourself have no doubt learned through past experience. After the calf has been placed on feed, the boy can be introduced to the subject of balanced rations, and taught how to produce or buy, mix; and feed these rations for the best results at the lowest cost. At the same time, he can be taught the proper method of handling and tending beef cattle, both In the feeding quarters and in the showroom. When the contest is finished,, there yet remains the job of market - ing the animal so that he will return to the feeder the highest value per pound. This, too, involves no small amount of skill and ability. The choice of markets, commission firms, the day on which to market, and niany other points are of real value to the feeder in marketing his livestock. All this and more can be taught the young feeder In his project laboratory. But his education does not end there by any means. During all this tine, a number of sidelights have been picked up; such as, proper record keeping and accounting for cost of the animal feed, etc., asso - ciation with, other farm boys and farm leaders, and attendance at group meetings where matters pertaining to farm life and farm prob - lems are thrashed out. All of this has contributed very directly toward making the young feeder a more skilled farmer, a more accurate thinker, and a better all around man. Let me emphasize again this point that education and not an immediate profit is the primary goal of these projects. If there has ever been a day in American, history when farming was'so remote from science, industry, and national affairs/that farmers could till their </seg>
         <seg id="p608">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lands and feed their livestock in a hit-or-miss, hap-hazard fashion, that certainly is not the case today. Farming today has taken its place in the ranks of the great social and economic forces of our time. The maintenance of this position is essential to agricultural prosperity. But it cannot be maintained unless the farm youth of today are so trained in their chosen profession that they can cope with and solve the problems which they will face as the farmers of tomorrow. This training can only result from a thorough education in this business of farming. Where is there a better place to teach the practical end of that education than in these 4-H Club beef production projects? As I have previously indicated, the more tangible goal toward which 4-H Club beef production should point is, of course, a profit on opera - tions. Beef production without profit is pointless to the producer who has spent his time and energy on the project. I believe this will naturally follow if we lay the proper foundation. The young feeder who is taught to buy closely, feed well, and sell dearly will usually find a profit awaiting him at the end of his feeding operations. There is another goal, one that is perhaps seldom mentioned, to - ward which 4-H Club beef production should be directed. That goal is the production of a superior grade of meat which will satisfy the critical demands of the American consumer. Doubtless you realize that the meat which you produce is in constant competition with other food products, such as fruits, vegetables, and cereals. The de - mand for meat is largely built up from its eye and taste appeal as com - pared with that of these other food products. If the meat product is of poor quality, the demand is low, and the consumer turns toward more attractive and palatable foods, resulting in a diminished market for the American beef producer. It is true, ot course, that the con - suming public will always use a certain amount of meat. But it is to the interest of producers that they consume a great deal more than is actually necessary to meet their minimum requirements. The consumer will always buy a certain amount of meat, a certain amount of fruit, and a certain amount of vegetables. But these minimum amounts do not represent all that is spent for food. There is a sizable part of your food bill left which is used to buy any particular product which happens to make the best appeal. Beef producers should strive to obtain a good share of this extra food money by producing a product which will be second to none in its appeal to the customer. This means better beef. However, one point which I wish to emphasize firmly is that quality beef production, desirable though it is, must never supersede profitable beef production. By quality beef Ido not necessarily mean the best which can possibly be produced, but rather the best which </seg>
         <seg id="p609">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION can bd produced at a profit. Beet producers who strive to produce the best possible product which can be produced at a profit will ac - complish the dual result of making a profit on present operations and stimulating a market for the product of future operations, i In suming up the views which I have tried to present to you this afternoon, I would say that the goal of 4-H Club beef production is to make each project a laboratory in which to teach those skills and ideas which jwork for the advancement of this particular branch of the farm - ing industry as well as the industry as a whole. If we set this up as a goal and follow a course leading to it, the results will be better farm - ing, better feeding, and a profit for both the individual and the farm population in general. . . MEAT IN THE DIET TO REDUCE OR GAIN DR. REBEKAH GIBBONS, Agricultural College .: The meat producers who are in a favored position since their product deserves a place in the diet whether the dietee is on the way up or on the way down will be interested in a dietetic experiment car - ried on at Rush Medical College in Chicago by Dr. Leo Campbell in which, reducing diets were built around meat. There have not been similar experiments reported recently in which meat was used in the - gaining diet, but it has just as valuable place here also. The type of meat used in the two diets is quite different. Lean meat without any visible fat is suitable for this diet. Lean beef, veal, lamb and most special organs come in this class. Pork is not allowable, since it contains too much fat within the lean portions. There are three reasons for the great advantage of meat in the reducing diet. First, its psychological value, since the patient does not feel that he is practically fasting when he has a generous serving of meat as part of the meal and his diet includes from three-fourths to one pound of meat per day. Second, what the scientist calls the satiety value, —meat sticks to the ribs, and third, a peculiar stimulating effect on metabolism characteristic of any protein food which instead of allowing fat to be stored burns it up. The foods which should be used with the meat are those high in water and cellulose both of which have no fattening qualities whatever. This means a very generous amount of succulent vegetables and juicy fruits. For the gaining diet the fat meats should be used, —pork, fat beef and lamb and the fat cuts of veal. The visible fat contained on the meat should be eaten and not left on the plate. Bacon and sausage are particularly valuable and if they are cooked in some way so that 20 : ¦ ¦ ¦¦¦•'•.¦¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p610">RKl'i IUT i IF NEBRASKA STATU 11. I.VRD OF AGRICULTURE the fat is all used, of course they are particularly advantageous. With these fatter meats should be taken those foods which are usually con - sidered the heavier foods. Other foods rich in fat and those containing generous amounts of starch or sugar. Too much of the capacity of the stomach should not be devoted to watery soups and succulent vegetables unless these latter are well fortified with a satisfactory dressing. I shall then show the comparative fuel value of lard or a large strip of bacon and a list of low calorie vegetables, and conclude with the statement that what seems ridiculous, namely that meat has an im - portant place in the diet either to reduce or to gain is an established scientific fact, since meat and meat products form such a versatile group of foods. lij, SF.W METHODS ()!•' MEAT STORAGE AM) M]lv_ CUTTING K. F. WARNER. _. S. D. A. Washington.! .. C. The rapid increase iti the utilization of freezer storage by farmers to preserve home-grown food supplies has developed a demand for knowledge which is of such importance that it has been given a place on this program. The expansion of the use of cold storage by farmers has proceeded through the winter harvesting of natural ice. the purchase of manu - factured ice, the use of mechanical refrigerators, and finally the rent - ing of commercial refrigerated space for curing meat or the temporary holding of other foods, funently, is the nationwide development of the so-called "freezer lockers" where foods are frozen and held for periods of several months or even longer than a year. Certain com - panies have now built experimental household refrigerators with freezer storage for from 200 to .100 pounds of meat. , New Type of Middleman These changes are but natural steps in the progressive task of bring - ing controlled temperatures to our rural population. Convenience and the desire for better things have played a part in this development but a more potent influence has been an economic one. Top market prices for many perishables have been possible only where goods wove handled properly at point of origin. As a result many producers now have cold-storage facilities in their own towns for handling eggs, milk, butter, fruits, vegetables and meats. The widespread distribution of electric power, new developments of mechanical equipment, and im - proved cold-storage service have made the local use of these controlled temperatures by farmers not only possible but economical. The im- ! mediate problem is to supply the information that will make it possible , ! r </seg>
         <seg id="p611">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION - ' ! ¦ for this new type, of middleman, the sellers of low temperatures, to give the results that the eager buyers of that service need. Freezer Lockers Widespread The so-called "freezer lockers" have been built by the scores in the Pacific Northwest States. Numerous others are appearing In the mid - west, the South and other sections. That number has reached over 1,500 west of the Mississippi river and is rapidly increasing; The oldest commercial venture of this character was reported about ten years ago,, but most of this new development has occurred within the last five years or even later. Batteries of lockers about 2 by 2 by 3 feet are provided in sub - freezing temperatures and rented on a yearly basis to individuals. FromJso to 2,000 families in the respective communities have availed themselves of this service to store their food supplies. Patrons are from among both town and country residents. In one small town in IjVashington state all but two families are using these lockers. Meats, poultry, game, fruits, vegetables and butter are the principal products frozen. Ice cream and water for making ice are often included. Some plants have separate facilities for freezing fish. .1 ¦! "¦,- '¦ ¦";. .•'.:•-.¦¦-¦- All sizes of lockers, all kinds of service, many levels of temperature,, all grades of product and all methods of preparing and packaging the products are in evidence. This lack of uniformity in proceedure con - trasts; with the almost unanimous approval Indicated by the renters of the lockers and by the capacity business that most plants are doing at a rental charge averaging from $7.00 to $10.00 a year. Numerous families now preserve but little food by canning, particularly non - acld products such as beans, peas and meats. Effects of Freezing The preserving effects of subfreezing temperatures include (1) the killing or stopping of the development of molds, yeasts and bacteria; (2) the inactivation of the enzymes, thus delaying autolysis or self digestion and (3) the retarding of chemical changes such as dehydra - tion and oxidation. Although there Is little microbial action under com - mercial freezer storage, the development of undesirable textures, colors, odors and flavors is common. These changes are attributed to con - tinuing enzymetic action, evaporation of the surface ice, etc. More information is needed as to the most valuable conditions and methods for handling the various food products. However, the following pro - ceedures are reported to give the best results. ¦"-.¦¦'¦ Zero degree F is generally accepted as the preferred temperature for the "sharp" freezing and storage of foods. This should not be confused with the sub-zero temperatures used in "quick" freezing.. </seg>
         <seg id="p612">REP. .RT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Although zero is the recommended level for sharp freezing, 10 or 12 degrees is often used and will probably be satisfactory if the lower one is not practical. Eighteen or 20 degrees Is often used but Is prob - ably too high. There seems to be a temperature level around 15 degrees above which results are often unsatisfactory. Much variation in temperature is considered undesirable. A relative humidity around So per cent is generally recommended. Preparation of Products Meat should be chilled and cut into family size pieces before being frozen. Beef and lamb will be improved if hung or aged at temperatures between 33 degrees and 88 degrees for about a week before being cut and frozen, as they may not ripen sufficiently while held at the lower freezer temperatures. All cuts should be well wrapped in tough moisture-proof parchment paper, preferably before freezing. Cheap oiled paper or ordinary wrap - ping paper will not prevent undesirable drying. The wrapped fresh meat should be spread so that it will freeze quickly. When the pack - ages of fresh chilled meat are piled together in the locker it is often several days before the center of the pack reaches the desirable temperature. Some spoilage and some off flavors have been reported when the meat was piled to freeze. Well-fattened beef and lamb appear to stand freezer storage better than the thinner meat. Fresh pork, under the present methods of wrapping, does not give the satisfaction obtained, from heef and lamb when stored for several months. Smoked pork is often frozen to pre - vent mold and infestation by Insects. The freezing of this product is often unnecessary but many do it and report favorably. Sausage is usually ground and frozen without seasoning. The fresh, aromatic spices are added after thawing. Thawing the frozen cuts In a household refrigerator is practical wherever such equipment Is available. Otherwise prompt cooking of the thawed product is considered essential. The managers of some freezer lockers hire a custom butcher who solicits business and goes out and dresses animals on the farm, bringing the meat back to the plant to chill. All the plants observed will cut and wrap the meat for a charge averaging about 1 % cents per pound. One cooperative plant in Oregon charges only % cent. Almost all the plants purchase dressed carcasses and will wholesale quarters or entire carcasses to customers. This is particularly true when a large number of the patrons live in town. </seg>
         <seg id="p613">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Community Organizations Many freezer-lockers establishments operate retail meat or meat and grocery stores in addition to their storage business. In fact many re - tail neat dealers In small or even middle-sized towns have pioneered the locker business to add that trade to the reduced volume going over the retail counter. Community organizations have often started co - operative lockers or helped the local cold storage plant or meat dealer finance his new installation. Inspection of the meat handled through these freezer lockers or of the manner in which they are constructed and operated is largely absent. Already, however, there is a definite talk about inspection. The community effort to dress, cut and use locally grown meat would seem to make practical some sort of community inspection service. Eventually the day will arrive .when freezers have advanced ln numbers to such a point where inspection can be made available at a moderate cost... - Methods of preparing, packaging and freezing fruits and vegetables has been worked out by the Frozen Pack Laboratory of the Federal Bureau of Chemistry and Soils and those recommendations can be ob - tained through that Bureau. DISCUSSION W. W. DERRICK, Agricultural College It was over in lowa that I first came in contact with a freezer locker. This-particular one was an old ice house. The owner went out and helped slaughter the farmer's anmials, bringing back the carcass which he cut into pieces of convenient size and packed for freezing. The farmers' comments on the locker were that it was a "great thing" for it enabled them to have fresh meat the entire year at a, greatly reduced cost. Ordinarily these tanners came into the locker and took out a small supply of meat which could be handled without danger of spoilage. Just recently we sent out a questionnaire in this state regarding the freezer locker. There were fifty reported which must have grown up practically "overnight". . *- Meat packed in freezer lockers is preferably wrapped in heavy wax or oiled paper to eliminate evaporation. It is also well to separate each cut with paper and eliminate freezing together. Wrap the meat in small packages and write the name of that cut on the wrapper so it can be easily identified, such as steak, roast, boll, etc. Since it is </seg>
         <seg id="p614">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE necessary to pay rent on the locker, it is economical to arrange the - bundles of meat in such a way that a maximum amount can be placed in a minimum of space. Also arrange in such a way that it will be convenient to find the roasts, chops, steaks or whatever it might be. In the heavier cuts, It is well to arrange and cut into sizes suitable for various occasions. With these big cuts, it is advisable to remove the bone in order to conserve space. The freezer locker offers many opportunities and also difficulties. The country roads seem to be the biggest detrimental factor for farmers You would be surprised though, how far people will come to avail themselves of this service,—upward to twelve miles in many cases. Questions: At what temperature is it advisable to chill the meat before cutting? A. The meat should be chilled at a temperature ranging from 36° to 40° F. Q. Should meat be wrapped before or after freezing? A. It is possible to wrap the meat much tighter before freezing and thus conserve valuable space. Q. Can locker space be rented by the month? A. The usual rate is $7 to $9 per year, however in many cases it is possible to rent on a monthly basis although the charge may be slightly higher. THE KELATIOX OF CLIMATE TO AGRICULTURE—IS OUR CLIMATE CHANGING? DR. J. B. KINCER Before the Joint Meeting of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association and the Nebraska Live stock Breeders and Feeders Association January 6, 1937 Yesterday we described in a rather general way the work that the Weather Bureau does in collecting weather observations from about 5000 different points in the United States. Today we are going to try to illustrate to you just what those records show in the matter of our climate. </seg>
         <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION We have.in Washington nearly 100 million weather reports from practically every county in the United States. The summarization and study of those records bring out certain facts about our climate that at this time are peculiarly applicable. . We know that In the last few years we have had several severe drouths. We have had very warmer winters, until last year, for a very long time. Just briefly, these records show that for the past 25 years there has been a general decline, a falling off In precipitation. It was not serious until lately, and the rising temperature is not peculiar to Nebraska or the Great Plains states, or the United States, but is world - wide. ' Little is known of the agriculture of prehistoric man, but in that part of the world supposed to have been the cradle of the. race, rainfall is today insufficient for successful agriculture under natural conditions. However, from the ruins Of irrigation canals, to supplement the mois - ture supplied directly by nature, it appears that the dependence of crops upon rainfall was recognized at the very dawn of history. As early as 3000 B.'¦&lt;_., If not earlier, man was a tiller of the soil and garnered a harvest; and from that remote date up to the Eighteenth Century the history of agriculture and the weather is contemporary with that of ¦civilization itself. Because of restrictions imposed by topography, soil fertility, and climate, food production under natural conditions is limited to a rela - tively small part of the earth's surface. Of these inhibiting factors, climate Is the most Important, for without.favorable weather a fertile _oil would be valueless for agricultural purposes under natural condi - tions. Of the fundamental climatic elements, temperature and rain - fall are basic. Where rainfall is sufficient, temperature, with its work - ing partner, the length of the growing season, determines the climatic suitability of a'region for growth of crops having different thermal requirements, such as wheat as opposed to tropical plants. Precipita - tion, either directly or indirectly through irrigation, has a much broader sphere of influence for it determines the natural suitability of the land for the growth of any and all crops.' The amount of precipitation required for successful farming varies greatly, depending, among other things, on its seasonal distribution and intensity, the moisture.requirement of the crop to be grown, and the rate of evaporation and transpiration, influenced largely by temperature, relative humidity and wind. However, in a very broad way, in relation to the earth in general, we may set up three divisions showing marked correlations between rainfall and natural vegetation. First, the desert, where the normal annual rainfall is less than 10 inches; second, pri - marily grasslands where it ranges from 10 to 20 inches; and third, </seg>
         <seg id="p616">616 REPORT OF XEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE indigenous forest where more than 20 inches occur. Within this last division most of the cereal-producing lands are found with the annual rainfall ranging from around 20 to about 40 inches.

         <seg id="p617">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Drought has been the persistent enemy of mankind down through the ages; he has had to reckon with it since the dawn of civilization. The question of periodic deficiencies in rainfall is referred to in the Bible where we are told of years of plenty followed hy successive years of famine because of aridity. This Is the first historical reference to an important characteristic of rainfall—the tendency for a number of successive years to have comparatively heavy rains, followed by a series of harmfully dry years, especially pronounced in regions with normally scanty moisture. While some 40 per cent of the area of the United States receives normally less than 20 inches of rainfall, our country, with regard to moisture, is very fortunate in comparison with many other lands. However, in the western half there are large areas which, because of insufficient moisture, are unsuited for crop growth, unless irrigated, and in these regions the matter of drought is especially important. ¦ j :¦•:,-' '" ' • ¦ • Smoothed weather records: show long-time trends in both tempera - ture and precipitation, covering a good many years, alternatively above and below normal. As a background for considering the recent marked tendency to abnormally high temperatures and deficient rainfall in the United States, it may be helpful to consider briefly some general climatic trends that have been in evidence for a good many years. During the present century, in most parts of the world, weather and climatic records show a decided trending to warmer and dryer. Droughts in the United States. Droughts in the United States may be divided into two general classes. In one class are those of a transi - tory nature, affecting usually a relatively small area and of compara - tively short duration, frequently lasting only a single year; in the other those general droughty conditions that have a tendency to persist for comparatively long periods. When a minimum phase of precipita - tion obtains, such as is now being experienced, there occur at short in - tervals what may be called families of droughts, in contradistinction to a transitory, or short period, ones that fall in the first group. Short - period droughts, in general, are characteristic in sections having com - paratively heavy rainfall, such as east of the Mississippi river, and long - period droughts in areas of relatively light precipitation. Prior to the minimum phase of precipitation responsible for the present family of droughts, so to speak, the last general condition of tHs kind occurred In the latter part of the 80's and the early 90's of the last century. At that time,.following a series of years with rather abundant rainfall, widespread scanty moisture began in 1886, and, while inter - rupted in 1892 by fairly'abundant moisture, there was a marked tendency generally for subnormal rainfall from 1886 up to 1895, cul - minating in severe droughts in 1894 and 1895, the driest years ot that </seg>
         <seg id="p618">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE minimum phase. Following this there was a series of years with rain - fall ranging generally above normal. In the period between the 1886-95 extensive drought and that be - ginning about 1930, there were several belonging to the transitory class —Ishort-lived and often affecting seriously only comparatively small areas). Among these may be mentioned that of 1901 in the interior valleys and the Southwest. The following year, 1902, had plenty of moisture in most states. Another transitory drought oc - curred in 1910, principally in the Central and Northern States and the South, but this again was largely a one-year affair. Another in 1917 affected mostly the .-Southwest and northern plains, and still another, in 19 25. was severe in the south and southeast. Thus, for some 60 years up to 1930, there were a number of short-period droughts, but only one persistent and markedly dry phase of the United States climate, that of IBSB-1N95. lasting, in general, about 10 years. Some years, of course, were better than others. The present dry phase begun in 1930 and has continued, with a few iuterspersions of fairly good years, such as 19.'!5, up to the present time. There have been in ibis period three extremely dry years— 1930, 1934, and 1936. The few available precipitation records, covering 100 years or more, indicate that a general dry phase, somewhat comparable to that of 1886-95. and the more recent one of 1930 to date, obtained in the 30's of the last century, or approximately 100 years ago. The outstanding wet phase of the United States climate in the last century was from about 1565 to ISBS, with a secondary maximum of precipitatioii during the first two decades of the present century, though several transitory droughts were interspersed. All of the fore - going statements refer specifically to that part of the country east of the Rocky Mountains. With this general summary, we shall now examine some slides which graphically illustrate the things we have mentioned. i Slides shown here). I would like to call your attention to what happened before and after the droughts of ISS6 and 1934. The whole western country had good heavy rains before the drought of 1886. Then came the dry period and immediately afterward, there were heavy rains again. The same was true in 1934. Just before the drought period, rainfall was above normal and just after this period, rain was abundant again. Taking the United States as a whole, since 1909 precipitation has been going steadily downward. It was above normal before that time. </seg>
         <seg id="p619">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Temperatures started to go up at the same time precipitation started down. What can man do to make It rain? What has he done to bring about the present conditions? Build ponds, etc. to get more moisture in the atmosphere? In answer to these questions, I would like to relate a couple of stories. One is about an engineer in South Africa who decided to build a reservoir in an effort to get more moisture in the atmosphere, making that -whole desert land humid. Now, the Atlantic ocean extends right down to Africa and the rainfall right along the coast Is but one Inch a year on the average. According to this, a; little pond, containing about 25,000 square miles of water, certainly would not do much to - ward naking it rain. Ar other illustration is that of a little English island in the Mid- Pacific ocean which is four miles wide and about five miles long with 1000 hiiles of water around it. This island maintained a splendid weathbr record for more than 25 years. The records of the moisture, humidity, temperature, etc. were all splendid. The average rainfall on this Island is 26 inches a year. The heaviest rain they have had was 9 .inches in the lightest was three Inches. In one year, on this island there was only three inches of rainfall, yet for 1000 miles, warm water evaporates all around. HOW I PLAN MY PASTURES By LAWRENCE QUANTE Given Before Joint Session of Nebraska Crop Growers Association and Nebraska Livestock Breeders and Feeders Association January 6, 1937 1980 Practices I. Objective. .-..'.'..-' A. To Provide a year-around pasture. 11. Type of pasture. :. A. Permanent pasture, two fields, seeded to replace blue grass killed by drouth. Field I—Brome, orchard, blue and rye grass seeded in fall of 1935 In an Old alfalfa field. Pastured lightly in 1936. Per - mitted to seed heavily. Produced a good late fall pasture in ~ 1936. </seg>
         <seg id="p620">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Field 2—Mixture of brome, blue grass and alfalfa seeded in the fall of 1936. Good stand obtained. Used grasshopper bait. To be used for bay ln 1937, later to be used for pasture. B. Rotation pasture—3 fields. 1. No. 1 rye for early pasture (March 20th to May 15th) Summer fallowed June 15. 2. No. 2. Oats and first year sweet clover to fill in the gap between rye and sudan. Sweet clover killed by drouth and hoppers. Planted to wheat in fall. Pastured May 15 to June 25th. 3. No. 3. Sudan—ground plowed early to catch spring rains. Planted late in May. Pastured June 25th to October Ist. In spite of lack of rain (1.18 inch of rain from June 12th to August 20th in seven scattered showers) it provided an all summer pasture. 4. Sweet clover and alfalfa with V_ bushel wheat seeded September Ist on summer fallow in field No. 1. Good stand, used grasshopper bail. Pastured November Ito December 15th. 5. Field No. 2. Wheat for grain in 1937. Pastured November 1 to December 15. 6. Com stalks December Ist to date. H).'S7 Plans A. Permanent Pasture—Brome and alfalfa, brome seeded in 1935 in old alfalfa. B. Rotation Pasture—4 fields. 1. Wheat pastured early, then harvested for grain. 2. Wheat with second year sweet clover and alfalfa. 3. Oats and first year clover. 4. Sudan on corn stalk ground. 5. Fall seeded oats. 6. Wheat. 7. Corn stalks. Conclusions Moisture is the most important factor in pastures and since rain - fall cannot be controlled, It must be conserved. On the fields under dis - cussion there was no run-off except when the snow melted in March. The ground was frozen and quite a bit of moisture got away at that time. Plant drouth resistant plants such as alfalfa, sweet clover, and sudan. Plant them at a time when moisture conditions are'most favorable. Early plowing puts the ground in shape to hold the rain that falls. </seg>

CONSERVING SOIL WITH GRASS By DR. MILTON TP. JARNIGAN Before the Joint Meeting of Nebraska Crop Growers Association and the Nebraska Live Stock Breeders &amp; Feeders Association January 6, 1937 The soil is our greatest heritage and grass is its mantle of protection. As husbandmen of the earth its conservation is our most sacred trust. It is ours to use for a lifetime and then pass on to the next generation. When we reach the western horizon of our journey through life will we have the satisfaction of knowing that we treasured and safeguarded .Mother Earth so well that she is able to feed and clothe our children as well or better than she did us? If the answer to this question is in the affirmative,.no matter how much or little of this world's goods we have left behind, I believe that the keeper of eternal records will inscribe after our names: He was a good and faithful servant. A study of theßeconnaissance Erosion Survey of the United States made | by the Soil Conservation Service would indicate that in many cases we have been unworthy of the heritage and unfaithful to the trust. Erosion is a ruthless robber that comes like a thief in the night and takes .his toll unobserved. It is only within the last few years that we haye had any conception of what a vandal we have been harboring. According to the survey of the Soil Conservation Service the total area of the United States, exclusive of large cities and bodies of water, con - sists of 1,907,721,392 acres of land. Erosion conditions have not'been defined on nearly 145,000,000 acres, which is 7.6 % of all the land. A little more than 578,000,000 acres—or 30,3%f-the survey lists as land with little or no erosion. In this area less than 25% of the top - soil has been lost. But nearly 70% of the land is so badly impaired by both water and wind erosion that Its use for profitable crop production is questionable at average price levels for farm commodities. More than 857,000,000 acres—or 44.9%—0f the entire area are in various stagesjof destruction, ranging all the way from one-fourth of the top - soil lost to over three-fourths of the topsoil and some of the subsoil gone. Nearly 323,000,000 acres—or 16.9% of the land—is specifically listed as affected by wind erosion. This varies from moderate to severe erosion. More than. 9,000,000 acres have been completely destroyed by wind erosion. Gullying has been allowed to go on until at the present time more than 867,000,000 acres—or 45.4%—0f the entire surface of the United States shows the ravaging effects of this destructive agency. </seg>
         <seg id="p622">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The damage varies progressively from occasional gullies to areas in which the land Is completely destroyed. The Reconnaissance Survey shows a worse picture in Nebraska than for the United States as a whole. Of the 49.291.529 acres in the state only 11.644.617 or 23.6%— fall into the classification listed as showing little or no erosion. For the United States 30.3% of the land is so classified. That is to say, of every four acres in the enormous state ¦of Nebraska less than one has not been seriously affected, whereas, in the United States as a whole nearly one acre out of three shows little or no erosion damage. Nebraska has nearly 17.000,000—0r 34%—in which one-fourth to three-fourths of the topsoll has been lost On more than 3,000,000—0r 6.2%—a1l of the topsoil and some of the subsoil has been lost. More than 20,000,000 acres of land—or 41.1% - have been affected by wind erosion. Gullying in varying degrees has been reported on 16,485,000 acres —or 33.4%. More than 857,000,000 acres of land in the whole United States— or an area equivalent to seventeen states the size of Nebraska with a little left over—shows the effects of sheet erosion. In this enormous area the extent of erosion was all the way from more than one-fourth to over three-fourths of the topsoil and some of the subsoil lost. It is reasonable to assume that at least one-half of the amount—or an area equivalent to eight and one-half states the size of Nebraska—has been withdrawn from agriculture hy Nature as a rebuke to wasteful practices of man. Much attention has been directed in recent years to undesirable surplus of farm products. For one reason or another crops have been plowed under and livestock production curtailed. We all remember the plow-up campaign in cotton, the purchase of 8,000,000 head of cattle by the government and the agitation for birth control among swine. But unless something is done about the erosion situation Nature will take care of our surpluses by so reducing cultivatable land that, so far from producting a surplus of foodstuffs, we will not be able to raise a supply sufficient for our needs. In the light of Nebraska's ex - perience with droughts in the last few years, this eventuality is not beyond the bounds of possibility. I will attempt to make no specific recommendations for preventing and combatting soil erosion in your locality. These can more com - petently be given by your highly trained specialists with a knowledge of local conditions in the fields of agronomy, soil physics, agricultural engineering, livestock production, and farm management. </seg>
         <seg id="p623">i NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Erosion Under Georgia Conditions In July of 1933 a study of the losses of soil, moisture and plant food was undertaken on the College Farm of the University of Georgia on Cecil sandy clay loam with a 5% slope. The object of the experiment, was to find out the rate of these various losses under different land uses and the methods of soil management by which they could be minimized. The study was planned and executed by Professor W. O. Collins of the Soils Department of the Georgia College of Agriculture.. The following table presents losses of soil for the first three years: Pounds of Soil Lost Per Acre by Erosion Years required 1933-1934- 1935- 3 year to remove _^ ot ¦"--'.''.. 34 35 36 Total average 1 acre foot Woodland 115 5 298 418 139~"~2__? 7 Continuous ¦ : ':" ~ Cover Crop 1510 4675 2902 9057 3034 i &gt;32 4 Clean cultivated ~ ¦ : "~ ~~ ' 6 inches deep 14306 11914 4034 29254 10790 370 Clean cultivated ~~ '. ~~ 3 inches deep 15037 24889 9430 49356 18356 216 Exposed: Subsoil 112316 25809 17407 155532 54700 f 3 Fallow Land 159783 41834 16072 217689 73086 ~ 55 On the wooded area from; which most of the original hardwood forest had been removed but brush and grass completely covered the ground, the average yearly loss was only 139 pounds. New soil will form at a greater rate than this. It is agreed by students of the subject that a dense sod of permanent pasture will be as effectice in the preven - tion of soil erosion as the woodland cover. This Is of particular interest to the stockman or landowner in non-timber-growing areas. The next most protective land use consists of continuous cover crops On this Plat the annual loss was 3,034 pounds. The next most protective method was the practice of cultivating land to a depth of six inches every time ' it was dry enough between rains. Here the average annual loss was 10,790 pounds per acre. In the next plat the cultivation was made to a depth of three inches, and the annual loss was 18,536 pounds On the exposed subsoil area, or badly eroded land, the annual loss was 54,700 pounds. In the,last plat the soil was tilled to a depth of eight inches and left with a smooth surface. There was no protection by </seg>
         <seg id="p624">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cultivation or cover crops. Here there was the enormous average annual loss of 73,086 pounds per acre. The average weight of an acre of soil to a depth of one foot Is 4,00u.000 pounds. The last column in the table shows the number of years required to remove an acre of soil to a depth of one foot. With woodland cover or under dense permanent pasture sod it would take 28,777 years to remove this amount of soil. There is a gradual re - duction in the number of years required under the different land uses, down to the tilled land, which would require only 55 years, according to the data obtained in this research study. These results can be summed up in one sentence when we say that land plowed, and not cropped, lasts but the lifetime of a horse; land plowed, and cropped, lasts the lifetime of a man; land rotated and protected lasts the lifetime of a nation; and land in grass or forest cover is practically everlasting. The loss of nitrogen, potash, and phosphoric acid was in about the same ratio as the loss of soil. This is also true of the pounds of water lost per acre under the different methods of land use. On the wooded plat there was an annual run-off of 319,526 pounds per acre. On the fallow land there was the highest annual run-off of 4.987,885 pounds. On an average it requires about 500 pounds of water to produce one pound of dry matter in ordinary farm crops. The results of these experi - ments show that if all the water lost by surface run-off could be used by growing crops the annual yields would be increased from 639 pounds to 9,975 pounds. Instead of making two blades of grass grow where but one grew before, it would make fifteen and one-half blades of grass grow where but one grew before, this increased amount of grass would make fifteen gallons and two quarts of milk flow where but one "flew" formerly. Since man has been cultivating the soil, plant-food has been washed out twenty-one times faster than the plants have used It in the produc - tion of crops. Nature is trying to replace the plant food in the soil by the decomposing rocks and plant residue. These processes are exceedingly slow. It has been estimated that Nature requires 300 years to build an inch of topsoil. Man should cooperate with Nature by conserving it. Grass is the surest means of protecting land under cultivation from erosion. Grass Essential for Economical Livestock Production Manger feeding costs four times as much as pasture feeding. For the past seven years we have carried on pasture research demonstra - tions at the University of Georgia. As a result of this work lam con - vinced that by proper cultivation, fertilization, seeding and manage - ment, it is possible and practicable to double the pounds of beef or gallons of milk that can be produced from an acre of permanent pasture </seg>
         <seg id="p625">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ¦ ! ¦ ' - ' - ¦ in three years or less. The South Carolina Experiment Station proved that an acre of Improved Bermuda grass reinforced with Lespedeza would produce as much milk In the grazing season as four tons of alfalfa hay. Aside from economy, grass is a natural food for all classes of farm animals. It supplies protein, minerals, and.vitamins essential for growth. The sunlight and exercise incident to grazing promote the health of the animal. Sunlight is the greatest enemy of disease yet discovered by science. &lt; .]...'; From the standpoint of soil erosion, economy of production, and health of our farm animals, I am prepared to endorse every word of praise in the eulogy paid to this greatest of all plants by the late Senator JohhJ. Ingalla of Kansas: "Grass is the forgiveness of Nature—her constant benediction. Fields trampled with battle, saturated with blood, torn with the ruts of cannon, grow green again with grass and carnage Is forgotten. Streets abandoned by traffic become grass-grown like rural lanes, and are obliterated; forests decay, harvests perish, flowers vanish, but grass is Immortal. Beleagured by the sudden hosts of winter, it with - draws into the impregnable fortress of its-subterranean vitality and emerges upon the solicitation of Spring. Sown by the winds, by wander - ing birds, propagated by the subtle horticulture of the elements, which are its ministers and servants, it softens the rude outline of the world. Its tenacious fibers hold the earth in its place, and prevent its soluble components from washing into the sea. It invades the solitude of deserts, climbs the Inaccessible slopes and forbidding pinnacles of mountains, modifies climates, and determines the history, character and destiny of nations. Unobstruslve and patient, it has immortal vigor and aggression. Banished from thoroughfare or the field, it bides Its time to return, and when vigilance is relaxed, or the dynasty has perished, it silently resumes its throne, from which it has been expelled but which it never abdicates. It bears no blazonry of.bloom to charm the senses with fragrance or splendor, but its homely hue is more en - chanting than the Illy or the rose. It yields no fruit in earth or air, .and yet should its harvest fall for a single year famine would depopulate the world." POSSIBILITIES OF SHEEP Abstract of Talk by A. D. WEBER, Kansas State College, Manhattan, at Organized Agriculture Meeting, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska, January 6, 1937 Sheep have, a definite place in a long-time farm program. Only rarely, however, are farmers justified in depending upon sheep loi </seg>
         <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE their main source of income. In most instances combining sheep pro - duction with other farm enterprises Is less speculative than attempting to make some phase of the sheep business an exclusive specialty. Thus the average farmer should regard sheep as a dependable market for pasture, home-grown roughages and grain, not as a get-rlch-qulck proposition. Persons with adequate credit and capable of using exceptionally good judgment in purchasing feed and feeder lambs and selling fat lambs have found, and doubtless will continue to find, certain types of specialized lamb feeding profitable. This is a legitimate business, and occupies an important place in the livestock industry. Yet it is obvious that the specialized lamb feeder who buys lambs and feed and perhaps hires the feeding done, cannot hope to compete with a farmer who produces his own feed, feeds the lambs himself, and uses as much intelligence in his feeding operations as the specialized feeder. Some farmers do not use lamb feeding systems that are well-adapted to conditions peculiar to their own farms. Nothing is gained as a gen - eral rule by trying to get lambs on feed in the shortest possible time, and frequently a heavy death loss results when this is attempted. A better practice is to allow the lambs to clean up the aftermath in meadows and other fields, or to feed an almost exclusive roughage ration tor a few weeks. When the time arrives that the lambs must be fed in a dry-lot, they should he fed liberally on hay or other roughage and the grain slowly increased until about one pound per head daily is being fed. If the daily allowance of grain does not exceed one and one-fourth pounds, and if sound management practices are followed, it is un - likely that the death loss will exceed two per cent. Not infrequently a farmer attempts to handle more lambs than his financial status, feed supply, or equipment would seem to justify. It is much safer and more profitable in the end to grow into the sheep business than to go into it. I once knew a successful Nebraska lamb feeder who often admonished beginners not to feed so many lambs any one year that a heavy financial loss would make it impossible to finance a lamb feeding project the next year. If one remembers that admonition, and handles his lambs In a sane, practical manner, then lamb feeding offers excellent possibilities for a profitable, long-time farm program. Raising lambs from a farm flock also has possibilities in a long time farm program. Western ewes make excellent foundation stock, and in some instances aged ewes know as one-year breeders may be used to good advantage. One of the greatest possibilities of sheep in a long-time program, assuming that lambs will be fed as a sideline and not as the principal </seg>
         <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION farm enterprise, is a permanent farm flock. Instead of buying feeder lambs or aged western ewes each year, lambs are produced on the farm and replacements in the ewe flock are selected from the better ewe lambs. » Maximum success with a permanent farm flock depends upon (1) keeping enough ewes, twenty-five or more, to justify purchasing one or more thick, blocky, mutton-type rams, (2) steady improvement of the ewes by careful selection of purebred rams and ewe lambs for replace - ments, (3) breeding for early lambs (January to March) and select - ing early ewe lambs as replacement since the tendency to lamb early is inherited, (4) creep-feeding the lambs, and (5) feeding and man - aging the entire flock, ewes, rams, and lambs, In such a manner that all of the lambs may be marketed before June 1. ¦ REHABILITATION OF THE SWINE INDUSTRY J. C. PRICE Organized Agriculture, January 6, 1937 In thei. brief time allotted each speaker on this program, It no doubt should be the mission of every one honored with a part In this meeting, to contribute from their observations and experience, such conclusions as may, in their opinion, contribute to the well being of all engaged in the business of agriculture, which in the main, Is the reason for our being here. It is my thought that whatever may in some measure contribute to the successful rehabilitation of the swine Industry, or rather its pre - servation, will be of benefit to everyone in Nebraska and will be re - flected to greater or lesser degree throughout the nation. V In some manner, all of our efforts along every line are closely related to the working of the age old rule or law of supply and demand. Workmen try to supply well or Indifferently as the case may be, their efforts or a service of importance. In return they expect such reward as demand for such service is willing to give. The inventor pioneers new fieldsj to supply something for which there is a demand, or if it happens that his Invention is previous to the need,.to create a demand for it. Things of this sort often change the life stream of communities and even commonwealths and nations. Recently, we have experienced something of the effort of well mean - ing peoples or rather groups and individuals tb attempt to adjust the supply of agricultural products to the probable demand. Their efforts were j much emphasized by reason of widespread and rather unusual weather conditions. In the subject allotted tp me, we have in mind chiefly the shortening of the supply of swine! to meet home demand </seg>
         <seg id="p628">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of the nation. Supplies have been greatly curtailed, partly by the efforts of governmental agencies, the general thought of the farming folk and in much greater degree by droughts and lack of harvests of grains and grasses—pork making feeds. In Nebraska, we experienced a short corn crop in 1931. Prices of grains rose a little and a rather large supply of hogs made feeding of nearly every character unprofitable. A large crop of corn was grown throughout the nation in 1932, but with continually falling market for pork, the prices went ruinously low. A fair grain crop was produced In 1933, but for the most part hog prices were yet unprofitable although the supplies were cut deeply. Then came the drought of 1934 and a greatly reduced number of hogs followed by a short crop of both hogs and grain of 1935, only to be followed by the disastrous year of 1936, which has permitted in many instances, only the nucleous of the former breeding herds of both purebred and commercial swine. These events are not being reviewed here because they are un - known, but because they are well known and need to be remembered if they are to have any value to all of us as a guide to our farming operations of future years. No matter how generous a government may be. or what good purpose prompts its action, it is only possible for it or for them to do poorly what operators may do well for them - selves. We, as farmers, have at our disposal all agencies of information. We will have to decide for ourselves what probable demand there may be, what crops we may be able to produce and about what disposition will be of greatest benefit to us as individuals, bearing in mind all the while that what Is better for a part of the people is fairly sure to be the better thing, in a reflected way. for the rest of the people. A prosperous farming folk, are an asset to be trades people and the manufacturing centers. A good condition in the industrial centers is beneficial to the farming people. It is not possible to always main - tain a balance, but if matters are approached with al] the available in - formation, our percentages of unfavorable balances will surely be greatly reduced. We are now out of balance with reference to a supply of hogs. We are down to nothing In some localities and nearly nothing in many others. The grower of purebreds has no home market for his breeding stock. Instead, the average farmer is trying to get into killing condi - tion the few hogs on hand. He has in some Instances grown so dis - couraged and dismayed that be is letting the tail go with the hide and saying that he will want to have some feed on hand before he tries to stock up again. He has heard enough of squealing and fretful, hungry bogs and hungry cattle to do him a long time. To this sort of man, I hope to have something to offer. I can only </seg>
         <seg id="p629">N EBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION point to past years when I say that we will have crops again. We have had dry years before and we.will have them again. That has been the history of the central west. We have had tough years for quite,a while, worse really than we thought tor we were for a time using some of the stored surplus. Now that Is gone, but we are surely nearer to better crops. The turn of the wheel should be nearer a favorable point. Distressed people are planting prayerfully. In some. instances, they have always been able to harvest gratefully. I cannot become persuaded that It shall be any different in the years ahead, and that good purpose will again be rewarded. In situations of this sort our supplications are not asking amiss. When harvests are here again and bins long empty are again patched and filled, and the cribs are again bursting and the surplus Is piled on thousands of hills in Nebraska, let us have Increased cause for thanksgiving by having retained or maintained a supply of grain-con - suming domestic animals so that our very harvests may not encumber us. All that I have said thus far is of little importance compared to the task of maintaining this supply. It all hinges on feed, finance and determination. Feed Is almost a nightmare. It Isn't. Mile after mile, county after county of empty cribs and bins—not enough to feed the poultry and the milk cows. We must keep some brood sows. It has to be done. Good crops of grain may be fairly cheap. Feeding stock are sure to be high. Let us think about a supply of brood sows. We have all heard of the 1000-pound boar and the 750-pound sow. Right now is a good time to forget them for awhile. They eat a lot of grain. Let us think about; the 100 to 125-pound gilt that may be bred this January or February, or even March for summer and fall pigs. They will get along with less feed than any other. The pigs should be marketed with much, very much cheaper feed. They should be worth a lot of money. In most neighborhoods are commercial hammermills. A good many farmers have their own. Try grinding very finely some alfalfa hay, soak It or dampen it and add a very little shorts or corn meal. This way they can have all they want to eat and it will not cost much. Spring is so far away when we hope for some pasture to help along. I heard of some Sarpy county stockmen, thinkers, unwilling to be downed, who have ground Atlas Sorgo, soaked it and carried through a good bunch of sows. Didn't do much good last year—no corn. They will need to do It again. I surely do not want to recommend that we try to make a profit for ourselves out of the misery of dumb animals—far from it. I have wintered cattle on the open range and I have carried breeding stock through on less feed than I would have liked, but the comfort of my livestock has always been uppermost and far ahead of my own comfort. </seg>
         <seg id="p630">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I recommend the same course for any stockman today. I have never fed blackstrap molasses to hogs. I have fed a great deal of it 'to cattle. It might be used to dampen some sort of well ground rough feed. I do not know. The men here at the College can tell you, but even then It may not be available to many who must try to get some breeding stock through. lam sure we need to think. A lot of fellows use their intelligence to poor advantage. Their purpose is poor. Our purpose is surely worthy. Let us think just as hard about something that will carry these little sows through, or the fall pig that is healthy and clean but too thin to go to market. Let us contribute our part by providing good shelter. It is not so hard when it is dry. Comfortable quarters will save a lot of grain that is often used to try to warm up the damp, vile quarters where hogs are often kept. Aside from our humane im - pulse, this is a time when it will pay In real cash to keep stock on hand in the most comfortable condition possible. It is worth while. Let us keep going. Let us take care of the small sow. Raise the summer and fall pigs. Take good care of them. Do a lot of thinking about feed, now and ever after. Let us plan out new ways to provide a sustenance. Let us keep the best stock of our good herds and try very hard again, and maybe yet again. It is seemingly our only road. Let us not miss the way. It is none too well marked. A LIVESTOCK PROGRAM OX RENTED FARMS FROM THE INVESTOR'S STANDPOINT D. M. HILDEBRAND, Seward Without question Nebraska is more dependent on Agriculture than any state in the Union. Consequently it makes it far more important that serious consideration be given the operation of our ranch and farm lands. When we realize that approximately 50% of our farm lands are spei-ated by tenants today, it makes this subject a live ong. We only have to go back a few years to find land soaring at a dizzy height, which has brought disaster to both the owner and the investor. It was argued pro and con that we would never see cheap grain and live stock prices again, but as usual, we were wrong. Farm lands are the base of any prosperity that comes to our country. Consequently, we should not expect our farm and ranch lands to be placed on a speculative basis, so far as returns are concerned. Today the Investors find themselves the owners of a vast amount of land throughout the state of Nebraska. One of the questions we should ask ourselves is "If the operator was efficient and was unable to pay interest and taxes, how can the investor hope to operate this same property as a non - resident landlord and show fair returns on the principal he has in - vested, along with taxes?" </seg>
         <seg id="p631">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION I am convinced that where the farm cannot be operated on a cooperative live stock basis, between investor and tenant, it is practically impossible, over a period of years, for the non-resident owner to handle this same property on a purely grain rent basis at a profit. It has been my privilege to handle farms where I have cooperated with the tenant on a live stock basis, for more than twenty-five years. Settlement has just been made on most of these farms, whereby the year's business has been settled and inventory taken. In practically every case, both the operator and the investor are fairly well satisfied with the returns. I have had an opportunity to compare the returns from these farms op - erated on a cooperative basis with farms that are purely on a grain basis, and in every case the cooperative farm has made a larger profit than those operated on the usual grain rental basis. Of course, much depends on the type of individual, both as tenant and landlord. Each must be reasonable In their demands and at the same time give every consideration to helping finance the problems as they present themselves. In the first place, when the Investor or in - surance company made the loan on some individual's farm, they had no thought of acquiring title to same. Neither did the owner have any thought of not being able to carry out his Contract. Where the farmer owner has made an honest effort to meet bis obligations and has failed through no fault of his own on account of economic conditions, I feel you are justified in extending this individual further credit to aid him in financing his live stock program, with a view of eventually returning to him title to the property he has lost to you. Our own company has worked out a plan of this kind which we have found very satisfactory. lam sure in time It will save both the individual and our. selves a loss that was apparent to both parties. Bear in mind that where the farmer owner has been unfortunate in losing title to his property, he of course has lost his credit standing with the bank. This handicaps him where credit must be extended to purchase live stock and feed, and make it practically impossible for him to get credit extended as he did before losing title to his property. This makes it more-necessary that you cooperate with him and lend him your credit in order to put the farm on a more efficient basis. Further - morel your advice and experience will aid him and give him renewed interest in working out your mutual problem. We cannot discount the fact that the farm operator should be the farm owner wherever possible, and I hope to see the day when every farm in Nebraska will have the slogan—"The Farm Factory", where the operator utilizes not only the grain, but the by-products of his farm through live stock, which includes creep-fed calves, a small flock of ewes and a reasonable number of well-bred sows, which will provide labor for the entire family, twelve month's ln the year. The Investor can </seg>
         <seg id="p632">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE play an important part in bringing this about by cooperating with the prospective farm owner. A LIVESTOCK PROGRAM ON RENTED FARMS FROM THE LANDLORD'S STANDPOINT BRUCE RUSSELL, Omaha A livestock program on a rented farm properly planned and execu - ted will do much to improve the landlord-tenant relationship through longer tenure; tend to increase and stabalize the annual income, main - tain fertility and better protect the owner's investment in the land and improvements. 1 have arrived at this conclusion after having been the tenant partner in such a set-up from 1919-25 and from personal ob - servation and experiences in supervising more than forty such units since 1930. Let me say to begin with, that a 50-50 livestock lease Is a much more complex arrangement than the ordinary grain-share lease in operation on most tenant farms. Many more problems present them - selves under such a set-up, and unless all of them are taken into account, the venture is very apt to prove disastrous to both tenant and land owner. Before deciding on a change from a grain to a livestock program on his farm, the land owner should first determine whether or not his farm Is adapted to a livestock set-up. The size of the farm, its location, topography, proportion of cultivated land to pasture land, improve - ments, fences and water supply all have a direct bearing on its suc - cessful operation as a livestock unit. After analyzing the farm he must then analyze himself to determine first—whether he is in a position to properly finance his end of the partnership; second, does he have a sufficient knowledge of livestock farming to assist the tenant in planning the operation of the farm; third—does he have an understanding of farming sufficient to enable him to take it on the chin when losses occur unavoidably and the ship is not sailing so smoothly. Having checked up on the farm and himself, and found both, equal to the venture, his next problem Is to find the right tenant-partner to take over the farm. Here again the land owner has a much greater responsibility than is the case in selecting a tenant for a grain farm. A livestock tenant must possess the ability not only to do a good job of grain farming, but in addition must have an understanding of the innumerable problems that go with the raising and feeding of livestock. </seg>
         <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The land owner must satisfy himself that the prospective tenant pos - sesses these qualifications by checking his past performances. If he has been a successful, livestock operator on his own account there is a good reason to believe he will be successful in a partnership arrange - ment. The livestock tenant, like the land-owner, must have enough capital to carry his end of the partnership, and in addition, must have sufficient help and adequate equipment. He too must be able to think straight and to keep his feet on the ground through period of adversity. Close cooperation at all times between tenant and land owner is absolutely essential for success. The general plan of operation to be followed should come In for considerable thought. We have observed that many such partnerships have gone on the rocks because one or the other became too ambitious and wished to expand more rapidly than the pocketbook, feed or facilities for handling more livestock would safely permit. It is better by far to start in a small way If necessary and grow into the business. The rate of expansion should be in direct proportion to the financial capacity of the weaker partner. From the owner's standpoint I do not consider it good business to finance the tenant. I have never known a livestock partnership where this was done to work out satisfactorily,! but Ido know of many that failed miserably. The reasons for failure are quite obvious. Briefly, the tenant has everything to gain and nothing to lose, and consequently, does not feel or assume the proper responsibility. A system of accounting is another important essential for success. Our experience has indicated that a simple yet comprehensive monthly report filled out by the tenant and sent _o the land owner has proven best. This report should be made on an inventory basis showing live - stock and grain on hand at the first of the month; disposition of same during the month, and the balance on hand at the end of the month. A division of proceeds and expenses should be made at the end of each month's business to avoid errors and the possibility of a misunderstand - ing. These monthly reports can he summarized at the end of the year, and will serve as a guide in planning next year's operations. What has been said this far might lead you to believe that I was inclined to discourage the 50-50 livestock lease. This is farthest from my thoughts. There Is much to be said in favor of a livestock lease - for rented farms, and much to be gained for both landlord and tenant under such a working arrangement.

BROKAW, Agricultural College The three preceding speakers have agreed upon the remedy so the subject of a long-time program is answered. In brief, it seems [hat </seg>
         <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS ANu'.FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ¦ ' -'(:¦-¦'' ¦•'¦-¦ --.¦'• . a livestock program is what we need. During a recent trip over the state I noticed that many farmers had no livestock, some only two or three cows and a few horses, others had the horses entirely replaced by tractor power. It is circumstances like this, that indicate a very unbalanced situation. We generally recognize the fact that for maximum profit livestock must consume the waste roughage and unsalable grains. .'.' i Another indication of an unbalanced situation is the increase in farm tenantry. We realize that most of us must start as tenants, how - ever the. Increase Of 42.7 per cent in 1920, to 49.3 per cent at present is very disturbing. '{.-¦; People came to America for religious freedom and for the oppor - tunity of getting land. Unfortunately they were allowed to follow the dictates of their own conscience In farming as well as religion. In 1862 the Homestead Act, not only granted free land but laid the foun - dation of a great nation. This foundation can be maintained only by people who are interested in the land. With 50 per cent of the farms back in the hands of tenants, many who: are not interested in owning the land, a point of danger is reached. Land is a national asset, a balance has been set between man and livestock which must he met. When man came Into possession of this land he assumed a grave responsibility for he receives it only in trust and will eventually pass It to future generations. Early pioneers were not careful in handling this land because they could move on west. However, when all the land was claimed, prices increased, modern machinery came Into use and the direction we headed was concealed under the confusion. These problems were complicated with high interest rates, tariffs and droughts and have led to the present conditions. . ! The remedy for the entire situation seems to be in livestock. Take for example our master farmers, in the majority of cases they produce livestock in' considerable numbers. Education is a possible solution. We must study the fifty per cent that have been successful and own their farms in order to teach the unsuccessful. Tariffs and high taxes have been mentioned as possible factors, however the most cases of un - sound tenantry came in periods when we thought land was worth more than It really was. If we make conditions too bad, we will only add to the troubles be - fore us. Tenantry is not wholly bad. A man, so long as he maintains soil fertility and protects the owner, is capable and should be allowed to continue on the land. Often a tenant just starts to do good work and has to move. This process offers many evils to both the owner and ten- </seg>

In summing up the subject of a long-time program, we can conclude that in most sections of Nebraska growing grains for cash is undepend - able year In and year out as a means ot making a living. Living by livestock is our simplest solutiou. HORSE.S AND MULES IX THE AGRICULTURE OF TOMORROW' M. P. JARNAGIN, University of Georgia, Athens Horses and mules have a combined value of more than any other class of farm animals. On January 1, 1935, we had a total of 16,622, - -000 horses and mules ou farms, with a combined value of ?L37lj - -938,000. There has been a phenominal increase in values since the last census was taken. This is a sum greater than the value of all dairy and beef cattle and three times as great as the value of all sheep and hogs comblued. There has been a steady decline in the number of horses since the peak year of 1920. By 1933 we had reached the low point in breeding operations. In that year the birth rate was approxi - mately three foals for each oiie hundred mature animals. With animals dying more than twice as fast as they were being born total numbers were being reduced rapidly, the average age of all animals was be - coming greater, and consequently the annual death rate was being accelerated, since there were relatively fewer young animals. The first evidence that the tide had definitely turned was shown in the Bureau of Crop Estimates' report when they published that in the year 193. a total of 692,000 horse colts were produced in the United States, or 27% more than were produced the previous year, and the greatest number since 1922. In spite of this increase in foals' the total number of horses of all ages showed a decrease of one per cent for that year. On the same date our mule population was 4,795, - -000, a decrease of 130,000 or about three per cent in the year. There was some increase in the number of mule foals produced In 1934 over 1933, but this was slight in comparison with the increase in horse foals. The foals dropped in the United States in 1935 and surviving to January Ist, 1936 were estimated to be approximately 900,000 animals, but' the death rate of all horses in 193G will probably be in excess of 1, - -100,000. Every indication points to the fact that more foals were dropped In 1936 than in 1935. More mares will likely be bred in 1937 than in 1936, but there Is no likelihood that foals surviving to January Ist following will equal the death losses before 1938 for horses and not before 1943 for mules. In the light of these facts it would appear that the production of horses and mules during the next few years will be highly profitable. </seg>
         <seg id="p637">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The reduction of horse and mule numbers during the past fifteen years is a striking example of how livestock affects the welfare of every man, woman, and child in the nation. During this brief period we have reduced our horses and mules by around 10,000,000 head. It requires on the average about four acres of land to supply the grazing, grain, and forage to feed a horse one year. This means that the market for the product of 40,000,000 acres of land had been destroyed. This vast area thus released from growing feeds for horses and mules now be - comes a competitor of all other agricultural lands. In the abstract this gigantic figure means but little to the average mind, but if we think of it in terms of specific crops to which It might be devoted it becomes a very vivid factor. The land involved would be enough to produce the entire cotton crop of 1936, with 15,000,000 acres left over. It is enough land t. grow our exportable surplus of wheat, corn, rye, barley and oats in our most prosperous year since 19,20. It is more than the total area of all harvested crops in 1929 in the six southeastern states ot North and South Carolina/Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. There are but two ultimate consumers of food and feed crops. They are man and the horse, The meat and milk producing animals are living factories that convert coarse grains, by-products, pasturage and forage into more refined forms to become food for man. The feed they consume is but temporarily withheld from the market, but feed con - sumed by horses is permanently withdrawn. The reduction in the number of ultimate consumers had the inevitable result of piling up surpluses. The downward trend in the numbers of horses'and mules did much toward bringing about the economic necessity for the cotton - plow-up campaign; the control of acreajge devoted to corn, wheat, pea - nuts and tobacco; the purchase by the government of 8,000,000 head of beef cattle; the elimination of 4,000,000 head of dairy cattle in the disease-clean-up campaign of tuberculosis, Bangs' disease, and mastitis; and the elimination of 5,000,000 hogs, largely pigs and sows. No Immediate Danger of Over-Prodnction It requires four years from the time a mare is bred to produce a three-year-old horse. Experience has shown that of each 100 mares mated about 60 living foals will be produced. Some of these are apt to die before they reach, work age. Assuming that the horse will live to an average age of 15 years.and the mule 18 years, It will require 66 horses and 55 mules for each 1000 mature animals for normal replace - ment. On the basis of these figures there is not a region of the United States with a sufficient number of foals born in 1934 for the replacement requirements for three-year-olds when the work season starts in the spring of 1937. This national shortage of horses has been evidenced by sensational increases in prices during the past year. </seg>
         <seg id="p638">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Situation in Nebraska While Nebraska is located in the region that normally ships many horses and mules to the east and south, an actual shortage exists in this great horse-breeding state. According to the United States census report of January l, 1935 which furnishes the last accurate figures available, there were 650,669 horses in the state. On the same date there were 66,863 horse colts under two years old. On January 1 there were 77,796 mules in Nebraska and 3 41S mule colts under two years of age. By using the normal mortality rate it would appear that the state would require 42,944 three-year-old horses each year for replacement. Assuming that half of the colts under two years old reported on January I, 1935 were foaled in 1934 there would be available .'{3.432 three-year-olds to go to work this spring This would leave a shortage of 9,512 horses and by the same method of calculation there would he a shortage of 2,304 mules or a total shortage of nearly 1 2.1 .„ work animals. This is on the assumption that no animals horn in the state in 1934 have been shipped out but his ,s not true, and the shortage is therefore greater than the in - dicated number. Mules lb,- Il.st Hrf Of the nearly 5.000.w00 mules in the United States today, worth more '"an a half billion dollars, two-thirds of them are found in the nine cotton) .It states. Most of the remaining one-third are i„ the nearby mule-breeding states of Tennessee. Kentucky. Missouri and Kansas' Mules are bringing ,„ U( . h stronger prices than horses. The average price being paid for mules on the Atlanta market today is more than $100.00 above that for horses. It would seem wise for the horseman of Nebraska to expand their production of mules. Certainly, the more than ,5.000 mules now found in the state amply demonstrate the prac - ticability of growing them in this territory. 'The popularity of the mule ,„ the south is based on the belief of the cotton planters that as compared with the horse the mule will live longer, endure more hard - ships, do more work on less feed, has less indigestion, disease, lameness and unsoundness, and is hotter able to take care of himself in the hands of inexperienced teamsters. These virtues of the lowly hybrid should commend him to the farmers of Nebraska. From the time of the collapse of the cotton market in the late sum - mer of 19 20 the purchasing power of the cotton farmer was at a low - ebb until 1935. As a result but few mules were purchased during this 15-year period. There are many mules on cotton farms now above "5 years of age. Many of them are dead hut have refused to lie down During the present season the planters are buying an abnormally large number of mules and no price level deters them on the better kinds </seg>

Many top pairs of mated mules are selling at around $700. Ordlnarly prices for good teams are from $500 to ?600. Kind of Mules Wanted ' Shi.pe, quality and finish are more determining factors in the selling price of mules than weight and substance. The fine-haired, thin-skinned, hard-finished mules withstand heat much better than the coarse, lymphatic sort. Plain, big, draft mules weighing up to 1500 pounds! will not command a price of much more than 10% over 1000 - -pound mules with quality, flesh and action. Daily rations are based largely upon the live weight of the animals. The cost of growing mules of different weights will tend, to be in proportion to their live weight Experience indicates that the producers of mules weighing from 1050 to 1100 pounds are making the greatest profit out of the undertaking. First thought and attention should be given to the selection of sound, big jac^s. They should be deep and wide in the body. They should show great length and spring of rib, and large circumference of heart and flank girth so as to give spacious room for heart and lung develop - ment as well as for the digestive organs. The neck should come well out of the top of the shoulders and the head should be well carried. The back should he relatively short, straight, and strong, with short coupling and well-muscled over the loin. The rump should be long, level and well - mttscled. The quarters should be full, the legs should be straight and set well apart. The bone should be heavy, dense, hard and smooth. Measured halfway between the knee and the fetlock joint the cannon should have a circumference of at least eight and one-half inches. The joints should be large, well defined and free from meatlness. The feet should be large, open at the hoof-head, smooth, and of dense horn structure. The head should be long, wide between the eyes, clean - cut, bony, well-proportioned and show masculine character. Viewed from the side it should be straight or slightly Roman. The ears should be long, fine, tapering, set relatively close together, and carried in an upright, alert manlier. Since the jack/tends to be sluggish in disposi - tion it is desirable to select an individual with all the style and action possible. He should walk straight and free, with an elastic stride and bold trot. Good mule jacks should stand not less than 15 hands high, and weigh not less than 1050 pounds. .In the past many of the finest plantation mules have been out of hot-blooded mares with a predominance of thoroughbred, standard - bred or saddle-bred breeding. Such mares, weighing 1150 to 1200 pounds, of rather massive, thick conformation for the type, make ideal </seg>
         <seg id="p640">REPORT OF XEBRA. KA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mule mares, but their scarcity and high price limits the number avail - able for mule production. It is therefore likely that a majority of the mules foaled during the next few years will be out of grade draft mares. Extremely large drafters are not desirable for this purpose. I would recommend the selection of mares conforming more to the type of good farm chunks or wagon horses. A weight of 1300 pounds is ample for mares to be bred to big jacks. As a rule the mule at maturity will weigh more than the average of its two parents. Mares of the weight indicated, that carry only one or two crosses of draft blood, can be secured. They should be clean-legged, hard-finished, active individuals with an abundance of quality and finish. Mules out of coal-faced, slug - gish mares never show the quality and courage demanded by discrim - inating mule buyers. 111-shaped, off-type, unsound mares are no better suited to mule production than to horse production. During the next few years I believe prices for horses and mules will remain at a profitable level. There are many reasons why farmers should continue to grow them in all sections of America. They are grown and maintained on farm feeds. All they consume of crops is permanently kept off the market, thereby strengthening the demand for the portion that Is sold. The brood mares do their share of farm work, and the colts are a by-product. They should be harness-broken at two and one-half years of age and pay the cost of keep from then on in work. They can be sold at five to six years of age without the owner's taking any depreciation on them. The source of power is crops grown by the farmer and does not represent a cash outlay. These non-cash costs are more easily handled than rash costs. It has been clearly demonstrated that through the use of multi-hitches horses will provide all of the power needed for any farm purpose. During recent years we have seen a rapid expansion in the use of pleasure horses. This will be likely to continue. From the standpoint of supplying the most satisfactory farm power at the lowest net cost, and also from the standpoint of providing a source of cash income for the farmer I believe the horse will play a prominent part in the national agricultural recovery that is well on ' the way. THE XERRASKA OF 1002 H. J. GRAMLICH, Agricultural College This Is a tough assignment. It takes considerable of a vision to even find an idea to grasp at in connection with responding to this sub - ject. Mr. Tolman evidently wanted me to give you something to think about. Since the Literary Digest advanced certain theories regarding </seg>
         <seg id="p641">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION the last national election, I am rather inclined to lose heart when I attempt to even prophesy what may be ahead for us. Even so, when the horse is given the order to go forward, about all he can do Is get In the collar. Accordingly here it is. •' Take it for what it is worth. In intelligently looking ahead twenty-five years to see what might, be around the corner, I think it would be wise to go back twenty-five - years and see what has transpired. In 1912 we find that it was still quite the common practice to feed big cattle for long periods of time. The rather common practice Involved ]the feeding of two-year-olds three-year-old, and four-year-old steers.' The'calf and modern baby beef such as we have today were practically unheard of in most feed lot operations and market centers. The steer that loafed around a year in the feed lot expanding from a 1000-pound fleshy feeder into, a 1500-pound ox stored away 125 bushels of corn, a vast amount of hay, and a tremendous amount of hard work on the part of the owner As reimbursement the owner had the privilege of sitting on the fence - at the stock yards the day he marketed the animals and hearing pas - sers-by comment that these were the largest steers that had been at the yards In a week. This helped to square things away at the bank and inasmuch as corn up to that time had been comparatively reason - able, the actual loss usually was within the comprehension of mere man. At that time the markets clamored for heavy cuts of beef Todar we have a rather different trend toward the steer which is finished for market at weights of 1000 to 1100 pounds. When there are not too. many of .he-so-called handy weight 1200-pound steers, the market for these gets near the top level prevailing for choice yearlings. What will be the demand and custom twenty-five years hence? My prediction is that we will see a greater demand 1 for light cuts of beef. We will undoubtedly see an increased call for tile so-called super-baby beeves, these being calves of both sexes carrying _ pretty fair degree of finished at live weights of 650 to 750 pounds. These little cattle may produce acceptable commercial carcasses for the great bulk of the trade throughout a considerable part of the United States. Their carcasses weigh about 400 pounds. Theyare not so fat as to be wasty yet they carry a fair degree of finish and a little touch of marbling. The man operating a farm where there is considerable grass may have occasion to keep a small herd of beef cows. He can creep feed the calves and make them into super-baby beeves. If he does not wish to keep cows to utilize the grass and other crops grown on the acres where he is practicing soil conservation, he will buy calves from the ranches in the fall, winter them on silage and finish during the following sum - mer and fall on grass, supplemented with corn, barley and such other grain crops as he may have available. He will probably try to have these animals finished at weights under 1000 pounds. There will be ¦21 -':¦".-.. </seg>
         <seg id="p642">XX.I-: XT ill- N KBKASKA STATE 111 IARD (IF AGRICULTURE some demand for heavy cuts of beef. Probably if one car in a thou - sand of fat cattle arriving at the central markets weighs 1400 to 1500 pounds, that will supply the demand for beef of the heavy type. Should we become so soil conservation minded that we keep a liberal acreage of grass on our Corn Belt farms we may find a much less intensive grain feeding that is now in vogue. We may even find con - ditions approximating those which we are following i„ this year of scarce grains. On farms where there is a considerable acreage of grass and legume crops and a very limited acreage of row crops, the practice will probably include the liberal use of ensilage, supplemented with some high protein feed, some legume hay and a little grain. The purpose which cattle on such farms serve will be quite largely hinged around the utilization of bulky crops produced on that farm plus maintaining the maximum fertility of the soil. Were we in an area where rainfall is heavier. I would feel confident that this would prove to be the case. The only factor which will limit the development of this practice will be the problem of limited moisture. I recently spent a day in eastern lowa. I was amazed to learn of the corn crop which they had produced this year. On the farms where the most corn was produced, the percentage of total acres in corn was the lowest. The feeders were using large amounts of legume crops They did not crop heavily to corn but between corn crops used ampl - manure and did not hesitate to build up the soil. As a result, one man m bemoaning the fact that his corn only made 60 bushels this year stated, after I bad &lt; hided him about being discontented with that that aside from 19:14 he had no, averaged less than 75 bushels in mauv years, his 1934 crop having been the same as that for this year In that section they have rainfall. Their normal is about 40 inches and they seldom go a week during the growing season without a good shower. If. following the droughts which we are experiencing now Nebraska should get a series of wet years, I can conceive of our grow - ing bumper crops comparable to those of eastern lowa. By the way. the rainfall records for Nebraska are interesting. Seem - ingly during the period that records are available we have alternated spells of below normal and above normal moisture. These have usually ranged from 16 to IS years in length. Thank goodness we are Hearing the end of ig lean years. May the next 1 6 be wet ones.

Think what has happened in the development of the airplane in that short span of years. What may be the future development? . .'¦ Possibly the Organized Agriculture of 1962 will be held with Mr Tolman serving as Chancellor of the University and he will introduce several old has-beens who are on the pension list. They will say a few words, which will go out over the air along with their pictures which as a result of new developments in television, will be transcribed to the receiving sets of the livestock feeders of the state. I can conceive of the talk fest part going over very nicely in this way; in fact, should such be the case you, as listeners, would have the advantage of being able to turn off the radio or going into the other room when part of a program comes on which doesn't suit your tastes. lam wondering however, just how we;would get around the problem of getting the food to you for the Master Farmer banquet, the Fun Feed and various other eating festivities which take place under the present set-up. lam likewise wondering how the sneak thief would be able to get into Delmar Anderson's hip pocket and relieve him of ?75, such as he succeeded in doing a few years ago.- Aside from a few practical monstrosities which present themselves as problems I am wiling to admit that by- 1962 this institution will to a considerable extent have turned itself into an up-to-the-minute radio broadcasting Plant and serve as a source of unlimited knowledge, available not only during the week of Organized Agriculture but during the other 51 weeks of the year. Fifteen years ago Professor Loeffel had us scared. He would have us believe that there was an acute shortage of meat Impending that inversely as the population of:the nation and world Increased man must cut down his meat eating habits. This distinguished gentleman of the cloth tried to tell us that we should go easy on corn because in a few years it would all be ground for human consumption and such meat as would then be available would largely be from the use of cot - tonseed hulls, wheat straw, sawdust and various other bulky produ-ts which man gave no evidence of being able to devour. Thus far Professor Loeffel s forecast has proven to be a fallacy. I think less of it today than at the time he made it. In fact I haven't heard him say anything about it for .a /number of years. I believe he too has lost faith in his theory. Today .it would seem as though with population increases gradually leveling off, there might continue to be ample meat available for the people of the nation, even in 1962. </seg>
         <seg id="p644">KEPI &gt;UT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I believe there are two things which we will find pretty much ill evidence by 1962. One will be the installation of a battery of silos on every farm in the state. These may not be trench silos—or they may be some modified form of the present sloppily constructed units such as we have some 32.000 in the state. However, Ido believe that following the lessons which have been butted against our heads during recent years we will adopt a system for storing livestock feed in fat years in order that we may be ready for the vicissitudes of the lean years Australia for many years has suffered recurring droughts, not in - frequently lasting two to four years. The farmers of that continent have devised a plan of using large trench silos in which they store suf - ficient feed to keep their herds and flocks through several years of short range and hay. why shouldn't we do the same thing? I expect the practice will be so common by 1962 in Nebraska that little thought will be given to the day fifty years preceding when a check-up showed but few silos in the state and most of those receiving a generous dam - ning, both from their owners and people living on nearby farms who had helped fill them. The unpopularity was so great that many of the silos were not filled. It looks today as though we were overcoming most of that unpopularity of early day silos. Today we have a field cutter which can be used to advantage in handling ensilage crops from field to trench silo. A crew of from four to six men can operate one of these units in contrast to the crew of twenty to twenty-five which was necessary in 1912. By 1962 it is pos - sible that the field cutter instead of selling for $500 or thereabouts will be for sale at Wool worth's 5 and 10 and other places famous fol - low prices. If such is the case there will be a field cutter on every farm or at least every community will have one or two available to do custom cutting. I foresee considerable development in the line of crops adaptable to our climatic conditions. Dr. Kiesselbach's successors who have come on the job since he went on Social Security have completed the de - velopment of various drought-resistant sorghum crops which have proven to be very valuable as producers of a heavy tonnage of ensilage We are still producing some corn. Our major efforts will of course be devoted to livestock production. The ballyhoo which we hear today about soil conservation will at least be off the front pages of the newspapers. We probably will be practicing it to a greater degree then than now. I predict, however that the average Nebraska farmer of 1962 will be even more dependent upon income from farm animals and animal products than his fore - runner, the farmer of today. </seg>

It was my priv - ilege to have had this flock under my supervision from 1929 until ¦v u ly 1!. obi ¦ , In 1929 at the time this flock was turned to me, the quality of the Hampshire and Rambouillet ewes was very good and it seemed quite necessary to get an outstanding ram to head each of these flocks if any progress were to be made in further development of the two flocks. ... .. In the fall of '29 the Hampshire top Of the Annual National Ram Sale was purchased at what seemed to us a rather high price. It was our hope to use; this ram extensively In the flock and possibly use one or two of his best sons from ewes of our own breeding. This ram proved to be an outstanding breeding ram as was brought out by the fact that four rams from his first crop of rams sold for enough as yearlings to return the original cost of the old ram. He was used at Montana State College until 1934.at which time he was sold to the North Dakota Agricultural College. Rams and surplus ewes sired by this ra m sold for a higher average price than sheep sold previous to the purchase of the ram in spite of the fact that he was used fn the flock during a time when sheep prices were quite low. One son and one grandson of this ram were used in the flock and later when new rams were brought in and crossed on line-bred ewes from the old ram, the results proved more than satisfactory. This was borne out by the fact that in 1935 the College sold the high and second high ram at the National Ram Sale and a pen of wethers was reserve cham - pion at Chicago. This past year another ram topped the National Ram Sale at $750 and the College exhibited the champion Hampshire wether at Chicago. The two new rams that were brought in were both tried aged rams We felt that in a small flock of ewes we would rather pay a little more for a proven sire than for a young ram even though we might not get more than one or two years' service from the rams. In using these old rams, we made it a policy to always have one good young ram, prefer - ably a son of the old ram, In reserve in case the old ram died or proved to be sterile.

It is unfortunate, however, that not in all cases do these top individuals uniformly produce offspring of similar type. Among our rams we have a naturally short tailed one, this individual was kept with the intention of finding out whether bob-tailed lambs could be produced. In twelve offspring thus far the characteristic has failed to reappear. His daughters are now bred back to him and will lamb early this spring. While attractive heads and shoulders may help to sell breeding stock, the high priced part of an animal on the market is the hindquart - ers.

IMPROVING FARM LIVESTOCK AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE COLLEGE HERDS AND FLOCKS—HORSES W.W. DERRICK, Agricultural College It takes, time to find unsoundness in horse breeding and still longer to work them out. A poor sire is bound to reproduce some of his own or his ancestors' undesirable characteristics in his colts. Consequently one cannot observe too much caution In selecting a herd sire. A few years ago the College changed from a small type horse to a large type. We needed many corrections that were found in a stallion that took to our liking. He was nice bodied and strong headed but not just right in his legs and feet. . Altho his offspring were improved in size and body they were all a little defective In their running gear This mare is one of his daughters. She is set out a little in her front legs, toes in slightly, but otherwise well set and proportioned. Neither of these defects were present in the stallion. When we get hack to her hind legs she somewhat resembles a car with the differential out. Horses are just about as valuable as they are good in their hind legs. This mare sets with too much closeness in the hocks. Looking at her from the side she is too straight in her leg setting, not as bad as the sire, however, indicating that she inherited some desirable qualities from the dam side. This other mare is sired by a little smaller stallion, but one more nearly perfect In bis leg setting. You will notice nothing radically wrong with her, altho not as large, she Is more squarely set in her hocks, larger and flatter in the cannons, cleaner about the hocks and stronger in her pasterns. </seg>

Select clean, straight flinty hocks with plenty of leg support and large, round waxy feet. In other words it is a sound policy to start with the feet and work up - for these little factors greatly affect the value of an animal.

IMPROVING FARM LIVESTOCK AS ILLUSTRATED RY THE COLLEGE HERDS AND FLOCKS—SWINE WM. ,/. LOEFFEL, Agricultural College There is so much that we do not know about hog breeding that I approach the topic with fear and trembling. It does have advantages however over the breeding of horses and cattle in that the gestation period Is shorter and the value per animal much less. Also the ma - jority of hog breeds are new with the result that the characteristics are not fixed. American breeds are of relatively recent establishment and therefore somewhat mixed. This does not apply to the Berk - shlres, Hampshires and other breeds of British origin. We need more appreciation for a standard type. Ideas of what are desirable In swine have fluctuated from a lowset, chuffy kind to the tall, slow maturing hog of recent years. The present trend seems to favor an intermediate type with more feeding qualities than any rangy kind. One of the things which strikes me is the apparent disability of hog breeders to profit from the mistakes of others. Although the extreme, big type has proven undesirable, each breed has had to pass through that era before they fully realized the value of the earlier maturing, intermediate type. Farmers at the present time have very definitely turned away from the extreme type with the result that they are producing animals more </seg>

BAKER, North Platte There are many angles to approach the problem of animal breed - ing, many of these have already been touched upon by the gentlemen preceding me. The manner in which the characteristics of livestock are inherited is so complex that improvement is difficult, and positive results hard to predict. I feel that our actual knowledge of the subject is very limited, for about the time we feel that we know something definite it is proven wrong. Animal breeding can hardly be considered a science; part of suc - cess in breeding livestock may lie good judgment, but much is due to luck. At our North Platte Substation we have maintained a breeding herd for thirty years and during that time have been reasonably success - ful. Through most of those years the herd iVas managed by one man who knew definitely what he wanted. This is an important essential for the success of any breeder, then with persistence, luck, and good judgment a measure of success may be obtained. Oood foundation stock is also essential, but they need not cost exorbitant sums of money if the purchaser uses good judgment. It is important that the females be of good type and the sires are never too near perfection. For example a certain fellow up in the range country had a herd of cows that were exceptionally good except they were low in the loin. This man purchased a bull exceptionally good in this re - spect but in getting a good loin he had overlooked other defects. It was only a matter of a few years before he had a herd of many defects. For the average commercial breeder with good females the secret of success is with the sire. Go out and get one of the same general breeding, but one not too closely related. The best sire will be none too good in the average herd. I do not advise line breeding to the ordinary farmer except in cases where an exceptional family is being carried on. Crossbreeding is all </seg>
         <seg id="p651">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION right under certain conditions for it will increase both the size and gain of the offspring. Personally, Ido not believe that there will be any ultimate gain, unless these desirable characteristics are fixed so they can be transferred to succeeding generations. WHAT PUREBRED SntES MEAN IN DOLLARS O. O. WAGGONER; Chicago, 111. Man has had animals for over 5,000 years of recorded history. Even before that time he undoubtedly knew of their existence and that some were more valuable than others. It wasn't long afterwards that man also learned the influence of breeding, which would tend to carry on certain desirable traits at the expense of the undesirable. Though often abused, this practice has been carried on until modern times. t 7 1u777 S6a aUimalS haVe been selected on tUe basis of color doubt if th is is justified. The thing in my mind which gives a ii. dollar value is not what he is but what he can produce in his offspring! the same will be true with females. "i"'".. We are cutting ties in bulls backs, thus making it harder for the v umate buyer to know what he is getting. This certainly doe not indicate progress. Processes of desception such as this are little more bail horse-trader tactics. Color may have its uses or pu poses b" breed 7? 7 " is»^oing *o make a great deal of differ „T The breed .that will make progress in the future must forget these petty recently at an auction sale in South Dakota, fifty-two carloads of drought cows were sold.

From the little tha I know of cattle breeding, this difference in price could have been nearly eliminated in one generation of good bulls, certainly in two mi final analysis bulls, rams or boars will be judged on the basis not of how well they look today or their frills but rather what they ctn do to improve future generations of livestock. </seg>

Chromosome numbers are of unusual significance. When an in - dividual produces germ cells, a special so-called reduction division takes place, so that only one of each pair of chromosomes goes into a germ ieil. For example, as before stated, in cattle there are sixty chromosomes made up of thirty pairs. The germ cells contain only thirty chromosomes. If the chromosomes in the germ cells are studied carefully, one will find that in the female germ cells, which are the eg_S, the thirty chromosomes will be exactly like those in the male term cells, which are the sperms. ln oilier words, a cattle germ cell contains one member of each of thirty pahs of chromosomes, ii follows, therefore, that the pairs are restored at the time of fertilization. In each fertilized egg one member in' each pair of chromosomes came from the sire and the other from the dam. And it is obvious I hat chance alone determines which one of a pair of parental chromosomes is to be v member of a j'ecombined pair in the offspring. In order to demonstrate thai chromosomes control heredity, let us consider a simple illustration, it should be kept in mind that the principles involved ill this Illustration are fundamental to an under - standing of the mechanics of heredity. Crosses between .Aberdeen-Angus i.solid-colored) and Holstein (while-spotted) individuals produce .solid-colored calves .exclusively. Why are no white-spotted calves produced. Only one of the thirty pairs of chromosomes is involved in the production of solid-colored and white-spotted calves. At certain points located exactly opposite each other on this pair of chromosomes are de - terminers for solid-color or white-spotting as the case may be. If the determiners on both chromosomes are for White-spotting, the calf Will be white-spotted. But if the determiner on one chromosome is for solid color and on the other for white-spotting, the calf will be solid - colored, because solid-color is dominant to white spotting. This is the relationship that exists between these determiners in the calves ob - tained by crossing solid-colored with white-spotted individuals. The determiner for white-spotting is called recessive because it cannot manifest itself when paired with the dominant determiner for self. What is to be expected when crosses are made between solid-colored individuals each of which has the determiner for solid-color on one chromosome and tbe determiner for white-spotting oil the Other chromosome?. The bulls used in making this cross would produce two kinds of sperms with respect to tbe determiners under consideration. </seg>

         <seg id="p656">REP( IRT OF NEBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE impressions really had an effect on the offspring, it should be possible to keep a red cow mated to a red bull behind a black fence and produce a black calf. Enough Is known about inheritance in color in cattle to predict that when red animals are mated to each other they will never produce black calves, and the color of the fence will have no eftect. There is no foundation whatever for many other similar beliefs be - cause there Is no conceivable mechanism that could bring about such effects. The science of genetics not only reveals why certain things cannot happen, but It also shows why certain other things do happen when a definite breeding program is followed. Take inbreeding, for example. Closely related animals are similar in their heredity, and inbred herds are more uniform in color and conformation than herds ill which inbreeding has not been practiced, When close relatives are mated with each other for several generations the principal effect is to in - crease the proportion of true-breeding characteristics and to decrease the number of non-true characteristics. This results in what are called recessives cropping out in the offspring, and, of course, reces - sives breed true. A consequence of this may be a decline in vigor, since recessives are frequently harmful. If the less vigorous and de - fective Individuals are discarded, inbreeding of itself will not produce harmful effects. Line breeding is a less intense form of inbreeding. If there are any undesirable recessives they crop out much less frequently, and this gives the breeders a better chance to carry on careful selection. If, in spite of this care, there are signs of degeneration, it is advisable to get in new blood in order to increase the vigor, and then make an - other attempt at line breeding. After quite a few generations o£ careful line breeding livestock breed true for the qualities which have been selected and from that time on there should be little or no degeneration. It Is impossible, however, by this means to get in new desirable char - acteristics. These are only obtained by out-crosses with animals that carry them. Since lack of vigor may be associated with a high proportion of true breeding determiners, it follows that exceptional vigor accompanies a high proportion of non-true breeding determiners. This explains why cross-breds are sometimes more vigorous than either of their pure - bred parents. Too great emphasis cannot be given the fact that cross-breds do not breed true. Their offspring exhibit a great diversity of types and details of conformation. Inbreeding tends to intensify characteristics and make for uniformity, while continued mating of cross-bred animals invariably breaks up many desirable combinations of true breeding </seg>
         <seg id="p657">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION determiners. In other words, the quickest and most certain way to wipe but the results of many generations of Intelligent breeding is to cross pure-bred animals throughout their useful breeding lives. Breeds are perhaps the most important element In the livestock industry, which has grown and prospered through the years and con - tributed more than.any other factor to the stability of American agri - culture. Yet breeds are not sacred even though each one has a host of loyal adherents. The great meed today is not to ignore breeds or do away with them, but to strengthen each one that has proved itself; to realize that their faults should be studied and corrected If possible, not magnified and then given unwarranted publicity; in short, we should preserve that which has been gained and make certain'that future accomplishments are real, not transitory. Scientists and breed - ers alike should direct their efforts toward the attainment of this objective. Nehawka, Nebraska Dec. 13, 1936 Mr. W. W.

         <seg id="p658">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The first day was spent mostly in leisure and getting acquainted with our surroundings, in the evening we attended one of the world's largest theatres. Friday was Junior Livestock Judging Day. During the morning we went to the Stock Yards and received our'number and groups for judging. We then judged from 10 to 12 in the morning, having 15 minutes for each class of livestock we judged. There were two classes of horses, two of cattle, two of hogs and two of sheep. The cuttle were Angus steers and Hereford heifers. The hogs were Chester White barrows, the sheep were a class of Shropshire ewes and a class of fat wethers. All of the livestock was of the finest in the world. There was livestock from England. Scotland arid Canada. At noon we had luncheon at the stock yards and it was there that we gave our reasons. That evening we had a banquet given by the Saddle and Sirloin club. Tbe winners of the judging contest were announced at this banquet. We were the winners of the ninth place. On Sunday morning at .15 we met the rest of the Nebraska dele - nates at the Northwestern depot, it was then the real thrill and fun began. We attended church three times that day. One of the sermons was given by Dr. Harold C. ['hilly of the First Baptist Church of Cleve - land. Ohio. We wi-iii on a sight seeing tour of Chicago. It covered all important and interesting points within the city such as the Loop, Lincoln Park, the Ghetto. Chinatown. University of Chicago, Washing - ton Park and many other interesting and historical places. Monday was International Livestock Show Day. On that day the rest of tbe judging was done. Then those who had finished went to the International Livestock Show on the elevated trains. The other ways of transportation were i„ buses, street cars, electric subways and taxis. At noon we were entertained by the Sears, Roebuck and Company. They gave us a luncheon at Stevens Hotel and a musical program. In the evening we were entertained in the Wilson Auditorium with a line musical program and a very line dinner. After dinner there was a parade of the entire delegation led by the lowa -l-H band in the arena of the International Livestock Ruilding on the Exposition grounds' We were led by R. t. Pilchard. State Club leader. "My Country 'Tis of Thee was led by Earl J. Cooper and the exposition band in which the audience joined. Tuesday was Science and Industry Day.

There we had the annual club members' banquet ln the Grand Ball Room of the Hotel. The national winners were pre - sented. We enjoyed the "Rhythm 'round the World" entertainment with a cast of 170 people. Wednesday was Manufacturer's Day. In the morning we attended the tractor Works on educational tours as guests of the International. And following this we went through the McCormick twine 'mill. 11l these shops the machinery was operated by steam, air and electricity. The International Harvester Company officials entertained us at a luncheon. This company makes 400 tractors per day. In the after - noon the delegation went to a matinee horse show, a polo game as guests of the International Livestock Exposition. We dined by states in the evening and after dinner we attended the National 4-H Style Revue, held in Orchestra hall. Tlilursday was Educational day. We visited the Field Museum of Natural History to see the Hallof the Stone Age Men and the Hall Of the Races of Mankind. We also visited the Shedd Aquarium. We found many different varieties o£ fish, animals and birds from all parts of the world. . Two penguins presented by Admiral Byrd were on display. Next we vyent to the Adler Planetarium where Professor Fox explained the ro ation of the earth, the cause of seasons and day and night. He also told many interesting facts about the stars and the planets. From there we went to the Museum of Science and Industry. We visited a coal nfine and saw Its operation. • We ended the day by checking out and boarding the Challenger for Omaha on which we had our evening party. We arrived at our destination at 10 a. m. Friday, December 4th. I have failed to mention the fact that there were fifteen hundred boys at d girls at the congress. The Nebraska delegation was led by Mr. Guy Divis. There were boys and; girls from forty-four states, all of good n orals, wide-awake eager to learn and out for a good time. We were nost royally entertained and everything was! done for our pleas - ure and comfort. We are most thankful to the Nebraska Livestock Breeders and the Cass County Farm Bureau who made it possible for us to go and to Mr. Frisbie who Is endeared In the hearts of every 4-H member.

We left Omaha on the Portland Rose, one of the finest trains on the Northwestern lines, and arrived in Chicago at 9:00 a. m. It was the first time I had ever slept on a train and I learned very much about porters, beds and how to take care of my suitcases. We also went back in the lounging car, read magazines and listened to the radio. Alter arriving in Chicago, we hailed a taxi and went to Hotel Harri - son where we made our headquarters for the week. Thanksgiving day we stayed at the hotel during the morning and then we went out to dinner and a show. Friday morning we went on the elevated railroad out to the Exposi - tion and judged the livestock. In the afternoon we gave our reasons. At 7:00 p. m. we went to a banquet at the Saddle and Sirloin club where the winners were announced and the prizes given. As a team, we placed 9th out of 21 teams.

Some of the interesting places were the Loop, j Lincoln Park, Chinatown, University of Chicago and many other interesting places. Monday we went out to the International Livestock Exposition and saw the finest livestock in America, also the finest saddle horses. At noon we went to the Stevens Hotel to lunch, through the courtesy of the Sears, Roebuck company, which is one of the finest hotels in Chicago. It was a fine luncheon and the entertainment very good, j Monday night we were guests of Wilson and Co. and I thought the best number on the program was the introduction of Bob Feller the 18-year-old pitching star of the! Cleveland Indians with 17 straight strikeouts In one game. After the banquet we went out to the Exposi - tion where the entire delegation led by the lowa 4-H club band marched in the arena. Tuesday morning all of the boys at the Club Congress left on a special train to plants of Armour and Company where we ate breakfast and then went through the packing plant from- the time the animals were killed, butchered, until the meat was ready for the consumer. One of the Important buildings was'the million-dollar building for the butchering of cattle,:' j At noon, we went to the College Inn, at the Sherman Hotel, being guests of the National Livestock Marketing Association, where each boy received a knife. During the afternoon we went to the Art Institute where we saw many valuable paintings. At six p. m. we went to the Annual 4-H Club Congress Banquet at the Grand Ballroom in the Stevens hotel. The national winners were presented. This was the finest banquet at the National Club Congress. Wednesday we went through the International Harvester Co., through the tractor workyard and McCormick twine mill. At the lunch - eon we saw the radio comedians, Fibber McGee and Molly. In the af - ternoon we went to the matinee horse show as guests of the International Livestock Exposition. ¦ i ¦¦ Wednesday evening the Nebraska delegation ate at the Hamilton Grill and then went to the National 4-H style dress revue. Thursday we boys went to the Field Museum of National History where we saw the Hall of! Stone Age Men, Hall of the Races of Mankind and many animals such as the penguins brought back by Admiral Byrd from South America. The penguins died at the Chicago Zoo so they were placed in the museum. We then went to the Aquarium where I saw all kinds of fish, and water animals. We then went to the Planetarium where we saw the reproduction of the stars and moon showing where they are certain times of the day and night.

In the contest vye had eight classes of stock, two of horses, two of sheep, two of cattle and two of hogs. Of these we were re - quired to give reasons on one class of each, hogs, cattle, sheepand horses. We finished placing the classes about 12:30 p. m. at which time we went to the Stock Yards Inn for luhtfh. After lunch we gave reasons on the various classes of livestock. Ws finished about 4:30 p. m. We then looked over the various of the show. At 7:00 p, m. we attended a banquet at the paddle and Sirloin Club at which time the results of the contest were given. After the banquet we re - turned to the hotel. ¦'. j - -1 Saturday was a day we could do as we saw fit, so we stayed in our rooms and listened to the radio and football games.

In the afternoon we took special buses on a fifty mile trip over the City of Chicago, where we saw many points of interest. This trip ended about 5:00 p. m. At 7:00 p. m. we went to Orchestra Hall to attend the evening church services. Monday was a busy day for all of the judging teams except the livestock team which had already judged. The rest of the group not on a judging team looked at the different exhibits until 11:45 a. m., when we boarded buses to the Stevens Hotel to attend a luncheon given by Sears Roebuck &amp; Company. After the entertainment we again got on buses bound for the Wilson Packing Company auditorium. We were entertained by a movie until dinner. We had dinner at the Wilson and Company Cafeteria. Wo then returned to the auditorium for the "Thomas &amp; Wilson Night" program which was broadcast. At 9:15 p. m., we left for the Stock Show again. There was a parade of all of the 1936 Club Congress delegates in the arena. This closed by the singing of America. Tuesday the boys were guests of Armour and Company and Swift and Company for an 8:00 a. m. breakfast. After breakfast those who ate with Armour and Company went through their plant. Those eating with Swift and Company were shown through the Swift plant. At 11:30 a. m. we left for the Sherman Hotel where we were guests of the National Livestock Marketing Association which was followed by an entertainment. We then left for the Arts Museum, where we were shown through. We saw many paintings and carvings, some valued at over a million dollars. We then went back to the hotel. In the eve - ning we attended the annual 4-H Club banquet given at the Grand Ball Room of the Stevens Hotel. About 1,500 or 1,600 boys and girls and leaders attended. Wednesday morning we ate breakfast at the Harrison Hotel. We then marched to the Auditorium Hotel and left for the International Harvester Company. We saw them make twine and tractors. At 10:15 a. m. we assembled In one large group and had our pictures taken. We each received one as a compliment of the International Harvester Company. We then had lunch with the International Har - vester Company. In the afternoon we were entertained by watching the horse show. We then returned to the hotel. At 6:00 p. m., we went to a dinner of just Nebraska people, after which we went to the Style Show at Orchestra Hall. We then returned to the hotel. Thursday we again met at the Auditorium Hotel and left for the Field Museum. We were taken through this by a guide and shown the various points of interest. We then went to the Aquarium and later to the Planetarium where a demonstration was given on how the stars, moon, sun and planets pass through the sky In the course of a day, year, </seg>

After lunch we went on a trip sponsored by the Illinois Central rail - roal to the Museum of Arts and Industry. We were shown through this _a|ad later on we were taken through a coal mine. This was not a real mine but a typical example of a coal mine. We then returned to our hitel where we had from 4:30 to 8:30 to do as we pleased. At 8:30 we left by taxi to the Northwestern depot where we boarded a tralh at 9:40 p. m. We all stayed up 7untl Iwe crossed the Mississippi river. We arrived in Omaha at 9:40 a.m. H.ving had a grand time meeting other people and seeing the city of Chicago, as well as the Stock Show, we were all well and happy, but a Very tired group, of boys and girls.

         <seg id="p673">Crop Rotation Work at the Scottsbluff Field Station LIONEL HARRIS, Acting Superintendent of Experiment Farm Croi rotation work is the principal work of the Scottsbluff station. It is concerned chiefly with the problems of maintaining high yields of crops under irrigation farming, where it is recognized that high yields a-e so essential. The greater portion of the work is a quarter - century old, being inaugurated in 1912. During that year 31 rotation systems were begun. Three were added in 1920, ten in 1926, three In 1931, aid one in 1932. Only the older rotations (the 31 systems begun iA 1912 and the 3 in 1920) will be considered in the following discussion. These 34 crop rotation systems include nine plots grow - ing the same crop each year; eleven 2-year rotations; three 3-year rotationi; five 4-year rotations; five 6-year rotations; and one 7-year rotation The crops involved include the major crops grown in the North I latte Valley, i.e., alfalfa, sugar beets; potatoes, corn, oats, wheat, and sweet clover. , The work begun In 1912 Includes comparisons of 2-year and 3-year unmanu-ed rotations with continuous cropping; manured rotations With others not manured; and rotations including alfalfa in the cycle of crops with others; wherein this crop is not grown. In on. instance manure jls applied to; a six year alfalfa rotation, which gives a compari - son with rotations where both alfalfa and manure are absent. The rotations begun in 1920 include studies of the value of sweet clover as a soil Building crop, when pastured with sheep, and the value of applying manure to the 2nd year beet crop in a 7-year rotation which also includes alfalfa In the cycle Of crops. Several methods of seed - ing alfalfa have also been studied. Alfalfa has been seeded In oat stubble In the fall, alone in the spring, and with grain as a-nurse crop in the spiring. These different methods may be compared in the various rotations. The .levation at the Scottsbluff Field Station is approximately 4, - -000 feet. The average annual precipitation for the past 27 years has been 13.89 inches, of which 11.37 inches fell during the growing sea - son (April to Sept. inclusive). The rainfall is very erratic and cannot be depended upon as a valuable source of water for crops. The irriga - tion water supply is the limiting factor insofar as moisture for plants is concerned. Hail storms sometimes damage crops. The 27-year aver - age datej of the last frost in the spring has been May 11, and of the first in the fall September 27, leaving an average frost free period of 134. days.'; 22 </seg>
         <seg id="p674">KKt"i IUT I&gt;!¦'NEBRASKA STATK HOARD OK AGRICULTURE The chief soils of the North Platte Valley or the area directly served by the Scottsbluff station, range from a sandy loam to a loamy fine sand, with the Mitchell, a very fine sandy loam predominating. The area is notably free from the heavier soil types characteristic of many irrigated ureas throughout the west. The natural drainage of most soils is good. The soil of the Scottsbluff station has been classed as Tripp, a very fine sandy loam. It has good natural drainage and is easily worked. The ground upon which the rotation work is conducted was broken from native sod in 111 in. It was seeded to oats in 1911 and the rota - tion work was started the next year. Comparative Values of the notations as Complete Units In ord&lt;-i- to obtain a true comparison of the value of the various rotations it was recognized as essentia! to determine the net returns from each rotation as a complete- unit. This has been done for the rotations under discussion in this paper. To get the net returns, pro - duction costs were subtracted from the gross'earnings of the rotation. The production costs used were arbitrary figures representing actual production costs as closely as il was possible to determine them. The production costs in-n- determined by using for cultural operation costs those recognized as somewhat standardized in the community, for example, contract labor, hauling sugar beets, harvesting grain, plowing, taxes, and irrigation water. Other items of expense such as disking, iiarroHin., and planting, were estimated, based partly upon the experience of performing these operations at the station as well as upon observations made by farmers on the project. Eighteen dollars per acre was ascribed to contract labor in producing sugar beets; eleven dollars per acre was allowed for water costs, tool maintenance, repairs, interest, and depreciation, and sen en dollars per acre used as the cost of applying manure. The unit values of crops used were as follows: Alfalfa .57 00 per t0 „ Sugar beets G .OO per ton oals 40 per bushel Marketable potatoes 50 per bushel Cull potatoes 15 „ R _ bushel Co,n 60 per bushel Wlleat 75 per bushel Results of ( 'ont/iiiious Cropping Compared to Short Untreated Rotations Planting the same ground with the same crop every year is de- j cidedly an unprofitable practice as is indicated by the 25-year mean yields and the relative values per acre shown in table 1.

         <seg id="p675">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION each instance below the yields required to coyer production costs, ranging from $4.69 below for sugar beets to $27.16 below for potatoes. Alfalfa returned a fair 25-year mean yield and a profit of $7.33 per acre, being the only crop grown on the same land every year to return a profit. Growing crops in 2-year or 3-year untreated rotations is also a de - cidedly unprofitable practice. The rotation of potatoes and beets gave 25-year mean yields which barely covered production costs. The rotation of oats and beets in a 2-year rotation and the rotation of pota - toes, oats and beets in a 3-year rotation also gave yields which barely covered production costs. In all other cases losses were incurred ranging, from 39 cents per acre in the : rotation of beets and wheat to $11.83 in the rotation of wheat and oats. Table I.

The Value of Farm Manure in Crop Rotations Three comparisons are available for determining the benefits ot manure ln 2-year rotations, and one comparison is available in a 3 - year rotation. In each instance the rotations are exactly alike save for the manure applied to one of them. The data showing the value of manure covers a 25-year period (1912-36) and is recorded in table 11. A yearly application of 12 tons of manure per acre to the potato crop in a rotation of potatoes and beets increased the yield of potatoes 89 bushels per acre and the yield of beets 6.2 tons over the yields obtained from the rotation where no manure was applied. The rela - tive values of the two rotations were 65 cents per acre compared to $25.:i5, giving a value of $4.62 per ton for the manure. In a 3-year manured rotation of potatoes, oats and beets, yields were sufficiently above those from the unmaniired rotation to give a value of $4.54 per ton for the manure applied. In a 2-year rotation of oats and beets, increased yields gu\e a value to manure of $3.53 per ton. The lowest value tor manure I $2.32) per ton was obtained from the 2-year rotation comparison of potatoes and oats.

Seeding alfalfa with oats as a nurse crop gives 3-years of good yields- ! of alfalfa whereas if it is seeded alone in the spring good yields of alfalfa j, are obtained in only two years. ' Summary Simple 2-year to 3-year rotations without alfalfa or manure have not been much more effective in maintaining the yields of crops than continuous cropping. Yields in these rotations and on the continuous plats have declined, excepting continuous alfalfa. The addition of manure or alfalfa to 2-year and :i-year rotations has caused considerable increases in the yield of crop, compared to rotations where these treat- {. ments were absent. In terms of increased yields manure has indicated ! values ranging from $2.32 to $4.62 per ton. As indicated by an average of three comparisons manure has increased the 25-year average yield of sugar beets 7.2 tons per acre, potatoes 84.0 bu. and oats 17.4 bu. In three similar comparisons alfalfa increased the yield of beets 5.1 tons per acre, tbe yield of potatoes 118 bu. and the yield of oats 23.0 bu. Manure exerted the greater influence on the sugar beet crop, while alfalfa had the greater effect on the potato and oat crops, Manure and alfalfa together in a 6-year rotation have produced good yields of potatoes, oats, and beets. The 25-year average yield for potatoes has been 311 bu. per acre; for beets 15.7 tons; and for oats 73.1 bu. i Pasturing sweet clover with sheep has proved to be a profitable practice in a 4-year rotation including 2-years of beets, 1-year of oats and 1-year of pastured sweet clover. EFFECT OF VARIOIS IRRIGATION POTATO ROTATIONS UPON SOIL FERTILITY H. F. RHOADES Department of Agronomy, University of Nebraska There are three Important soil factors that profoundly affect plant growth. These factors are as follows: 1. Moisture supply, 2. Air supply, 3. Supply of nutrient elements. .1 </seg>
         <seg id="p681">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The soil moisture supply depends upon the ability of a soil to take np and hold water, and also upon the amount of water received by the soil fr im rain or irrigation. The air supply of a soil is closely related to thelmoisture supply. When the soil is extremely wet, plants may suffer because of lack of air to the roots. This condition is more com - mon in the heavy textured soils. ' Many nutrient elements are needed for plant growth. Many of these elements are required in such small quantities that the soil is able th supply them indefinitely. However, there are two. nutrient elements that are lacking In many of the soils in the North Platte valley. It is a common practice to add phosphate fertilizer to certain soils ajid thus supply phosphorus. That nitrogen is commonly lacking is evidenced by the large returns obtained by the use of a legume in a rotation and by the application of manure. Many farmers have found that the application of large amounts of manure to land other - wise phosphorus deficient has given large increases in yield without the usi. of phosphate fertilizer. This indicates that manure supplies phosphorus as well as nitrogen. Let us consider in more detail the physical nature of soil. When the soil is in a condition to support good plant growth it consists of three distinct groups of materials—solids, liquids, and gases. The solid portion, which is the most noticeable, Is usually made up of 95 per ceit or more of mineral material and the remainder of organic matter] The mineral particles differ greatly in size and are fitted together in many different ways. The organic matter is particularly effective In holding the mineral particles together ln small clumps Regardless of the nature of the arrangement, there Is considerable void orl pore space left between the particles and air and water occupy-! ing this space. It is the size of these pore spaces that'determines the' ability of a soil to take up and hold water and at the same time be sufficiently aerated. The] following illustrations will serve to indicate the effect of the arrangement of the soil particles on moisture and air relations. First, let us cbnsider a soil made up of large sand particles. Such a soil will have relatively large openings and water will enter readily but at the same time the large pores will not hold the water and thus it will drain out quickly. This soil is not desirable because of its low, water holding ability. Second, let us consider a soil made up of very small cfay particles. These particles may fit together in such a way that sn^all pores are left between the particles. The entrance of water into these small pores will be extremely slow and thus a con - siderable time will be required to wet the soil. If the land is sloping much of the water will run off. When this soil does become wet very little w iter will be lost by drainage, but so much of the pore'space will be filled with water that the air: supply In the soil will be In- </seg>
         <seg id="p682">RETORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sufficient for best crop growth. Third, let us picture a soil having the ability to take up water rapidly, to retain large quantities and at the same time be well aerated. This occurs when the soil consists of various sized particles arranged in such a way that they form clumps or aggregates. Large openings occur between these clumps and water enters readily. Within the clump there are smaller openings which take In the water less rapidly but they are able to hold It. Since each aggregate would be surrounded by water the time required to wet up the clump would not be excessive. After a time the water left In tbe large openings will drain out and the space will be occupied by air, but the water in the small pores will be retained for crop growth. The desirable arrangement of soil particles just described is ob - tained in nature by the action of grass and other plant roots compressing the particles into aggregates. The organic matter produced by the partial decomposition of these plant roots is particularly effective in acting as a cement to hold the particles together Into aggregates. This would lead one to assume that the use of a legume in a crop rotation or the use of manure may be desirable because of their effect on the physical conditions of the soil as well as their ability to supply certain nutrient elements. It has been demonstrated by farmers as well as by certain experi - mental investigations that the continued successful growing of crops under irrigation involves the following three things: (1) A rotation. (2) growing of legumes, and I.'!) application of manure. This is as true for the growing of potatoes as for other crops. The length of the rotation for potatoes becomes even more important from the standpoint of disease control. Since 1912 a series of potato rotations have been investigated at the Scotts Bluff Experiment Station near Mitchell. During this time considerable interesting and valuable in - formation has been obtained. Certain of these rotations have given consistently higher yields than others. Part of the increased yields may have been due to either the maintenance or the development of a better physical condition of the soil, but undoubtedly much of the in - crease was due to a greater supply of nutrients materials made avail - able. During the season of 1935 the Agronomy Department of the Uni - versity of Nebraska in cooperation with Mr. Harris and other members of the Scotts Bluff Experiment Station sampled at harvesting time the entire plants from several areas within each of the plots of Field X growing oats, wheat, sugar beets, and potatoes. From the potato plats weighings were made of both the tops and tubers and each were analyzed for phosphorus and nitrogen. The data on several of the potato rotations are presented in the accompanying table and chart.

The applica - tion of 12 tons of manure on the sugar beets increased the yield 83 - -bushels or approximately % as much as the alfalfa. The yields ob - tained in 1935 do not show as great a difference between alfalfa and: manure, but do show a greater Increase for.both compared to the rota* tion without manure or alfalfa. The; rate of removal of phosphorus and nitrogen is almost in direct proportion to the yield. Manure would ncrease both nitrogen and phosphorus while it is generally assumed that alfalfa would increase only the nitrogren supply. It the latter is true then it may be assumed that nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient material in this soil. However, alfalfa Is considered to be a strong feeder on soil phosphorus and is thus able to take more of it from the soil than such crops as potatoes and sugar beets. Our laboratory experiments indicate that this phosphorus stored in the roots of alfalfa will be readily made available to the next crop upon decomposition of the roots.

         <seg id="p686">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE METHODS OP IRRIGATION and PREP._RI.YG J.A.VD FOR IRKIGATIOX LESLIE BOWEN, Asst. Irrigation Engineer, U. S. D. A., Scottsbluff In the agriculture of the arid and semi-arid West, water is usually the limiting factor in crop production. The acreage suitable for agri - culture might be considered very large indeed, provided an ample supply of water could be obtained. It is apparent that future agri - cultural development of the West will depend upon the water supply. During the past few years of drought, the importance of water in the production of crops has been pronounced. Here in the North Platte Valley, as in other sections of the country, much has been learned about the value of water to crop growth and to the prosperity of farmers. In most states west of the Mississippi river people associated with agriculture, and the farmers In particular, have become water conscious—a fact evidenced by the interest in pumping as a means of augmenting water supplies. By experiences gained from the actual practice of irrigating, and other duties connected with irrigation farming, most, if not all of those in attendance at the meeting today are entirely familiar with the problems which confront the irrigation farmer. Perhaps there are many not satisfied with the results obtained from present practices who would welcome information regarding methods by which better utilization of water could be brought about. Methods of Irrigation General There are two general methods of applying water to the soil: (1) irrigation on the ground, and (2) irrigation from below the ground. Surface irrigation is the application of the water to the land surface by flooding, furrows, or small corrugations, and by sprinkling and spraying. Underground irrigation, commonly termed sub-irrigation, Is the application of the water below the surface. Each of these general methods possesses merits and when practiced under suitable conditions both will give good results. Irrigation through surface flooding or in furrows or small cor - rugations is the most common methods practiced ln the arid and semi-arid sections of the United States. The aim of flood irrigation Is to cover the entire land surface with a sheet of water, through one of the following methods: (1) ordinary </seg>
         <seg id="p687">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION flooding from field ditches; (2) border strip flooding; (3) check flood - ing; and (4) basin flooding. In furrow irrigation water is guided over the field through furrows or small currugations and only a part, of the land surface (from one-half to one-fifth) is covered by the - water. Irrigation as practiced today in various localities is usually the continuation of methods used by the pioneers. Generally, areas devoted to alfalfa, grain and pastures ajye irrigated by flooding, while furrows, or small corrugations are used in the irrigation of crops grown in rows—beets, potatoes, corn, bekns, etc. However, in many localities, where water supplies are limited and the topography such as will ac - commodate only small streams, alfalfa and grain are watered by fur - row irrigation. In many other sections where Irrigation by this method would be appropriate, It Is not used simply because early Irrigation practices and customs were different and have not changed. ' In practicing irrigation, whether by furrows or small corrugation or by one of the various forms of flooding, the method employed is to a large extent, determined by the crop produced, the nature of the soil the slope or topography of the'land, the available water and the size of.the stream. Generally, flood irrigation is used in the watering of alfalfa, grains and pastures, while furrow irrigation is used in irri - gating row crops—beets, potatoes, corn, beans, etc. For flood irriga - tion, the land surface should bje reasonably smooth and of uniform slope, with the slope preferably,lll one direction. Rather large heads or streams, of water are desirable; furthermore, with flooding of sandy or other porous soils, percolation losses require use of liberal amounts of water. '-,'.." 1' ' ¦¦ ' .. . ';-.¦'- With furrow irrigation the lands need not be so carefully leveled nor are large streams required. -However, this method can be prac - ticed with either large or small streams, since the water can be run in few or many furrows, according to the amount available. This method is well adapted to rough land and areas of considerable slope In the laying out or marking the furrows the usual practice is to run them down the steepest slope. Large furrows, such as those commonly used with corn and potatoes, may run more nearly along the contour or may angle across the slope at.py grade which will give the desired water velocities. On porus sandy, soils, excessive percolation losses encountered under flood irrigation, can frequently be reduced if not entirely avoided by. use of furrows not too widely spaced. On soils retentive of water, such as the clays and heavier soils, IberaP unit applications of water should be made, while on sands and the lighter, soils which retain limited quantities, smaller unit applica - tions mkde at more frequent intervals are desirable. </seg>
         <seg id="p688">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Likewise, the type of soil, the slope or other topographic features should govern the size of stream and the length of lands to be used on any particular area. Perhaps the best method of determining these is one of trial and error. In general, heavy soils in rather flat areas will accommodate large streams and land lengths varying from 600 to 1,000 feet, while on sandy soils of similar slope, these lengths should be reduced to about 200 to 500 feet. On areas of steep slope, where washing occurs, it is usually desirable to decrease the size of stream used and increase the length of lands; however, it is ques - tionable if the length should ever exceed 1,000 feet. Where short lands are used frequent cross ditches are necessary. By wise planning, these ditches can be so placed as to minimize difficulties with general farm operations. As to the frequency nf irrigation: In addition to the character of the soil, such factors as the kind of crop, its stage of growth, tempera - tures and oilier climatic conditions have their influence. On areas producing a heavy crop growth, dry, hot, windy days result in heavy losses of soil moisture. Under such conditions applications of water should lie rather frequent. For example, here in the North Platte Valley such crops its potatoes and sugar beets make their greatest demand for water during the month of August, and for this reason, these crops should be irrigated rather frequently during tilts month. Indeed, the practice of irrigation fanning involves wise planning and considerable work. Under conditions where irrigation vt liter is abundant and large heads can be used. Hood irrigation is the usual practice; furthermore because of the efficiency in wetting the soil, its use should be en - couraged. However, when.- water is scarce, or if the soil or topography is such as to permit accommodating only small streams, furrows or small corrugations should be used. To convey a general idea of the more common methods of irriga - tion a brief description of each method follows. (Persons wishing more detailed descriptions are referred to the many text books and Depart - ment of Agriculture and State Experiment Station publications dealing with irrigation): Flooding from Field Ditches In ordinary flooding from field ditches, water flows from outlets ln the field laterals and head ditches at suitable intervals onto and over the field. Small ditches may be necessary to insure proper dis - tribution of the water. These small ditches guide the water over the high portions of the field from which it overflows to cover the lower portions. Occasionally small earth or canvas dams must be used to permit proper distribution. This type of flooding is laborious and not </seg>
         <seg id="p689">I '¦ - ' -. NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the most efficient method, but it requires only a small amount of grad - ing and other land preparation and serves for the farmer of limited means. It is tbe method used by the pioneers, and, since it is suitable for any except row crops, it is still practiced extensively. A fairly large jhead of water (from two to four second-feet) can be used in flooding from field ditches. Soil type and slope will govern the lengtli of runs. Border Strip Flooding In this method the field is divided into-a series of parallel strips running in the direction of the natural slope. These strips, 50 to 100 feet wide, and level crosswise, are separated hy low ridges or borders which! confine the water within the strip, enabling the irrigator to watchj the water closely. The low ridges are formed by throwing up several back furrows with a plough or special implement designed for the purpose. The ends of the strips are usually left open or else a supply ditch is provided., The runoff is collected and used again. Large! streams of water (4 to 8 or even 10 second-feet) can be handled with this method, which is more efficient in water use than the ordinary flooding from field ditches. In order to have the land level, crosswise of theistrips, some grading is necessary, yet if the land Is not too rough, with too many slopes In the various directions, the cost of preparation is not! excessive, Flooding by Checks In'this method the field is divided by earth levees into a series of compartments or. checks, ranging in area from one-half to three acres. Water is turned in at the upper end of the check and permitted to run until'jthe entire compartment is filled to the depth desired, Large streams of water (6 to 12 second-feet) are desirable in order to 111! each compartment rapidly and spread the water uniformly over the entire ; area. The checks may be made into any shape that will best fit the topography. This method Is practicable only on comparatively level ground, for if the slope Is too greati the lower levees must be built too high and too .much grading is necessary for practical purposes. Basin Method Flooding This method is essentially the check method applied to the irriga - tion of orchards. Basins are formed, usually one to'each tree, although on level ground two or more trees may be included by the ridges or levees. Prom the supply ditch water is conveyed to the basin by small ditches, or, It may be run from basin to basin. Large or small streams may be used. Furrow Irrigation Furrows or-small corrugations leading from the supply ditch </seg>

Regard - less of the way they run, the furrows assist materially in guiding the water over the Held. There are numerous Implements, either of commercial or home manufacture, for making furrows. The ordinary beet cultivator, equipped with suitable shovels, Is a highly efficient tool. In the marking of small grain and newly seeded alfalfa, shovels used for the furrowing of beets may be used. However, shovels slightly smaller in size are preferable. For the furrowing of old alfalfa, the implement used should be sturdy, as the Interference caused by the alfalfa roots may be damaging to the ordinary beet cultivator. In such fields a furrowing sled Is efficient. This tool may also be used for cleaning and refill-rowing. For irrigating alfalfa and grain the furrows, spaced 16 to 36 inches apart and about 2 or 3 inches deep, are usually made at planting time or a few days later, the idea being to make them prior to the sprouting of the seed. In watering row crops one furrow is ordinarily made midway between the rows just prior to Irrigation. In many ways the furrow method is ideal. Either a large or small Stream of water ma be used. If the stream is small, the water is confined to a few luirows. while large streams may serve ill many furrows. Where the furrows are not too widely spaced or made too deep, irrigation can be accomplished with a maximum efficiency of water and labor. The method is well adapted to most noils; it is inexpensive in the amount of land preparation necessary for irrigation. Frequently a small furrow will guide water to a high spot which might be insufficiently wetted, if not missed entirely by one of tbe flooding methods, unless carefully leveled. The principal objections to tbe furrow method of irrigation are: (1) it is difficult to keep the proper amount of water in each furrow; t2) it roughens tbe land surface. If too large a stream is run in each furrow serious washing may result; however, by controlling the flow Into the heads of the furrows with weeds or trash, usually available at the head lauds, this objection may be largely overcome. Another practice, but more expensive, is the use of short pieces of pipe or small boxes made of lath, which can be installed in the head ditch to make each turnout permanent. The second objection to this method is that the furrows or corrugations roughen the land surface and when harvest - ing machinery passes over them considerable vibration and shaking result, which is injurious to the machine and uncomfortable for the operator. Present-day machinery equipped with pneumatic tires should materially offset this latter objection. Preparing Land for Irrigation Regardless of the method employed in irrigation or making water deUvevies, a certain amount of leveling and grading should be done. </seg>
         <seg id="p691">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION &gt; In irrigation the object is to moisten the soil uniformly. To ac - complish this most easily the land surface should be given a smooth slppe, preferably in one direction, and free from irregularities such as depressions and low spots where water will accumulate in excessive amounts, or high spots which are difficult, if not Impossible to reach. In fertile soil, crops under irrigation are usually good or poor according to the amounts and times of irrigation. Too much water, like an insufficient amount, does not produ'cegood crops. On rough and poorly graded land the low spots invariably receive too much water while the high spots are seldom, if ever, wetted sufficiently, with the result that in each case plant growth is stunted and crop yields materially reduced. Frequently one finds an area which to the eye appears level and requires no grading. However, as water spreading is attempted ho soon learns that things were not as they appeared; a little scraping from this or that high spot so as to fill the low places would have materially aided water spreading. Indeed, only in rare instances is the natural surface so smooth that It could not be Improved by some leveling and grading. The aim in grading is to remove all small knolls or hummocks by scraping them into the low places, thus permitting uniform spreading of the water over the land surface. By grading it must not be inferred that the surface should be reduced to a level or nearly level condition; on the contrary, In order that the water shall flow freely over the surface a certain amount of slope Is necessary. The land surface after being graded should be relatively smooth. Local conditions will determine the amount of slope. While the process of grading requires the expenditure of time and money It is believed the advantages gained by the resulting greater economy in the use of water, the savings of labor in applying the water, and the uniform and more abundant crop produced will, over a period of years, pay good dividends. Indeed, grading is a capital investment, the value and benefits of which too many farmers underestimate. . In recent years the people of the North Platte Valley have become water conscious and in a few instances, irrigation minded—attitudes of which our f orbearers had not the slightest conception. The pioneers came to.the Valley, saw the water running past thirsty land, and they used it—lavishly. Their sole purpose was to water the lands and their methods served their purpose. They had plenty of water, nobody else wanted it, so they used it extravagantly. Then came the droughts and with them an awakening to the fact that the number of irrigators had gradually increased without a cor - responding Increase, in fact a decrease, in the amount of -water. Droughts in Nature, like depressions in- the business world, come and go. At present all are hoping for the return of conditions which will again: yield, adequate water supplies, because the crop acreage is •constantly increasing, while the water supply (except for yearly </seg>

         <seg id="p693">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the middle of May the early potato fields are infested and by the first week of June tbe first symptoms of "psyllid yellows" appear. In the years 1920, '30, and '31 our best indicators for-psyllid abundance were the perennial ground cherries. These plants appeared early provided the first food for the adults, and their first eggs were laid on the leaves. In 4 to 7 days the eggs hatched, and the first generation of psyllids was on its way. Each year we have been checking the host plant areas to determine the extent of the growth and Infestation. This, coupled with the use of mechanical traps, has given us a practical means by which we can determine what to expect during the season. Last season we were able to tell what areas would have the heaviest Infestation and when spraying should be started. Our chief difficulty In the psyllid problem has been to find them in hibernation. A great deal of time has been spent in attempting to uncover their hiding place. A number of closely related species have been taken, but the only records we have on the over-wintering potato psyllid were those'taken from Cedar trees in Nebraska and Wyoming. Cedar trees growing on the southern exposures of the Mountains south - west of Gering, Nebraska, and east of Lusk, Wyoming, were found to be harboring the adult form In hibernation. In areas where there is an abundance of wild solanums has been considered the most likely place to find psyllids in hibernation. Large numbers propagate in a favorable year oh these plants. Psyllids are with us every year, but it has been observed that in a favorable potato year, when there is sufficient moisture and the plants are actively growing, that psylllds do not seriously disturb the growth. This is not entirely due to the health of the plants, but probably to weather conditions. Moderately high temperatures and dry weather Offer the optimum conditions for psyllid development. They pass thru their stages of development more quickly. . In a dry, warm sum - mer it is a matter of a few weeks before enormous numbers are present. In plants where the symptoms begin to appear it is common to count 15 to 18 hundred psyllid nymphs to the plants. Spraying must be started before this time, consequently during April and May we try to be oh the alert to recognize the first signs of a psyllid year. The policy followed by many Colorado growers is "that spray is the best insurance for a potato crop, so they spray" re - gardless of whether it is necessary or not. The past season there was a late infestation of psyllids which began to show up in July and by August j there was little doubt that the late plantings were going to be affected. Growers who took no chances and sprayed escaped crop loss, while those who failed to spray: in several cases had their yield reduced as much as 45 per cent. Growers recognize the value of the spray, consequently they do not hesitate to get the greatest protection possible.. </seg>
         <seg id="p694">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE TOLERANCE OF CERTAIN POTATO VARIETIES TO PSYLLID YELLOWS M. F. BABB, Associate Pyslologist JAMES E. KRAUS, Assistant Pysiologist U. S. D. A. Horticultural Field Station, Cheyenne, Wyoming During the growing season of 1936, a test was conducted at the Cheyenne Horticultural Field Station to determine whether or not there are potato varieties immune to the disease known as psyllid yellows. The test was also designed to test the relative tolerance of those vari - eties which are known to be affected by the disease, i.e., to test their relative crop-producing abilities even though showing symptoms typical of the disease. Fifty-six varieties and strains were included In tbe test. Virus diseases, which became manifest In many of them soon after growth commenced, made severe roguing of the plots necessary and yield data from them unreliable. For this reason, data to establish their relative tolerance to the effects of the disease were secured on only thirty-nine varieties. Due to the number of varieties under test, the field planting was divided into four blocks, each containing about fifteen varieties to - gether with check plots of Cobbler, Bliss Triumph and Rural New Yorker. These latter varieties were used as checks because they rep - resent the early, mldseason and late groups and are the varieties most commonly grown in this region. Five plots of Cobbler and Rural New Yorker were used in each block and fifteen plots of Bliss Triumph. The field was irrigated and otherwise cared for according to the usual commercial practices, except that It was not sprayed for psyllid control. Data were taken In the field on the percentage of plants infected; on the number of plants per plot. Each variety was also given a rating as to its earliness. The amount of injury to the tops and tubers was also evaluated on a numerical basis. All plots were harvested sep - arately and subsequently data were secured on the number and weight of tubers per plot for grades corresponding to the U. S. No. 1, U. S. No. 2 and culls. For the purposes of this preliminary report, the former two grades have been combined to form a grade comparable to the U. S. Commercial. Plot yields have been computed on an acre basis, combined and averaged to give the yields reported. The data included in this report have not been completely analyzed and are based on only one year's results. Further work is necessary to establish the relative tolerance of the various varieties to the effects of the disease as indicated by yield records. The data relative to immunity are considered conclusive for the varieties under test, be- </seg>

         <seg id="p696">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cause it is believed that a variety which has once shown symptoms of the disease will again be found susceptible under similar conditions. Results: No variety included in this test was Immune to psyllid yellows. This finding also holds true for a planting immediately adjacent to the test plots in which about 182 varieties of potatoes were grown. These were beiug grown for increase and included a number of seedling selections and certain related species from South America. The significance of the difference in yield of any given variety from that of other varieties is not definitely known. In view, however, ot the wide differences shown in table I between such varieties as Condon's Early Snowflake at the heud of the list and those of varieties appearing towards the bottom of the list, it appears reasonably certain that there are inherent differences between varieties in their tolerance to psyllid yellows. This inference concerning their relative tolerance is somewhat in - validated by the fact that there is a marked tendency for those varieties rated as "l" in earliness to be grouped towards the bottom of the list. (Varieties given the rating of "4" in earliness were those judged to be "Too late for Cheyenne"). Probably, therefore, inferences concerning their relative tolerance should not be extended beyond those varieties given a rating of "3" for earliness. These varieties were considered as being "Late varieties for Cheyenne". Table 1 also shows the results of the attempt made to evaluate the seriousness of the infection to tops and tubers by assigning values of from Itos to the various apparent degrees of injury. In both cases, a rating of "1" was given to the smallest degree of injury and "5" to those most severely injured. The correlation between yield and the rating given to the tubers is -.6295, and indicates that there is, in general, an association between the amount of injury to the tubers and the ability of a variety to yield. The correlation between yield and the rating given to the tops is +.7384. The apparent failure of the rating given to the tops to measure the extent of injury to the plant as a whole is probably due to the fact that but one reading, late in the season, was made on the planting. Under such circumstances the early varieties were more severely penalized than the later types because pronounced symptoms of top injury do not appear until after the initia - tion of tuber formation and become progressively worse to the end of the season. Thus, a variety which sets its tubers early in the season may escape the full effects of the disease in so far as the formation of tubers is concerned, but the tops will show a higher degree of injury, if examined late in the season, than those of a variety which sets Its' tubers later. </seg>

This practice has since been aban - doned. Another practice that has been definitely discarded is the use of the spade type of cultivator shovels on all shanks, these shovels tended to loosen all the ground too deep, permitting it to dry out readily and they cut off the fine feeder roots, leaving the plants without proper support. A few dry spring seasons with the resulting clodding plowing and hln sands of potatoes made a change of procedure to discing in he fall prior to the potato crop season, and immediately following he harvester, this prevented fall weed growth, retained the moisture in the soil, and put the soil in better shape to accept moisture, and aided m the rotting of the straw stubble. The following spring the land was then plowed to a depth of about en inches and a subsoil packer pulled directly behind the plows The laud was again packed and kept free from weeds by harrowing several times. This method made a firm seed bed with moisture near the surface in dry springs and resulted In better and evener stands This firm seed bed needed some loosening near the seed piece and »eeds killed in germination so as not to come up in the row with the Potato plant, n, order to do this the field was blind cultivated and mmediatelv harrowed with a float board ahead of the harrow teeth, this also packed the soil over the seed piece and left the seed piece covered the proper depth for quick sprouting. After the first cultiva - ion sweeps were used on all shanks, with small narrow ones near the plant and large ones in the middle of the space between the rows cultivating as often as necessary to keep the weeds down, and as shallow as possible.

         <seg id="p701">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION then handled exactly as the adjoining fields of the summer tillage. On the summer tilled fields we had an average of 116 bushels to the acre. While on the stubble strips we harvested 14 bushels to the acre. We did not check the No. 1 potatoes sorted from these fields on the stubble, but the quality and size of these potatoes were inferior to those grown on the summer till. ¦ ' In the season o£ 1935 our entire acreage was planted on summer till ground on which we secured"a good stand and wonderful fine growth until heavy psyllid infection stopped the growth and affected the yield materially. Some of the smaller fields not beink worth digging while on the large fields we had a normal yield on the center of the field. This Infection made. It Impossible to make a fail comparison of yields with the late planted fields which had but slight infection. In preparation of the land for the 1936 potato crop the high wheat stubble was disked early in the spring of 1935 with a one-way disk, 1 then plowed to a depth of ten inches with a mold board plow pulling the subsoil packer right behind! the plows, this left the soil firm but rough enough to keep from blowing and in shape to accept moisture without run off. As soon as weeds appeared a rod weeder was used and thereafter as often as necessary td.keep the field clean. I.nnd Listed to Prevent Blowing In the early fall this land was listed, north and south to a depth of the plowing to prevent wind erosion during the winter months. In the early spring the ridges were worked down with a disc ridge buster. However not much of a ridge remained. Some of the land was Plowed with a mold board plow to check if there was an ad - vantiig^ in replowlng. The land was then harrowed several times and weeded with a rod weeder shortly before planting then again cross harrowed just prior to planting. Th^ potato planters are so constructed as to shave off the dry soil just aheadof the planter shoe, and discs behind the shoe to cove - the seed piece with moist dirt insuring germination and better stands on dry (seasons. The fields were harrowed with a float board ahead of the harrow teeth, just a few days after planting leaving about three inches of covering over the seed piece. As soon as the potatoes could be rowed a first cultivation was made with narrow bull tongue shovels next to (the plant and spear heads on the other shanks. This was the only deep cultivation practiced. The succeeding cultivations were made as often as necessary to keep weeds down and as shallow as possible. The last cultivation being made as late as possible without injury to the vines.. Our: average yields on these fields were over 90 bushels to the </seg>
         <seg id="p702">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE acre while adjoining fields not on summer fallowed land yielded from less than 10 to a maximum of 50 bushels to the acre. Stubble land referred to In my remarks has been winter wheat stubble, wheat being the predominating crop in this territory and coming in the rotation prior to the potato crop. I have found that summer tilling either corn or bean ground will produce even a better crop than wheat stubble. On summer fallowing alfalfa ground the yield was very disap - pointing yielding less than one-fourth that of the wheat stubble. Sweet clover land that had been summer fallowed and then a crop of winter wheat grown on it and the wheat stubble then fallowed and planted to potatoes gave an average yield compared to land that had never had sweet clover on it. From these observations I would conclude that in order to secure a satisfactory average yield of potatoes on an average season that it is necessary to conserve more than one year's moisture and at the same time conserve and maintain the present fertility of the soil without the use of alfalfa as a fertilizer. IS THERE A FERTILITY PROBLEM ON DRY LAND IX WESTERN NEBRASKA If. F. RHOADES Agronomy Department. I'niversity of Nebraska Many farmers in the dry land areas of western Nebraska are con - cerned over the loss of fertility from their soil. The continued removal of crops decreases the supply of nutrient materials in the soil while the removal of the surface soil by wind erosion may cause a greater loss in local areas. There are a large number of nutrient matcriivls needed by plants and supplied by the soil. Many of them are required in such small quantities or are present in the soil in such large amount? that It would require many years to deplete the soil sufficiently to affect crop yields. The nutrient materials nitrogen and phosphorus may be more quickly depleted. It has been necessary to add thes.. materials to the irrigated soils in the North Platte valley. Under dry land conditions the average yields are lower and thus depletion of phophorus and nitrogen takes place at a slower rate. Let us first consider the problem of maintaining nitrogen in dry land soils. The nitrogen is associated with the organic matter and occurs mainly in the surface soil. When the surface soil is removed by blowing most of the nitrogen is removed and the crops growing on sucii land will suffer seriously from lack of nitrogen. This lack 01 nitrogen </seg>
         <seg id="p703">j NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION ¦.'.¦'¦¦.' I Is indicated by the yellowing of the growing plants. Growing of legumes such as alfalfa or sweet clover will increase the nitrogen supply and for the poor soils and those eroded by wind such a practice may be desirable, 'The experiences of many farmers indicate, however, that the general use of legumes is undesirable on the normal soils of this region. Except for the soil conditions just described, they find a decrease in yields of crops after a legume. The legumes require an extremely large amount of moisture for their growth and thus may greatly deplete the soil moisture supply for the following crop. There will also be a stimulation of vegetative growth in the early part of the growing season due to. the nitrogen added by the legume. This greater vegetative growth of the plants requires a large amount of water for maintenance and during the dry season they may be so seriously affected' that yields are greatly reduced. The application of manure affects crop yields in a similar way. There is one method by.which nitrogen is naturally restored to our dry land soils. Certain organisms in the soil are capable of converting gaseous nitrogen from the soil air into a form that plants can use. It is very difficult to ascertain the amounts added but it is possible that enough Is added in this way to maintain the average yields. Where the yields are higher, as under irrigation, there would not be a sufficient increase of nitrogen to maintain yields. These organisms derive their energy and food by decomposing various organic residues. When the residues are low in nitrogen they utilize gaseous nitrogen and finally make it available to plants, but when the residues are high in nitrogen the organisms will use that nitrogen and not the air nitrogen. It has been suggested that the addition of such residues as wheat straw may stimulate .the activity, of these organisms. Since unfavorable results are obtained the next year after straw is plowed under, the land to which straw Is applied should be slimmer fallowed one year before planting a crop. Another method of supplying organic material low in nitrogen would be to reseed the land to grass after a number of years of cultivation. The use of a grass in a planned system of farming would have other desirable attributes than that of supplying material for the activity of certain sbil organisms. The fibrous nature of grass roots Is especially important in the development of a good soil structure. In such a structure the soil particles are arranged in clumps or aggregates. This allmys for a favorable penetration and conservation of the rain that falls. At the same time these clumps or aggregates are less subject |to wind erosion than where the soil structure is broken down by continuous cultivation. Grasses are much more effective than legumes for the purpose. The main difficulty with this plan is to ob - tain a gi-ass that can be readily and inexpensively seeded. It seems likely that with the large amount of investigation now being done </seg>
         <seg id="p704">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE with grasses that certain kinds will be developed that will make a reseeding program more favorable. Most dry land soils do not need phosphate fertilizer at present. With continued cropping it will likely become necessary in the future. There are a few areas even now that respond to phosphate fertilizer. This Is especially true of soils which have a high lime content in the surface soil. This discussion Indicates that there is a fertility problem on dry land in western Nebraska. However, this problem is not a serious one except where there is severe wind erosion. The growing of legumes and the application of manure are not recommended for this region except In the case of very poor soils. Apparently the nitrogen supply can be maintained to a high degree by the action of soil organisms. It is not necessary to use phosphate fertilizer in most cases. It was suggested that a system of farming involving periodic reseeding of the land to grass would aid materially in increasing the efficient use of the rainfall and at the sunn- lime leave the land less susceptible to wind erosion. GOOD STANDS ()/•' POTATOES: EXPERIMENT Al, EVIDENCE ('ONCER.M.VC FACTORS AFFECTING THEM 11. O. WERNER. I'lliversily of Nebraska Oood stands of potatoes are essential for successful potato growing because they represent Hie most efficient utilization of the seed planted, are essential for maximum yields and for greatest uniformity in size of tubers. Poor stands may often result from planting tubers infected with diseases such as rhlzr otonln, fusarlum or black leg, which cause seed pieces to rot or plants to be stunted or killed prematurely. Tubers infected with one of the virus diseases such as spindle-tuber or mosaic sometimes fail to produce plants or the plants are weak and slow growing. Seed treatment, roguing of seed plats, seed se - lection or use of certified seed potatoes are the accepted methods of avoiding losses from such s.-ed borne diseases. Crop rotation is recom - mended for avoiding losses due. lo diseases resulting from microscopic organisms that live in the soil. However, when heal Iby seed potatoes are planted in soil that has not produced a crop of potatoes within five or six years stands are sometimes very unsatisfactory. Results from numerous experiments conducted in Nebraska and a lew pertinent ones reported from other experiment stations show that maturity of tubers, methods of storage, detree of sprouting, methods of soi! preparation, time of cutting and </seg>
         <seg id="p705">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION method of holding cut seed before planting, time of planting soil moisture content at planting time, and method of planting all may exert a considerable influence upon the stand of plants. It will be ob - served that good stands are secured when sound disease tree seed potatoes with sprout growth just starting and with thoroughly healed cut surfaces are planted at the proper time in soil well supplied with moisture. The alert potato grower wishes to know how to conduct his various operations so as to attain the ideal result regardless of condi - tions. For the purpose of presenting facts that are pertinent to that problem,.data from various experiments are being presented in a very condensed style.

However those from tubers placed into cold storage on April first were practically as good as when cold storage was used for a much longer period. When tubers were placed in cold storage on May 15, after sprouts had started, stands were not quite as good as with earlier storage but they were much better than from tubers continually in the cellar. Spring cold storage as a means of delaying sprout growth has been found to be a very satisfactory method of preserving seed potatoes and securing good stands if potatoes are planted late, especially it soil conditions are not especially desirable. Certain limitations in connection with the use of spring cold storage are dis - cussed in another section. lime of Removal from Cold Storage When potatoes were put into cold storage (38°-40°F.) in the fall - and removed at different times, stands improved with the continuance of cold storage (Table 3). Best stands were produced from the lots held in cold storage till .. or 6 days before planting time in late June. A short warming up period in the cellar is desirable before planting potatoes. The cutting of any seed potatoes causes a rapid rise in the rate of respiration. With rapid respiration considerable heat is generated by the cut seed potato. A shift in temperature from the low cold storage temperature to the high soil temperatures prevailing in late June also causes a very rapid rise in the respiration rate. Thus if potatoes are both cut and moved to a higher temperature at about the same time the rate of respiration may be accelerated so that serious damage may be done to the seed potatoes resulting in a high percentage of rotting seed pieces. These undesirable consequences </seg>
         <seg id="p707">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION can be avoided in part or entirely by removing the seed potatoes from cold storage and cutting them a few days before planting.

His results show that not only was emergence much prompter but final stands were very much better when potatoes were warmed up to 65 T 70° for 10 days before cutting and planting than when they were left at either 32 or 50° F. This warming up of seed potatoes so that sprout - ing is underway at planting time has been found to be of great value when potatoes are planted as an early crop in cold soil. Cutting Seed in Advance of Planting Cutting seed immediately before planting is a satisfactory method if the cut seed is handled carefully so that it does not become over - heated and if soil is moist but not too wet. If the soil is very dry or wet or hot. heavy lo.ss.s may occur when fresh cut seed is used.

Effect of Exposure to Sun Upon Cut Seed Potatoes 'Bright sunshine and low humidity are known to be very dis - astrous to the wound healing process in potatoes.

A very good stand was secured from the lot that was taken directly from the cellar to the field in late afternoon. As the exposure increased in length the damage to stand increased. Covering the seed with burlap, cloth or heavy paper did not provide very satisfactory protection. In this experiment all cut surfaces were carefully turned up so as to be exposed to the sun. On a pile of pota - toes not all seed pieces would be exposed with the cut side up but then the uncut side with the sprouting eyes would be exposed and might suffer similar damage. A similar experiment conducted at Scottsbluff (Table 8) showed that when cut seed was not exposed to the sun better stands were secured if seed was cut 1 or 4 days in advance of planting, but that Table 8.

If late planting is desired because of other advantages it -win he neces - sary to use much, more care than with early plantings in order to get good stands. Some of the matters already discussed—such as proper storage of seed and proper healing of cut surfaces are very im - portant and some of the matters discussed later such as method of soil preparation, packing after planting, seed size, etc. are even more Important than with early planting. Size of Seed Tubers and Size of Seed Pieces In past years it was quite commonly the custom to save the little potatoes for seed. Gradually this custom came into bad repute be - cause yields were frequently very poor. With the development of the present day body of Information concerning the virus diseases it became evident that these more frequently recurlng poor yields were due to seed stocks being infected with virus diseases. Plants thus infected </seg>
         <seg id="p712">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE were weak and produced small tubers. Consequently among the small', tubers sorted out of a bin of potatoes there were many infected tubers. As this practice was continued year after year the situation rapidly became worse and some lines of seed thus became very unproductive. With the development of state seed certification and the improvement of seed stocks by eliminating virus diseases from them the situation has changed. There is now a rapidly growing tendency for careful growers to show a preference for small seed potatoes. This growing preference for small tubers from disease free strains is a very sound one. Probably the most important assets of small seed tubers are that no cutting or at least less cutting is required and that in cutting to a seed piece of a given weight the area of a cut sur - face is very much less with small than with large seed potatoes. As the area of cut surface is reduced per ounce of seed piece planted there is proportionately less opportunity for rot producing organisms to be - come established through the cut surfaces before they heal and there - fore less opportunity for seed piece decay. This becomes especially important when potatoes must be planted when soil conditions are not favorable. For a number of years the literature has been full of reports of experiments showing that stands improve as the size of the seed piece Is Increased and that when moisture and fertility are adequate yields Increase in a similar manner. This Is due to two main factors, one be - ing the greater amount of requisite food material stored in the large seed pieces and the other being the reduction in area of cut surface per ounce of seed as the size of the seed pieces is increased. In 1936 seed potatoes of various sizes were cut into seed pieces of two weights. When seed pieces weighing 0.8 oz. were used (20 pieces per pound) the stand decreased with the increase in size of the tubers from which these pieces were secured (Table 10). Best stands were secured from planting the smallest tubers without cutting. These are often referred to as culls, being the tubers that go through the lower or IV4 " screen of a grader. When the #2 size tubers (that go through a 1-%" screen but not through a 1%" screen) were cut In half stands were not as good but were better than where #1 size tubers were cut into seed pieces of the same weight. As the weight of the #1 seed tubers increased the stand decreased so that pieces cut from seed potatoes weighing 6.8 ounces or more stands were only a little better than 60% in comparison with stands of 85 to 90% when smaller tubers were cut in half or planted whole. When the size of the seed pieces was doubled, to 1.6 oz. (10 per pound) stands were much better than with seed pieces weighing 0.8 oz. This difference occurred when tubers of any size were used. However, with these larger seed pieces best results were always secured </seg>

Results of this kind cannot be expected if any appreciable percentage of disease is present in seed' stocks. Depth of Plowing • Tlere is little experimental information concerning the relation •of dejth of plowing to potato production. Experiments conducted at Alliance indicate that shallow plowing (4 to 6 inches) resulted in pooreij stands every year than medium deep plowing (6-8% Inches) but that very deep, plowing (9%-u inches) generally resulted in poorei stands than did medium plowing.

It remains to be seen whether the deep plowing will give better results when this experiment is repeated again on the same piece of land. In the 5 years reported the tests were conducted on different pieces of land each year. In the year of 1933 when the soil was dry at planting time, stands were very poor but they were much better with deep than with medium or shallow plowing. The summer weed growth was strikingly less with the deep plowing. Time of Plowing In six years there was no significant difference in stands with fall and spring plowing I Table 12).

Method of Planting In 10 tests conducted in 8 years deep planting generally gave better stands than shallow planting when accompanied by deep covering (Table 13). When covering was shallow there was no consistent difference between deep and shallow planting, deep planting having given better stands in the drier springs, shallow planting in the wetter springs. Deep covering almost always gave better yields than shallow covering. Deep planting and deep covering consistenly gave best re - turns. Deep planting was 4 to 5 inches, shallow planting 2 to 3 Inches below the surface of the soil when levelled off. Deep covering was 6 to 8 inches over the seed piece, shallow covering was 1 to 3 inches. (See also Table 14.) </seg>

In general it seems to be the concensus of opinion of those who have studied this question that when irrigation is needed around plant - ing time the best procedure is to irrigate before plowing. The next best procedure is to irrigate in furrows into which potatoes are to be </seg>
         <seg id="p718">718 KEI I |RT HI- .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE planted and the third choice is to "irrigate up" that Is irrigate the planting so as to stimulate growth. If the soil Is dry above the seed pieces sprouts may develop but plants will not get established or grow very much as roots will not be sent out unless the soil is moist. In heavy soils the earlier irrigation is especially important. In sandy soils the later irrigation may be used with less risk than in the heavier soils. In any type of soil, irrigation at planting time need be only sufficient to moisten the soil into which the seed pieces are to be planted. With irrigation after planting the water should be applied in furrows on each side of the row and only enough water should be applied to get moisture to the seed pieces. Great care should be taken to avoid flooding over the rows as this will bring about inadequate aeration and then much rotting will occur. Conclusions Prom experiments and observations in Nebraska and other places it appears that in order to get good stands of plants with the late or main crop planting it is very important to have sound seed that has not lost very much weight in sprouting. Such seed should be protected from the sun or hot drying winds and should be planted in moist soil. If moisture conditions are not satisfactory stand possibilities may be improved by cutting the seed several days in advance of planting and "healing" it under proper conditions and then planting and covering deeply and perhaps packing the soil after planting. If irrigation water is available it should be used before plowing or planting if soil moisture conditions are not ideal. Stands are generally better with early than with late plantings, with large than small seed pieces, with small rather than with large tubers and with early plowing better than with late plowing. In the case of early potatoes—planted when the soil is cold and frequently wet many of these precautions need not be taken. At that time seed treatment to kill rhizoctonia carried on the seed tubers and a warming up period of a week or more are likely to be the most Important things the grower can do to improve stands.

The number in the earlier years was less, but interpolations from near by stations in surround - ing states makes the record for those years fairly accurate. The record covers 61 years from 1877 to 1936. Itis of interest to divide this period into groups of years of different length to determine when, the driest and wettest periods occurred, and to determine whether there is an indication of an upward or downward trend. For simplicity in making equal divisions, the first year la omitted. The 60 year average annual rainfall is 18.09 inches. Dividing into two 30 year periods, the averages are 18 17 and 18.01 inches. In four 15-year periods, the averages are 18 84 17 50 18.10 and 17.93. The first fifteen years were the wettest and the second 15 years the driest of the 60 year period. Dividing Into six 10-yeilr periods the averages are 18.93, 16.82, 18.76, 18.01, 18.53 and .17.49.| Again the first and second periods are the wettest and driest Dividing into twelve 5-year periods, the averages range from 20.56 to 14.97 inches. The fifth period 1902 to 1906 was the wettest and the fourth period 1892 to 1896 the driest. The average for the last five years including 1934 and 1936 is 15.96. T7J etteSt year WaS 1916 with 29-37 inches and the driest year was 1893 with 9.87 inches. It should be kept in mind that these are average records for all stations. Numerous higher and lower records have been made at individual stations. The record of 44.83 for Hayes Center in 1915 is probably the greatest amount of rainfall measured at any one station in western Nebraska in any year. Some low records are 6.63 inches at Ogaliala In 1894; 6.30 inches 7Z * 17T7 C°Unty 1U 1931 ' and at Bridgeport 7.93 inches in 1934, and 7.95 inches in 1936.

         <seg id="p721">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION WESTERN DRY LAND POTATO CROP DEPENDS UPON MOISTURE STOKED IN SOIL H. O. WERNER Department of Horticulture Rains during the growing season may bring about "bumper" potato crops in the western dry land areas, but in most years the production of a potato crop depends more upon the moisture stored in the soil by planting time than upon summer rainfall. During the drouth years of 1934 and 1936 the total amount of rain that the plants could use; that fell between July 1 and September 30 amounted to only 1.44 and 1.22 inches respectively. Nevertheless in these two yearssome of the potato plats yielded respectively 81 and 63 busnels per acre. These plats had been summer fallowed the year prior to planting potatoes; During these same two years potatoes following corn yielded 22 and 30 bushels and following small grain only 5 and 4 bushels per acre respectively. These differences in yield were asso - ciated with differences in soil moisture. According to moisture de - terminations made at the time the plants came through the sollthe moisture that was available to plants In the top 5 feet of soil were equivalent to 6.3 and 6.4 inches of rainfall in the plats that had been fallowed the previous year, 4.6 and 5.0 Inches following corn and only 2.3 and 1.1 inches following small grain. In the latter plat there; was practically no available moisture below the second foot of soil. In these rainless summers the potato plants removed practically Table 1.

This explains why the potato plants following small grain died during August without producing tubers whereas after summer fallow the plants were still green in September and were able to produce a good crop of tubers during the cool short September days which are the most suitable of the season for tuber development. About .2.5 inches of water seem to be required by the plants before they pro- </seg>
         <seg id="p722">REPORT 111-' NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE duce any tubers but beyond this the potato plants seem to produce about 20 bushels of potatoes with each additional inch of water taken out of western dry land soils. If the upper few feet of soil are kept supplied with available moisture during late July and August either by rain - fall or irrigation, yields will be increased greatly. If this additional moisture is not received the plants will draw upon the deeper sub - soil moisture and while they will survive and produce a crop it will necessarily be of limited size because of the difficulties which the plant incurs In getting moisture. A total of about 8 inches of rainfall must be stored in the top 5 feet of soil to replace the moisture removed by a small grain crop. Generally 50% more rainfall or 12 inches must occur in order to permit these 8 inches to be stored by potato planting time because of losses due to run off, snow blowing and evaporation. According to the official rainfall records covering a period of almost 50 years this amount of rainfall (10-12 Inches) or more has occurred between October 1 and June 1 In only about half of the years at Hay Springs and at Kimball. Yield records from potato crops grown under com - parable conditions in the vicinity of Alliance are available for the last 20 crops. These show that a very close relationship existed between Table 2. Soil moist un. in northwestern Nebraska potato fields in late June 11)30 and total bushels per acre produced...

In only seasons was a satisfactory or large crop produced when this pre-planting time rainfall was deficient. In those seasons the June or July rainfall was unusually high. Soil moisture samples secured to a depth of 3 feet in the fields of 18 farmers in 4 Counties during the last week of June in 1936 gen - erally contained very little moisture. Samples from 12 yields that had been in small grain averaged 1.6 inches of moisture stored in the top 3 feet, while 3 after corn averaged 2.6 Inches and 2 after fallow aver - aged 4.2 Inches. The total yields from these groups of fields averaged 10.7, 20.6 and 71.6 bushels per acre respectively. (Detail data for each field are given in table.) There seems to be sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that the rainfall occurring before potato planting time is responsible for more dry land potato crops than is the summer rainfall. Since this winter-spring rainfall is very frequently insufficient to replace the moisture removed by small grain, the most desirable plan is to plant potatoes after summer fallow, with second choice being after corn or beans and after with small grain or sweet clover last choice and to be resorted to only after a very wet winter or spring. Planting after sum - mer fallow or some clean cultivated row crop Is the most effective means of insuring a dry land potato crOp and of keeping down the per bushel production cost. As the potato crop is the most expensive dry land crop to grow and brings in the greatest cash income per acre, efficient production methods are very much to be desired. HOW 03BER STATES ARE HANDLING THEIR POTATO PROBLEMS E. F. McKUNE Supsrvisor of Market Inspection, U. S. D. A., Denver, Colo. The material for the subject assigned to me by your program com - mittee bis been most interesting to assemble, and to me It has revealed several important facts. Even though the subject is supposed to cover only the methods other states are employing to handle their potato problems, I find it impossible to refrain from diverting somewhat to the discussion of local Nebraska conditions. The jlrish potato has been subjected to more legislative action, more quarantines, more rules and regulations and more general dis - cussion than any other fruit or vegetable produced in these United States. The reason for this is probably because It is one of the most important food commodities and because it can be produced In every state in the Union. It hak been my privilege to study legislative acts relating to the </seg>
         <seg id="p724">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE marketing of potatoes of eighteen different states, most of which are late and surplus producing. While most of the states have adopted similar laws with only slight variations to take care of local conditions, other states have found it convenient to use entirely different methods to handle their particular problems. The study of the laws reveals that the states apparently feel that their respective potato industries can best be aided and protected by means of required branding, labeling or tagging the containers to show the correct grades of their contents, or by mandatory inspection, or by a combination of both. A summary of the state laws studied shows the following: One state (Connecticut) requires that potatoes when offered for retail sale shall be labeled or branded with the correct official grade. Two states (lowa, Oklahoma) have rigid laws or rules and regula - tions pertaining only to seed potatoes, especially seed Imported from other states. Four states (Nebraska, Missouri, Wyoming, Colorado) have laws which require them to establish the U. S. potato grades as state stand - ards; also establish inspection on a mandatory basis either in counties, districts or statewide. Two states (Kansas. Texas) have laws permitting the establishing of U. S. grades as state standards and have provisions enabling them to set up shipping point inspection on an optional basis. Three states (Oregon, Louisiana, Montana) have laws that require that the U. S. grades shall be established as state standards, also that potato containers shall be branded, tagged or labeled with the correct grade of their contents and, in addition, require inspection on all ship - ments. The other states seem to be move agreed as to their methods of handling their problems. These six states (Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota) have adopted very similar laws. These laws In general provide that the U. S. grades shall be established as state standards and for the mandatory branding, label - ing or tagging of all containers with the correct official grade con - tained and, in addition, provides for shipping point Inspection on an optional basis. This summary of the different state acts reveals that the majority agree that their problems can best be handled by means of the TJ. S. grades as state standards and by required branding, labeling or tagging of containers with the correct grade of their contents, supplemented by shipping point inspection either on an optional or mandatory basis. </seg>
         <seg id="p725">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION A further study of the different acts indicates that by far the greater majority of the surplus producing states have enacted laws which appear to. regulate shipments of their own producers and ship - pers and protect consumers ln other states. The question may well be asked here: Why are the different state legislative bodies so anxious to protect the consumer, especially those consumers who live outside of the state enacting the law? The answer is this: Any industry to be successful must have a continuous and steady demand for Its commodity. This is accomplished through satisfying of customer demands. In organized Industry the output can usually be made to conform to consumer demands by means of an ex - ecutive order from those in charge. The potato industry is generally unorganized or at best only partly organized; consequently it appears that controlled quality can best be secured through legislative action. It might not be out of place at this time to discuss briefly some of the changes which take place in the development of any commercial potato producing section and to make a survey of the position Nebraska now occupies in the potato industry. If we were to study the history of all commercial potato produc - ing sections we would find that they pass through a series or changes, many of which are very similar. Early in their history we find as a rule that the quality is exceptionally good and the market demand is Btrong. This can be attributed to the fact that the soil is new and the insect pests and diseases are few and ineffective and a good quality is produced. As time progresses the soil'as a whole becomes less fa - vorable to potato production. Insect pests and plant diseases become more prevalent and harder to control, all of which has its effect on the quantity and quality produced. It is human nature to desire something possessed by the other fellow, especially if that "somthing" is of exceptional value. Usually about Ithe time a district reaches Its peak in production some other section finds that they, too, can produce potatoes in commercial quanti - ties. These sections have the advantage over the older district in that their soil is new and growing conditions are more favorable. The re - sult is that the older district must give way in the better markets for the new. The usurping of the better markets by new districts haß repeated itself many times in potato history. However, during the past ten years no new late commercial sections have, to my knowledge, been de - veloped with the exception, possibly, of the Klamath Falls district ln Oregon which came into commercial production at about that time. With the exception of the Klamath Falls section all of the large commercial districts have the same or similar problems to combat. All </seg>
         <seg id="p726">REPORT or NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have soil conditions which are not as favorable as In the beginning, insect pests and diseases are more prevalent and harder to control with the almost unlversial result of poorer quality. The districts that have been able to hold their markets in spite of the production of poorer quality potatoes have done so by means of rigid grading, sorting and in general meeting the consumer demands. What are some of these consumer demands? We are often too prone to think of the potato consumer as not being particular, to whom a potato is a potato regardless of quality. But If we watch him select a lot from an open bin in a grocery store we will soon be convinced that he is an expert on quality. The consumer not only demands quality, but he insists on a certain quality. He not only insists on uniform quality, but demands, in addition, his favorite color. The demand for color not only varies ln diSerent communities, but has a tendency to change over a period of years. The consumer for many years was not particular about a slight amount of dirt on potatoes. Now in certain markets he prefers a washed product. It is doubtful if washed stock originally came at the demand of the consumer. It probably came as the result of some overanxious shipper who wished to secure a premium price. Regard - less ot the origin of the idea, now in order to sell in certain large mar - kets at top prices it is almost necessary to wash the stock. Markets are more and more demanding uniform quality ill packages. They are no longer satisfied to accept field run or partly graded stock un - less the price Is very reasonable. Markets now want straight cars of U. S. No. 1 or U. S. No. 2 quality and this year will handle straight cars of culls. This is proven by the fact that U. S. No. 2 quality is bringing practically the same price as U. S. Commercials, which re - quires 8 0 per cent or more to be U. S. No. 1 stock. The markets were once content with potatoes in any kind of sack. Now we are compelled to use new or recleaned branded, evenweighed sacks. Some markets go so far as to Insist on new white cotton branded sacks. What is the statues of Nebraska in the potato industry and are we keeping in stride with our competing states? Nebraska holds an enviable position in the potato world, largely because you are heavy producers of the Triumph variety and because you produce a very execptional quality product. You certified seed growers are to be commended on your output. Your seed is in big demand by all growers within your freight territory. </seg>
         <seg id="p727">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION These growers are willing to pay a substantial premium to secure your product. You have secured and maintained these markets by care - ful grading and sorting and in general meeting the demands of your consumers. Just a few words about the table stock potatoes In Nebraska. This has been discussed at many previous meetings, yet it may not be out of place to discuss it again. I have just stated that you produce a very exceptional quality product. I mean just that. This year your quality was even better than it has been for several years. The quality of your stock is good up to the time of harvesting, but beginning with the harvest and until the stock is placed ln the car the majority of the growers damage their crop by rough handling. This damage ranges from a small percentage by some growers to more than fifty per cenjt by others. Much of the crop is so badly damaged that it is economically Impossible to put up aU. S. No. 1 grade. This is the one reason jwhy the majority of Nebraska potatoes are sold as U, S. Com - mercialk Bruising and general rough handling are also the reason why the retailers in the eastern cities of your own state have to resort to the handling of Idaho and Colorado potatoes for their customers. The speaker recently made a survey of seven leading retail stores in the City of Lincoln; All of these stores were handling Idaho Bur - banks, jsither U. S. No. 1 or U, S. No. 2 quality. Four were handling both Idaho Burbanks and Colorado Red McClures. Two were handling Idaho Burbanks and Nebraska Triumphs. Or, in other words, only two stores of the seven were handling Nebraska Triumphs. The Triumph potato ranks high in eating qualities. There are many who prefer it to the Russet Burbank or Red McClure, but as you know, its skin is extremely thin and is very susceptible to bruising and cracking. Some may contend:that bruising and cracking cannot be prevented; yet I believe that there is plenty of evidence on record to provtj that this damage can be held to-a very low percentage. No doubt there are growers right here in this audience who, If they would, could tell of actual experiences they have had In the eliminating of handling damage. This last part of my talk perhaps does not entirely conform to my subject, but was given with the idea in mind that a true picture of the Nebraska position would not be amiss. At this time I wish to thank your program committee for asking me to appear on your program. Also toj assure you that the criticisms that "I have made [have been offered jivith the sole purpose in mind of bettering the potato situa - tion in Nebraska.: </seg>
         <seg id="p728">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE REVIEW OF THE 1036 CROP SEASON The 193 6 season will go down In history as one of the most un - usual potato years. For the irrigation growers it was one of the most profitable years ever experienced. To 90 per cent or more of the dry land potato growers it was one of the most disastrous years if not the most so of any year thus far experienced In western Nebraska. As a result of lack of rainfall for a long period of time prior to planting in June 1936, there were very few potato fields with more than 18 inches of moist soil at planting time. With no summer rain - fall of any consequence, with high temperatures and with serious in - vasions of grasshoppers, blister beetles and jack rabbits, the inevitable doom of most of the dry land potato fields was evident in late July. Only a few small areas were favored with summer rain and there a crop was produced. However, in several parts of western Nebraska very good crops of potatoes were grown on dry land when the crop was planted on land that had been summer fallowed. When planted on land following corn the crop was worth harvesting. Following small grain the potato crops were frequently not harvested. In the irrigation regions there was a shortage of water—but even so—the yields were good and as everything could be sold and prices were higher, returns were such as will be quoted for many years. For some unknown reason flea beetles and psyllids were not serious except in a very few very early planted fields but wilt was rather serious. This season marked a very definite shift by the certified seed potato industry into the irrigation regions. Most of the 1936 certified seed crop was irrigated. According to all reports this irrigated certified seed gave good results in the south where it was planted in spite of an old prejudice against it in many regions. This and the destruction or serious reduction of many stocks of seed of dry land growers may re - sult ln a very material change in the potato picture. One unusual aspect has been that of dry land seed growers getting seed potatoes from irrigation growers. Another significant and interesting result of the several drouth years has been the establishment of irrigation wells on table lands in Box Butte county and in the Lodgepole Valley in Kimball county. In Scottsbluff county several very large track side potato cellars were built. Three of these were built by grower's cooperatives. There is every indication that the potato crop in the North Platte Valley is going to be of increasing importance. With the passage of the winter and early spring and still no rain of consequence, potato prospects on dry land do not look very good for the 193 7 potato crop. In view of these numerous subnormal years farmers are concluding that the dry land potato crop In western Ne- </seg>
         <seg id="p729">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION . braska 1 must be grown with the assumption that every year is going to be a dry one and farm accordingly by fallowing more land and using it for potatoes. During the year practically nothing further was heard concerning potato j control legislation. An effort was made to get a mandatory potato | shipping inspection bill thru the legislature but it failed of passage probably because of rush of business in the closing days of the session. Another interesting bit of potato news was the installation as the senator in the United States senate of Alien Ellender of Houma, Louisiana. Mr. Ellender is well known to many Nebraska certified seed potato .growers having purchased his seed potatoes in Nebraska for many years. He is one of the most successful potato growers in the entire south.
