PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSES Seventv-two public grain warehouses were licensed by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission during the year 1934. and ap - proximately three hundred and fifty inspections of grain warehouses a-ere made Despite the continued depression the Commission "S </seg>
            <seg id="p016">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT proud to report that no losses resulted to any party storing grain in a grain warehouse licensed by this department. In order that the cost of storing grain may be reduced to the citizens of Nebraska doing business in public grain warehouses the Commission has recommended to the legislature and hopes to have made into a law a provision allowing the Commission to exercise its own discretion in fixing the amount of bond which public grain ware - housemen shall be obliged to furnish, also giving the Commission permission to fix the fees for storage which shall be charged by the public grain warehouses to parties storing grain. The registration of warehouse receipts continued to be a very active branch of public warehouse work. Five hundred and six ware - house receipts were registered during the year 1034. STORAGE OF GRAIN ON FARMS The use and workability of the Farm Storage law is fast be - coming better known, and the law is being adopted for more general use in the future. Banks are using it as a basis for further loans on small grain, and the Commission hopes that the loans on small grain will be facilitated generally through the use of the Kami Storage Act. The Commission has competent inspectors in each county, ready and able to seal and grade grain on farms, and farm storage certificates can be issued for use as collateral to loans without delay in any part of the state. The Commission is recommending to the legislature that it be granted authority to fix the amount of fees which shall be charged for farm storage of grain. The 1933 law provided for a minimum fee of $5.00. Due to careful management and economic handling the Commission has found that it can carry on this work at a fee less than $5.00. The Commission feels that if the fixing of the fee is placed in its hands that it can and will immediately reduce the charges for sealing and inspection of grain on farms. In connection with the above a careful audit of all fees re - ceived and expenditures made in sealing some forty-eight thousand cribs for corn loans by the Federal Government discloses that the Commission has on hand the sum of $122,673.56 available for re - turn, and it is asking the 1935 session of the legislature to empower the Commission to return the whole amount of this unexpended bal - ance to the farmers and corn producers who paid in these fees to be returned on a pro rata basis to the parties paying in accordance with the amount paid by them. A complete record kept by the Com - mission will disclose in each case the amount of money paid by the </seg>
            <seg id="p017">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION i . producer and the amount of expense which the Commission was put to in sealing, inspecting, reinspecting and certifying the producer's grain. We have reason to believe that the legislature will look with favor upon this recommendation, and that for the first time in the history of the state of Nebraska a fee collected by a tax-consuming agency will not be all used, but will be voluntarily returned in part to the persons paying the same. , In this connection it is of further interest to note that the in - spection and sealing of corn on the farm for corn loans in the state of Nebraska was handled at a smaller cost to the producer in Ne - braska than in any other state where corn loans were made. The cost per crib for inspection and certification of the corn in cribs on farms in Nebraska was slightly less than $3.80 per crib. </seg>

ABSTRACT OF OPINIONS TO RAILWAY COMMISSION FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE January 10, 1 .":{.: An agreement between a municipality and an electric light and power company for street lighting at a stipulated amount per month will not be relieved against as exces - sive in the absence of fraud or some other equitable ground of relief. January 20, 1034: S. F. 327 (Chapter 4, Laws 1933) construed and held to require the Commission to cause grain to be inspected for the number of applicants and under the circumstances out - lined in Section 3 of said act, without additional charge for mileage over and above the amount of the fees fixed by Section 4 of the act. March 15, 1034: Sections 11 and 12, Grain Warehouse Laws of 1933, con - strued. Held that where contracts for grain storage ex - pire June 30th — except contracts as to shelled corn expiring March 31st of each year, when the original contracts for storage and the original receipts have been cancelled, new contracts for storage have been made and new certificates issued and presented for registration, the fees provided in section 6 of the act, and also in rule "V" of the Commis - sion, applied to such new registrations. April 27, 1034: Item 4 of the special endorsement upon a policy of the Yellow Diamond Coach Lines held not to cover the loss of a suitcase by a passenger in a car covered under the above policy. 'May 10, 1034: Section 88-222, 1933 Supplement to 1929 Compiled Statutes construed. Held that where an application Is complete </seg>
            <seg id="p112">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT prior to July 1st, except for the approval of a bond, the fee having been paid in and passed to the State Treasurer, the bond may be approved and license issued subsequent to July 1st without the exaction of another fee. May 23, 1034: A controversy between an electric light and power com - pany maintaining a transmission line and a property owner owning trees which project over into the road along which the transmission line runs, and interfere with said lines, is a matter as to which the Commission may, without impro - priety, offer its good offices for settlement. June 1, 1934: S. F. 327, Session Laws, 1933 (Farm Storage Act) con - strued. Held that the expense of partial releases of ware - house certificates made necessary in the proper functioning of the act in connection with the corn loan program of the Commodity Credit Corporation is essential to the proper enforcement of the act, and should be paid out of the amount paid in by the applicant and no additional charge made therefor. June 20, 1034: Section 86-206, Compiled Statutes, 1929, as to division of tolls, construed so as to provide that the company originat - ing the message shall receive 15% and the company ter - minating the message 10% of the toll charge, the re - mainder to be divided between the companies carrying the message intermediate these exchanges. Held, also, that the allotment of five units for switching is proper only where the switching occurs on the inter - mediate transmission, and does not apply either to the originating or terminating exchange. Held, further, that the case is not altered where the call originates on a line switched into the originating exchange, August 13, 1934: Endorsement for liability insurance policy covering busses under Chapter 150, Laws 1927, and Section 60-101 to 60-105, Compiled Statutes, 1929, which is proposed to be substituted for form of endorsement now in use, examined and Commission advised not to approve the proposed pro - vision but to adhere to the present provision. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">•!• NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION August 14, 1934: Resolution 102,' Supplement 4, Nebraska State Railway Commission, examined and held that where an insurance company has set up a surplus to policyholders of $650, - 323.05, that this complies with the requirement of the resolution even though the same involves capital to the amount of $400,000.00. September 21, 1934: Section 88-320, 1933 Supplement to 1929 Compiled Statutes, construed. Held that where the Commodity Credit Cor - poration has made arrangements to increase loans made to individuals on corn warehoused under the Farm Warehouse Law, and under the rules established by said C. C. C, it will be necessary to pay off the outstanding loan and to make a new loan and to present as collateral a warehouse receipt issued by the Commission; that on the canceling of the warehouse receipt of any applicant, and the issuance of a new receipt to him, under such circumstances no new fee should be exacted from such applicant either for the release of the old warehouse certificate or for the issuance of the new. September 28, 1034: Where an appeal has been had from an order of the Com - mission entered on a complaint as to reparations on freight rates, and the Supreme Court has under stipulation of the parties dismissed the appeal, the parties may enter into a stipulation before the Commission, agreeing that the com - plaint may be withdrawn and the order of the Commission canceled and annulled. November 7, 1934: The right of a telephone company to cross a railroad right - of-way with wires is not an unqualified right, but is sub - ject to regulation by the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion, even though the telephone company carries its wires on poles along a public highway where it crosses the right - of-way in question. December 1, 1934: Freight overcharges may be recovered in the absence of statute, but where reparations are sought by reason of the existing rates being attacked as unreasonable, or other- </seg>
            <seg id="p114">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT wise unlawful, the right to reparations depends upon the validity ot the statute granting them. December 0, 1934: A mutual telephone company, serving only its own members, may change its method of operation and sell or dispose of telephone lines which are owned by it and which are now being switched through certain exchanges. December 7, 1934: Section 86-319, Compiled Statutes, 1929, prescribing a pen - alty for tapping or connecting with a telephone line for the purpose of eavesdropping, quoted. December 7, 1931: C. S. Brown, who was granted permission to construct a line for the transmission of electrical energy, held to have the power to sell his interest in said line to another with - • out the approval of the Commission, provided, however, that the transfer should be reported to the Commission for their records because of the continuing jurisdiction of the Commission over such power lines. December 8, 1934: Sectlon 75-1201, Compiled Statutes, 1929, providing fees on the issuance of securities held not to apply to an applica - tion to reduce the par value of the common stock of a power company from $100.00 to $50.00 a share, since the trans - action is merely an accounting transaction and does not in any wise relate to the issuance or sale of stocks or other securities. </seg>
