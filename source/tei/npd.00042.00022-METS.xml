            <seg id="p003">THE BOARD OK COMMISSIONERS 467 NEBRASKA INDUSTRIAL HOME, MILFORD, NEBRASKA To his Excellency, Honorable Keith Neville, (jovcrnor, and to the Honorable Members of the Board of Com- I. Holcomb, and Eugene 0. M 01/ field. Gentlemen : I, hereby, submit to you the fifteenth biennial report of Nebraska Industrial Home covering the period from Decem - ber 1, 1916, to December 1, 1918. So much of the same ground is covered by each re - port, that I fear, to many of you, the summary will sound familiar, but when we realize that this report will fall into the hands of many who know nothing of the "Home," or what the state is endeavoring to accomplish through it, I feel that it is imperative to repeat what has been said in previous reports in order to give a full account of the work. The main object of the "Home" continues to be the restoration of the unmarried mother to society, by shelter - ing, protecting and encouraging her at a time when she feels that almost the gates of heaven have closed against her, and by teaching her by precept and practice what God wants her to be, that she may go out and take her place in the world and prove herself an asset and not a liability to society. Statistics gathered from all countries show that the death rate among illegitimate children is far higher than among legitimate children. This excess death rate is not due to any inherited weakness, but almost entirely to the bad environment into which their illegitimacy naturally throws them. Through this "Home" the state gives the illegitimate child a chance to be born where it can have the best of medical care and proper nourishment and thereby often saving its life and giving to society a strong healthy citizen in place of a dead baby or a blind, crippled or diseased child, which must always be a burden to itself and the community in which it lives. missionera of Stoti Institutions, Henry Chrdea, si lux </seg>
            <seg id="p004">468 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OP The "Home" not only gives this physical care to the child but it also makes it possible for the child to be placed into environments, where it can grow up to manhood or womanhood without being constantly reminded of its un - fortunate birth. The state can well be proud of a number of these chil - dren who through this "Home" were enabled to grow up into useful, respected citizens; many of them graduates of our best schools and filling positions of honor and trust, and many more are on the road to success, who, according to reliable statistics, would, in all probability, have become state charges in some way, had not the state provided so kindly and wisely for them, thereby giving them an equal chance with the child of more fortunate birth. We feel that the work of the biennium has, as a whole, been a success. The health of the institution has been ex - ceptionally good; we have been able to find good homes for nearly all of our babies, who were for adoption; have been very fortunate in finding desirable employment for our girls, and most of the girls are proving themselves worthy of the confidence, which was placed in them and are giving general satisfaction to their employers. We have had a very good class of girls to work with and, with but few exceptions, each has put forth her best efforts to learn all she could while in the "Home" and to do what she could to make it happy and beneficial for all. This we greatly appreciate in the girls. There has been but little change in the general work, except that special emphasis has been placed upon the vo - cational training. Realizing, as we did, the absolute neces - sity of most of the girls being able to go out and support themselves upon leaving, we felt that the vocational train - ing would be of more benefit to them and have, therefore, spent more time upon it. Some of our more fortunate girls have had fairly good school advantages before coming here. These we have been able to send out as teachers, stenog - raphers, clerks and practical nurses, and some have, upon leaving, gone back into school. But a large number of our girls do not have the education to take up these lines of </seg>
            <seg id="p005">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 469 work and in the short time they are here it is impossible to do much for them along scholastic lines. But we are able to accomplish much along the line of general housework, cooking, cleaning, mending, sewing, laundry work, care of children, nursing, fine needlework and so on. So that many of them go out as good housekeepers with an entirely differ - ent idea as to what constitutes a well regulated home and wholesome, well prepared and properly served meals. Aside from the regular work done in the institution we have tried to do what we could for the Red Cross. Every girl In the institution joined the Red Cross, so that we had a 100 per cent membership. Some did not have the $1.00 membership fee, so work had to be provided for them, that they might earn it. A number of articles were made by the girls and sold and the money given to the Red Cross; a deal of time was spent under a certified instructor in the making of surgical dressings. MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TRAINING Every evening a short chapel exercise is conducted by one of the teachers. On Sunday the regular International lesson is studied, and splendid interest has been manifested. We also have a well organized and thoroughly alive Chris - tian Endeavor society. Not only at these meetings, but each day and in all departments, whenever and wherever opportunity affords, we try to impress the girls with the absolute necessity of right living, what we teach in the chapel, we try to have them practice on their details and at their play. LIBRARY A number of new books has been added to our library through the State Library Commission, as well as a nice lot of magazines provided. Once a week books are checked off to the girls to be taken to their rooms, but the library is open all of the time and a girl may go in and spend any spare time, that she has, reading, and every day as soon as detail work closes, a number can be found reading in the library. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">470 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF SEWING ROOM We feel that we must make special mention of the work done in this department the past two years. The fol- lowing table will give an idea of the amount of work done, and when we realize that many of the girls had never run a sewing machine, or worn a thimble, to say nothing about cutting or fitting, or doing any kind of fancy needlework before they entered, we feel that they have accomplished a great deal in this department. Each girl, in the past two years, has taken with her a nice little wardrobe, consisting of one good dress, three bungalow aprons, two corset covers, two night gowns and underskirts, all of which were made and nicely trimmed with hand-made lace or embroidered by her. With but very few exceptions they have taken a great interest in doing this work, each trying to have her outfit look the best. A number after being gone a few months, have written back and told how much pleasure they have gotten out of their clothes, also how thankful they were for what they had learned in sewing, that they had been able to do all of their plain sewing and in many instances had sewed for others.

But this year, we raised very little and almost nothing for winter. Our alfalfa has died out and will have to be resown next year. REPAIRS A number of much needed improvements have been made this biennium. The first, of which, was the building of a modern dairy barn, this was something that had been needed for years; two large high-pressure boilers were in - stalled, in place of the one low-pressure and one small high - pressure; a well with an electric pump has been put in, which now supplies us with an abundance of good water; a new storeroom and coal house were built; new roofs and ceilings were put on the porches of the main buildings, and some other outside work was done on these buildings and the laundry. Very little inside work has been done the past two years, therefore some will have to be done next year, also some more outside work will be needed. NEEDED EQUIPMENTS, REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS Our most urgent needs in the way of equipments are an automatic anaesthetizer for our hospital and an electric tumbler and washer for our laundry. During the winter months it is impossible for us to get our laundry work done as it should be with the machinery that we have, and this necessitates the running of the laundry every day in the I'illow slips, embroidered 7S Fancy baby dresses 16 Embroidered baby coats L'orset covers, with crocheted yoke or embroidered no 3owns with crocheted yokes or embroidered 220 : T nder skirts embroidered or crocheted edge 110 Waists, trimmed 11(1 la&lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS week, whereas, if we had the needed machinery the work could be done in much less time, and with less help. An - other needed equipment is a feed grinder with motor. This would enable us to lay in our grain in the fall, when it is cheaper and to have the freshly ground feed for our stock. As it is now, we must buy the ground feed, which is often of a poor quality, much more expensive and impossible to care for in great quantities without a great deal of waste. During the last two years, a great many of our fruit trees have died, and unless a new orchard is set out soon, it will only be a short time until there will be no fruit at the institution. This would certainly work a great hard - ship, as the fruit means so much. We also need some small shrubbery. The walks and drives are badly in need of attention. The cottage, which is occupied by the farmer's family, is located near the main buildings. This should be moved further away as it makes it bad for the institution and also for the family living in it. I, therefore, ask for an appro - priation to be made to cover this expense. We must have the following new buildings: horse barn, hay barn, feeding barn for cattle, implement house, silo and piggery. The old horse barn, which is located entirely too near the main buildings, has been in use ever since the institu - tion was established and is past repairing. There is no room in it, in which to store feed for winter use, and it is also impossible to make it comfortable for the horses. The hay barn, if it can be called such, and feed shed for cattle, is just ready to fall down, and it is impossible to make it stand another year. We have no silo and with the number of cows, which we must keep, we feel that this is a much needed im - provement. There is no house or shed in which to care for the implements. We have practically no place in which to care for our hogs, and therefore ask that a building for this purpose be provided. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF 474 LAND There is only a very small tract of land in connection with this institution, so it is impossible to raise the garden and feed, which we could easily do, if we only had the land. In an institution where there are so many small children, it is absolutely necessary that we have plenty of good, pure milk. The state now has a good little dairy herd, all that we can care for with no more land, but it is only about one-half as large as it should be. So we most urgently re - quest, that more land be provided. There is an eighty-acre tract adjoining the institution, which is for sale, and which would be just what the institution needs, and could be handled nicely.
