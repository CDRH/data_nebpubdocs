            <seg id="p007">GENERAL STATEMENT This report is made for His Excellency, the Governor of the State of Nebraska, the members of the State Legislature, and the public. Whatever success the deFiartment has had during the two years is due to the earnest cooperation of the department heads and their able corps of assistants. The State Superintendent assumes full re - sponsibility for mistakes which the department has made. Any credit really belongs to the directors who have worked for the state un - ceasingly. Education, its activities, personnel, organization, and ad - ministration have come to be one of the most important parts of our everyday life. There is direct relationship between education and wealth. It is absolutely impossible for an uneducated nation to be wealthy, to use and enjoy the things that are to be found in everyday use in a nation of educated people. The nations outstanding in their expenditures for education are the nations outstanding in the accumu - lation of wealth. Likewise, the nations outstanding in illiteracy and the lack of attention paid to universal education are the nations of low economic wealth at the present time. Public opinion is moving towards a realization that the field of educational obligation to the rising generation is soon to be as large as the whole range of human activity and interest. With this en - larged conception of the obligation of the state for the education of its youth and for the education of its citizens in general should be mentioned the advances being made in the direction of the develop - ment of scientific technics in all phases of educational work. Public opinion is the force that is relentlessly demanding more and greater advancement and development in the field of education. Out of an enlightened public opinion come the demands for new buildings, more skillful staffs of teachers, greater educational expendi - tures and educational advancement in general. The very life of a democracy depends upon the universal and equitable education of each generation of youths as they come upon the scene of action. The State of Nebraska, as will be seen elsewhere in this report, is giving generous support to her schools. We urge all state officials to study the facts given in this report. We are making an effort in the report to give a fair knowledge, a sort of bird's-eye view, as it were, of the field of education here in Nebraska. Normal Training The present administration has been thoroughly committed to the need of continuing the work of normal training. Until such time as </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT the institutions of higher learning reorganize and point their work as well as their faculty mind at least partly towards the preparation of teachers for rural schools it will be necessary, if we are to have teachers with any kind of training at all, for the normal training high schools to continue doing this work. This must not be con - sidered in any way a criticism of the management of the state insti - tutions of higher learning. Their neglect to prepare teachers for the rural schools may be exactly the right policy for them. We are not interested in that discussion here. To be sure, there is somewhat of a surplus of teachers holding the Third Grade Elementary Certificate, but the turn-over is so great every year and the withdrawal from the profession of teaching so large that it would be a very short time until our rural schools would be suffering for trained teachers were the present program withdrawn. The normal training high schools are meeting this situation now. For a more complete discussion of this subject see the report on Normal Training activities elsewhere in this communication. Adult Immigrant Education The biggest piece of Americanization work attempted in recent years is that of adult immigrant education authorized by the last legislature. The response of school officials to their duties, on one hand, and of large numbers of good residents in Nebraska to their opportunities, on the other hand, has been very gratifying. We wish to urge here serious consideration for the subject of adult immigrant education in general. Correlation of Educational Activities A very short survey would show that there are at least seven or eight important lines of state and federal control of educational activities going on in the state. Each of these lines has its own separate governing board, its own staff of overhead organization and expense. Some day citizens of Nebraska will awake to the need of correlating these activities more nearly under a central and unify - ing control. Much overlapping and contradictional work can be saved on the one hand, while on the whole much more definite and sys - tematic progress can be made by such a course of action. What is needed from the standpoint of business efficiency and economy in state education is one centralized board of education having in con - trol and direction all of the state-supported educational agencies in the state. Time may not yet be ripe for a such a movement. Character Education One of the outstanding pieces of legislation passed in the last legislature was Senate File No. 236 making it the duty of every </seg>
            <seg id="p009">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 9 teacher in the state to emphasize in her teaching and managing of her pupils, common honesty, morality, courtesy, obedience to the laws, respect for the national flag and for the constitution of the United States and of Nebraska, respect for their parents and home, and the dignity and necessity of honest labor. The department has lost no opportunity to further work of this type in all the schools of the state under the mandate of the law. A course of study with a supplement was printed and put into the hands of every teacher in the state. Public opinion is wide awake in its demand for more attention on the part of the schools to this important matter. The State Superintendent realizes better than any one else that the Department has accomplished too little in this line. The problem of citizenship training towers like an overpower - ing need in these present times of disorganization, carrying along as they do ideas of social and economic overturn. Already splendid work in character education is being done by organizations independent of the schools, such as: Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, Junior Red Cross, Girl Reserves, Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., 4-H clubs and many other fine organizations of this type. Health Program There is a crying need for a state-wide health program. Public sentiment of the state is ready and waiting for such a program to be put on. Money is lacking, however, to provide personnel for this important phase of our curricular program. Many organizations and societies are wide awake to the need of health training and health preservation. It is to be hoped that soon the State of Nebraska will be able to see the wisdom of providing for a unified state-wide pro - gram of health, including that of mental hygiene. Cooperative Enterprises There exist in Nebraska today large numbers of fraternal organ - izations and clubs that are interested in civic life and in civic better - ment. Nearly all of these groups have a definite interest in educa - tion. Few people have yet dreamed of the possibilities that could be realized for the improvement of education in general if these organizations could be harmonized and correlated with the work of the schools throughout the state. They are all to be congratulated and encouraged for their interest in education. Rural Schools and Rural Parent-Teacher Associations During the present biennium the department has done everything it could in cooperating with the state and national group of parents </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT and teachers to promote rural parent-teacher association work. The National Congress of Parents and Teachers has furnished a number of trained organizers to do work in Nebraska. A more specific report of this phase will be found later on in the Division of Rural Educa - tion. The salaries and expenses of these National workers have all been borne by the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. It is our belief that the schools of any community will rise no higher than the public opinion of the community demands. There seem to be abroad three or four erroneous ideas with regard to rural education. First, there seems to be some sort of an idea that rural people are inferior to urban and city folks. Even the rural people sometimes appear to have developed an inferiority complex. Second, the idea seems to prevail that rural life is lacking in richness, pleasure, profit and social values; that the rural people are totally unable to help solve even their own problems; and that some - how the poor degraded ruralist must be uplifted by a race of over - wise superior beings living, of course, in the towns and cities. Third, that the ruralist is a sort of social and economic outcast who is not even vitally interested in his own welfare. And, finally, that the rural schools are uniformly inferior as com - pared with the schools of the urban and city centers. Rural life, because of its universality and geographical spread, is naturally much less coherent and self-conscious than any other sec - tion of American life. It should not be considered as separate and apart from urban and city life, but really as an important part of, or closely related to, the rest of the body politic. That the rural regions have always been a huge reservoir of labor, industry, genius and talent from which business and com - merce have recruited many of their brightest minds should be com - mon knowledge to all. Every city in the land, every industry is honeycombed with posts manned by individuals who have had their beginnings, their education and their character formation in the rural regions of the country. A very superficial observation of actual rural conditions in any part of the big state of Nebraska will show con - vincing proofs of a rural status of living, rich in all sorts of social, economic and cultural values. It is most unfortunate that a state of mind has come into existence, apparently common to many classes of society, that places the ruralist </seg>
            <seg id="p011">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 11 with his problems separate and apart from other groups of our social and economic life. Instead of this, the ruralist should be thought of not as an individual, separate and apart from the rest of the com - munity, but as an important part of the whole group with all his interests closely tied in and related to the interests of the other sub - divisions of the whole. The rural school along with other so-called rural problems has suffered in the development of this state of mind. That many deplor - ably weak rural schools are to be found in the country today no one will deny; but it would be difficult to find rural schools any place worse than can be found in almost any city of the land. Urban and city schools have often assumed vast superiority as compared with rural schools. On the other hand, large numbers of rural schools can be found equal to the best that any city can produce. The large number of fine, up-to-date rural school buildings now coming into existence are eloquent proof of that statement. The predominant factor in any situation is the teaching element. Given a finely trained, conscientious and enthusiastic teacher, whether she is working in a one-room sani - tary wooden schoolhouse or in some of the marble palaces of the city, you will find the results in the lives and the characters of the youngsters to be approximately equal. Nebraska is recognizing the importance of superior rural school teaching by presenting standards for better school teaching and awarding recognition cards to those teachers who show outstanding merit in the rural field. There has undoubtedly developed in the last twenty-five years a tendency to judge the value and worth of schools by the large salaries of the adminis - trative officers and by the material out of which the buildings are built rather than by that fine and delicately poised relationship that exists between the individual teacher and her little family of boys and girls. Some of these times the rural mind is going to rebel and cast off this inferiority complex regarding rural schools and rural life in general and assert itself in politics, in business and industry, as well as in education. Agriculture, and that means rural life, is and always will be the basic industry upon which all the prosperity of this country rests. Self-consciousness and self-assertiveness of the rural mind when once aroused will speedily put to rout the economic and business vultures of the country who may be, seemingly, perfectly willing to strangle the life out of any industry, agriculture included, in order to reap profit and larger dividends on money invested in stocks and bonds. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT If our hypothesis, that the standard of the American school is based upon and has grown out of public opinion, has any merit, then the best way to improve schools is to cultivate, promote and vitalize public opinion relative to the schools in any particular community. The rural school is no exception to this principle. It is the judgment of this department that the organization of rural Parent-Teacher Associations, officered and manned by the rural people themselves, is the proper place to begin to work for the betterment of the rural schools, in so far as they need betterment. We often hear of "the rural school problem". It is to be doubted whether or not there is any one rural school problem separate and apart from other school problems. Here, again, we have the inferiority complex at work. Proper stimulation of public opinion related to rural schools within the rural districts themselves will ultimately prove the solu - tion of whatever rural school problem may exist. This is the pro - cedure that has always worked in the city schools, and there is no reason why it will not work with equal success in the rural districts. Institutions of Higher Learning Nebraska is confronted with an unprecedented growth in her state - supported institutions of higher education. These include the Uni - versity of Nebraska and the four state teachers colleges situated at Peru, Kearney, Chadron, and Wayne. Additions to the physical plants are sorely needed at all of these points but the predominant need is additional money with which to hold outstanding faculty men who have already made their reputation in Nebraska and to provide for the enlargement of the teaching personnel of these institutions. Unless these institutions receive larger appropriations soon we will be facing a period not only of educational inadequacy but of lowered quality in instruction and the products of scholarship. Child Welfare We mentioned above the department's attitude with regard to the organization of Parent-Teacher Associations. Briefly speaking, the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, whether city or rural in its application, is built around the idea of child welfare. The child - hood of the nation must be conserved, preserved, protected and edu - cated if future generations are going to do for humanity what we have a right to expect of them. Each generation of children begins exactly at zero so far as education is concerned. The only chance for improvement of the race lies in our ability to make each suc - ceeding generation better than the one preceding. The problem of education is not only to educate each generation as well as the one preceding, but in addition to this, its main concern must be to make </seg>
            <seg id="p013">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 13 in each generation as much progress as possible over and above the accomplishments of the generation before. Of what use to the nation is the acquisition of unlimited wealth, political power, and prestige unless each generation of citizens conies to its Bask with the intellectual training and character to properly deal with the problems of its time? Equalization of Opportunity The Nebraska State Teachers Association through Dr. Paul Mort of Columbia University has made a study of the school finances of Nebraska. The purpose of this study was, first, to find certain funda - mental and basic facts regarding the distribution of school finances as applied to the whole state educational system and, second, to devise ways and means which could be used to manage the finances of the state so as to bring about greater equalization of opportunity. We recommend this study of the Nebraska State Teachers Associa - tion for careful consideration by all of those interested in progres - sive education. The inequality and unfairness of the present scheme of taxation are apparent to all. Farm lands, our homes, and the merchants' goods on the shelf carry an unjust proportion of the tax burden. There is, on the other hand, evidence to show that we have two billions of wealth in Nebraska not now being taxed for the support of any form of governmental activities. See page 319 of this report. Undoubtedly, the citizens of the state will be studying the matter of general taxa - tion in the years immediately before us. Any kind of a scheme of equalization of school opportunity is closely tied into the general system of state taxation. Personnel The personnel organization of the Department of Public Instruc - tion is given on one of the front pages of the report. We have pur - posely included in the report proper other activities than those in the formal report for the reason that the State Superintendent of Public Instruction is ex officio a member of the State Normal Board, is secretary and executive officer of the State Board for Vocational Educa - tion, and is an ex officio member of the State Library Commission. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction feels that in these ex officio capacities he has a measure of responsibility to the people for these activities even though he does not have direct control in them. The State Superintendent has no direct responsibility with regard to the administration of the University of Nebraska but wishes to </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 14 assume an attitude of helpfulness wherever possible toward that great institution. Church Schools Nebraska is fortunate in having a group of church schools out - standing in their merit, work and ability. The office is making every effort to cooperate with the various church organizations to the end that it may render the greatest service possible to the good people whom they serve. We wish here to express our appreciation of the splendid coopera - tion of all school officials in the state, not only of public schools but of private and church schools. We particularly appreciate the coop - eration of the ninety-three county superintendents. We wish that every citizen in the state could catch the vision of Nebraska's edu - cational system in the large as we see it from this office, and from our comings and goings over Nebraska as a whole. The Dignity and Democracy of Labor It is just possible that many parents in the past have been ambitious for their children to have the opportunities of an educa - tion in order that the children might not have to work as hard as the parents have worked. The Department of Public Instruction does not take that attitude toward the whole problem of education. In a democracy like ours, the whole mass of people should be trained and educated for useful work and service to the social group as a whole. All of the material on curriculum and management that goes from this office will be predicated upon this purpose of education — not to train the rising generation away from work, but to train them toward it. Work for everybody, with a high standard of living; but industry, work, And a busy life are the greatest blessings that can happen to any man or woman. Supreme Court Decisions A number of important decisions have been handed down by the State Supreme Court on school problems. Without exception these decisions have been given from the standpoint of harmony with exist - ing laws and the welfare of schools in general. One particular decision stands out in bold background as an epochal decision in denning the scope, purpose, and obligation of the </seg>
            <seg id="p015">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 15 public school system as a whole. The Supreme Court was unanimous. We quote from Case No. 26026: "The school system of our state recognizes the vitally im - portant fact that education is for all persons within such school age as has been fixed by the legislature. Obviously this priceless boon cannot be regulated by the number of pupils who may attend the district school. And if by chance there should be but one pupil of school age in any school dis - trict of this state, that pupil is entitled to the benefit of the school privileges which the law guarantees for the education of all the school children of the state." We doubt if a more comprehensive statement could be made de - fining the duties and obligations of the State in the education of its youth. Additional Room Needed A serious situation confronting us at this time is the altogether inadequate provision made by the State Capitol Commission in its assignment of office space to this department. Be it known at the outset that there is no thought whatever on the part of anyone to expand upon our present sphere of activities and responsibilities in the administration and supervision of the schools of the State of Nebraska. In making this request for more adequate quarters and additional office space, we are doing it solely that the department may function more efficiently in the discharge of those duties and obligations now imposed by law. To any casual observer, it would seem that prac - tically all of the constitutional offices with the exception of this de - partment have been adequately provided with office space. At the outset, the demands of the department were taken care of, as may be seen from a study of the original plans and specifica - tions. The space originally planned for the State Superintendent's office was marked "Com. of Pub. Inst." (Commissioner is the term used for this office in New York where the architect resided who developed the plan.) This abbreviated designation was interpreted by the drafts - man as "Commissioner of Public Institutions" and the space was assigned to the Board of Control of Public Institutions. If it be true, as some have insisted, that "Com. of Pub. Inst." as indicated on the original plans by the draftsman did not have reference to the "Commissioner of Public Instruction", there is but one conclusion, namely, that in the original plans there was no provision made for office room for the State Department of Public Instruction. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Owing to this error in interpreting the abbreviation alluded to above, the State Superintendent's office was the only constitutional office for which no provision was made on the main floor by the Capitol Commission. A general protest was voiced by the educators of the state to the assignment of quarters on the ground floor to the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and as a compromise, after a most strenuous effort on the part of the educa - tional forces of the state, the entire space originally intended for the Department of Public Instruction was divided between this office and that of the Board of Control. This division has seriously cramped and interfered with the proper functioning of the personnel of the State Superintendent's office in all of its many activities. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the present admin - istration addressed the Secretary of the State Capitol Commission on July 12, 1927, calling attention to the congested conditions in the office and suggesting that the Commission might provide relief. To this request, there was no response from the Commission. Again on September 19, 1927, a letter was addressed to the Secre - tary of the State Capitol Commission in which the unfavorable condi - tions under which the personnel of the State Superintendent's office were compelled to labor were called to their attention. To this re - quest, the Commission replied that the matter was being left to the Governor inasmuch as he is the custodian of buildings and grounds. The statement was made to the effect that "As the work progresses on the building, more space will be available and it would seem that ample provision will be made for all offices when the building is completed." The situation was again called to the attention of the Capitol Commission on January 9, 1928. In replying, the Capitol Commis - sion advised the department that no additional space would be avail - able until the Capitol was more nearly completed. On or about the first of May, Governor McMullen made a personal inspection of the department at the suggestion of the State Super - intendent, after which a letter was directed to him indicating more or less in detail certain salient facts for his consideration, to which there was no reply forthcoming. The Capitol Commission advised the department under date of July 12, 1928, that after an investigation had been made, it was decided that it would be impossible to furnish any more space at the present time, but that after construction progressed, two additional </seg>
            <seg id="p017">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 17 small rooms adjacent to the department would be available, one of which would of necessity be vacated by the department during legis - lative sessions. To this letter, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction replied under date of July 12, 1928, requesting an opportunity to appear before the Commission and present the case of the department. A reply from the Secretary of the State Capitol Commission under date of July 17, 1928, was to the effect that the request for a hearing would be presented to the Commission at its next meeting. Under date of September 5, 1928, a letter from the State Capitol Commission addressed to the State Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion advised that the Commission was to meet at 10:00 A. M. on Friday, September 7, 1928, at which time the situation of the depart - ment as regards additional space might be presented. Accordingly, the State Superintendent appeared before the Commission at the stated time and was given a very cordial and courteous hearing. At the close of this hearing, according to newspaper reports, a committee of three was appointed to investigate the need of addi - tional space by the State Department of Public Instruction, but so far as the department has been able to learn, this committee has not as yet taken any definite action. Present Conditions The present space for the department provides: (a) a private office for the State Superintendent, (b) a small room adjoining this used by the Deputy State Superintendent and until recently, occupied by two stenographers and statisticians, (c) a third room serving as a reception room and providing space for three stenographers includ - ing the secretary to the State Superintendent, (d) a large room occupied by the Assistant State Superintendent; the three Directors of the Divisions of Rural Education, Certification, and Secondary Educa - tion and Teacher Training; the Supervisor of Secondary Education as well as five departmental secretaries and stenographers, and (e) two small rooms occupied by the chief examination clerk and five assistants. That these rooms are wholly inadequate to the needs are shown by the following intolerable conditions: A. There is but one room in which those wishing conferences with the State Superintendent and departmental heads can enjoy any privacy whatever, and that is the private office of the State Super- </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT intendent himself. As a result, patrons and taxpayers coining to this office cannot have satisfactory conferences with directors of the several divisions without constant interruptions and without being disturbed and disiracted by the din and noise of as many as three to five typewriters and an electrically operated mimeo - graph as well as being confused by the other personal confer - ences being held within a radius of eight feet of each other. Cer - tainly these persons are entitled to courteous hearings and a reasonable degree of privacy. B. The most constructive, original and accurate contributions in edu - cation cannot be made in such an environment. The division heads are responsible for courses of study in elementary and secondary education, character education, normal training courses of study, bulletins on rural school standards, Nebraska high school manual, rural and village high school bulletin, program discussion material, certification, fire prevention, the preparation of public addresses, educational articles for publication, and teach - er's and eighth grade examination questions. It is almost impossible to concentrate on the many perplexing problems that arise in the daily correspondence coming into this office. This correspondence includes the necessity of making many decisions involving legal points that are continually referred to this office for our consideration and final decision. C. It is further impossible to carry on any telephone conversations save in the private office of the State Superintendent. But one telephone extension in the large room referred to above necessi - tates having to go to other rooms to converse with any degree of satisfaction to the person calling or to members of the de - partment. It is a matter of record in the office of the Lincoln Telephone Company that the Department of Public Instruction is one of the heaviest, if not the heaviest user of telephone service in the entire Capitol Building. D. Provisions for filing cases, book and pamphlet cabinets, records of certification and examination papers as well as cabinets for many varieties of materials used daily in the offices cannot now be arranged in any satisfactory manner without involving wasted time and effort on the part of all members of the department in having to go from one room to another to secure needed materials. Neither has sufficient space been provided for additional filing of records and constantly accumulating materials, all of which are of inestimable value to the proper functioning of the department. The Director of Certification finds it impossible under present con- ditions to answer many letters without having to consult the files located in three different rooms. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 19 E. At the present time, this department has been forced to make use of a couple of rooms by the courtesy of the State Treasurer in order that the statistical clerks might have a reasonable degree of quietness in which to compile the large masses of statistical data, a part of which appear elsewhere in this Biennial Report. Conclusion We repeat what we have said at the beginning, "There is no thought whatever on the part of anyone to expand upon our present sphere of activities and responsibilities in the administration and super - vision of the schools of the State of Nebraska. In making this re - quest for more adequate quarters and additional office space, we are doing it Solely that the department may function more efficiently in the discharge of those duties and obligations now imposed by law." Divisions Following we give the report of educational facts and procedures revolving around these particular phases of educational work. In each case, the director should have due credit for the activities and policies enunciated. These divisions of the report are given in the order of their his - torical development, and mean nothing as regards rank or importance. In the authority and responsibility for the general work and routine of the office, the Deputy naturally stands next to the Chief. Much of the credit for the work of the Department during the biennium is due to the careful, efficient work of the Deputy. </seg>

            <seg id="p021">ROBERT H. GRAHAM Deputy State Superintendent of Public Instruction The school organizations, while consisting of eight different types of districts, have all been evolved from time to time by legislative acts that are permitted by Section 6 under Article VII of the State Constitution of Nebraska which provides that: "The Legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years." The various legislative sessions from year to year since 1868 have enacted numerous statutory laws that apply to different conditions arising from a diversity of climate and occupations so peculiar to the geography of Nebraska. Thus, certain types of schools are maintained in the thickly populated districts of the Missouri Valley region and other types in the range country of western Nebraska. The legisla - tive authority and courts have also jealously guarded against any infringement of the natural inherent rights of the individual to the extent that Nebraska School Laws are practically a Magna Charta for the youth of this state. The most priceless and outstanding gift from the state to the boys and girls consists of several provisions which make it obliga - tory for them to take advantage of school privileges until they are sixteen years of age. It is worthy of note to observe that of 414,975 people under twenty-one years of age, 317,221 of them are enrolled in the public schools and 18,719 in the various church schools in the state from the first to the twelfth grades inclusive. Thus, there is a remainder of 79,035, a large majority of whom are enrolled in the denominational and teachers' colleges and other state institutions of Nebraska. Those pupils aggregating in round numbers 336,000 arc&gt; Jigtrihuted amontr the different types of school organizations mentioned and also in the church schools. Thus, those citizens of Nebraska elected to various sessions of the legislature beginning in 1868 have performed their duties faith - fully and well, while their authority has been limited to the section of the Constitution mentioned above. It would seem that the types of districts limited to only eight could be placed under a supervisory authority by only a few legislative statutes. Yet, the numerous problems arising from time to time and the school activities are so differentiated that approximately four thousand different statutory laws have been brought into existence to apply to emergency condi - tions of each one of the eight types of districts herein mentioned. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 22 Yet, without the rulings from the Department of Justice, the chief officer of which is the Attorney General, it is difficult to con - struct and compose letters setting forth uniform procedure on ques - tions applicable to all the districts included in any one of the eight types mentioned above. For these reasons, it is neither plausible nor pertinent to enter into the explanation or discussion of letters that vary so widely in subject matter written to the various school districts of any one type throughout the state. As a rule each letter decides the policy of some individual district on some one important exception to the rule and usage set forth in the law. During the past two decades appreciable progress has been made by legislative authorities in supplying emergency needs for school districts in portions of the state where land values are extremely low in price. These districts are located in the range or ranch regions where the small amount of money to be accumulated by a tax levy must necessarily be collected from a wide territory. Fortun - ately for the people living in these regions, the Legislature enacted a law providing that a fund known as "State Aid to Weak Districts" should be appropriated to any rural school organization consisting of twelve or more sections of land, when an eight mill levy does not support a school for the term of months required by law. The funds for the above are combined with an appropriation known as the Mallory Act. The total appropriation for the two pur - poses mentioned above for the biennium just closed was one hundred thousand dollars. However, the law contains the stipulation that money under the Mallory Act as a reimbursement for laboratory equip - ment to rural high schools teaching agriculture and other vocational subjects is to be paid out of funds not otherwise appropriated. Thus, payment of aid to weak districts takes precedence over any reimbursements to rural high schools for teaching vocational subjects. The teaching of these vocational subjects by rural high schools is a most laudable purpose to be sponsored by any state in the Mississippi or Missouri Valley region. For the above reasons the appropriation of aid to weak districts and the Mallory Act fund should be suffi - ciently large so that both types of school districts would receive the full amount as aid to one, and as a reimbursement to the other. In addition to the foregoing brief survey, the compilation of annual reports from ninety-three county superintendents, from which data is collected to determine the amount of state apportionment semi - annually due each county, is of supreme importance. This most im - portant project takes the time of a clerical force approximately four months out of the year. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 23 In conclusion, we would call attention to the Nebraska Educa - tional Directory published by this office at the beginning or approxi - mately near the beginning of each school year. This directory in - cludes information that is both desirable and valuable to high school, village, and rural teachers and to members of the board of education in the various types of districts mentioned above. The demand for this publication is such that the office is com - pelled to publish something like seven thousand copies a year. It is the consensus of opinion that this comparatively small publication contains financial and statistical information in a condensed form so that the average citizen and school patron can secure definite knowl - edge on some of the most important points of school finance and school organization. In other words, this Nebraska Educational Di - rectory seems to be eagerly sought by all the teachers and all the members of the school boards in the state. We are of the opinion that the popular demand for such directory is based upon the desire of many school patrons and citizens of Nebraska for such information as the directory supplies. </seg>

            <seg id="p025">LULU S. WOLFOBD* Assistant State Superintendent of Public Instruction A complete and comprehensive digest of the State School Laws of Nebraska has been made. The indexes comprise approximately five thousand sub-heads, making it extremely easy to find references bearing on any topic covered in the School Laws. Each section of the law is shorn of all unnecessary verbiage, and the substance stated clearly in the digest. Considerable time was devoted to the preparation of this piece of work. Owing to the lack of funds the digest and index has not been published, but it is hoped that it can be brought to date and published after the close of the coming session of the Legislature. SAFETY The State Superintendent's office has devoted considerable time in an effort to create through the schools a safety consciousness in this state. Statistics show an ever-increasing death toll due to automobile acci - dents alone. Since Nebraska ranks third in the percentage of automo - biles owned and operated in the state, it is very essential that attention should be given to means of lessening the vast number of preventable accidents occurring from this source. Statistics show that from January 1, 1919, to December 31, 1926, 137,017 persons were killed by automobiles. The total casual - ties of the American armed forces in the World War were 120,050. Since Armistice Day, 1918, automobiles have injured 3,500,000 persons in the United States. These figures give us a slight realization of the immensity of the automobile problem alone. Every day of the year 65 persons are fatally injured in this manner, or an average of one death every twenty-five minutes throughout the year. There were 1,000 more accidents in 1926 than in 1925. Nine-tenths of these accidents are preventable. Therefore a realization of the tremendous number of preventable casualties should make the world stand aghast. Surely too much stress can not be laid upon the need of adequate penalties for motorists who through carelessness or incompetency imperil human lives. Loss of life and injuries, property losses and losses through acci - dents are all being emphasized. There are more people killed by •Resigned. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT automobiles every year than are now sleeping- in France as the result of the World War. We must realize that we are living in an age of transportation by motor power, and must face the problem in an effort to lessen the consequent tragedies that have resulted by placing power machines on the highways and in the hands of all types of drivers. Travel and transportation in the United States have greatly in - creased in the last twenty years. Transportation and travel are much more rapid. The number of motor vehicles is much greater. In 1919 there were 1,000,000 automobiles in the United States. In 1926 there were 22,000,000 motor vehicles. In 1926, 7,000 children under fifteen years of age were killed as the result of travel accidents alone. The Department of Public Instruction has endeavored to aid in the great national movement of promoting safety. The methods followed have comprehended the dissemination of information of this character, and also by cooperating in the National Safety Essay Contest through the schools in order to bring home to the various communities the urgent need of teaching safety through the school, as the boys and girls are the best disseminators of information, since they carry the message to their homes. Special emphasis has also been placed upon crossing accidents and those resulting from live wires, open windows, cars and street crossings, running after balls, broken glass, nails, rubbish, fires, care - lessness with food, fire arms, lack of observation of warning signs, etc. An effort is being made nationally to secure a genuine awaken - ing of the people in the matter of preventing accidents, and the imperative need of immediate action is being generally stressed. Nebraska has disseminated much information, and has been per - sonally represented by the Assistant State Superintendent at the Cen - tral States Safety Congress at Kansas City which meets annually in April. Publicity has been given through the press of the state, and Safety Essay Contests have been conducted in the schools in which prizes of $50.00 in cash, and gold, silver and bronze medals have been awarded each year to the pupils submitting the best essays. The essays are judged first by the county superintendents, the ones receiv - ing the highest rating being sent to the State Superintendent's office where they can be passed upon by competent judges, and the seven </seg>
            <seg id="p027">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 27 ranking highest are sent to the Highway Education Board at Wash - ington, D. C, for competition. Prizes are also offered to the teachers for the best lesson plan submitted. These essays have dealt espe - cially with highway safety problems. The office has also stressed dangers of various types throughout the homes and has published a series of lessons on Fire Prevention as provided by law, all as a part of the safety campaign. The schools are being urged to teach street and highway safety to create in each pupil a desire to prevent accidents and to aid them in the formation of habits of safety. Various devices are resorted to, such as signboards, posters, estab - lishing safety zones, safety codes in the schools, safety plays and safety programs, and the working through various types of social organizations such as Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, Automobile Clubs, Woman's Clubs, etc. Rules like the following are being promulgated: I will not play on the streets or highways. I will always stop, look and listen before crossing the highway. I will cross streets at crossings, always at right angles. I will not take chances. I will hold my umbrella upright in crossing the street. I will not run behind or in front of cars. I will not try to catch rides on automobiles, trucks or other motor vehicles. Safety rhymes and safety songs are also part of the training. The office has requested that every school in the state tench the following pledge of carefulness to the pupils: "Realizing my responsibility as an American citizen to secure the safety of others by careful conduct on the streets; "Realizing that the accident and death toll of my Nation, State and city can best be reduced by thoughtfulness and cars - fulness; "I pledge myself to be considerate of the rights of others while on the streets and highways; to learn and observe traffic rules and regulations to the best of my ability; to cooperate in a campaign of carefulness, either as a pedestrian or as a driver of a vehicle; and I will, by precept and example, en - deavor to assist others in making streets and highways safe." </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 28 FIRE DANGERS AND PREVENTION LESSONS Since the disastrous Chicago fire of 1871, it has become a common practice in the United States to observe the second week in October as Fire Prevention Week. A proclamation has been issued in Nebraska by Governor Adam McMullen, calling state-wide attention to the observ - ance of October 7th to 13th inclusive, as Fire Prevention Week. The fire waste in the United States and Canada is greater than in any other country in the world. The majority of fires causing this are preventable. They are due in great measure to individual care - lessness and neglect. Statistics show that fire losses in the United States are appalling. A new fire breaks out with every passing minute of the day and night. In every twenty-four hours there are five schoolhouse fires, forty-one people burned to death, forty-seven people injured, fifteen hotel fires. There is a loss of $60,000 every hour, — day and night. Fifteen thousand people have been burned to death annually. There is one dwelling house fire every three minutes, and enough buildings burned yearly to make a solid row from New York to Denver. The loss sustained from fires would build 100,000 dwellings an - nually at a cost of $5,000 each. Our yearly loss from fire alone is twice the interest of all savings bank accounts. It would require 100,000 tons of gold to pay the yearly losses from fire. This loss amounts to $4.75 for every man, woman and child in the United States. Nine fires out of every ten are preventable by taking precautions of proven value, and being careful to the utmost degree. Nebraska fire losses during the past year (1927) amounted to nearly $3,000,000.00; forty-five lives were lost, and 150 persons were injured. The Nebraska law requires the State Superintendent to prepare lessons on Fire Dangers and Prevention for the use of each month of the maximum school year, and teachers and instructors of public, private and parochial schools to devote not less than thirty minutes each month to instruction of pupils in the subject. The law also requires fire drills, and provides that all schools and other places of assemblage or places of public resort, when such buildings are more than two stories in height, shall be equipped with suitable fire escapes, and that all doors open outward. The doors of all schoolhouses must be unlocked during school hours. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 29 The first Friday in November is set aside to be observed in every school as State Fire Day. In compliance with the requirements of the law the State Department has issued a series of lessons on Fire Dangers and Prevention which have been sent to every school in the state. These lessons are prepared by Miss Lulu S. Wolford, Assistant State Superintendent, and are seasonal in character, dealing with the most prevalent sources of danger for each month. September covers fires from matches and smoking, also dry grass; October, open fires and rubbish; November is home and school inspection for fire hazards, each child being requested to make a complete survey of his home and school premises. In December the holiday fires are stressed. Christ - mas probably has more fire tragedies than any other holiday. Candles and Christmas trees have created many a blaze. Another source of fires is neglect to clean up premises after Christmas. January is devoted particularly to fires originating from heating devices; Febru - ary to gas, electric and acetylene fires; March, to carelessness, partic - ularly in the home, including the use of toilet and other articles made of French Ivory, celluloid, etc. The theme for April is cooking, clean - ing and coal oil, while the lessons for May cover fires caused by electrical storms, lightning ranking sixth in the cause of fire losses. The lessons provide a number of questions for study, several prob - lems for solution and themes for essays on the various topics of Fire Dangers and Prevention under consideration in the particular month. A number of statistics are given calling attention to the tremendous fire losses of the nation, to the heavy loss of life and property in Nebraska, and to the fact that nine-tenths of all fires are preventable. Carefulness at all times in following these instructions is emphasized. These bulletins have been placed in the hands of every teacher in the state. Man's best friend and bitterest enemy is fire. When under his control it is his best servant, but he is helpless when fire is beyond his control. Fire is indispensible to our daily lives, but is one of our greatest perils because of our carelessness. "With every passing min - ute, day or night, throughout the year, another fire breaks out." ARBOR DAY AND NATIONAL FORESTRY Arbor Day had its origin in Nebraska. In an early day many tree claims were taken in this state which meant that a certain amount of tree planting was to be done, and as a result groves flourished throughout the length of our river valleys. Because so much tree planting was done, the legislature in 1895, conferred upon Nebraska the name "Tree Planters' State". </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The Federal government is encouraging the planting of trees by establishing government experiment stations in different states to determine the kinds of trees that grow most successfully in the various soils and climates. The government station of Nebraska is near Halsey, where over 13,000 acres are planted to pine trees. The ex - tension service of our State College of Agriculture is cooperating with the State Superintendent's office to encourage tree planting by supplying to the farmers of the state from this reserve. During the past year 682,000 forest tree seedlings were distributed to 2600 farmers, representing every county in the state. The State Superintendent's office endeavors to secure interest through the schools, and in 1927 conducted an essay contest on "Trees and Tree Planting". In 1928, county superintendents were urged to secure an interest in planting trees on every schoolground in the state, and special observance of Arbor Day and National American Forestry week, April 21 to 28, was urged. There was fine coopera - tion in this first effort to secure universal planting of trees on schoolgrounds. County superintendents reported from 69 of the 93 counties in the state. 11,402' trees were planted on 1537 schoolgrounds, making an average of seven trees for each district. Pawnee and Hayes were banner counties having planted trees on every school - ground in each county. Superintendent C. S. Strickler led out in his county by sending a tree to every district for Arbor Day planting. Custer county, with 250 districts, observed Arbor Day by planting 3000 trees on the schoolgrounds of 200 districts. Buffalo reports 1290 trees; Platte 600; Sherman and Holt 500 each, and other counties smaller numbers. Professor Clayton W. Watkins, in his report on this activity at a meeting of Extension Foresters in Manitoba, Canada, created much interest, and especial interest centered in the school - ground planting. In Nebraska this feature will be continued as part of the education program in cooperation with the tree-planting activ - ities of the extension department. A letter went out from the depart - ment urging especial care in the preparation of the schoolgrounds for the opening of schools that no damage might accrue to the newly planted trees. 850,000 pieces of literature were distributed through the county superintendents who were county chairmen of the American Forestry Week Committee. General forestry information was presented through some organization in every county in the state. An outstanding feature in this effort to secure universal interest was the essay contest in grade schools in which 56 counties competed. In 1927 twenty-five dollars in cash prizes was paid by the Isaac Walton League in the furtherance of this activity. In 1928 the </seg>

The two essays winning highest scores in each county were sent to the State Superintendent's office, where they competed for state prizes as follows: 1st prize, $10.00; 2nd prize, $5.00; four 3rd prizes, $2.50 each. The state prizes were won as follows 1st. Rose Fischbach, of Orleans, 2nd. Roma Eggers, of Elkhorn. 3rd. Rose Samek, of Abie. 3rd. Nola Hoffman, Wayside. 3rd. Eva Sorenson, Dannebrog. 3rd. Helen Olson, Geneva. Trees and Tree Planting The following outline was followed in the preparation of the essays, covering all points mentioned: 1. Five reasons why farmers should plant trees. 2. How to promote planting. 3. Growth, protection, care, forest and grass fires. 4. Trees best adapted to my locality, and why. 5. Tell what you have read about trees. 6. Tell why you like trees. 7. What have you done, or what are you doing, to create interest in tree planting? 8. Are there trees in your neighborhood? Why? 9. Are there many trees about your home and in your commun - ity? Why? 10. What has been done in tree planting in your neighborhood in the last five years? 11. What is being done this year? Landscape Planting on Schoolgrounds The extension service of the University of Nebraska and county agents cooperate in demonstration of landscape planting on certain schoolgrounds of the state. Three of these schoolgrounds in Hamilton county are especially outstanding in this demonstration work. This is </seg>

The State Superintendent's office is very much gratified over the widespread interest resulting from this first campaign for tree planting on every schoolground. Plans for Future Planting This year the State Department is again urging the planting of trees on every schoolground, and in order to arouse additional interest we hope to offer prizes to the schools showing the greatest accom - plishment along the following lines: 1st. The number of trees planted on schoolgrounds. 2nd. The number of trees planted about homes in the district as direct result of efforts through the schools. 3rd. Photographs of schoolgrounds planted. 4th. Best description of Arbor Day program and planting on schoolgrounds. In connection with the awards made on Arbor Day 1930, will be prizes for the best care of trees based upon the percentage of trees growing from the plantings of the year before. A complete report of all activities will be filed with the county superintendent. This will be summarized and published and the awards made according to the findings. Through the cooperation of our State Forester, Clayton W. Wat - kins, arrangement is made to secure groups of trees suitable to the various sections of the state. The State Superintendent's office and the Agricultural Extension Service are glad to answer all inquiries as to trees that will grow most successfully in any locality. An excellent bulletin on "Tree Planting in Nebraska" issued by Dr. George E. Condra of the University of Nebraska was distributed and is still available showing methods of planting, etc. The trees that will do well throughout most sections of Nebraska are Blackhill spruce, yel - low or rock pine, quaking aspen, cottonwood poplar, burr oak, slippery elm, American or white elm, sandbar willow, hackberry, box elder, green ash, horse chestnut, basswood or linden and honey locust. Others that will do well in the eastern half of the state are: Red cedar, black walnut, sugar maple and shagbark hickory. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 33 In harmony with Section 6521, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, the following moneys were distributed from the Forest Reserve Funds during the biennium: WORLD FRIENDSHIP A AMONG CHILDREN The Committee on World Friendship Among Children, instituted by the Federal Council of Churches, sent to Japan in the winter of 1927, 13,000 dolls as messengers of friendship to the famous Doll Festival in Japan. As a result of this, Japan formed a committee on World Friendship and began its work by sending us fifty-eight Japanese dolls which were sent throughout our country so "that the school chil - dren of the United States might see them and know the friendship of Japanese children for us. These Japanese dolls are the gift of the children of Japan, they having contributed an average of one-half cent each to make this gift possible. A committee on World Friendship Among Children is now carrying on the project which is intended to develop good will among the children of Mexico. The State Superintendent's office has cooperated to the extent of sending letters to the county superintendents of the state calling attention to the preject, and suggesting their cooperation as a purely local matter. A pamphlet was enclosed with the letter describing the project in detail. It is the policy of the office to neither refuse nor endorse any movement requiring the raising of funds among school children, re - gardless of how worthy the object may be. The project following closely upon the visit of Col. Lindbergh to Mexico, the committee felt that it was an opportune time for a wide - spread realization in Mexico of the kindly spirit pervading our coun - try, and of our interest in the children of other lands.

AMERICAN LEGION ESSAY CONTEST The State Department cf Public Instruction cooperated with the American Legion, Department of Nebraska, in a High School Essay Contest upon the subject of "Why Should Every Citizen Vote." The purpose of the essay contest was to awaken, if possible, all citizens to the duty imposed by the Federal and State Constitutions. That the citizens of tomorrow might give serious thought to the obligations of citizenship, the essay contest was submitted to stimulate interest in governmental activities. Col. John G. Maher, First Commander of the American Legion in Nebraska, offered as prizes a gold, a silver and a bronze medal. These medals bore the Coat of Arms of the United States and were appropri - ately inscribed. The three best essays from each school were forwarded to the county superintendent of the county who in turn selected the best one which was. sent to the State Superintendent of Public In - struction. A committee consisting of Prof. C. C. Wiedemann, University of Nebraska, Prof. B. C. Ogden, Cotner College, and Prof. Glen Callen, Nebraska Wesleyan University, selected the winning essays. The gold medal was awarded to Mary Pollard, Nehawka, the silver medal to Louise Best of Stratton, and the bronze medal to Elizabeth Kneifl of Newcastle. Certificates of Award were sent to the county superin - tendents to distribute in recognition of the essays winning first, second and third in their respective counties. It is probable that this activity may be continued next year featuring some other phase of citizenship training. AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK A Permanent Worldwide Movement The National Education Association has set aside for annual observance the week in November which includes Armistice Day as American Education Week.

Ruth Pyrtle. It is in part as follows: "By reasonably accurate count in two-thirds of the leading populous counties of Nebraska we note that the number of illiterates is reduced about three-fourths or in figures to less than 4,000 which is about .005 or one-half of 1 per cent of the entire population of Nebraska in 1924. We note that prac - tically all of these illiterates are over 40 years of age and many were reported as feeble-minded and others were physi - cally unable to receive education. It is a bit interesting to note the relatively small number of foreign born among the illiterates. In the 1920 United States Government census it was found that many were listed as illiterates who spoke and read two, three and four languages but did not speak English fluently. The Commission believes that the questions relative to education on the (Government) census blanks are ambiguous and account in a large degree for the discrepancies between the 1920 Government census and the 1924 Nebraska survey. The Commission believes that the census should be taken by a person trained for the task, and that the county should check on the accuracy of the census report. "Reports from a number of counties in Nebraska tallied • with the experience of the workers in Lancaster County. The names and addresses of the 1,098 illiterates attributed to Lin - coln were copied at Washington, D. C, from the 1920 Govern - ment census. After every home and every person on the list had been visited by careful workers from the Parent-Teacher Association and Women's Clubs, there were found 125 illiter- </seg>

Of the remaining 87S on the list, 68 were reported dead, 84 had moved from the state, 96 could not be traced, and the rest were illiterate people." The question of Nebraska's rank with respect to illiteracy has been one of considerable interest to educators for some time past. Owing to incomplete information based upon partial surveys, the state has been variously ranked. During the last year the Federated Woman's Clubs determined on making a survey of one county as typical of general conditions of the state. The President, Mrs. Will Minier, appointed a committee consisting of State Superintendent C. W. Taylor, Miss E. Ruth Pyrtle and Mrs. Paul C. Perryman, to arrange and direct a survey. Adams County was chosen as being typical. The survey was made under the direct supervision of Mrs. Paul C. Perryman, with the cooperation of the County Superintendent, Mrs. Martha Schultz, the city superintendent and principals, teachers of the city and county, members of the Woman's Clubs, and others who volunteer their services. The report cards were sent to the State Superintendent's office where the information was classified, tabulated and summarized. However, there were a number of inaccuracies owing to the fact that the census report card was in error in that it lacked detail and definiteness, making it necessary to give verbal instructions to the canvassers, which instruction in many instances was overlooked. Therefore, the reports on many families lack completeness. Another cause of inaccuracy is due to the fact that the census takers reported many instances where families were absent from home, and hence, no information was available in such cases. A recanvass was made in part of the city of Hastings in an effort to secure more complete information. Another inaccuracy noted is that citizenship was often times reported only as affecting the head of the family. There are also certain inconsistencies of frequent recurrence similar to the one showing 82 citizens and 4 aliens, a total of 86, 79 being native born and 2 foreign born, a total of 81, making a discrepancy of 5. This particular inaccuracy is ever occurrent throughout the report. The compilation of this report was no small matter, twelve items of information being asked on each family. Reports were made on 2,984 families, a total of 10,873 persons in the city of Hastings alone. In the rural districts the majority of cards failed to show the number in the family. The gathering of this information was a tremendous undertaking, and on the whole was as well done as could be expected. In view of the inaccuracies cited above, and also in view of the fact that these </seg>
            <seg id="p041">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 41 were not sworn reports, the findings of the survey can not be held to be absolutely correct. However, it is possible to arrive at some reasonably accurate percentages. The survey shows a total of 14 illiterates and a total of 43 defectives. Upon an estimated population of 25,000 the illiterates would be 5/1000 of 1 per cent and the defectives 17/1000 of 1 per cent. The defectives include 11 feeble-minded, 16 crippled, 10 deaf, 4 blind, 2 defects not listed. This survey does not include the Hastings State Hospital at Ingleside, for the reason that only 36 of the inmates of this hospital are residents of Adams County. Owing to the fact that the reports of the rural districts did not give a total census of the number of families, it was necessary to use an esti - mated population. This estimate is based upon the standard generally used, namely two and one-half times the school population, making approximately 25,000. The 1920 census gives Adams County 22,621. The State Superintendent's office has revised the census reports for the current year with a view of meeting the requirements of new laws and securing accurate information as to the census of the entire state. When gathered and compiled, this information will be of in - estimable value to the state in the interpretation of its affairs along various educational lines and in the proper administration of the school laws. The census is taken by the director of each district, and all are sworn reports. Five items relative to adults, in addition to those previously required on the blank, have been added, namely, total number in family, citizenship, nationality, reads English, writes English. The findings of the check made in 1924 show First. That many had been counted illiterate in the 1920 census because they did not speak English fluently when a number of these were able to speak from one to four languages. Second. There is evidence of the census taking not having been done carefully and accurately in many instances. Third. There seems to have been a misunderstanding of the definition of illiteracy as used by the Government Census Bureau. Fourth. There were a number of persons (defective) in institu - tions concerning whom definite information could not be secured. It would be impossible to secure really accurate information unless defectives were listed separately in the Government census. Fifth. The survey shows that the average age of the illiterate in Nebraska is over forty years and that these people had no oppor - tunity for education. The many iuaccuracies and errors divulged by </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT the definite check on the 1920 census in Lancaster County would indicate that there is a relatively small number of illiterates in Nebraska. This is borne out in the report of all counties that at - tempted to make the survey according to the definition of illiteracy as used by the government. A careful checking of the blanks coming into the office from the Adams County survey indicates that the in - formation was very inaccurately gathered. We shall preserve the records of this survey for any one who wishes to investigate and study them further. If by illiteracy we mean the inability to read and write English, and in addition some simple understanding of the Constitution of the United States, then we would probably have many thousands of in - dividuals in the state who are to be classed as illiterates. The large majority of these good people at heart want to be good loyal citizens, and only await an opportunity to acquire the use and knowledge of the English language. </seg>

Normal schools — teachers' training courses. There may be established in the state normal schools of Nebraska two courses of study for the training of rural teachers — an elementary course and an advanced course. The elementary course shall be two years in length and shall include thorough instruction in the common school subjects, rural sociology, the management and organization of rural schools, manual training, domestic science, and such other subjects as the board of education of normal schools may deem necessary to equip the student for rural school service. To enter this course, the student shall be at least sixteen years of age and have completed the eighth grade or its equivalent. On the completion of the elementary course he shall receive a rural elementary certificate good for three years. This certificate may be renewed by such further advanced study as may be prescribed by the board of education of state normal schools. The advanced course shall be two years in length. To enter this course the student must have completed the elementary rural course or its equivalent. This course shall contain such subjects as may be prescribed by the board of education of state normal schools. On tht, completion of the advanced course the student shall receive a first grade rural state certificate and after three years of experience shall be entitled to a professional rural state certificate good for life.

The advanced certificate shall also be valid in village and town schools as contemplated under the school laws of Nebraska. Interpretation of the New Certification Law When the new certification law was passed in 1925, provision was made that it would not be retroactive through the enactment of the following: SECTION IX. "This act shall not be construed to be retroactive as to certificates in force at the time this act becomes effective, but every teacher shall receive under this act a certificate of equal rank to the one held under the present law." In an effort to make adequate provision for the conversion of the old certificates into the certificates provided for under the new certifica - tion law, the State Department of Public Instruction issued rulings to cover as many points as could be foreseen at that time. It must be manifest that neither the Legislature nor the State Superintendent could foresee all of the questions that would be involved in making the transfer from the old certification law to the new. For this reason a great many questions have arisen which were not covered in the rulings published in the Teachers' Examination and Certification Bulletin of July, 1926. Naturally since the certification law represents the only real authority for the issuance of certificates by the State Department, it must be patent that when a point arises which is not specifically covered in the law a decision must rest upon the interpretation of the State Superintendent. Whenever these questions in which the. value of an old certificate under the new law are raised, the depart - ment has made every effort to be fair and carry out the .apparent intent and spirit of the new certification law. Since there are so many certification agencies in the state and since the requirements for certificates have varied so greatly, there are certain to be hundreds of cases which cannot be covered by official rulings. These cases must be considered as individual cases. Certificates Issued by County High Schools County high schools are not issuing certificates at present. Their graduates who have completed the Normal Training Course secure certificates in the same manner as graduates of approved Normal Training high schools. </seg>

"Fourth — The state superintendent of public instruction shall satisfy himself by personal inspection or by the personal inspection of the state board of examiners for life certificates that any institu - tion desiring recognition under said sections has fully complied with the requirements set forth herein and in the next two preceding sections. "Fifth — The entrance requirements to the elementary and higher courses and the time required for the completion of said courses shall be the same as in the state normal schools. "Each year the state superintendent of public instruction shall satisfy himself by personal inspection or by the personal inspection if the state board of examiners for life certificates that the require - ments have been met before any certificate can be granted by such institution." A careful study of the various sections under which the state and private schools are authorized to issue institutional certificates reveals an anomalous situation. The University of Nebraska sets the standard for the four year certificates, that is, for those certificates based upon graduation from an institution authorized to confer the degrees of bachelor of arts or bachelor of science. There are eleven accredited higher institutions which have made application to issue the university first grade state certificates on the basis of standards set by the University of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT While the University of Nebraska fixes the standards for the university first grade state certificate, it must meet the standards set by the state normal board governing the four state normal schools for certificates based upon two years of college work. If the University of Nebraska were to issue a certificate based upon one year of col - lege work, it would be necessary for the University of Nebraska to meet the standards set by the state normal board governing the four state normal schools. However, the University of Nebraska does not at this time issue the one year or general elementary certificate. There are eighteen accredited higher institutions which have made application to issue the junior first grade state certificates and the general elementary certificates on the basis of standards set by the four state normal schools. There are four accredited higher institutions in Nebraska which are not issuing the institutional certificates at this time, but their work is fully accredited by the State Department of Public Instruction and state certificates are issued upon credentials from these institu - tions. They are Doane College at Crete, Hebron Junior College al Hebron, McCook Junior College at McCook and the University School of Music at Lincoln. Students presenting credentials from the newi.y organized junior colleges at Norfolk and Walthill may receive certifi - cates on the basis of their credentials as soon as the work of these two institutions has been approved by the University Examiner of the University of Nebraska. A board of examiners made up of three of the state's mor? prominent city superintendents served the state until about 1916. This board of examiners made a practice of visiting the various private and denominational schools in the state a short time before the commencement season. Graduates of these schools who were seeking institutional certificates were required to fill out an applica - tion blank in the presence of this examining board. On this blank they were asked to give a complete record of all work of secondary rank together with such other information relative to the college courses which they had completed as the board deemed necessary. The plan was not recognized as entirely satisfactory since in many cases the applicants could only hazard a guess as to the exact secondary courses which they had completed. It appears that instead of revising the application blanks and making certain other changes which would have removed the objectionable features and improved the practices and procedures followed by the beard, the State Super - intendent dispensed with the enth-e plan. There was no board of examiners from 1916 to January 7, 1927. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 57 The law seems to be very specific in providing that only such institutions as have been approved by the state board of examiners shall be authorized to issue institutional certificates. Therefore, in accordance with this provision in the law, a state board of examiners was appointed early in 1927, and this board has been busy since that time visiting the various private and denominational schools of the state which have expressed a desire for approval as an institution authorized to issue the certificates. When the board first began its work, it discovered a considerable difference of opinion among the heads of the various private and denominational schools as to the exact requirements which the schools must meet in order to secure approval. There was no little mis - understanding as to the exact requirements for the various institu - tional certificates. In one or two instances applicants for the uni - versity first grade state certificate based upon graduation from a standard four year college have been required to complete courses prescribed by the state normal board for the two year diploma or certificate. Many cases of a similar nature might be recalled. It was impossible for the board to visit every school to inspect the work for the school year 1926-27. Visits were made to the following schools: University of Nebraska, Lincoln; State Normal School and Teachers College, Chadron; State Normal School and Teachers Col - lege, Kearney; State Normal School and Teachers College, Peru; State Normal School and Teachers College, Wayne; Nebraska Wesleyan University, Lincoln; University of Omaha, Omaha; Cotner College Lincoln; Doane College, Crete; Duchesne College, Omaha; Grand Island College, Grand Island; Hastings College, Hastings; Midland College, Fremont; York College, York; Immaculate Conception Normal, Hastings; and St. Ursula's Junior College, York. During the school year of 1927-28, the board of examiners vis - ited the University of Nebraska, Lincoln; State Normal School and Teachers College, Chadron; State Normal School and Teachers College, Kearney; State Normal School and Teachers College, Peru; State Normal School and Teachers College, Wayne; Creighton University, Omaha; University of Omaha, Omaha; Duchesne College, Omaha; Mt. St. Mary's Junior College, Omaha; Nebraska Wesleyan Uni - versity, Lincoln; Cotner College, Lincoln; Union College, College View; Concordia Teachers College, Seward; Luther College, Wahoo; Dana College, Blair; York College, York; Hastings College, Hastings; Grand Island College, Grand Island; Nebraska Central College, Central City; Midland College, Fremont; Immaculate Conception College, Hastings; and St. Ursula's Junior College, York. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The personnel of the board of examiners as constituted at this time is Chairman, B. E. McProud, Dean of the Teachers College, Ne - braska Wesleyan University; Professor A. A. Reed, Director of the University Extension Division, Professor of Secondary Education, and University Examiner, University of Nebraska; and W. P. Hieronymus, President of the Hebron Junior College. The Director of Certification in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction serves as secretary ex officio. Members of the board serve without pay, receiving only their necessary traveling expenses. The board has adopted a new type of application blank to be filed by the institution desiring to issue any of the various certificates. Some of the features of the new application blanks which in the opinion of the board represent a distinct improvement over previous types of blanks are as follows: First — The application reveals whether or not the applicant is a citizen of the United States. Second — It contains a detailed statement of the secondary prepare tion of the applicant. Third — The previous certificate held and the teaching experience of the applicant are clearly shown. Fourth — The statement of college hours will readily reveal whether or not the applicant has completed the required professional and academic courses. The board has also recommended a new and uniform type of certificate blank for the use of the various private and denominational colleges. A uniform name for the various types of certificates issued by the private and denominational colleges has been suggested. The use of these new names for the various certificates will enable city superintendents and boards of education to mfore easily determine the exact qualifications of applicants for teaching positions. </seg>

            <seg id="p060">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 60 Examinations for the Third Grade Elementary Certificate Provision for uniform state teachers' examinations is made in Article XIV. SECTION 4. "The county superintendent shall hold a public examination of all persons who are applicants for teachers' certifi - cates, such examinations to be held under the rules and regulations prescribed by the state superintendent of public instruction. Appli - cant's name shall not appear on any answer paper, but shall be desig - nated by a number. Immediately after the close of the examination the county superintendent shall forward all answer papers to the state superintendent of public instruction for examination. The state superintendent shall have all answer papers examined, marked and filed and he shall make a complete and accurate record of all such examinations to be kept on file in his office. He shall transmit within thirty (30) days from the date of said examinations a record of the standings of each applicant to the county superintendent who shall report all grades to the applicant within ten days after receipt of same. All answer papers shall be kept on file in the office of the state superintendent for ninety days." SECTION 5. "Each applicant who is examined for a certificate shall pay, for each number assigned to him, One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) to the county superintendent, One Dollar ($1.00) of which shall go to the Teachers' Institute fund, to be used by him in support of teachers' institutes as provided by law and Fifty Cents (50c) of said fee shall be sent to the state superintendent of public instruction as hereinafter provided. It shall be the duty of the county superintendent immediately after each examination to forward Fifty Cents (50c) for each applicant for a teacher's certificate at such examination to the state superintendent of public instruction. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this article, the state superintendent of public instruction is hereby directed to pay all fees that may conte into his hands as provided herein into the hands of the state treasurer for the general fund." In order to qualify for the Nebraska third grade elemental-} school certificate, the applicant must comply with the provisions of one of two plans. "The requirements for this certificate shall be: "Plan I — Twelve semester hours of college work including six hours in education earned in a standard college, university or statu normal school in this or another state and a minimum grade of seventy per cent, average of eighty per cent, earned upon state examination as hereinafter provided, in agriculture and geography of Nebraska, bookkeeping, civil government, drawing, theory and art, arithmetic, </seg>
            <seg id="p061">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 61 English composition, general geography, grammar, history, mental arithmetic, Nebraska elementary courses of study, orthography, pen - manship, physiology and hygiene, reading, and public school music." "Plan II — Graduation from the normal training course of ar. approved Nebraska normal training high school and a minimum grade of seventy per cent, average eighty per cent, earned upon state examination as hereinafter provided, in agriculture and geography of Nebraska, bookkeeping, civil government, drawing, theory and art, arithmetic, English composition, general geography, grammar, history, mental arithmetic, Nebraska elementary courses of study, orthography, penmanship, physiology and hygiene, reading, and public school music." Questions for the examinations for which provision is made in the above sections are prepared in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The examinations are conducted by the county superintendents of the various counties at the county seat and at such other places as the county superintendent may designate. The county superin - tendent is responsible for the proper conduct of all examinations held within the county. Five examinations in the third grade elementary certificate sub - jects are held during the year. There are fourteen thousand sets of questions printed for the third grade elementary certificate subjects for each examination. These are forwarded to the county superin - tendents at least ten days prior to the date set for the examination. Every possible precaution is taken by the county superintendents to safeguard the integrity of the examination. Questions for each half day are mailed to the various conductors in separate sealed envelopes and these envelopes are not opened until the beginning of the half day during which the questions are to be given and in the presence of the applicants who are to write. At the close of the examination, all manuscripts submitted at all points in the county are forwarded to the county superintendent. The county superintendent carefully checks all papers with the records on file in his office for the purpose of rejecting any that may havo been submitted on numbers upon which the examination rights have been exhausted. The papers are then securely wrapped, sealed and forwarded to the office of the State Superintendent. At the same time, the county superintendent forwards a registra - tion report upon which is listed the name and number of each appli- </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT cant who wrote at the examination. Attached to this report thero must be a remittance of fifty cents for each new number assigned. The bundles of examination papers begin to arrive in the office of the State Superintendent on the Monday following the examination. The papers are then sorted and grouped by subjects by one who has been in charge of this work for a number of years. As soon as the registration reports are received in the office of the State Superintendent, the names and numbers of applicants are copied upon an examination record blank. The financial report and remittance are checked and if found correct, the examination record blanks are placed in the hands of the chief clerk of examinations. After the papers have been sorted and grouped by subjects, they are placed in envelopes and are ready to go to the readers. The first packages of papers go to the readers on Tuesday evening following the examination and they are required to return at least two of these the following morning. As soon as the papers are returned, they are placed in the hands of the chief examination clerk, who with the aid of three assistants, records the grades on the various forms. One clerk reads the grades from the various papers, one makes the individual grade card for each applicant which is filed in the office of the State Superintendent, another lists the grades on the typed report which goes to the county super - intendent, and another lists the grades on a similar or duplicate report which remains on file in the office of the State Superintendent. The chief clerk then reads the grades as listed and the others check to see whether all reports agree. Other checks are made to definitely deter - mine whether the total number of grades listed on all reports in all subjects are in agreement. In fact, four different checks are made so that practically all possibility of error is removed. Since the examination clerks begin the work of recording on Wednesday following the examination, reports are usually ready for four or five counties four days after the date of the examination. There are twelve readers employed in grading the papers sub - mitted in the third grade elementary certificate subjects. Nine of these readers are university or college graduates; two are graduates of state normal schools and have had additional work in summer school; and one has had two years of college work. The sum total of their teaching experience is one hundred forty-seven years. The </seg>
            <seg id="p063">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 63 amount of experience ranges from two years in one case to twenty - five years in another. The median of their teaching experience is 11.74 years. Following each examination, there are a certain number of com - plaints from the applicants and normal training teachers in which the judgment of the readers is questioned. Some of these letters reveal an apparently wide-spread notion to the effect that these papers are read by high school or university students. There are no university students on the staff of readers at the present time, nor have there been any recently so far as we have been able to determine. The staff of readers is made up almost in its entirety from graduates of colleges and universities who have had a wide range of teaching experience. Since these examinations come but five times during the year, it must be apparent that the staff of readers must be in the main recruited from the ranks of those who do not have regular employ - ment. There were about six hundred papers in penmanship submitted at the December, 1926, examination. The reader receives three cents per paper for examining these. The compensation for twenty days of comparatively intensive work is therefore not sufficient to interest anyone except on a part-time basis. Every applicant has a right to request a review in case he is dis - satisfied with the grade assigned to his paper. The request is made through the county superintendent and must be accompanied by a fee of fifty cents for each paper which is to be re-read. If the grade is altered, the fee is returned; if the grade is sustained as originally given, the fee is retained. In some cases grades are raised upon review. In other cases they are lowered. As a matter of fact, experience has proved that in the matter of grading examination papers, grades are more or less relative. Grades assigned to one examination paper when submitted to a dozen competent teachers may vary from five to thirty or forty per cent. Those in charge of the examinations in the office of the State Superintendent make no claim of infallibility, but they do endeavor to be prompt, just and accurate in dealing with every phase of the examinations. The tables which follow show the number of papers submitted for the ten examinations beginning with November, 1926 and ending with the examination held July 21, 1928 together with grades assigned. </seg>

There are one thousand sets of examination questions printed for the second grade high school certificate subjects for each examination. The examinations are held at the county seat points only and on the same dates as the examinations for the third grade elementary certifi - cate. Very few certificates are issued under this plan. Questions are prepared in the main by professors connected with the University of Nebraska. The papers are read by these same professors. Aside from the fact that the law provides that the examinations for the second grade high school certificate must be given, the number who avail themselves of the opportunity to take these examinations scarcely justifies the expense involved.

The Nebraska School Law provides that the third grade elementarv school certificate shall be valid in the kindergarten to the eighth grade inclusive in schools organized under Article 3, and that the second grade elementary school certificate, the first grade elementary school certificate, and the permanent elementary school certificate shall be valid in the kindergarten to the eighth grade inclusive in any school in the state. It provides that the second grade high school certificate, the first grade high school certificate and the permanent high school certificate shall be valid in any school in the state, mak - ing no distinction between the high school and the elementary school. Whether or not every teacher qualified by law to teach in high school is by virtue of holding such a certificate competent or quali - fied to teach in an elementary school is a subject worthy of serious consideration. The average layman will conclude and perhaps be justified in making such a conclusion that any teacher qualified to Permanent) i,liU.UU 'or Validating Life and Institutional Certificates.. 1,986.00 'or Review of Examination Papers 282.50 TOTAL RECEIPTS $20,047.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p089">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 89 teach in high school is equally well qualified to teach in an elementary school. Possibly the greatest need for improvement in educational prac - tice in Nebraska is found in the elementary school. If this is true, the question of how much it involves the problem of certification referred to above will call for consideration. The Nebraska second grade high school certificate under Plan I requires in part that the applicant must have a total of sixty semester hours of college work including twelve semester hours in education. Nothing is said as to the nature of these hours in education and applications have been presented wherein all of the twelve hours offered as work in the field of education were hours based upon work wholly within the field of the primary or kindergarten. It would seem that this situation should be remedied so that the fact that one holds a high school certificate will in itself be sufficient evidence of the fact that the holder of the certificate has actually made adequate preparation to teach in a secondary school. While the Nebraska law makes specific provision for the issuance of special high school certificates to teach music, commercial, art, home economics, manual training and physical education, which certificates are valid only for the subject for which they are issued, the Nebraska second grade high school certificate, the first grade high school certifi - cate and the permanent high school certificate are valid for teaching any subject in any high school in the state. In other words, the second grade high school certificate, the first grade high school certifi - cate and the permanent high school certificate are what might be termed "blanket certificates". There is no provision in the law which prohibits holders of any of the three above named certificates from teaching any subject offered in the high school curriculum. To illustrate, let us assume that the teacher holds a second grade high school certificate based upon sixty semester hours of college credit with twelve in education and twelve in the subjects of English and Mathematics. Let us assume that the remaining twenty-four of the total of sixty hours are distributed as follows: Latin, 12 hours; French, 6 hours; Spanish, 6 hours. Sup - pose that this teacher is employed in a small high school of three teachers. He may be called upon to teach classes in English and Mathematics in which he has had twelve semester hours of work, and in addition, he may be called upon to teach a class in Botany and one in Physics or History. Legally he may teach any of these classes </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT although it must be apparent that he is not qualified to do this work unless he chances to be a very unusual individual. As a matter of fact, there is serious doubt as to whether twelve semester hours of work in college Mathematics is really sufficient preparation for one who is to teach Mathematics in high school. Th» twelve hour requirement as applied to the teaching of a foreign lan - guage might mean that a teacher who had had no work in a foreign language in high school might, by taking two semester hours in excess of one year of college work in this language legally qualify as a teacher of foreign languages in high school. It is rather absurd to think of one who has had two semesters of beginning French, let us say, with two additional semester hours, undertaking to teach French in the high schools of the state. Yet this is what is being done in many instances in Nebraska under the present provisions of the certification law which permit the issuance of blanket certificates. The same situation prevails in the matter of the issuance of in - stitutional certificates, particularly the junior first grade state cer - tificate issued by the University of Nebraska and the private and denominational colleges, and the two year diploma issued by the four state normal schools. The holder of either one of these certificates is legally qualified to teach any subject in any high school in Nebraska, regardless of the subjects in which they have made their major prep - aration and regardless of the nature of the education courses which they have taken. Should all certificates be countersigned by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and credentials upon which they are based be filed in his office? Another situation that is oftentimes disconcerting arises when some school board member, city superintendent or teacher requests information from this office relative to the type of certificate held by some praticular person, when the person in question holds a certificate which was not validated in this office. This case which actually happened last summer illustrates the point. A young lady came to the office of the State Superintendent con - siderably distressed because her certificate had been lost in forward - ing it to a certain county superintendent. In order to accept the teach - ing position which had been offered to her, it was necessary that she have some sort of a statement as to the certificate which she held. </seg>
            <seg id="p091">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 91 Her certificate was not issued by this office and it was suggested that she get in touch with the registrar of the school which had issued the certificate. This she stated was impossible for her to do since the registrar was away on vacation and no one else seemed to be able or willing to supply the necessary information. If the certificate had been issued by this department or even validated in this office, her ability to qualify for the teaching position which was offered would have been assured. How Judge a System of Certification? Competent authorities on school administration are agreed that the points to be used in judging a system of certification are: First, that it be reasonably simple; second, that it recognize the distinction between responsibility of different teaching positions; third, that it provide for an apprenticeship period; fourth, that its terms shall be in some degree self-explanatory; and fifth, that the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall be the agency through which all certificates issued by all certification agencies in the state shall be validated. The citizens of the State of Nebraska have a right to expect that the office of the State Superintendent shall have on file at all times a record of all teachers' certificates in force in the state. At the present time this information is not available since the State Super - intendent is without authority to require that certificates issued by the other certification agencies clear through the office of the State Superintendent. </seg>

            <seg id="p093">GEORGE W. ROSENLOF, Director Division of Secondary Education and Teacher Training INTRODUCTION The Division of Secondary Education and Teacher Training was not evolved in a single day. Prior to 1907 there was no distinct division as such. In 1907, however, the organization of the State Department indicated that Mr. E. C. Bishop, in addition to serving as the Deputy State Superintendent, was designated as "inspector of high schools not accredited to the University of Nebraska". With the passage of the high school normal training bill in 1907, there was created a new division of responsibility and Mr. I. A. Downey was selected by the Superintendent, Mr. McBrien, to become in - spector of normal training in high schools. This obtained until the school year 1910 when we find that Mr. Gregory was designated as inspector of normal training, no one apparently being designated as responsible for the inspection of non-accredited high schools. In 1915, under Superintendent Thomas' administration, the divi - sion of secondary schools was created with Mr. R. D. Moritz, Mr. O. P. Stewart and Miss Wheeler being in charge. But with the change of administration in the school year 1916-1917, Superintendeni Clemmons perfected a new organization, placing Mr. Dixon in charge of normal training inspection work. There was no longer a distinct division of secondary education. This condition obtained until 1923 - 1924 when by virtue of legislative enactments the whole program of directing secondary education and teacher training came under tht supervision of Mr. Archer L. Burnham. Mr. Burnham had been for four years designated as the "inspector of normal training". Prior to 1923 there seems to have been a dual responsibility for inspection of secondary education in Nebraska with the result that there was a very apparent duplication of activities by University examiners and members of the State Department. The present Division of Secondary Education and Teacher Training, as such, dates from 1923 to the present time. Mr. Burnham was the first one to be responsible for this duty, the present director being the successor to Mr. Burnham. There is perhaps no part of the organization of our public school system quite so typically American as our free public high school. While our high schools had their origin first in the Latin grammar schools, which were typical of the secondary school system found </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 94 throughout Europe in the early history of our American life, and while this high school had its origin also in the so-called "transition academy", it is no less true that the American school has in it elements distinctly different from those in either the Latin grammar school or the transition academy. The Latin grammar school, as such, was an aristocratic institution in most respects, with a curriculum that in comparison with our present day curriculum was decidedly narrow. The student-body of these former schools represented a rather select group of individuals. It is a matter of record that Harvard lists all of its students according to their rank and social standing. In the eighteenth century, however, with the rise of the demo cratic spirit as manifested during the period of the American Revolu - tion and the years following, there was a very decided tendency for the schools to become mbre democratic. The Latin grammar school could not meet the new demands that were being made, socially, economically or otherwise. We have reason to believe that in addi - tion to these facts, the many advances being made in the field of science, with their attendant influences upon industry, were very positive factors in the rise of the American academy. The curriculum of the academy was somewhat broader and, con - trary to that of the Latin grammar school, was built upon the cur - riculum of the common school. It prepared students not only to go directly into life and participate in the affairs of life but also te enter upon collegiate training. The academies spread very rapidly throughout the country. Cubberley tells us in his "History of Edu - cation" that by 1850 there were more than 6000 of these schools in the states then comprising the Union, enrolling some 260,000 or more pupils. The first American high school of a public nature was established at Boston in 1821. From then until after the settlement of the famous Kalamazoo high school case in 1872 we have a very steady growth and development in the extension of the high school movement. The period of greatest development in the number of schools established prior to 1900 was during the decade 1890 to 1899 when more than 1300 public schools were established. There were in 1902, according to E. G. Dexter, the author of "A History of Education in the United States", 3179 high schools. In 1924, according to the United States Bureau of Education, there were not less than 12,000 high schools in the United States from which graduated more than </seg>
            <seg id="p095">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 95 294,000 students. The enrollment in public high schools has grown from 357,813 in 1890 to 3,741,087 in 1924. The rate of increase mounts at each successive census period. "Perhaps no part of the American public school sys - tem," says Cubberley, "has been subjected to such critical scrutiny during the past quarter of a century as that which we designate the secondary school. Especially during the past ten years has the questioning of existing secondary arrangements been particularly searching and many new proposals for curriculum reorganization to meet the needs of new social objectives have been advanced by critical workers in this field of public education. "In European lands as well as the United States has the new ferment been at work and today there is a chal - lenge of old aims and purposes and objectives and a marked tendency to re-shape the school to make of it an instrument expressive of a larger democratic purpose. In particular has the center of gravity in instruction been shifted from subject matter to the pupil and especially to his needs as a member of society. So great has been this change in direc - tion of the school that a textbook on secondary education that is ten years old can scarcely hope to represent the modern point of view." 1 This makes all the more significant the importance to be attached to the function of this division of the State Department of Public Instruction. In the degree to which this division of the State Department can contribute out of its practical field of activ - ities a contribution that will bring about more certainly the desired and necessary improvements through a wise and adequate super - visory program, in that degree, will it justify its existence. The Function of This Division The Division of Secondary Education and Teacher Training has under its direction all those activities in any way related to the state's supervisory responsibility for the maintenance and development of Nebraska's secondary or high schools and their accreditment to the University of Nebraska. This department does not feel that its responsibility merely lies in the field of inspection for accreditment purposes only. Were this all for which it existed, then, it would hardly be justified in commanding the time and services of individuals who have given many years of service to 'Cubberley, Douglas: "Secondary Education", page vii. </seg>

The University of Nebraska maintains no "inspector" or "vis - itor" of accredited schools. By arrangement with the State De - partment of Public Instruction, the University committee on ac - credited schools accepts the reports of visitation and inspection made by officials of this department in lieu of reports made by University representatives. 1 In the second place, this division is and has been charged with the oversight of normal training in the high schools of this state, this program being wholly and solely under the direction of the State Department. For the insurance of its uniformity, for the guaranteeing of its quality and the furtherance of its program this division is held distinctly responsible. 1 A third function, shared jointly with the University of Ne - braska, is that of preparing courses of study and curricula to serve as guides to the schools of the state desiring to be accredited institutions, whose graduates would be under no penalty in seeking admission to the University or other higher institution of learning to pursue their further educational preparation. From time to time there is issued the "High School Manual", the last one having been issued in 1926. A new manual is now in course of preparation and should be ready for distribution about January 1. Material for this manual has been issued from time to time during the past six months as University Extension News bulletins, representing as they do the preliminary reports of the several committees that have been responsible for its preparation. The secretary of the central committee is the director of this division of the State Department of Public Instruction. The new manual when completed will represent the best efforts of the authorities to prescribe certain courses of study in the various fields of instruction for the various high school grades, so outlined and planned as to provide for a minimum of essentials arranged and grouped to insure continuity, unity, and effectiveness 'See Nebraska Statutes, Article XI.

No arbitrary measures are anticipated or intended other than insistence upon the observance of what are ever recog - nized as common sense provisions and standards of attainment. The immediate needs are always recognized as well as the antici - patory needs of those who are fortunate enough to be able to pursue a course of higher education beyond a secondary level. The fourth responsibility of this division was the direction of and the editing of the recently published bulletin on character education. Stnate File 236' provided for instruction in the first twelve grades of all public, private, parochial and denomina - tional schools in the State of Nebraska in the matter of character education — upright and desirable citizenry. Such bulletins have been prepared by the department and distributed to the schools of the state for the guidance of the teachers in their program of citizenship training. It is reasonable to assume that this division will continue to be responsible for the further development and improvement of this course of study, having, of course, the cooperation of the Division of Rural Education in perfecting the work for the rural schools. To that end the State Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion has created a commission on character education, of which the director of this division is a member, which commission is to "enter upon experimental activities, devise specific type lessons or programs of study, test all procedures, and report to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction such results as are deemed worthy and significant. The commission may be empowered to collaborate with the State Department in making such construc - tive changes in the character education bulletin as careful investi - gation in the field of inquiry may justify." It is reasonable to expect, finally, that this division of the Department of Public Instruction will ever be ready to cooperate with all other divisions of the Department of Public Instruction, the public, private, parochial and denominational schools, elemen - tary and secondary and higher, and with the people of the state at large in the furtherance of their various activities to the end that a state program of education may be constantly improved and developed and made to more certainly and more fully sub - serve the needs of the individual and the society of which the individual is the important unit.

            <seg id="p098">98 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT This division of the State Department must ever be a student of the many significant and far-reaching changes that are taking place in the reorganization and redirection of the secondary school. It must ever be in a position to wisely advise and counsel with all responsible persons in any way charged with the duty of de - veloping a program of secondary education in Nebraska. High School Accreditment The University of Nebraska maintains a list of accredited schools, the graduates of which are admitted to the University (and to nearly all of the colleges and universities of the United States) without entrance examinations in any subjects that have been properly certified as completed within these schools. Unless a graduate of an accredited school, the candidate for admission must be prepared to take an examination in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired; provided, that graduates from non - accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examinations by passing an intelligence test with a standing that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman. Accredited schools are such as are found to meet the standards of accreditment, these standards being set forth in detail in the High School Manual. There is now but one list of schools fully accredited to the University of Nebraska. For the convenience of the smaller com - munities, however, the University of Nebraska has established a list of minor accredited schools, the graduates of which may receive fourteen units on credentials, giving them conditional ad - mission to the college. Additional credit can be secured by exam - ination or by completing satisfactorily thirty college hours of work.

The growth in enrollments in all public secondary schools has increased in five years more than 20 per cent, whereas the enrollment in accredited public high schools has grown 16 per cent. The number of schools accredited to the University has increased practically 25 per cent in 5 years. The number of persons employed as instructors in these schools has increased approximately 10 per cent. The number of graduates from secondary schools reached its peak in 1926 when 10,800 were reported. This represented an increase of about 17.5 per cent. Contrasting these figures with those given in the summary of school statistics on page 314, we find that while the total enroll - ments in all public elementary and secondary schools have shown a decrease from 330,623 in 1924-1925 to 326^71 in 1927-1928, the en - rollments in public high schools, accredited and non-accredited, have increased from 54,191 in 1924-1925 to 65,081 in 1927-1928. This means a decrease of approximately one and one-half per cent (1.5%) in total enrollments in the public schools, elementary and secondary, and an increase of twenty per cent (20%) in the enrollments in our high schools. One must conclude from this that the holding power of the secondary school in Nebraska has been very materially improved in the past few years. This is completely in conformity to the evidences being produced throughout the nation. .accredited schools 54,191 58,763 60,106 61,457 65,081 Inrollment in accredited high schools 51,874 54,355 55,234 58,272 60,282 lumber of accredited high schools I 410 435 456 472 482 lumber of teachers in accredited high schools i 2,709 2,646 2,925 | 2,977 3,079 iraduates from accredited high schools i 9,198 10,044 ! 10,800 10,080 11,331 </seg>

The object of the Association is one of establishing closer rela - tionships between the secondary schools and institutions of higher learning within the group of states in the North Central areas as well as such other areas of the United States as the Association elects to recognize. Membership is purely voluntary. There is and can be no com - pulsion. Any school choosing to become a member of the Associa - tion may make application therefor and having been examined by those authorized to make such examination and having been found to meet the standards as set up will be recommended for approval. To quote from the Constitution, "All decisions of the Association bearing on the policy and management of higher and secondary insti - tutions are understood to be advisory in their character". In general the standards for accreditment are in all respects higher than those now being set up and maintained by the University of Nebraska. The significance of this plan of regional accreditment lies in the fact that graduates of such institutions as are accredited to the Association are admitted to most, if not all, higher institutions of learning in the United States. Neither does this Association seek to control the individual schools when accredited either as regards their course of study, their curriculum, their plan of organization for administration and supervision, the personnel of their faculties, etc. This Association has approved the applications of 96 public high schools and 16 private high schools in Nebraska.

            <seg id="p108">108 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Normal Training Nebraska has for twenty-one years been committed to a program of high school normal training. It is the judgment of the depart - ment that Nebraska must continue such a program of teacher train - ing for a considerable number of years to come. There are no evi - dences at the present time that the problem of training rural teachers can be solved any differently than we are now trying to solve it, namely, through the agencies of approved normal training high schools. The growth of such schools has been very gradual and in most instances entirely justified by the demands made upon the schools for such training facilities. In 1907-1908, which marked the first year of the program in Nebraska, there were 69 approved normal training high schools with an enrollment of 1212 students, of whom 550 were the first graduates. In June, 1928, there was a total of 226 such normal training high schools with an enrollment of 5094 students. The number of graduates was 1912. Since 1924 there has been a slight decrease in the number of schools, the largest number being 251, the total number of students, 7016. The largest number of grad - uates from normal training courses was shown to be in 1924 when 2664 were graduated.

In the light of adverse criticism of the high school normal train- ing program being voiced not only in Nebraska but in many other states, it is well to ask at this point whether Nebraska can afford to continue to support such a program. It is the contention of the Department of Public Instruction that the program of teacher-train- ing in our selected secondary schools ought to continue. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Nebraska employed during the year just past 14,203 teachers in its public schools of whom 6438 were rural teachers teaching in one - or two-room rural schools, the number of such schools being 6294. Enrolled in these schools were 109,824 boys and girls. The teachers for these schools were employed on a one-year contract and received for their services an average of $768.18 annually or $85.35 per month. According to Miss Blunk's study l the "Miss Mythical Average Teacher" of 1925-1926 taught in a one-room rural school in her home county a little over five miles from a village and seven and one-half miles from her home. She received $90 per month or $720 per school year. Her experience in the rural schools was found to be three years, having occupied her present position but one year. She was not planning to return to her present position the next year. Upon graduation from high school she had attended some college or normal school for approximately 15 weeks. An earlier study made by Dr. Rosenlof while pursuing graduate work at Columbia revealed conditions very similar to these just cited. It should be made clear that this investigation was made prior to his appointment to the office he now holds in the department and is, therefore, unbiased and uncolored. As a matter of fact, Dr. Rosenlof proposed that high school normal training be brought to an end in 1932. This opinion was altogether based upon principles, theories and predispositions prior to his entrance upon the field of actual service in handling the problem. Fifty-five county superintendents or 60 per cent of the entire number of superintendents in the state responded to the inquiry sent out. Their replies reported a total of 4559 rural teachers employed in the 55 counties of whom more than 1200 were teachers of no previous experience. This is approximately 25 per cent of the entire number. For all classes of teachers, rural and urban, slightly more than eight - teen per cent were new and inexperienced. These figures would tend to indicate a need for more than 2500 teachers annually for all schools of the state. Of this number, certainly, from 1800 to 2000 would be needed for the rural teaching positions. Data compiled more recently show no improvement. Eighty-five county superintendents cooperated in supplying these data. The total number of teachers employed in one- and two-room rural schools was reported to be 5950. Two superintendents did not find it possible to supply all the facts called for. Deducting the total number of teachers 1 Blunk. Ella : "The Rural School Teacher".

            <seg id="p111">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 111 employed in these counties we have for the remaining 83 counties 5781 teachers. Of these 1528 were new to their positions. This represents 26.5 per cent turnover. Adding to this number 1185 who were teaching their second year we find 2713 teachers, or slightly less than 47 per cent of the entire number who have taught two years or less. Sixty-seven county superintendents reporting a total of 4830 teachers in their one- and two-room rural schools stated further that the estimated number of new teachers for the year 1928-1929 would be 1560 or 32 per cent of the entire rural teaching force. The above figures lead one to conclude that the need for new teachers for the rural schools does not represent less than 25 per cent of the total number of rural teachers employed and may repre - sent more than 30 per cent. Elwood P. Cubberley of Leland Stan - ford University, an authority in the field of public school administra - tion, holds that the turnover of new teachers in the rural schools represents from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of the total number em - ployed. From What Sources are We to Expect These Teachers to Come? In 1927-1928, 226 high school normal training classes were or - ganized with an enrollment of 5094 juniors and seniors. Of this number 1912 were graduated as "normal trainers". Not all of these graduates ever complete the required seventeen examinations or make application for and receive certificates. Re - ports from the Certification Division show quite conclusively that a considerable percentage of the graduates never complete their exam - inations. Of more than 2000 seniors enrolled in 1926-1927, only 1001 passed in all the required examinations while but 656 of these actually made application for and received their certificates. Of the 2302 seniors in the class of 1927-1928, 1259 passed in all the required ex-. animations while but 771 of these were certificated. Of those who were not certificated or did not complete the normal training program many continued their training in the teachers col - leges and other institutions of a collegiate grade. This is altogether to be expected. For, be it said to the credit of high school normal training, it has been one of the chief factors in leading its graduates to continue to better prepare themselves for a greater and more effective professional service. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT These facts indicate very clearly that many of the statements to the effect that high school normal training is "flooding the market" with teachers is not at all well established. Doubtless there are some sections of the state where normal training facilities have been pro vided to a greater extent than is advisable or necessary, but there are other sections of the state where the need is just as great today as it ever was. Our firm belief is that nowhere can one find facts to justify the contention that we have now reached the place where we can well afford to eliminate high school normal training. From the Biennial Report for 1926, Chadron, Kearney, Peru, and Wayne reported the issuance of only 88 elementary rural and ad - vanced rural state certificates in 1925. In 1926 these four schools reported only 67 such certificates. This is but a drop in the bucket in comparison with the number of individuals needed for the rural schools. It is true, en the other hand, that these four state teacher* colleges issued in 1925, 244 general elementary certificates; and, in 1926, 289 general elementary certificates. Assuming that all of these were to be placed in the rural schools, we would have but 332 for 1926 and 356 for 1926. A careful checking of the "minutes" of Normal School Board Proceedings, dating from February, 1927, to September, 1928, inclu - sive, indicates still further that the numbers of individuals attending the four state teachers colleges and registering for such work as will lead to their completion of prescribed courses necessary to re - ceiving a "Rural Elementary" or "Professional Rural" certificate are not increasing in any considerable degree. The far greater number ot certificates are the "General Elementary". These records are set forth in the following table: Institutional Certificates Issued February, 1927 to September, 1928 Schools Certificates Chadron Kearney Peru Wayne Total Elementary Rural 12 94 14 72 192 i Professional Rural 7 18 0 0 25 General Elementary . . . 45 339 106 282 772 TOTAL 74 451 120 3E4 989 </seg>
            <seg id="p113">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION It is clearly shown that the number of certificates now being annually issued by these institutions is not a significant number in proportion to the number doubtless needed to fill the rural school positions of the state. Our first consideration, therefore, is that our present program in the state teachers colleges and normal schools for the training of rural teachers is wholly inadequate to the need that would have to be met were the high school normal training classes suddenly dis - banded. Again, we have no reason for assuming that as many students would be trained for teaching positions in the centralized teachers colleges. For the parents it is far more economical to have then 1 receive their training in schools near enough that they may keep their children at home. The necessary financial burden of sending them away, the expense of beard and rcom, of travel, of increased demands for clothes; in short, all the higher costs represented in these institutions tend to eliminate many who could not afford take the teacher-training course. In brief, hundreds of young men and women in our high schools look to high school normal training as the only source of their first preparation for a vocation either temporary or permanent. Not only that, but parents maintain that our secondary schools should give more attention to preparing stu - dents for vocations than is now the case. Outside of the commercial courses there are no other avenues open to the young women graduat - ing from our high schools. A third consideration is very apparent to us all, namely, the tendency for college students to look askance at the rural teaching positions. As a matter of fact, students in our teachers colleges and normal schools look with great disfavor upon any rural school teach - ing position. Consequently, normal schools and teachers colleges have to a very large extent ignored completely the demands of the rural schools and have failed or have found it unwise to offer courses of study designed especially to train rural school teachers and leaders. Very few state teachers colleges here in Nebraska or elsewhere report enrollments of more than 50 students in courses in rural edu - cation. It is a well known fact, also, that in many if not most of the teacher-training institutions, instructors are constantly talking to </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 114 students in terms of disparagement of rural teaching and rural life. The atmosphere of the school is altogether the opposite of what is expected. The discussions ensuing between the teachers and those taught, as to where their students will locate show all too clearly this attitude of showing up the shortcomings and the weaknesses of the rural schools and the impossibilities of doing things that are worth while or of producing results that can be talked about in the daily papers. Advancement in rural teaching positions, these teachers say, is too difficult and uncertain. Then, too, the students who rate above the average, those who show promise of leadership are all encouraged to go on and complete advanced courses and prepare themselves for the more responsible teaching positions. Naturally, having been thus encouraged and urged and having gone on and completed more advanced work, they cannot afford or at least think they cannot afford to return to rural schools to teach. The results are all too evident — the poorer students are the only ones left to man the rural school teaching positions. Who suffers? Why, the very ones who are as deserving and as worthy of having the best teachers money can buy — the boys and girls in the rural schools of our country. We might even go one step further and insist that because of our present inadequate provision for better super - vision and administration of rural schools, they ought to be taught by the very cream of the teaching profession — by those capable of thinking and acting wisely for themselves. To digress for a moment, it is perhaps proper to state at this point that statements to the effect that normal training students do not represent the better types of individuals in our high schools are not substantiated by the facts. During the past year, all normal training students were given a battery of tests, the results of which were made a matter of con - siderable study. Attention is called to the results of two of the tests, viz., the "Otis Self Administering Test of Mental Ability", and the "Cross English Test". In the Otis S-A Test given to 2336 members of the senior normal training classes, or 97 per cent of the total number enrolled, the median I. Q. (Intelligence Quotient) of the people was found to be </seg>
            <seg id="p115">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 115 102.5 or 2.5 points above the normal score for the I. Q. or 100. The middle 50 per cent of the entire group represent a range in terms of I.

In terms of "brightness" (that constant quality which determines the rate of growth of mental ability of an individual and the degree of mental ability which he will eventually reach) 1938 or 82.9 per cent of the number tested are normal, superior or very superior. But 238 are shown to be below normal of which number 199 may be con - sidered dull. Only 39 students, or less than 2 per cent of the entire number according to this test, are very inferior individuals. See Table 1 on next page, and Chart I, on page 117. </seg>

Those in the senior classes represent, in the main, only those that were able to complete satisfactorily the courses prescribed for the juniors. This is entirely as it should be. The second test to which we refer is the Cross English Test given to the same normal training students and at about the same time as the S-A Achievement Test in Mental Ability. "The Cross English Test is designed primarily for high school seniors and college freshmen, to measure their ability to use the correct grammatical forms of English and accept- </seg>

It is suitable, however, for all grades of junior and senior high schools. * » * * "The purpose of the test is to obtain an accurate, objec - tive measure of the ability of a student to use correctly the common English forms in order to compare the ability of the individual with others of the class, to determine the special needs of the students for certain kinds of instruction, to meas - ure the progress of a student or a class in learning the correct forms of English, to compare the ability of one class with that of another, etc. The teacher may compare not only the relative progress of different individuals but also the relative efficiency of different methods of instruction. * * * * "College entrance examinations. The traditional entrance examinations in English have been found unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. It has been found that no two in - structors will rate a composition or other examination paper of the usual type in the same way. It has also been found diffi - cult to test a wide variety of aspects of English ability in the time available for the examination. The time required to read and grade the ordinary entrance examination in English is very great. The Cross English Test obviates many of the disad - vantages of the older type of entrance examination in English. It is objective and must be scored in the same manner by all scorers. It covers a wide range of aspects of ability in English and can be scored in very much less time than the ordinary examination. "There has been a deepening conviction among college officials also that a high school diploma, as now frequently given, does not give assurance that the student has the ability in English to do satisfactory work in that subject or to warrant a college diploma without additional study in English. For this reason there is a distinct need for a new type of examina - tion in English, such as the Cross test, as a college entrance examination in the use of correct forms in speaking and writ - ing." i It is seen, therefore, that any measure of the students' ability based upon the results obtained from the giving of this test to students ought to be and is a very reliable measure. It is for this reason that this test was chosen as one of the battery of tests given to the normal training classes. The Department in reporting the results of this study wishes to acknowledge here the very valuable services of Mr. Floyd W. Miles, a graduate student in the University of Nebraska, who compiled the data and prepared the various tables and graphs based upon these compilations.

            <seg id="p121">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 121 Mr. Miles tabulated the results from 162 normal training schools enrolling 1841 juniors and 1819 seniors. This represents more than 70 per cent of all the schools, 68 per cent of the juniors and 75 per cent of the seniors enrolled in the normal training classes. A summary of the results for the eight parts of the test as administered to the juniors shows a median score of 125, the lower quartile being 114 and the upper 137. This gives an inter-quartile spread of 23 points. For the seniors, the median score is 128, the lower quartile being 117 and the upper quartile, 139. Here an inter - quartile spread of 22 points is shown. The results compared with the standards set up by the author of the test shows the junior median to be 10 points below thot of the established norm, the inter-quartile spread being exactly that of the established norm. The senior median is 13 points below the norm established by Dr. Cross. However, the inter-quartile spread or deviation from the norm is not nearly so great as that of Dr. Cross' findings. In the case of the latter there is a spread of 31 points — this being 9 points greater than is found to be true of the deviation for Nebraska. A further comparison of these results in Nebraska with those found in a study of 1692 college freshmen at the University of Vir - ginia in 1925 and 1583 freshmen at the same institution in 1926 shows very favorable results. Whereas the median for Nebraska senior normal trainers, as determined by a test of seniors at the beginning of their senior year is shown to be 128, the median for the Virginia freshmen in 1925 and 1926 was reported to be 130 and 128 respec - tively. We conclude that, while the standards of Dr. Cross are somewhat higher and should represent an ideal situation, the attainments of junior and senior normal trainers as manifested by the tests are not to be considered in any sense as typifying a lower degree of knowledge of correct English or ability to use the same in one's speaking and writing. There is every reason to believe that these students in our normal training classes are the equal of any other groups of secondary students enrolled in our public schools in the matter of English. Tables 3 and 4 and Charts III and IV, as prepared by Mr. Miles, show very clearly the distribution of scores made by the juniors and seniors of the normal training classes. </seg>

            <seg id="p126">126 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Doubtless much of the ground for the notions held by some that the normal training courses are taken by students of inferior ability is due to the fact that those who fail as high school normal trainers do go on to some higher institution of learning, particularly teachers colleges and normal schools and attempt to complete the work leading to the issuance of an institutional certificate. That there are many such will doubtless not be denied and it is this type of student that gives rise to the claim that high school normal trainers are not representative of the rank and file of secondary school stu - dents. The State Department is not ready to admit in any degree that this is so. The Department insists that these students are as capable and as intelligent as any other group of students. The De - partment is ready to go one step further and say that in the large majority of cases the normal trainers are representative of the very finest and best of our high school population. Such facts as revealed above are conclusive evidence of the justification of the assumption just made. Without our present facilities for training our rural teachers in our high school teacher-training classes, there is no question but that the rural schools would be the first to suffer were we to dis - pense with the high school normal training program. Doubtless there are many other factors which might be considered and which would even more clearly justify our present program but to these we cannot now take time to refer. One might well raise the ques - tion of centralization vs. decentralization. One might well raise the question of the vocational vs. the cultural aim of secondary educa - tion. Doubtless if one were to direct a question to the county su - perintendents of the state, asking them if they would favor the discontinuance of normal training in the high school, 75 to 80 per cent of them would without hesitancy say "no". As a matter of fact, Dr. Rosenlof found that 45 to 55 county superintendents from whom he asked just this question replied in the negative, eight superin - tendents were non-committal, while only two clearly stated themselves as favoring the discontinuance of the program. One county superin - tendent of a considerable number of years experience said, "We find the normal training graduates of high school normal training classes as a rule do much better work and have a better knowledge of methods than those who have had one year or less of college work". Another said, "It takes one of the drawing points away from our high school to eliminate high school normal training. We give them more personal attention than the larger schools do. It keeps them at home — they are away too much now." A third county superintendent said, "Normal training in the high schools is the most practical vocational work given there today. These normal </seg>
            <seg id="p127">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 127 training students, when remaining in the work, almost without a single exception continue their normal training in some college or university. Under present conditions the college or university stu - dent will not go into the country schools to teach." And, a fourth one makes this singular statement, "So far as is consistent with sound educational policies and advancement, I favor keeping the in - stitutions intended as fitting schools for the beginning teachers as nearly within reach of the homes of our patrons as possible. Our students are all too soon separated from the home, and the parents should have an active directing influence over the courses pursued by the advancing pupils." We might ask this question, "Does high school normal training lower standards of teaching?" Evidence everywhere clearly demon - strates, from all of the investigations and demonstrations in the field, that the plan has insured and made certain a much higher quality of certificated teachers. Professor Mabel Carney of Teachers College, Columbia, has said that those who make the statement that high school normal train - ing lowers standards of teaching should remember this important fact, to- wit: "The choice does not lie between high school training and full rank normal-school preparation but rather between what the high school can do and nothing." One might well raise another question, "Should rural teachers be prepared in our high schools?" The answer, again, of Miss Carney is significant. She says, "Prac - tically all students of the rural teacher situation in the United States are agreed that teacher training in our high schools on a sec - ondary level is the practical solution of our present situation. The 100,000 teachers in our rural schools who in 1923 had no professional preparation whatever and less than two years of education beyond the eighth grade presents a convincing argument for retaining such courses and making them as efficient as possible until such a time as we can economically, satisfactorily and assuredly train them in our higher institutions of learning." In concluding this discussion of high school normal training, it is our desire to indicate that when a state is ready, able and willing to put creditable sums of money into consolidation, rural school salaries, better living conditions and effective well-staffed rural school departments in its teachers colleges, only then is it ready to give up its high school normal training and provide for the training of our teachers on a college level. Eventually, we shall discontinue such a policy, but in the middle west, in states like Nebraska, we cannot bring about effectively </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 128 such a change for a considerable number of years. Our task is then to make our teacher-training program effective, more definite and more valuable by perfecting our courses of study, by fixing higher requirements as to practice teaching and graded participation and observation, and by training more superior people as directors and teachers for such high school normal training classes. We have not as a nation nor have we as a state solved our problem of rural education. As Professor Carney has so clearly shown, we have lacked a proper appreciation not only of the sig - nificance but also of the seriousness of the rural problem. We have never built up constructive state programs for solving our difficul - ties and have all too frequently given insufficiently of our material resources to this particular phase of education. The perfection of high school normal training program is but one of the preliminary steps forward. No one looks upon it as a permanent solution. It is but a single step. We must not take the next step until we are ready for fear that the very schools which we are trying to serve may suffer and fall behind. Character Education When Senate File 236 was made a part of the school law of the State of Nebraska there was brought into being a new statutory provision concerning the course of study and the curriculum of our public, private and denominational schools. There was also placed in hands of the State Department the responsibility of preparing materials and making them available to all the schools of the state. To this task the department set itself, appointing Professor F. M. Gregg, Professor of Psychology, Wesleyan University, and Archer L. Burnham, then the Director of Secondary Education, to assist in drafting the course which was submitted to the teachers of the state for their guidance in developing the program. In the foreword to this bulletin it was clearly stated that the course was tentative and subject to revision. It was urged that educational agencies everywhere within the state would feel free to discuss the course in the most vigorous fashion to the end that from all such discussions there would grow up new information and new materials for our guidance in planning our future program. Ultimately it is hoped that the course will develop into one of the finest and, at the same time, soundest and sanest treatments of the entire subject of character training and citizenship building. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 129 From the time that this bulletin appeared up to the very present moment, the State Department has been besieged with requests from every state in the Union as well as from many points outside of the United States for copies. The original number of 25,000 copies has been in such great demand that there are today but 600 copies left and at the rate these are being called for the present edition will be completely exhausted by January first. On the other hand, the subject of "Character Education" has been more discussed in the many teachers meetings and other edu - cational gatherings, in every county teachers institute in Nebraska, and at all of the Nebraska State Teachers Association meetings held in Nebraska during the past two years than any other subject. Members of the Department have appeared before many civic organi - zations, Parent-Teacher Associations and religious groups, both within the state and without, for the purpose of presenting as man' facts and enlisting the cooperation of the many communities to the end that the success of this major activity might be insured in the largest degree possible. No efforts have been spared to make the program more effec - tive. The active support of teacher-training institutions of the state has been encouraged to the end that teacher-training courses dealing explicitly with problems of the techniques and methods of procedure for presenting character education might be offered. In this effort we have been greatly encouraged, for during the past summer *he University of Nebraska, the State Teachers Colleges and many of the private colleges of the state provided special teacher-training courses in Character Education. In all of these many students enrolled. In the one course offered at the University of Nebraska this past summer there were enrolled 200 college students. Extension courses have been developed by several of our institutions, the enrollments in which have been very encouraging. Already reports have come into the Department indicating no abatement of interest in the matter and many such course offerings are being planned for next summer again. In our public schools we find the faculties have taken concerted action to consider in a very specific manner the problem of Charac - ter Education and have developed individual programs and individual devices for perfecting their techniques and procedures. Everywhere there are genuine evidences of a deep concern for the problem. Those responsible for administering and supervising curricula have been most unanimous in their action in stimulating the classroom teachers to put forth their every effort to make the character education pro - gram effective. </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The Department takes this opportunity to express its unbounded approval of the splendid cooperation of all the schools in Nebraska. It is most truly appreciated. In February, 1928, at the urgent request of many individuals, rep - resenting particularly the rural schools, the Department issued a supplementary bulletin intended primarily for these schools. Appre - ciating the fact that the problems involved were and are difficult and appreciating further the fact that our many definitions are more or less indefinite and hazy, it was felt that such a supplementary bulletin might be of considerable help to the young, more or less untrained and inexperienced teacher. Such a bulletin, it was thought, would serve as a suggestive guide in properly interpreting and using the course of study already prepared and in the hands of the teachers. In this bulletin some very positive suggestions and approaches to the development of the program were made. The last two pages of this bulletin were prepared with a view to securing information directly from the teachers as to the use they have been able to make of the bulletins and the difficulties they have experienced. Opportunity was given the teachers to ex - press themselves as to what they had been able to introduce in the way of projects and devices. Finally, they were asked to make any suggestions that would be of value to the Department in de - veloping the future program and activities. A similar blank calling for information was directed to superin - tendents of schools throughout the state. All of the information thus obtained is being analyzed and studied and all suggestions are being considered and will be considered in modifying any future bulletins that may be issued. As has been stated earlier, the State Department has planned for and has created — in part, at least — a Character Education Com - mission, the purpose of which, cooperating with other educational and civic agencies, will be to make a wider and more specific study of the whole problem, hoping thereby to develop new points of emphasis and new procedures and techniques, as well as new ma - terials of instruction for use in the schools of the state. Finally, it is proposed that the State Superintendent of Public Instruction call for a Character Education Conference for the State of Nebraska, the same to be called in the not distant future with a view of considering and studying every phase of the subject of character education. To this conference will be invited outstanding </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 131 individuals, nationally known leaders and students of the problem of character training. In this conference there will be included representatives and delegates of every civic, social, educational and religious organization in the state. Not only will professional men be included, but the business men, the men who represent the large economic and industrial interests of the commonwealth. Out of this conference should grow a very concerted move - ment, bread in its purpose, far-reaching in its effects and genuinely progressive in its nature — a movement that will crystallize itself in a concerted effort on the part of all of the people of the state to bring to our educational institutions a program worthy of the re - spect and the attention of the leaders of thought and action through - out the nation. The proposal to call such a Character Education Conference has been prompted by demands from many different organizations and associations throughout the state. Among those who have passed appropriate resolutions and petitions to the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction are the Nebraska Council of Christian Education, the Nebraska Synod of the Presbyterian Church, U. S. A., Franklin County Ministerial Association, The county Sunday School Associations of the counties of Holt, Dawes, Cherry, Pierce, Banner, Grant, Lincoln, Hitchcock, Boyd, Antelope, Oixon, Franklin, Cheyenne and Otoe, and finally 39 ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Nebraska. This office has received many suggestions from private in - dividuals expressing themselves as distinctly favorable to the calling of such a conference. We cannot do better at this point than to quote from our dis - cussion in the supplementary bulletin in order to set forth what has been the purpose and policy thus far: METHODOLOGY OF CHARACTER EDUCATION "The State Department of Public Instruction holds no brief for any particular method or methods to be used in the furtherance of character education in the public schools of Nebraska. Our one and only conception of responsibility to the citizenship of this Commonwealth of ten years or twenty years hence is to faithfully discharge our duty as the servant of the State in making available for use in the schools materials of instruction in character education inso - far as funds will permit or ability warrant. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 132 "So far as the history of education in the United States reveals, this nation has been committed more or less de - terminedly to the indirect teaching of morals through our subject matter courses, our classroom activities — intra-curricu - lar and extra-curricular — and through the necessary regimen of classroom or school management policies. "There is no doubt but that the indirect method of in - struction in morals and character has its advantages. Such a method can be used and has been used most effectively in the instructional process. It permits most certainly of do - ing what has been so aptly expressed in the words, 'striking when the iron is hot'. It permits of using the situation of the moment, logically and psychologically, for 'driving home' some valuable lessons in the matter of right conduct and behavior, right social relationships, respect for one's home and country, one's laws and customs, and respect for the dignity of labor. "Such a method does not become a 'preachment'. It is not readily thought of as 'moralizing'. It does not thrust itself into strange places at sundry times. "Some one has said, 'there is no royal road to learning'. Such a philosophy is false, for if you will but think of your own experiences, you will very quickly call to mind many things you have learned or many modes of behavior you have acquired through indirect, incidental and timely experiences. And these have been so learned as to never be forgotten, and yet, you say, 'how easily I learned them'. "The fundamental weakness of such a method is known to all. It is uneconomical and unorganized and indefinite in that it is left largely to chance and 'fate'. It is too acci - dental. As Charters has so well said in his recent book, 'The Teaching of Ideals', 'the accidental inclusion of materi - als in a program of instruction is always inefficient'. Leav - ing so much to 'chance' is hardly to be countenanced in any of our so called 'academic subjects', yet when it comes to character and morals, there has grown up the idea or notion that it is only through this procedure that we can hope to accomplish the desired end. "The other method, direct moral instruction and char - acter building, needs to be considered at this point. Doubt - less Charters in his book, 'The Teaching of Ideals' has correctly diagnosed the difficulty when he says, "The over - whelming opposition to direct moral instruction which exists among writers interested in the subject of character develop - ment is due, in part at least, to a misconception of the nature of direct instruction * * * A type of instruction which consists predominantly of the lecture method fills us with irritation and fear; but there is no reason why direct moral instruction should take this form. The lecture method has disappeared in every public-school subject. Why must it be retained in moral education alone?' "The direct method like the indirect, has its advan - tages as well as its weaknesses. Certainly it more than offsets the hap-hazard unorganized unsystematized and 'acci- </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 133 dental' nature of the indirect method for it does provide possibilities for properly organizing a program on the basis of certain 'traits' or 'modes of behavior' or 'standards of conduct'. Knowing these and providing a category in which they will or might be expected to appear, we can be more assured of their being properly treated in the various situa - tions that arise during the year. Various traits will then find opportunity of treatment in a more definite and cer - tain manner. The direct method also more certainly guaran - tees that there will be a large opportunity for practice in favorable situations. "The weakness of the direct method lies in the fact that we cannot avail ourselves many times of situations that are vital for the moment in implanting a character 'trait'. But there is no reason for our holding rigidly to the creation of any one untimely situation to teach any particular trait, There is no reason why many situations should not be 'seized upon' at opportune moments and utilized most ad - vantageously in our consideration of the traits that stand out for consideration from time to time. "There is a growing feeling among leading thinkers in education that we need to define 'direct moral instruc - tion' in such terms as will make it acceptable to the ma - jority of those who are now committed to a narrow program of indirect moral instruction. In so doing we can avoid the very consistent objections of those who hold the notion that direct moral instruction is a failure. "This department can see no reason for objection to Charter's definition, viz., 'By direct moral instruction we mean that form of instruction in morals which begins with a consideration of traits. This is in contradistinction to indirect moral instruction in which we begin with a consid - eration of situation.' "Accepting this definition there can be no serious minded person, interested in boys and girls and their training for upright citizenship, who would for one moment object to either or both of these methods being used in the further - ance of a 'State Program of Character Education'." Dr. A. G. Crane, president of the University of Wyoming, speak - ing before the recent meeting of the N. E. A. said: "Character is more than knowledge of the mechanics of government, now so evidently insufficient in the pre - vention of knavery in high places. Essentially, citizenship means harmonious and efficient teamwork in society. Good citizens are not only good senators but good neighbors. The sum total of a man's reactions, his character, his per - sonality, and his attitude toward public welfare, are all parts of his citizenship." In considering the question of technique and procedure in building citizenship, there is the necessity of recognizing that the task is essentially one of working with the individual through the </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT individual. That is to say, one of the surest and most effective ways — if not the surest and most effective way — of insuring upright citizenship is for the individual teacher to so live and conduct his own affairs and to so allow his own personality to play upon the individual students as to modify the latter's conduct and behavior as to make him a worthy member of society. In the days of mass education, when teachers were charged with instructing large num - bers of students in the classroom, it was very easy to forget the individual in our treatment of subject-matter. Our public schools have become large institutions, thoroughly systematized. Machinery has been set up that has made much of our administration and su - pervision a thing of mechanics. Our curricula and courses of study have been developed in the past along lines that have ignored the individual. More recently we find a decided trend away from the masses and back to the individual. The psychology of individual differences, scientific developments in education, the whole program of tests and measurements in education — all of these and many other fac - tors — clearly demonstrate and definitely exhibit and portray that individuals do "differ in ability, interests, habits, physical stature and strength, use of native tongue — in brief, in practically every con - ceivable trait. Attempts to isolate these various traits and specific abilities, interests and aptitudes in the past fifteen or twenty years have furnished us with great masses of information and have been the basis for almost revolutionary developments in the teaching processes." As has been repeatedly shown and emphasized, in every group of boys and girls, elementary and secondary, there are wide ranges of ability and accomplishment. Between groups there have been shown to be much overlapping of abilities and accomplishment. Finally in all groups pronounced evidences are shown of extremes of ability and accomplishment. All of this only goes to show the necessity of individual diag - nosis and treatment of individual cases. No longer does the scien - tifically trained teacher ignore her responsibility in suiting her assignments to the needs of the individual. No longer does this teacher ignore the needs of the individual in her conduct of the classroom procedure. The "recitation" has taken on a new meaning — a new significance. As Thayer in his recent book indicates, we have come to the "Passing of the Recitation." In the field of character education — in the development of per - sonality — in the building of citizenship, it is no less true. We must think in terms of the individual. The psychiatrist has a way of </seg>
            <seg id="p135">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 135 putting it that is quite "apropos". He has come, in his practice, to consider every conduct problem as an individual one. When there is brought to him a person for diagnosis and study, like the mathe - matician, he sets up an equation, x plus y equals z. In other words, the individual plus the environment equals the reaction. The psychiatrist diagnoses the individual in all detail. He studies every - thing about that individual that he is capable of studying, using such objective tests and measures as he can devise in order to get a complete picture. Then he studies the family life and family history. He gathers all the data concerning environment as a factor in development. He investigates all of the relationships of these two and tries to conclude why the individual does what he does. Knowing all of these 'facts he can more readily understand the reactions that occur. Finally, he attempts to suggest and set up those environmental conditions that play upon the individual in an effort to bring out the desirable traits of behavior and that will neutralize and make of non-effect all those undesirable traits that have been the handi - cap to individual growth and development in conformity to the standards of desirable citizenship. This same procedure, it seems, may be safely counted upon to do much for the teacher in the classroom. There can be no doubt but that the teacher meets individual problems in the main rather than group problems. Wherever the latter occur it is almost certain that some individual may be depended upon to be the "power behind the throne". It is to him that we must turn. It is to him that our attention must be directed. Through him we can more surely secure the desired information and explanations. Through him we must necessarily work to bring the desired results. No, there is no more effective way of dealing with many of our problems than dealing with the individual. Mass instruction and preachments, "moralizing", the teaching of "lessons in morals", alone, will not suffice. Be it said these are not synonymous with character training. They should not be so considered. Mere knowl - edge of right and wrong does not nor never has been insurance against misconduct and unbecoming citizenship. What we want is to develop in our boys and girls right habits, right attitudes, right ideals and right reactions. These are the "fruit of spirit". These are the dividends of the spiritualized teacher. These come as the con - comitants of personality effects. Permit us to crystallize all the above in an illustration drawn from experience. This is the true story of a lad in high school, </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT forced to work after school hours as a "delivery boy" and extra salesman for a dry goods firm in order to supply his own necessi - ties and contribute to the family larder. The father of this family was deceased. Like all fatherless boys, he was subject to many temptations. One cold winter day, when the snow was piled deep everywhere and still falling, this lad was noticed standing in the entryway to one of the old pool halls typical of pre-Volstead days. Doubtless he was wishing that he might go inside where all seemed to be fine and attractive. A mathematics instructor of the local high school chanced to pass by and noticed this youth, recognizing him as one of his students. At his first opportunity this instructor made it a point to visit with the young man. He learned of his life, his difficulties and hardships. He learned of his longings and ideals and aspirations, such as they were. Out of these first experiences there grew a lasting friendship between instructor and instructed. The former became the source of inspiration, the fountainhead from which the youth drank and from which he received his greatest help. This instructor was in - strumental in changing the whole point of view of this lad. He directed his activities into new channels. This lad prepared himself for teaching solely because of the urgencies of this one teacher. This young man, because of these influences, taught in the rural schools for a time, went on to college and became a public school superintendent. Later he completed graduate work in a state university, finally earning the highest degree conferred by a gradu - ate school, that of the "doctorate". The two chief sources of inspiration and the two persons re - sponsible for it all were the boy's "sainted mother" and revered teacher of mathematics. Such a story can be duplicated in the lives of many of us. Each one has had similar experiences where some instructor has come into his life and has allowed the force of his or her personality to be a determining factor no less positive than that of a parent in building, moulding and shaping an environment in which he could develop his own best self to the limit. And so it is, that we should become forces for good in society. So it is that our conduct, our ideals, our habits, our interests should be characterized by the very best. If the teacher in the classroom counts for 85 per cent of environment, then he or she must see to it that that influence is one hundred per cent good. It was a wise teacher who replied to the mother's anxious queries as to what her child should study, "It matters not so much what your child studies as with whom he studies." </seg>
            <seg id="p137">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 137 Thus and thus alone does the teacher become a spiritual power, the fruits of whose labor, the dividends of whose investment and the concomitants of whose activities are measured and evaluated in terms of the life successes of those whom he taught. The State Superintendent, Miss Samuelson, of Iowa, has well expressed the thought in these words: "The final unit in vital education is the teacher, She must not be too scientific to be motherly, nor too motherly to be scientific. She must not be too pedagogic to be social, nor too social to be pedagogic. She must have concrete fineness and possess a consuming love for all of God's children. Her tangible work goes upon the records of the school, her intangible work continues as an inspiration to higher achievements. Through the rich significance of these spiritualizing qualities, civilization moves forward through its children." To this challenge we cannot be blind. To this challenge we cannot be obdurate, obstinate and unyielding. We must recognize that after all what is implied in the law is within reason and right. It is a concrete evidence of the demands being made by the "lay - men in education" of the "professional men in education", viz., defin - ite, explicit, implicit and genuine concern for the ways and modes of life of individuals in the social group to the end that the con - duct of all individuals may make certain the advancement of society and that the benefits of that growing society may accrue to all individuals. We repeat wbjat we said at the beginning. We hold no brief for any particular method or methods for teaching "character". But we do hold that it is the duty of every teacher and every supervisor to recognize his or her responsibility in the state's program of character-building using every agency and every method in further - ance of that end in compliance with the law. To the continuance of this task the State Department has com - mitted itself for the future. Nothing shall be left undone that it is within our province and our ability to do. The continued support of all individuals and all organizations in the furtherance of this program is assured. We look to the future with high hopes and great expectancies. We cannot, we must not, fail. Conclusions This report cannot be concluded without making some reference to future plans. There is no one who should be more keenly sensi - tive to failures and shortcomings than those who are on the firing </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT line. Doubtless our nearness to the situation and its attendant problems makes us incapable sometimes of fully appreciating all of the difficulties. It is only as we consciously attempt to view our tasks from afar off and thus get a perspective of them that we can really see the "next steps". As a result we are able to sense what the impending changes are for which we must make adequate and timely preparation. Briefly, the following are suggested: I. SECONDARY SCHOOL STANDARDS The standards upon which we base our recommendations for the accreditment of secondary schools ought never to be static. Such items as student admissions, courses of study, curricula, gradua tion requirements, faculty personnel, teaching load, physical plant and equipment and many more must be made the subject of careful and continuous study. All accrediting agencies provide for commit - tees whose whole province is that of studying and revamping stand - ards to conform to ever changing conditions and demands. Effective September 1, 1928, the University authorities set up a new standard as to teaching personnel, viz., "The minimum aca - demic and professional preparation of at least fifty per cent of the high school teachers to be four years beyond a four-year high school course or 120 college hours". Heretofore the standard provided that two years of successful high school teaching experience might be accepted in lieu of each year of college training that a teacher was short. Four years of such teaching might be offered in lieu of a shortage of two years of college training. Effective September 1, 1929, an additional forward step is being contemplated. It seems that in the light of superior teacher-training advantages for secondary schools and in the light of the higher standards of the North Central Association and other accrediting agencies, all schools wishing to be fully accredited should be required to employ no one on the high school teaching force who has not completed a four-year college course or its equivalent — 120 college hours. Furthermore, conditions of student admissions to high school should be more specifically formulated. Library facilities should be very definitely prescribed. Before formulating such library stand - ards there should be very careful investigation made of the present status of high school libraries in Nebraska and elsewhere. The assignment of subject-matter courses to teachers should be more carefully considered. Too many teachers in Nebraska are now </seg>
            <seg id="p139">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 139 being assigned courses to be taught for which they have made no adequate preparation. No accredited school should be permitted to continue such a policy. II. EXTRA-CURRICULAR PROGRAM It is more and more apparent that the whole extra-curricular program of our secondary schools should be made the subject of careful scrutiny, to the end that steps might be taken for providing such forms of school and life activity as will afford to every boy and girl opportunity to engage in some form of energetic action, be it physical, mental, moral or social. There is a growing feeling among laymen as well as professional people that our extra-curricular program is too narrow and compre - hends in its program the few who are the leaders rather than the many who are apparently the followers, but who possess latent abilities and qualities of leadership that our programs as now or - ganized are failing to develop. Our program now is not compre - hensive. It is one-sided. III. NORMAL TRAINING Two phases of the normal training program that should re - ceive attention during the coining biennium are (a) a revised course of study and (b) a more effective policy relative to practice teaching in the rural schools. The "Reviews Courses" have been too largely just what the name implies. As a result students and, in many instances, teachers alike look upon these as opportunities merely to "cram" and pre - pare the students to take certain teachers' examinations. In suggesting revisions, it is not the purpose nor intent to minimize in the least the importance and necessity of a thorough grounding in subject-matter. But such a mastery of the subject - matter can be assured more definitely when it is bound up in every detail with that professional element, the proper manner of pre - senting the subject matter to the pupils, the normal training stu - dent is preparing herself to instruct. If subject-matter is to be virile — if it is to receive its due recognition and consequent careful study, — it must be bound up with those new elements and new ap - proaches that will command attention and occasion new activity. Methods to be effectively treated cannot be divorced from subject - matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The second phase of the normal training program that needs strengthening is that of practice teaching in the rural schools. The plans now being advocated call for one week of observation, graded participation and practice teaching in the rural school under super - vision of the normal training instructor, the county superintendent and the local rural-school teacher. Where this plan has been in operation it has met with unusual success. No serious criticism of the scheme has yet been heard from any source. Other plans for perfecting this important work are now being considered which, it is hoped, this division will be in a position to carry out in the near future. IV. CHARACTER EDUCATION In the light of the very apparent determination of the public to expect from the educational authorities that they give first emphasis to the problem of character building and citizenship train - ing this division should continue its study of the needs in the field and the present policies and practices now being followed every - where throughout the nation and world. Our present program should be modified as new discoveries and successfully tried plans are brought to our attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">CHLOE C. BALDRIDGE, Director Division of Rural Education The functions of the Director of Rural Education divide them - selves into two types of activity: first, improvement of instruction, and second, administrative supervision. The position of the Director of Rural Education was first added to the State Superintendent's office force in 1914. At the present time the work of this division is to give particular help to the county superintendents, school officers, and teachers in formulating and developing county-wide progressive school programs that will result in better supervision of rural schools, more efficient teaching, standard and superior rural schools and improved equipment, and greater cooperation of home and school for better schools. The opinion is growing among rural school officials and rural school specialists that the immediate hope for the improvement of schools in the open country is through professional supervision and the de - velopment of leadership in rural communities. Leadership is being developed and organized effort for better rural schools has been made by the school officers' organizations and by the Rural Parent- Teacher Associations. The efforts of this division are directed toward the following activities which may be grouped under Improvement of Instruction and Administrative Supervision: I. Better Supervision of Rural Schools by County Superin - tendents. II. More Efficient Teaching III. Elementary Course of Study. IV. Eighth Grade Examinations. V. Standard Rural School Buildings and Equipment. VI. Supervision and Inspection of Approved High Schools. VII. Greater Cooperation of Home and School. VIII. . School Officers' Conventions. IX. Additional Activities including Addresses and Corres - pondence. X. Preparation of the following publications: 1. Rural School Standards Bulletin. 2. Rural and Village High School Bulletin. 3. Program Discussion Material for Rural Parent-Teacher Associations. 4. Grammar Review Outline. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT I. Better Supervision of Rural Schools by County Superintendents. 1. Annual Conferences. Conferences of county superintendents were held at Lincoln on January 25-27, 1927, and January 31, Febru - ary 1 and 2, 1928, for the purpose of presenting the educational program of the State Superintendent's office to the county superin - tendents; of assisting them in organizing the routine work and the administrative duties of their offices; of presenting methods for improvement of instruction in the rural schools; of giving them an opportunity to exchange ideas and help in their clerical and ad - ministrative work; and for the purpose of enthusing them to be - come community as well as educational leaders in their counties. The themes of the conferences were "The Improvement of Schools Through Cooperation of School and Community", "Supervision and the Improvement of Teaching", and "Improvement of Teachers in Service". All agreed that the conferences were most valuable. Eighty-four of the ninety-three county superintendents were present in 1927 and eighty-five were present in 1928. The State Superintendent recommended that the county board of supervisors in each county pay the expenses of the county super - intendent of that county to the annual conference since the program was full of practical help and vital interest in the administration of rural schools. Many county boards followed this recommendation. Topics discussed were: (1) Examinations for Teachers and Eighth Grade Pupils. (2) Certification. (3) School Laws and Needed School Legislation. (4) Courses of Study. (5) Supervision of Schools by County Superintendents. (6) Standards for Better Schools. (7) Spelling Contests and School Exhibits. (8) Parent-Teacher Associations. (9) School Board Conventions. (10) Adult Education Program for Nebraska. (11) The Teachers' Institute. (12) Character Education. (13) Some Changes in Classroom Methods. (14) Rating of Teaching Skills. (15) Visitation Days. (16) County-wide Health Programs. (17) County Superintendents' Greatest Work. (18) Administrative Problems of the County Superintendent's Office. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 143 2. Group Meetings. Group meetings of county superintendents have also been held in the state. Administrative problems, improve - ment of instruction, and activities and methods in Parent-Teacher Association work have been discussed in these meetings. Six of the group meetings for county superintendents have been held at the State Teachers' Colleges. II. More Efficient Teaching. 1. Standards for Better Rural School Teaching. "As the teacher, so is the school." In order that teachers may be inspired to do more efficient teaching and to participate in community activities, Standards for Better Rural School Teaching have been established. The pur - pose of these standards is to help the teacher take a daily inventory of her or his work and make a daily introspective study of her or his own personality and technique. The Standards for Better Rural School Teaching have included requirements under the following head - ings: (1) Professional Spirit. (2) ProgTam and Classification. (3) Classroom Instruction. (4) Schoolroom Routine. (5) Supervision of Playground. (6) Housekeeping. (7) Community Activities. (8) The Teacher. (9) Pupils' Attitude. (10) Results. Near the close of the school year, teachers who had complied with these standards filled out a questionnaire. If all questions were answered in the affirmative and the questionnaire was confirmed by the county superintendent and two members of the school board of the district in which the teacher was teaching, the questionnaire was sent to the State Department. On receipt of this questionnaire a "Recognition of Better Rural School Teaching" was issued by the State Superintendent. (See Rural School Standards Bulletin, pages 50 to 60, inclusive.) Thirty-four teachers received "Recognition for Better Rural School Teaching" last year. 2. Addresses. Addresses have been given at county teachers' meetings, county institutes, district meetings, district state teachers' associations, and group conferences. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT III. Elementary Courses of Study. "Section 6324. General Management. The district school boards shall have the general care of the schools and shall have the power to cause pupils to be taught in such branches and classified in such grades or departments as may seem best adapted to a course of study which the school boards of any county shall establish with the consent and advice of the State Superintendent. • • • " Attention will be given at all times to make the Elementary Courses of Study the means of bringing about a thorough knowledge by all pupils of the fundamentals of education and to emphasize character building in the teaching of all subjects. The present Elementary Courses of Study have been in use in Nebraska since September, 1924. Many educators in the state have devoted much time and effort to this work. Since no curriculum can be final and continue to be a guide to teachers in training pupils in the skills, abilities, knowledge, habits, attitudes, ideals, and appre - ciations needed in life outside the school, the course of study should be considered tentative in nature and should be revised and supple - mented from time to time. To the 1924 edition has been added, this past year, a detailed and complete outline in grammar for eighth grade pupils, prepared by the Director of Rural Education. Com - mittees have recently been named who will recommend revisions, during this year, to the present courses of study in reading, arith - metic, civics, drawing, and health. The alternation plan that is in use in the rural schools has proved to be satisfactory. It enables the teachers to have fewer and longer recitations and to devote more time to directed study. This plan gives the teacher more time for the individual pupil. Difficulty has been found in the combination of fifth and sixth grades in arith - metic. This can be corrected in the revision of the course of study in arithmetic. Special attention will be given to the correction of "Section 6385. * * * Course of Study. * * * The course of study for the first eight grades in common schools shall be composed of the following subjects: agriculture, bookkeeping, civics, drawing, arithmetic, English composition, geography, grammar, history, mental arithmetic, orthography, penmanship, physiology, reading. The State Superintendent with these subjects for a foundation shall lay out a feasible course of study adapted to rural school conditions keeping in view the good cf a thorough education for the child in these branches rather than to the completion of the course in a given number of years. * * * " </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 145 any defects in the alternation plan. Although the alternation plan is the best plan to follow in the average rural school, it should he adapted to fit the needs of the individual child when that child does not fit into the alternation program. The completion of the courses of study and passing satisfactorily the final eighth grade examinations under the direction of the county superintendent entitle the pupils to the privileges of the free high school law in Nebraska. Vitalized Teaching The Elementary Courses of Study include activities for the pur - pose of motivating and vitalizing the school work. Courses of study include not only the essential facts, principles, and processes to be learned but should also include activities for the children while they are learning these things. The principle has been widely recognized that the child should have much opportunity for self-activity. He should study things rather than so much about things. This office wishes to promote vitalized teaching and the motivation of school work through the course of study. We believe in the doctrine that Comenius stressed more than three hundred years ago: "In the place of dead books, why should we not open the living book of nature? To instruct the young is not to beat into them by repetition a mass of words, phrases, sentences, and opinions gathered from authors; but it is to open their understanding through things. We must offer the pupils not the shadow of things but the things themselves which impress the sense and the imagination. Instruction should commence with a real observation of things and not with a verbal description of them." The school work should relate the child to his environment and materials in such a way that he will work with a will, with an en - thusiasm, and a well-defined purpose. According to old methods definitions and principles were taught and then were applied. At the present time the children discover by the guidance of the teacher rules and definitions and principles for themselves. 4-H Club work as directed by the University Extension Service may be correlated with the subjects of the school. Where the 4-H Club work has been given a fair trial, pupils, parents, and teachers have been benefited. Pupils have been benefited financially. They have been taught thrift, industry, business methods, the dignity of labor, and a real interest in home life. This kind of education fits them for lives of usefulness and success.

IV. Eighth Grade Examinations. 1. Free High School Education. "Section 6385. High school grade defined — course of study — rules of admission. — Provision is hereby made for four years of free public high school education for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in public school districts which maintain less than a four-year high school course of study, on the following conditions, to-wit: "First — For the purposes of this article all grades above the eighth grade in any public school district of this state shall be deemed high school grades. The course of study for the first eight grades in common schools shall be composed of the following subjects: agri - culture, bookkeeping, civics, drawing, arithmetic, English composition, geography, grammar, history, mental arithmetic, orthography, pen - manship, physiology, reading. The State Superintendent with these subjects for a foundation shall lay out a feasible course of study adapted to rural school conditions keeping in view the good of a thorough education for the child in these branches rather than to the completion of the course in a given number of years. Every pupil after taking this course of study may by applying to the county superintendent take examination in these subjects, such examination to be held at a time and place designated by the county superin - tendent and held by him or his assistant, and at no time shall be held by a teacher any of whose pupils are taking the examination. The questions used in such examination shall be furnished by the State Superintendent and be the same in all counties each year. The county superintendent at the close of such examination shall after ascertaining that the name of the pupil is not written on any exam - ination paper, record each set of papers by name and also by num - ber, after which such papers shall be turned over to the Examining Board who shall consider the papers by number only. Said Board to be appointed by the county superintendent and shall consist of at least five competent examiners with qualifications at least equal to those required for a second grade county certificate. Each member of said Examining Board shall give careful consideration to the grading of each paper, expense of such grading to be paid out of the general fund of the county, and if pupils shall have passed with an average of seventy-five per cent in the subjects named in this chapter, no subject less than sixty per cent, the county superintendent shall </seg>
            <seg id="p147">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 147 issue a certificate stating the pupil is entitled to free high school tuition, providing the ninth grade is not being taught in the district where pupil's parents or guardians reside. The course of study for the high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction." In compliance with the law the eighth grade examinations have been prepared by the division of rural education and sent out to the county superintendents. They have been held by county superin - tendents on specified dates in January, April, and May. The January examination is a "Special" examination in a few subjects designed to enable pupils to do better work by taking a few of the minor examinations in January so that they may devote more time to the remaining major subjects. The purpose of the final eighth grade examinations is to determine the eligibility of pupils to receive free high school instruction in approved high schools. All eighth grade pupils, public, private, and church, town, city, or rural, regardless of the school they are attend - ing, must pass these examinations in order to be entitled to the priv - ileges under the free high school law. The questions are based upon the Elementary Courses of Study. A great deal of effort has been put forth to make these examinations a fair and reasonable test of the pupil's ability to carry on high school work. V. Standard Rural School Buildings and Equipment. Satisfactory physical environment is considered very important to the school life and progress of children, and has led to definite stand - ards in buildings, toilets, grounds, and working equipment. All prog - ress in education ought to be approached through the people and every effort is being made on the part of the State Department of Public Instruction and the county superintendents to develop within our rural people a public sentiment and consciousness for better schools. Education, to be most effective, must begin in childhood. Theodore Roosevelt expressed this thought when he said, "If you would do any - thing for the average man you must begin before he is a man. The hope of success lies in working with the boy and not with the man." Poor schools are due largely to neglect and lack of personal in - terest and support. Boys and girls are entitled to good instruction in a clean, sanitary, well-lighted, well-ventilated schoolhouse with proper seating and heating, surrounded by attractive and well-kept school </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT grounds. The improvement of rural schools through better buildings, better equipment, better teaching, and definite community cooperation is being realized through standardization. Standards For Standard Rural Schools The purpose of standardizing rural schools is to secure the best one-teacher schools possible by establishing definite standards which will be conducive to greater care in providing educational advantages for rural children. A sixty-four page bulletin on Standards for Rural Schools was prepared by the Director of Rural Education in 1927. Fifteen thousand copies of this bulletin were printed. Fourteen thousand two hundred seventy-five copies of this edition have been distributed. This bulletin contains the minimum requirements for standardization, the official score card for standard and superior rural schools, a general explana - tion of the Nebraska Rural School Standards, floor plans suitable for one and two-teacher rural schools, the law regarding our flag and flag pole, flag code, playground equipment, hot lunch equipment, library books for pupils, and music helps and records. The schoolhouse plans give special information relative to size of classroom, heating, lighting, seating, blackboard space, basement, and additional rooms for coats, books, and supplies. Minimum Requirements of Standard Schools 1. The school term must be at least nine months in length 2. The teacher must have one year of experience or the equivalent in training. 3. School grounds must be adequate, well-drained, and kept clean. One or more acres of ground is recommended. 4. There shall be a good well on the grounds or nearby and sanitary methods for the use of water must be provided. 5. The school must provide single desks of suitable size adjusted to the needs of the children, and the room must contain at least fifteen square feet of floor space to each child. 6. The schoolroom must be lighted from the left or the left and rear with the window area equivalent to one-fifth of the floor space. 7. The heating must be of some approved type and the room must contain 200 cubic feet of air space for each child. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 149 8. The school must be equipped with teacher's desk and chair, dic - tionary, globe, maps, blackboards, and up-to-date textbooks. 9. Sanitary methods of cleaning must be employed, 10. Outbuildings must be placed as far apart as possible, and kept clean and free from marks. In front of each there should be a board shield screening the entrance. When a school reaches the minimum requirements, the teacher or school officers should score the school and request the county superin - tendent or State Department to inspect and score the school. If a school justifies a score of 75%, it will be classed as a standard school and a Standard Plate will be sent by the State Department to the county superintendent for the school. If a school justifies a score of 95% and meets the minimum requirements for a superior school, it will be classed as a superior school and a Superior Plate will be sent by the State Department to the county superintendent for the school. (See Rural School Standards Bulletin.) Organized efforts are directed toward standard rural schools in our state. There are now five hundred eighty-five standard rural schools in Nebraska — a gain of two hundred four standard rural schools in the biennium. Many states are giving special state aid to districts which have standard schools. Legislation is needed whereby the plans of a new rural schoolhouse must be approved by a school architect, working under the direction of the State Superintendent. Funds should be available for the preparation and distribution of blue prints and specifications for up-to-date standard schools. Standardization Day Standardization Day was observed by the rural schools in the state during American Education Week. Patrons were urged to visit their respective schools for the purpose of hearing their pupils in their everyday recitations. Regular school work was posted for inspection by visitors. The program of school work was followed by a discussion on Standardization, the scoring of the school according to Rural School Standards, and a talk by a school officer or patron on "What Our School Needs in Order to Become a Standard School". Standardization Day will be an annual event and stands as a milestone in the educa - tional progress of the rural schools in this state — a day of scoring the educational facilities and of setting goals for further educational progress. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Standards For Superior Rural Schools In addition to the requirements for a standard school, a superior school must have the following: 1. At least one acre of school yard, neatly fenced, covered with a good sod and planted with trees, shrubs, and flowers; concrete or cinder walks to the entrance and to outbuildings. 2. A well equipped with a sanitary drinking fountain within doors. 3. Besides the schoolroom, there should be a basement, work and play room, cloak room, and a library room. 4. The library shall contain at least eighty juvenile books, ten suitable for each grade, a standard school encyclopedia, suitable diction - aries, and a supply of the bulletins published by the United States Government and the University of Nebraska, useful in the school and in the community. 5. There must be in operation a Parent-Teacher Association which secures the hearty cooperation of the parents with the school. 6. When the teacher, under whose administration the school is recog - nized as "Superior", ceases to teach school, it must be reinspected to remain so recognized. The teacher should meet the requirements of the "Standards for Better Rural School Teaching". The teacher shall hold not less than a First Grade Elementary Certificate. The school must score 95%. 7. In conclusion, before a school can be recognized as "Superior", it must be taught in a schoolhouse in every respect suitable to the best work; it must be equipped with everything necessary; it must be taught by a teacher of superior qualifications and skill; the course of study must be well covered by the pupils; the people of the district must cooperate to make the school "Superior" in every respect. The work of the teacher, the pupils, and the patrons, is of first importance.

Upon receipt of said certificate, the said county board shall levy on all taxable property in the said county a sufficient tax to pay said high school tuition as certified by the county superintendent: Provided, said board shall exclude from said levy all the actual valuation on all of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved four year high school, shall exclude from said levy three - fourths of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any dis - trict in which is maintained an approved three year high school, shall exclude from said levy one-half of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved two year high school, and shall exclude from said levy one-fourth of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is main - tained an approved one year high school. * * ♦ * " 2. Purpose of Approval. Many of the smaller schools are un - able to meet the standards set for accreditment to the University of Nebraska, not being able to maintain more than 9, 10, or 11 grades of work. In justice to the children who live in such districts, this department requires such standards as may reasonably be met and which may bring about greater educational progress. Schools com - plying with these standards may collect tuition from the other dis - tricts for non-resident pupils. They are also exempt from the pay - ment of high school tax. 3. Approval of High Schools. Approval of high schools under the authority of Section 6386 of the School Laws is a function of the State Department of Public Instruction and is fundamentally for the purpose of providing high school privileges to boys and girls. Cer - tain problems of approval, however, present themselves, namely, the proposition of exemption from the county wide high school tax on the one hand and authority for the collection of free high school tuition from non-resident pupils on the other. Quality of academic work, qualifications of teachers, equipment, ability to support such a program, and other matters naturally enter into such a proposition. 4. General Plan. Applications for approval of all high schools for the collection of free high school tuition will not be made until </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT immediately after the beginning of school in September, on or be - fore the close of the third week of school, when the high school in its various grades is actually set up and in operation. All schools that are applying for approval, either in part or in whole, should make application very soon after the beginning of school. Final approval of schools will not be given until June 1, by the State Department of Public Instruction, at which time county super - intendents will be notified of the approved schools in their respective counties. In other words, a school or added grades must be set up and in actual cperation before it receives the consideration of this office for approval. Exemption from the high school tax levy or any part of the high school tax levy will depend upon the approval of the school as reported by the State Superintendent for the year just past. This seems to be the most logical course of procedure under the laws as they exist in the statute books at the present time. Schools that desire to be approved must submit reports called for by the State Department of Public Instruction; teachers must meet the re - quirements of the State Department; the requirements as given in the 1927 Rural and Village High School Bulletin must be complied with. Acceptance of credits of pupils from an approved high school is dependent upon the judgment of the school authorities to which such pupil applies for admission. This department strongly urges all high schools in the state to admit pupils from approved high schools subject to evidence of their ability to continue their school work in a satisfactory manner in the new school. Such admittance does not presuppose that pupils from an approved school shall be subjected to an entrance examination. We believe the attitude of all schools should be to encourage young people in their quest for an education. 5. Classes of High Schools. For the purposes of approval, public high schools are divided into two classes: (1) Accredited High Schools and Minor Accredited High Schools (Report of the Division of Secondary Education). (2) Approved High Schools — In addition to those accredited to the University there are a number of smaller schools offering one, two, three, or four years of high school work. The schools that meet the standards required by the State Superintendent are approved as one year, two year, three year, or four year high schools, depending upon the number of high school grades taught, and are eligible to collect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. The approved high schools have been classified into "Approved High Schools, First Rank" and "Approved High Schools, Second Rank". </seg>
            <seg id="p161">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 161 6. Of General Interest. The general conditions which the ap - proved high schools must meet are outlined in the 1927 Rural and Village High School Bulletin and relate especially to courses of study and daily programs, certification and number of teachers, library and reference facilities, laboratory equipment and supplies, sufficient class and recitation rooms, and general sanitary conditions. No high school tuition may be paid by district, county, or state funds to any sectarian or denominational school. "No sectarian in - struction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by the public funds set apart for educational pur - poses." — Article VII, Section 11, Constitution of Nebraska. 7. Bulletin on Rural and Village High Schools. A bulletin on Rural and Village High Schools has been prepared by the Director of Rural Education and distributed by the State Superintendent. This bulletin includes the provisions of the free high school tuition law; the high school approval requirements; distinction between approved and accredited high schools; suggested two year and four year high school programs; lists of laboratory equipment in agricul - ture, domestic science, general science, manual training, and physics; outlines in English including general reading lists; and detailed outlines of the courses in the ninth and tenth grade subjects. Three thousand copies of this bulletin were printed. Two thousand seven hundred and fifty copies have been distributed. This bulletin is followed carefully by the teachers as a manual. 8. Conferences with Teachers of Approved High Schools and Circular and Personal Letters Sent to Teachers of Approved High Schools. Conferences with teachers of approved high schools have been held in fourteen counties during the past three months. Cir - cular letters relating to a better study drive for the purpose of inculcating in the pupils better study habits, standardized tests in mathematics, English helps, and a school demonstration day for approved high schools in the spring of 1929 have been sent out. Personal letters have been sent in response to the detailed reports that are required from each school. Certification reports including the qualifications of each teacher in the approved high schools are required. 9. Inspection of Approved High Schools. During the school year 1926-27, there were 339 approved high schools. During the school year 1927-28, there were 329 approved rural and village high schools. Twenty-nine of the twelfth grade approved high schools have met the requirements of the minor accredited schools during </seg>

VIII. Greater Cooperation of Home and School. Why is the State Department of Public Instruction actively par - ticipating in Parent-Teacher Association work? Rural education pre - sents one of the greatest problems in American education. Leader - ship and cooperation are needed in the rural districts in order to solve the great problems of rural education. The rural children are entitled to just as good educational opportunities as the boys and girls in towns and cities enjoy. However, advancement in education must come from local leadership. The school cannot be made greater than the community. The progress of the school will depend upon the progress of the community. </seg>
            <seg id="p169">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 169 In order to develop leadership, this division is stressing the organization of Parent-Teacher Associations. Parent-Teacher Asso - ciations promote the finest kind of cooperation and a better under - standing between parents and teachers of the problems of the child. The Association aims to bring into closer relationship the home and the school in order that the teacher may cooperate more intelligently in the training of the child and to develop in the school and general public such united efforts as will secure for every child the highest advantages in physical, mental, moral, and spiritual education. No improvement in school conditions is possible until a strong public opinion approves and demands it and no group can so suc - cessfully influence public opinion and school officers as an enthusiastic and interested group of patrons. Patrons cannot be enthusiastic and interested in school improvements unless they know school conditions, and there is no way to acquaint parents with school conditions and arouse their interest in improvements like a Parent-Teacher group which meets regularly to consider such matters. This department, with the assistance of patrons and teachers, is working for better educational advantages for our Nebraska boys and girls and for a real community spirit. At the request of the state officers of the Nebraska Congress of Parents and Teachers and through their continued efforts, the Na - tional Congress of Parents and Teachers agreed to conduct a rural demonstration of Parent-Teacher Association work in Nebraska, in conjunction with the State Department of Public Instruction. 1. Plan of the Work. Late in November, 1926, Mrs. C. E. Roe, Field Secretary of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, presented this plan of work to this office. The National Congress pro - posed to spend $2,000.00 a year for the organization of Rural Parent- Teacher Associations and the promotion of the work by National Field Organizers. This opportunity was welcomed in order that the coopera - tion of all patrons for better schools and better advantages in physical, mental, moral, and spiritual education might be secured. 2. Report of the Organization Work in Nebraska; forty-seven county superintendents participating: Number of Parent-Teacher Associations organized in the Demon - stration, to April 21, 1928, 201; to May 24, 1928, 224. Number of Parent-Teacher Associations affiliated with the State and National Congress, to April 21, 1928, 161. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Number of members in the 161 Parent-Teacher Associations affili - ated with the State and National Congress, to April, 1928, 5,090. 3. Work of the National Organizers: This division has scheduled the Field Workers of the National Congress, Mrs. Randlett spent 5 weeks in Nebraska and organized 21 asso ciations. Mrs. Golden spent 7 weeks in Nebraska and organized 35 associa - tions. Miss Minnie Nielson spent 12 weeks in Nebraska and organized 93 associations. Associations organized by county superintendents as follow-up work, by Director of Rural Education and Rural Demonstration in Nebraska, and other Parent-Teacher leaders, to April, 1928, 64; and up to November 23, 1928 (dues not checked up since April, 1928), 113. 4. Achievements : (a) The following topics were discussed in Parent-Teacher meet - ings: Character Building, Children's Reading, Cooperation, Character Education, Health, Importance of Play, Standards for Rural Schools, Safety and Accident Prevention, Better Films, Good Roads, Art Appre - ciation, Arbor Day, Nebraska History, Thrift Education, and Music Appreciation. (b) The following counties have organized 10% of their dis - tricts in Parent-Teacher work: Antelope, Banner, Boone, Butler, Cass, Cedar, Chase, Clay, Custer, Franklin, Gage, Harlan, Holt, Keith, Kearney, Lancaster, Merrick, Nance, Nemaha, Pawnee, Sheridan, Scotts Bluff, and York. (c) Some of the results obtained through Parent-Teacher work: Cooperation, Health Work, Hot Lunches in Schools, Medical Inspection, Summer Round-Ups, Additional School Equipment including pianos and victrolas, Improved Buildings, Playground Equipment, More Standard Schools, Traveling Libraries, Community Sunday School, and aiding Chautauqua. 5. Program Discussion Material for Parent-Teacher Associations: This bulletin, prepared by Miss Baldridge, was issued by the office for the purpose of providing basic material for constructive dis - cussion by the patrons, to give assistance to the Parent-Teacher Asso- </seg>

Plans for organizing Parent-Teacher Associations and suggestions for maintain - ing interest are included in the bulletin. Discussion material on the following topics is presented, includ - ing an introduction, suggested topics for discussion, and suggested questions and answers that may be handed out for informal discussion: Art Appreciation Better Films Health Importance of Play Music Appreciation Character Building Children's Reading Good Citizenship Good Roads Standards for Rural Schools Thrift Education Safety and Accident Prevention Six thousand copies of this bulletin have been printed and dis - tributed. Requests and favorable comments have been received from forty states. 6. Recreation Institute — This division cooperated with the Uni - versity Extension Service, the county superintendent and county agent of Lancaster County, the Recreation Department of the Nebraska Con - gress of Parents and Teachers, and the recreation specialists in Lin - coln in organizing the first Recreation Institutes that were held in Nebraska on May 31st and June 1st, and October 25th, 26th, and 27th, under the direct leadership of Mr. J. R. Batchelor, the District Repre - sentative of the Playground and Recreation Association of America, and Mr. Earl Johnson, Director of Recreation of Lincoln and of Physi - cal Education in the Lincoln Schools. VIII. School Officers' Conventions. A County School Board Association is one of the very best agencies for arousing interest in and securing better rural schools. Since the improvement of a school is so dependent on the school board and community, this department is interested in the organization of School Officers' Associations in order that school officers may be - come better informed as to the needs of the school, educational progress and policies, school equipment, plans for modern school buildings, and financing of schools. Members of this department have addressed School Board Asso - ciations in many counties. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT IX. Additional Activities. In addition to inspection of approved high schools, the field work of the Director of Rural Education is varied. During the biennium she has delivered the following addresses: 57 addresses at teachers' institutes and associations in 27 counties; 6 addresses to School Officers' Associations; 8 addresses to district teachers' associations in Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska; 9 addresses at county superintendents' conferences; 1 address at the National Education Association at Minneapolis; 8 dedication addresses of eight school buildings in four counties; addresses at 2 eighth grade promotion exercises; 2 commence - ment addresses; 6 other educational addresses; 6 addresses given to Mothers' Vacation Camps and organized agriculture meetings; 4 stan - dardization addresses at community meetings; 27 addresses at Parent- Teacher Association meetings, county council, and organization meetings; 2 addresses to city councils of Parent-Teacher Associations; 2 addresses at district conventions of Parent-Teacher Associations; 2 addresses at state conventions; 3 radio talks; total, 145. This does not include conferences with teachers of approved high schools and talks to students. In addition to the field work, an average of 360 personal letters have been sent out by this division each month, making a total of 8,640 personal letters for the biennium; 260 circular letters have been sent out each month, making a total of 6,240 circular letters for the biennium.

            <seg id="p177">S. R. ELSON, Director Division of Adult Immigrant Education In 1923 representatives of about forty civic, patriotic, and social groups formed a new Americanization organization designated as the Omaha Council of Americanization. The aim of the organization was to coordinate and allegate various agencies at work in Omaha along the line of Americanization. S. R. Elson was made executive secre - tary in charge of the active work of this body in the city of Omaha. The mayor of Omaha has been the president of the Americanization Council from its inception with a group of leading citizens making up the governing board of the council. When the Nebraska Legislature of 1927 passed House Roll No. 179 the State Superintendent of Public Instruction appointed Mr. Elson to head up the work on a state-wide scale in harmony with the amended state legislation. It is well to include here a copy of the law as it was passed by the legislature. House Roll No. 179. INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVES LEO MISKOVSKY OF DOUGLAS AND VICTOR M. HOVIS OF DAWSON AN ACT relating to education; providing for adult immigrant educa - tional activities under the direction of the state superintendent of public instruction. Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Nebraska Section 1. Educational Division — Adult Aliens. — There is hereby established the adult immigrant educational division of the depart - ment of public instruction for the education of adult aliens and others under the direction of a state supervisor appointed by the state su - perintendent of public instruction. Section 2. Powers of Local School Boards — Courses of Study. — Under this act local school boards and school authorities are empowered to expend moneys for conducting schools and classes in school build - ings, in industrial establishments, places of employment and other places as may be expedient, for the purpose of giving instruction to foreign born and native adults and minors over the age of sixteen </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT (16) years. Such courses of instruction or study shall include English, history, civics, and other subjects tending to promote good citizenship and to increase vocational efficiency. Section 3. Duties of State Superintendent. — The state superin - tendent of public instruction shall designate courses of study, approve the selection of teachers, and supervise the instruction in said courses. Section 4. Disbursement of Funds. — The state superintendent of public instruction is hereby authorized to disburse from funds appro - priated for his department sufficient money for supervision, instruc - tion, and other necessary expense in conducting the adult immigrant educational division of his department. Approved April 1, 1927. In a press dispatch from Washington, D. C, September 8, 1923, was the following statement: "Nebraska needs an intensive Americanization campaign to make citizens out of the more than half of the alien population of 45,723 who have not yet taken the first step toward naturaliza - tion. — Federal officers say Nebraska, because of its large percent - age of unnaturalized aliens, has before it one of the biggest tasks of Americanization of any of the states." Excerpts from an Editorial from the Omaha Bee-News, Dec. 27, 1927 "EDUCATION FOR THE ADULTS" "One of the significant developments of social advance is the movement to increase the educational training of grownup men and women. That is, the members of society who have passed school age, and yet feel the desire for broader and deeper mental culture. * « • "This is a proof that the greater leisure afforded by the shorter work day is not being dissipated in ephemeral pursuits. Knowledge is sought, for now if ever, 'Knowledge is power.' Nebraska has swung into line in this work commendably, the last Legislature having passed an amendment to the school laws which provides for adult instruction. S. R. Elson explained in an article in the Omaha. Bee- News, how far the work already has moved in the state, and the inspiring help he has received from school authorities and others interested, in putting the law into effect in spirit as well as in letter. "To the adult among the foreign-born it is a particular boon. It has for them the opening of a great opportunity, enabling them to be - come early acquainted with the language of their new home. • » ♦ "To the native adult the boon is equally great. It enables him to follow on where he left off in the grade school, and fits him better </seg>
            <seg id="p179">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 179 for the gTeat work of life. Perpetual enjoyment of the liberty that rests on the principles that underlie our system of government de - pends on enlightenment. * * * 'That is what education tends to bring about' 1 The establishing of the Division of Adult Immigrant Educa - tion in the State Department of Public Instruction with the appoint - ment, by the State Superintendent, of a director of this division, marks a new era in the school system of Nebraska. This law which authorizes boards of education to use school funds for the maintenance of adult schools and classes opens up a wide field heretofore prac - tically untouched in the educational work of the state. While this law, in its present form, which appears in full in this report, does not make the appropriation of school funds by school boards com - pulsory, as is the case in some states, yet it implies the obligation where it is shown that the work is needed. Since the new educational law has been in effect public opinion, as far as it has come to our notice, is hearty in commendation of the legislation creating this division as a part of the school system of the State of Nebraska. In nearly every community, where the matter has been presented and properly understood, superintendents and boards of education have manifested willingness to cooperate and to make financial provisions to carry on the work wherever feasible. The fact that the program is official gives it sanction which it could not otherwise have. The appeal to school administrators for support for this work has met with a fair degree of sympathy and the disposition to make provision in school budgets for night schools. The official responsibility of the State Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion for an aggressive campaign in this work throughout the state and his interest and official leadership in promoting the activities of this division have been a most important factor in the progress so far made. Immigration From the last fiscal report of the Bureau of Immigration we find that 538,001 aliens were admitted to the United States leaving a net increase after deducting the number of departures of 53,508. Of this total number admitted 335,175 were immigrants who came here for permanent residence, the remaining number of over 200,000 were temporary visitors for one cause or another. Of this total number ■of newcomers nearly 100,000 came from Canada and over 60,000 from </seg>
            <seg id="p180">180 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Mexico while Europe sent us 168,368 immigrant aliens, quota and non-quota, Germany gave us 48,513, the Irish Free State 28,054 and Great Britain 23,669. The report further shows that less than one-sixth of the im - migrants during the fiscal year of 1927 were children under sixteen years of age. The male immigrants averaged considerably more than females in number. . It further notes the fact that a wholesome situation has developed under the new quota law, namely, that the newcomers are spreading more evenly throughout the country rather than con - centrating in the congested eastern centers of population as in the past, with a marked drift to the central west and states beyond the Rocky Mountains. The report shows that the total immigration from Mexico to the United States during the year 1927 of all newcomers for permanent residence in this country was 80,639. Deducting the departures it left a net addition of the Mexican race to our alien population in the United States for that year of 69,685. Most of this immigration settled in the middle west, creating a special phase of immigrant educational work for these states, Nebraska having her quota. The present Mexican population in the United States is conservatively figured at over a million. While many of these people are illiterate and from the lower social strata they are here to stay and are re - sponsive in disposition and ability to learn the English language and American customs and ideas. The responsibility we owe to them and to our government in fitting them for American life and citizenship is obvious. Immigrant Bootlegging Since the restrictive legislation limiting immigration to this country there has been developed a new business, the bootlegging of aliens which has proved a lucrative and attractive field and has grown to be an industry second only in importance to the bootlegging of liquors, the two not infrequently going hand in hand and many thousands of immigrants, especially from our southern borderline, have thus surreptitiously gained entrance to the United States. The reports show that during the fiscal year 12,000 of such aliens were apprehended by patrol officers. The government made an appropria - tion for the year 1927 of $1,500,000 for maintenance of this border - line patrol. The border patrol is made up of young men, mostly ex - service men, religiously conscientious of the responsibility reposed in them, and faithful in the discharge of their duty. With all their vigilance many thousands surreptitiously enter this country. </seg>
            <seg id="p181">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 181 Many Cultured Immigrants It should be noted that many immigrants to the United States today, as in the past, are well educated and have shown great facility in mastery of the language and customs of America, having risen to high places in many walks of life. But it is nevertheless a fact that the high per cent of illiteracy in this country is, in the main, related to, and inseparable from, the unrestricted immigration to the United States from nearly every nation in the world. It has been generally accepted as a fact that we have in this country about five million illiterates. That means inability to read or write in any language. We need figures that will show the illiteracy in English. What Is Illiteracy? The federal census has been the standard used in determining illiteracy. The army tests determined on a basis of 4th grade stand - ard show these figures have been found to be entirely too low, that the illiteracy of the United States cannot be less than 25%. In other words, one-fourth or more of our population, (twenty-five to thirty million) are unable to function in English, or to intelligently par - ticipate in civic duties and public affairs, read English intelligently or write letters. Many voters are absolutely unable to read a ballot. In the last presidential election in a certain district in Omaha numerous ballots were thrown out because the voter was incapable of marking the ballot properly. Many ballots had been marked to indicate that the voter was voting both Republican and Democratic tickets straight, and there were many other marks on these ballots. Bond issues, street railway franchise, special ballots to be marked "yes" or "no" were .'ound to be marKed both "yes" and "no". This is typical, doubtless, .f manv «&lt;-&gt;&gt;er districts throughout the state. Literacy Test for New Voters Over twenty states have passed laws or have made provisions for a literacy test for all new voters; obviously Nebraska needs such legislation. WHILE IT IS DESIRABLE TO ENCOURAGE ALL ALIENS TO BECOME NATURALIZED CITIZENS, YET WITHOUT ADEQUATE SCHOOLING FITTING THEM FOR INTELLIGENT CITIZENSHIP, this is an unwise and dangerous procedure. With our adult educational law backed up by legislation for a literacy test for all </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT new voters, native and foreign-born, the results in adult education will be materially increased, since the aim in naturalization is mainly to be able to vote. Such a law should not be retroactive. We have no statistics showing the true facts on the functioning English literacy status in Nebraska. This important data we are en - deavoring to obtain through a special questionnaire in the school cen - sus blank, which should have the hearty cooperation of every school superintendent in the state. We have only made a start but reliable information already obtained by this division has revealed not only the fact that many voters cannot read a ballot — but that we have in our state, a few public school directors who can neither read nor write; their signature to official and legal papers is an X (My Mark). The average school board member is an individual of good intellectual at - tainment and a leader in the community. Superintendents who fail to see the importance -of securing this information sought by the Department of Public Instruction would be placing themselves in a delicate position. Suggestions as to the wisest and simplest form for this questionnaire will be welcomed, but the object, the getting of accurate and complete literacy statistics of Ne - braska's population, must be realized. On the basis of revelations in many other states where exhaustive surveys have been made and pub - lished, we expect the discovery of very many thousands of illiterates in our state — a highly commendable public service by the Department of Public Instruction to the commonwealth. Powerful organizations of the state supporting this department such as the American Legion, The Nebraska Federation of Women's Clubs, the Bar Association, and the Legislature expect just this kind of service, though it may uncover blemishes excrescenses in the body politic. Only thus can the remedy be applied. The aim is to give this group instruction in the English language and training for citizenship, resulting in an intelligent conception of our government, loyalty to the country, greater efficiency and competence — an asset to their community, the state and nation. Nebraska is for - tunate in being one of the states which has made this phase of educa - tion an integral part of the state program of public instruction. With a united effort of all school districts and with the support of public sentiment, the literacy inefficiency in our state will approach the irre - ducible. The Work to Be Done The first duty of this division, therefore, is to perfect a system of adult education by which the English language is taught, the assimila - tion and naturalization of our alien population given first considera- </seg>
            <seg id="p183">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 183 tion. Those of native birth beyond the compulsory school age, who have had only limited educational advantages, are likewise to be given their opportunity. Other Phases of Adult Education The broader field as recognized, ultimately to come under the Division of Adult Education, is that of civics, history, government, inter - national relations, and cognate subjects, technical and cultural rather than vocational. Education for adults out of school, but who desire learning for its own sake, provided by the state for old and young is indispensable for the highest form of civilization, human happiness and progress. By federal legislation and large appropriations vocational educa - tion has assumed prominence in this country. It has to do with the mechanics of life, the tools and skill in their use in the chosen vocation, the inspiration being enhanced compensation. In a wider sense and with a broader outlook, the movement of adult education in this country as well as in Europe is making a universal appeal to men and women as citizens or prospective citizens, as parents and members of the com - munity desiring a fuller realization of the meaning of life, over a. beyond vocational needs, vital as they are. At a recent meeting of the American Association for Adult Educa - tion the topic of one of the papers given was the "Menace of Leisure", emphasizing the fact that as the leisure class grows the danger to the state increases and that the safeguard against this menace in our gen - eration of larger earnings and shorter hours, is in universal adult edu - cation. In that paper it was pointed out that the greatest nations in past history were doomed to fall as the leisure class grew in numbers and dominance. It has been said that a government will be as good and as wise as the men and women in it; that, unless we want to be governed by the uneducatea, we must educate the governors in our democratic iorm of government. Newton D. Baker, former Secretary of War, in discussing the im - portance of adult education at the same meeting made the following statement: "The minute we stop being educated we cease to be edu - cated. A man may have the most complete education this year, and graduate from the highest and best qualified university in the world after a magnificent devotion of splendid talents to the securing of an education, but at the end of ten years, if he hasn't added anything to it, he might just as well not have started, except as to the discipline he has gotten. The progress </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT of knowledge will have gone so fast and so far that the educa - tion which he got, and which was good at the time, ceases to be an adequate education for the duties which he now confronts. So continuity of education seems to me indispensable to educa - tion at all. The minute we cease to be educated we become un - educated in these modern times." Home Classes The passage of the Cable Act providing for the independent natural - ization of women has emphasized the need of a system of education particularly for foreign mothers, many of them without a usable knowl - edge of the English language. The foreign mother is isolated by her home duties and remains tied by European traditions. She must either teach foreign and un-American ideals to her children or lose much of her influence over them when they become subject to American en - vironments. No phase of adult education will result in such far reach - ing benefits to the community as organized teaching in the homes of non-English speaking women. This is considered by many leading teachers to be the most important feature of adult immigrant educa - tion. A foreign mother reached and educated in Americanism is the multiple of many. She is a veritable Americanization missionary. Thorough schooling in the English language and rudiments of our institution of government and customs should be provided for the adult alien residents in each community. The immediate results for good cannot be measured. It will be felt in the daily lives of the immigrant, by the citizens with whom the immigrant comes in con - tact, by the community where they both live, by the state, and thus extended throughout the nation. State-Wide Organization Forty counties have been visited personally by the director of this division, involving over ten thousand miles of travel. Numerous towns in many of these counties, from the extreme north to the ex treme south of the state and from the eastern border to the western state line, have been visited where schools and classes have been or - ganized or tentative plans have been made for establishing such schools and classes. By way of illustration without design or invidious discrimination a few districts with outstanding records of new work are cited. At CRETE, where the first new organization was effected, a class of twenty-five to thirty was enrolled. As an evidence of the public interest and success of the work in Crete a naturalization mass meet- </seg>
            <seg id="p185">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 185 ing was held on the night of October 2, 1928, in the high school audi - torium with a splendid patriotic program and an attendance of several hundred. SCOTTSBLUFF had one hundred students under four teachers last school year. This year the board of education made a budget of $500 to cover the expense of instruction. This division employs a super - visor in that territory. At GILEAD, Mrs. Dora Schainost had done splendid work prior to her appointment by the State Department, and this field is sure to show large gains during the next biennium. Two young men drive thirty - eight miles round trip to attend her classes. At NORTH PLATTE, a department supervisor, under the direction of the city superintendent has had three classes well in hand under regular school teachers. Other work is being organized in Lincoln County. WEST POINT has a well organized class taught by the city superintendent, who has been cooperating with the county superintend - ent, and members of this class of twenty-five or more traveled thirty miles every week to attend night school. This territory should have many centers organized. At FREMONT, with the generous appropriation by the Board of Education of $500 for instruction, the city superintendent and county superintendent have joined forces for an aggressive campaign in Fre - mont and Dodge County. HARTINGTON has organized work under the city and county superintendents, which is to be expanded in Cedar County. KEARNEY got the work well started last school year, and is func - tioning with promised expansion this year. At HASTINGS, the city superintendent has an organizer from the Junior High School working up a roster from a large list of eligibles revealed by the supplementary questionnaire in the school census blank. WAHOO made the same discovery through the census questionnaire and has taken steps to reach this element of their population through the night school. This work will be extended in Saunders County. WILBER, MILLIGAN, GENEVA, GREENWOOD, ASHLAND, GRETNA, all have expressed through their boards of education and superintendents a desire to open schools for adults as soon as the neces - sary assistance can be furnished. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The CITY OF LINCOLN has long carried on most creditable work under their public schools generously supported by the board of edu - cation. In the CITY HALL at Omaha, where this state office is provided free of expense by the City Council, special classes are held at any hour between 9:00 and 5:00 o'clock by a special teacher connected with the division. These classes are for candidates for naturalization who have failed in their court examination and continued for further study, and others who need special help for any cause. It is in the plans to have such arrangements in every county seat, with a trained teacher available that all candidates may prepare them - selves to meet the court requirements and any literacy tests the state law may prescribe. Many other places through personal visitation or correspondence have appealed for help and guidance in effecting organization. KIM - BALL, SIDNEY, and OGALLALA have expressed deep interest in get - ting the work started. In LANCASTER COUNTY a coordinator has been employed in this district for several months, mostly in small communities around Lincoln. Surprising conditions have been revealed showing the need of this special type of Americanizing education within a radius of a few miles of this University-Capitol City. Boards of education in the places visited in the state have generally manifested a disposition to give their moral and financial support, recognizing adult immigrant education as an important phase of ele - mentary education, and the Department of Public Instruction as the proper auspices under which it should be conducted. Of necessity the new work cannot be inaugurated very fast with our appropriation of less than $10,000 a year, and consequently no large staff of workers can yet be employed. Our policy has been to move conservatively and lay a solid foundation in as many central points as possible, judiciously distributed over the state. In all cases we aim to function through and with the local school authorities, city and county. Legionnaires are on many of these boards of education. The American Legion, with other civic and patriotic bodies, has great influence in forming public opin - ion and can do much in recruiting, making surveys, holding meetings and creating a general sentiment supporting and popularizing adult education. United cooperation of all civic and patriotic bodies with the public schools is the only practical way this work can be done. They have generally responded. Hundreds of towns in the state should be doing similar work. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 187 This does not mean, however, that we do not meet with indiffer - ence and are confronted with lethargy and even prejudice in commun - ities and settlements, or that this work is given a recognition compar - able to that occupied by the education of children. But like all pro - gressive movements it will require time and persistent and strenuous effort to overcome these prejudices and to educate the public to the realization that money spent for education of any degree in any com - munity is the biggest investment that can be made. In the beginning of this work much time had to be given to making plans and selecting teachers and enlisting the cooperation of school officials. All of the work naturally divides itself into two branches — that of developing and improving the method, and that of expanding the field. Under the division of improving the method, the first necessity recog - nized was that of efficient teachers and training. To this end a teacher training course was established in the summer school of the University of Nebraska, conducted by the director, during the past summer for twelve weeks. This course represented two terms. There was a regis - tration of twenty during the entire course who completed the work, passed the final examinations and received the regular university credit. Since then arrangements have been made to continue this teacher train - ing in the University with two hour courses weekly. The course is scheduled to begin the first Saturday in December. Automatically, this work must result in better teachers with technical knowledge of this highly specialized educational field, which will conduce to the realization of an expanded zone of operation. While we have had hearty cooperation of the extension division of the University under the direction of Professor A. A. Reed, we antici - pate even a closer relationship and cooperation in the future. It is to be hoped that we may be able to establish not only more extensive teacher training courses in the University and perhaps in the State Teachers Colleges, but also regular institutes in different localities. With the proper training of teachers and the adequate means for their main - tenance, and the maintenance of an efficient staff of workers, we can reasonably hope for outstanding and constructive results in expanding the field. It should be recognized that this work calls for a type of teacher peculiar in itself. The successful teacher in addition to technical knowl - edge must be actuated by a keen interest in the cause rather than for the remuneration it brings, and be willing to give of his energy and time freely, ready to work over-time and to join in any movement that may develop new and better methods. Probably the greatest need in this work we are confronted with is this affiliated relationship of teach - ers. Probably one of the best alliances to be made would be between </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT the teachers of this division and the Parent-Teacher Associations. This would bring the teacher of the adult department into direct con - tact with many of the very people we are seeking to reach and doubtless would also result in bringing many parents who need it most into the Parent-Teacher Association. Teachers Go To School Incidents of striking human interest are of frequent experience, some inspiring, some pathetic or tragic, but all most interesting to the student of human life. Under the following head is given the experience of one of our teachers in her own words. JUST ONE FAMILY "In looking over the foreign situation in a shoptown one day, I found the Mexican family, M . This family consisted of the father, mother, five little daughters and the grandmother. "The father had been to school but two days in all his life and that was when a boy long ago in Mexico. In response to my inquiry whether they would not like to learn to read English, they readily assented but the father assured me he was very stupid. "Quirina, the old grandmother, was sixty-four years of age; she could not speak one word of English; it was difficult to make her understand and I was almost discouraged with her the first day but when I returned for the next lesson, the mother and father had taught her what they had learned. She had copied carefully the written alpha - bet I had left, and never since have I returned to give a lesson that I have not found that she has made careful preparation. "After six lessons a daily paper was subscribed for and they scan it carefully and read the easy pieces of news which they are proud to be able to recount to me. Mr. M said to me one day, 'I wish you would come Sunday morning and stay all day, I just love to read.' "I always find the home in a neat condition, the mother and grand - mother usually busy with some fancy work, the children well-dressed and happy and a splendid home atmosphere prevails. They are proud of their little garden, just a part of a lot, but from that little garden </seg>
            <seg id="p189">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 189 they added over sixty dollars to their income last year. They raise a few chickens for sale and with the salary of eighty-four dollars per month they have a scant sufficiency to develop a family that any nation might be proud of. "If one could have seen this family on the last lesson day it surely would have been an illuminating object lesson. Mr. M had recited his lesson and was studying carefully the words he had mis - pronounced. He said, 'I must get them while you are here or I'll say them wrong when you are gone.' Mrs. M was reciting and old Quirina, the grandmother, was studying diligently and even Juana sat close by with a book for she had caught the vision and had learned to read four pages which she was eager for me to hear. "America and Nebraska have given them the opportunity to be numbered among the intelligent ones of the earth." (By Mrs. C. Wolfenbarger.) To the foreigner, trying to learn the language of his adopted country, and to become adjusted to the social and political ways of his new neighbors, is a serious business. Some students gladly drive miles to attend the night classes. Others beyond middle life show re - markable aptitude in acquiring a new language. A notable instance daring the last year was the case of a woman sixty years of age who learned to read and write English in three months, illiterate in Eng - lish before entering the adult school. To witness her pride and new interest in life was ample demonstration of what adult education may do for many, even those advanced in years. In hundreds, even thousands of families with children in the day schools, a transformation may be wrought, a new atmosphere created in the home and a congenial domestic happiness created through the parents' attendance at afternoon and night school, learning the lan - guage, the customs and facts about American life. A Bulletin for Teachers A bulletin has been published by the division and widely dis - tributed, entitled "Adult Immigrant Education", containing general information on adult education, and how the work is being conducted in the state, with methods of teaching and model lessons in three grades. All the teachers are supplied with this booklet, which will be supplemented with a yet more complete FEDERAL GOVERN - MENT bulletin. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Cooperation With Other Organizations One of the important factors recognized in the activities of this division is the proper cooperation with voluntary organizations, social, civic and patriotic, enlisting the talent and influence of the community in carrying on this work. The very fact that town organi - zations interest themselves, as organizations, in the foreign element in their community, creating ways and offering inducements for their advancement in learning the English language, the customs and tradi - tions of the country and social relationships, has a powerful influence in effecting a result called Americanization. The Federal Naturalization Examiner and the district courts of the state are working in closest harmony with the State Department, accepting credentials of our schools as evidence of fitness for American citizenship from candidates for naturalization. The American Legion, which sponsored and worked for this legis - lation to the limit of its ability, has been to the front on every occa - sion when called upon. State Commanders and Post Commanders and various state officials and others have never failed to render every aid possible. The Nebraska Federated Women's Clubs in conformity with the policy cf the General Federation has officially tendered its undivided support to this division in carrying out its state-wide policies. This great organization of fifteen thousand women, added to the eighteen thousand Legionnaires, makes an immense background which with numerous other civic and patriotic organizations is an aggrega - tion of irresistible forces. The American Legion Auxiliary, the Women's Overseas League, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Women's Relief Corps are all contributing to the cause of Adult Immigrant Education, working in harmony with the State Department, as is the Y. M. C. A. and the Council of Jewish Women. Out of all these affiliations, with an established standardized organization officially administered under state authority, there should come the vision and broad conception of what the Adult Educational movement really means; a vision of what will comprehend not only aliens and illiterates, but the whole people as wards of the state and the </seg>
            <seg id="p191">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 191 nation, furnishing a process of education inspiring men and women to become life-long students in the democracy of which they are the rulers. The time is not far distant when the public school will be radically changed, when it will not be merely for children, but will include in its curricula educational opportunities for all who may not have had such opportunity or who desire to keep abreast with the progress of this marvelous age of advanced thought. Dr. Thorndike's new book "Adult Learning", Dorothy Canfield's (Fisher) "Why Stop Learning", The National Education Association, The American Asso - ciation for Adult Education, the organized adult movements in many European nations, all unequivocally evidence the fact that education must be life-long and is never done. This nation is awakening to this responsibility. The State of Nebraska has honored herself in this new educational law. Every com - munity which cooperates with it will share in that honor. In concluding this presentation attention is called to the fact that Nebraska's need for this type of education far exceeds the general belief. While the federal census shows the state to have a low per - centage of illiteracy, yet, if the figures were based upon a usable knowledge of the English language the per cent would be much higher. In this country the knowledge of English must be the standard of intelligent and efficient citizenship. How many adults in Nebraska cannot read an English newspaper or write an intelligent letter? How many voters cannot read a ballot? The answer would be sur - prising if not alarming. In some sections of our state no English whatever is spoken in the home and teachers find it difficult to function in the day schools because the children hear and use no English outside of the school - room. This is one of the problems confronted by rural teachers. The only solution is to reach the parents, especially the mothers. It is an obligation resting upon the state which this division must assume. The needs are two-fold: An efficient staff of workers. An adequate appropriation for its maintenance. The realization of the SECOND is a guarantee of the FIRST. The groundwork is laid ready for the completion of the structure. </seg>

            <seg id="p201">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 201 A SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1928 I. Agricultural Education (a) Evening Agricultural Classes Many vocational agriculture departments continued the extension of their service in the respective communities by offering systematic instruction in agriculture for the adult farmers. There was an increase in the number of courses over the previous year, with requests from many more groups than could be accommodated. This showed a grow- ing interest in that type of work. There is a tendency for the regular all-day teacher to both or- ganize and instruct the evening school groups. More schools are being held in the isolated rural communities. This gives unusual opportunity to those persons who have previously been deprived of systematic instruction in agriculture. Systematic instruction was given in such subjects as Beef, Crops and Soils, Dairying, Feeding, Farm Management, Farm Accounts, Swine, Farm Machinery, Motors, Potatoes, Poultry and Wheat. The amount of State and Federal aid is based upon the number of different classes maintained.

Five new departments were added to the list of approved schools for the year 1927-1928. There was the greatest enrollment per school in the his- tory of the work. Both of these facts indicate an interest in agricul- ture and that boys are planning to become farmers. The recent vocational survey in the state showed that in many schools there were twenty-five to thirty-five boys who had definitely chosen farming as an occupation, yet those schools were offering only a semester course in agriculture to prepare those students for their vocation. Most of those boys will not continue their education beyond the high school. When and where, the high school.

TRADE AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION (a) Evening Trade and Industrial Classes With the inevitable shift of the balance of population toward cities, trade and industrial pursuits are becoming more important in Nebraska. To prepare ambitious men and women in these fields for lives of greater service and promotion the public schools are offering evening classes giving specific trade extension instruction — that is, in - struction directly related to their daily callings. These classes are sometimes conducted in schools, shops or industrial plants with prac - tical men and women as instructors. They are offering instruction to persons over sixteen years of age now obliged to be self-supporting and entitled to such schooling. Financial aid is based upon the number and length of courses offered. Courses were offered in such subjects as: Sugar Technology, Nurses' Chemistry, Nurses' Dietetics, Nurses' Anatomy and Physiology, Nurses' Psychology, Nurses' Bacteriology, Nurses' Drugs and Solu - tions, Locomotive Operation, Blue Print Reading, Telegraphy, Ox Welding, Machine Shop, Electric Welding, General Car Work, General Boiler Work, Machinist's Mathematics, Valve Motion, Boilermaker's Layout, Railway Shop Electricity, Foremanship, Baker's Course, Plan Reading, Custodial Management, Telephone Shop Drafting, Plumbing, Telephone Accounting, I.

These classes enroll young men between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one who for various reasons have dropped out of the regular full-time classes, and have entered upon employment as apprentices. These apprentices are returned to school for four hours per week, with pay, to receive instruction which is supplemental to their employment.

(c) Part-time General Continuation Schools Under the laws of Nebraska, the board of education in any school district having fifteen or more children between the ages of four- teen and sixteen who hold employment permits which are in force must establish part-time classes giving instruction to such permit holders for eight hours per week. When part-time classes are estab- lished permit holders are required to attend, while the classes are open upon a voluntary basis for all others between 14 and 16. At the present time, Omaha is the only city having a large enough number of employed boys and girls to warrant organizing a separate part-time school. The schedule of instruction in the part-time school is not fixed, as the pupils enrolled are of varying ages and scholastic attainment. They are employed in a variety of jobs and their experiences are those of workers rather than children. Consequently, to make the school best serve their need, it is organized on an opportunity school basis to give the pupil the things he needs and can profit by most. Courses were offered in such subjects as: English, Mathematics, Civics, Drawing, Shop, Home Economics, Hygiene and Retail Selling.

            <seg id="p207">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 207 (d) All-Day Trade Schools The purpose of the day unit trade school is to fit the student for advantageous entrance upon a trade or industrial pursuit and to give occupational practice and technical instruction in related subjects which will best fit the individual for profitable employment in wage-earning occupations common to the community. The aim is both to prepare for advantageous entrance upon an occupation and to assist the potential expert worker to become a thinker having a larger vision of his field of labor. It is not the purpose of the day unit trade school to prepare students to go directly from the class room as full-fledged expert workers. Courses were offered in Carpentry, Auto Mechanics, Printing and Electricity. Federal and 112 boys were enrolled in these classes. III. HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION (a) Evening Classes in Home Making Evening classes in homemaking is an administrative term which distinguishes the adult work from that offered in the day schools. The majority of the classes meet in the afternoon. Many of them meet in the mornings. Only a few meet at night. The ever increasing problems of planning and managing which present themselves to the homemakers of today make them eager for help in these two phases of their work. The classes are organized to give units of instruction from six to ten lessons in any phase of home - making where a sufficient number of students desire work and an in - structor can be secured. Classes in home management, child care, nutrition and parent education are discussion classes. Cooking, supper classes, sewing, dressmaking, home decoration and home care of the sick, though they are termed laboratory classes, must depend on home Schools State Aid 'alls City $1,237.50 Castings 1,137.00 jncoln 4,500.01 Total $6374.51 </seg>

(b) Part-Time Home Economics Schools Part-time schools for rural girls are proving themselves of value in giving homemaking training to the girls who must remain at home to help with farm and house work. Hooper offered the work for the second year and found girls and their parents as interested as they had been the preceding year. One additional center was established this year. Schools which are equipped to teach home economics can offer part-time work to girls in their own district and to tuition students at a small expense. A special teacher is employed to conduct the work.

They are planned to give girls training in the homemaking responsibilities they should be carrying at present, and to lay a founda- tion for a continued development in homemaking. Each year's work includes units in social and family relationships; food preparation on the meal basis; clothing selection, construction and care; child care and development and management. Home projects are a part of each year's work. In addition to units in home economics, the course includes in- struction in science related to home problems, art applied to the cloth- ing, and house furnishing and decorating problems and physiology.

IV. VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION OF PERSONS DISABLED IN INDUSTRY OR OTHERWISE In H. R. No. 232, the Nebraska Legislature accepted the provisions of a new Act of Congress for retraining men and women disabled by accident, injury or disease, in industry, on farms, or otherwise and restoring their capacity to earn a livelihood. Aim To help people help themselves. To assist disabled persons to be- come readjusted to another occupation in which they may be self-sup- porting and self-respecting citizens rather than recipients of public or private charity. What Actually May Be Done A machinist loses his right arm as the result of an accident. The arm was essential in his work. He was trained for no other occupa- tion. During the months his compensation funds support him, he can, under this new law, be trained for some vocation in which the right arm is not essential. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT One whose health has been undermined by indoor employment in factory, shop, store, schoolroom or office, may be re-educated for some suitable out-door occupation. One, who by reason of accident or illness, is unable to do farm or out-door work of a heavy nature, may be trained for some light outdoor vocation or for office or clerical work. Who May Be Beneficiaries 1. Those so physically disabled in employment of any kind that they can no longer do that kind of work. 2. Those who are capable of being rendered fit to engage in some other occupation. 3. In each case the feasibility or retraining both from the physical and vocational standpoints must be determined. Where Retrained In public and private institutions, industrial plants, shops, offices, or anywhere the student may be trained efficiently in the most advan - tageous way and in the shortest possible time. Administration The administration of the law is entirely in the hands of the State Board for Vocational Education. Use of Funds Funds will be used for tuition, necessary incidental fees regularly charged by a school, books and supplies. Nothing for maintenance of student, for buildings, equipment, etc. Existing schooling facilities will be utilized. Department of Labor The State Board for Vocational Education and the State Department of Labor have formulated a plan of cooperation in the administration of the provisions of the Act in so far as they relate to persons affected by the State workman's compensation and liability laws. Acceptance of training by persons injured in industry does not affect in any way, nor deprive such persons of any rights under the Workman's Compensation Act. </seg>

LETTON State Librarian NELLIE WILLIAMS, Secretary MARGUERITE NESBIT Reference Librarian EDNA BOOTH Clerk for Traveling Libraries THE COMMISSION The Library Commission consists of a board of five members, four ex-officio and one appointed by the Governor for a term of five years. The board acts in an advisory capacity, the secretary and her staff carrying on the work of the Commission. The present staff consists of the secretary, Nellie Williams, who is also the librarian for state institutions, the reference librarian, Marguerite Nesbit, and the clerk for traveling libraries, Edna Booth. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT AIM The aim of a library commission is to promote library extension, to encourage the founding of libraries where none exist and to aid in their intelligent and economical administration. ACTIVITIES The work of the Nebraska Public Library Commission is organized under three general divisions: Field activities, a system of traveling libraries" and reference loans, and the building and supervision of libraries in the state institutions under the Board of Control. FIELD WORK In degree of importance the Library Commission has always given first place to the establishment and furtherance of libraries. It has been its aim to visit each library during a biennium. With the increas - ing number of these libraries, and the growth of the work along all lines, it has been impossible to cover the state in a two-year period. We are glad at this time to report the goal in sight. The increased number of visits made during the last biennium is due to the addition in hours of service. The following is a record of visits made since the last report of the Commission, the greater number having been made since July, 1927, when the increased appropriation became available. Visits in answer to call 29 Other visits 84 TOTAL... .113 The visits in answer to call have been to libraries about to organ - ize or in need of cataloging. Of the twenty-nine visits, fifteen were made in the interest of organization, eleven to give assistance in cata - loging, three relative to building plans. Visits of the Commission are made without expense to the library receiving help. LOANS Though aid in organizing and in improving existing libraries seems to us the most important phase of the Commission's activity, of neces - sity the greater part of its time is given to the daily requests for books. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 219 The requests from groups and individuals for the biennium num - ber 10,795. The loans number 118,517. The following is a classified arrangement of the requests and loans from December 1, 1926 to November 30, 1928. Borrowers Requests Volumes Groups of residents 312 22,065 Public libraries 660 17,232 School and College libraries 874 48,627 Study clubs 1,177 4,884 Other organizations 34 2,898 Individuals 7,738 22,811 TOTAL 10,795 118,517 The method of loans is explained in the following letter of in - formation: Books are sent out by the Nebraska Public Library Com - mission according to two general plans. There are traveling libraries which are loaned for three months with the privilege of extending the time. Usually a general group contains adult fiction and children's books in about equal numbers but a group consisting of only adult books or only children's books will be sent if desired. To any general traveling library non-fiction along special lines will be added on request. The number of books loaned is determined, in part, by the size of the commun - ity to which they are sent. Groups of books for special study are sent to individuals and clubs, the number of books and the time limit depending on the special needs of the case. The time is usually a month, however. In either case the only necessary procedure is to write and ask us to send them. In all loans there is no expense to the borrower except the transportation charges. Traveling libraries are sent by freight; special loans by parcel post. We have no printed lists of our books but depend on our patrons to tell us what they want and we meet their wishes as far as our resources will allow. A traveling library wilt be. sent on receipt of the enclosed application card properly filled out and SIGNED BY AT LEAST THREE TAXPAYERS. We are greatly assisted in our selec - tion of books if in the space for remarks, we are told the num - ber of pupils and grades of a school, if the library is for the school, and something of the reading tastes of the community, if the library is for general reading. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TRAVELING LIBRARIES Our traveling libraries are loaned to groups of residents, to pub - lic libraries, to schools and to other organizations. The schools lead in the number of requests. During the biennium 87 counties have received traveling libraries. Custer county takes first place, 54 libraries having been sent to 10 stations. Lancaster follows with 51 libraries sent to 14 stations. Next in order are Gage 37, Thayer 36, Saunders 29, Cedar and York 24, Valley 23, Merrick and Butler 22, Burt and Saline 21, Hitchcock 20. Many of our borrowers express themselves as grateful for the books received. When they say that they are pleased with the selec - tion, thanks are due to Miss Booth for her careful choosing. A few of these appreciative patrons wish to testify. I think first place goes to one from Pleasant Dale on whose card was written, "100% satis - faction". Others speak as follows: "Very well pleased. Fine books. Look for another box soon." "I am a booster for the traveling library." From a sod house in western Nebraska where we sent a collection of particularly lovely books for children, came this letter: "I am writ - ing to say that we wish to renew the library which we have. We have enjoyed it very much and we should like to keep it so that the children can get more benefit out of it. They will have more time when school is out. I keep the library at my house and people either come and get the books or we exchange them at our club which meets every two weeks." A regular borrower and staunch friend writes: "The enclosed letters are the result of a suggestion of mine to ask for a library. I am sending them all to please the little third and fourth graders who wrote them." The children speak thus: "Please, Madam, I wish you would send us some books. I would like to have a book of bears. The books are so well to read in." — Edgar. "I liked the library very much last year. I liked many books. I would always miss the books. Will you send a few circus books, negro books and other kinds of books?" — Lorin. "Will you please send a few books so that we do not waste time during the day. Please send an airplane book." — Clarence. </seg>
            <seg id="p221">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 221 REFERENCE Reference loans have been sent into every county in the state dur ing the biennium just ended. As in any reference department great variety attends the requests which are a considerable part of the daily mail. It is gratifying to note the increasing use of books for courses of study. The Reading with a Purpose courses supply the desire of many. We feel that we are thus adding our bit to the great work of Adult Education as fostered by the American Library Association through its board. We are also happy to send books to people who are as greatly in need of recreational reading as others are desirous of serious study. Many letters pay tribute to the selection and promptness in filling requests. We quote from one letter: "We will stop using your good services and will leave soon for New York to board the U. S. Liner Republic. Part of the enjoyment of this trip will be due to you and your good help." From a superintendent of schools comes this: "I received that book of Durant's. It is excellent. I just literally revel in it. It is a real thought provoker. Thanks very much for sending it. P. S. Oh, yes, I also received those articles on Child Labor." In its issue of March 5, 1927, the Nebraska Farmer made known the Library Commission's loan service to the state through its Home Circle department under the caption, "Study at Home". We quote from the article as written following an interview on the Reading with a Purpose courses: "Have you regretted not being able to study literature, psychology or art? If so, you will be interested to know that you can go to school at home and study along these and many other lines. Courses are offered in this home school on widely different subjects. Who is going to teach your school and who will buy your books? The American Library Association, which has organized these courses, will be your teacher. A short introduction has been prepared and a short list of books on each subject is recommended. Your own Public Library Commission at Lincoln will furnish the books free ex-, t-ept for transportation." Then follows a list of the courses with an - notations. This advertising brought immediate returns. We are quot - ing from a few of the requests. "We desire to enter your study at home courses on 'Our Children'. We are wondering if you have anything to offer on Agiiculture, Poul - try or Dairying." </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "I am returning the booklets which I enjoyed immensely. With the notes I have taken I can study for months to come. Will send for other short courses when I run out of fresh material for my mind." "I regret very much having been unable to study literature but the public schools did not include it in their courses in Virginia twenty years ago when I went to school. I am just bubbling over with joy at this opportunity. Kindly send me books for history and literature courses." INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES The human element enters largely into the work of the Library Commission for those who constitute our shut-in citizens. We feel a peculiar interest in the readers in the hospitals, homes, and schools, in the penal and correctional institutions. The majority of those who are physically able to read, or have the time for it, make good use of the books which are provided for them. The circulation for the eleven institutions reporting is 95,286. This is an increase of 27,261 over the preceding biennium. The greatest in - crease is at the penitentiary. The circulation there for the past two years is 54,151, which is an increase of 24,011 over the two years pre - ceding. This is not a padded report, nor is the number of prisoners much greater. The men are reading more. This is largely due to the reprinting of the catalog at which time many new books were added. We are quoting from a letter received recently from one of the "boys": "Upon entering my cell sixteen months ago I was delighted to see a library index upon my table and upon perusing it I was more than glad to knpw that I could study even though in prison. I have secured many technical books in drafting and architecture." The boys from the Reformatory also have a word to say "In my short period that I have been here I have read many of the library books and I appreciate them for they help me to pass my time and makes it much easier to do right." "I have been benefited by the privileges given me through the librarian and my choice of book friends. I do sincerely believe that the library here is one of the greatest helps in reforming one's self. I have found that good literature is the foundation of clean living. From one who has been greatly helped through the institution library." </seg>
            <seg id="p223">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 223 We are letting a boy from the Industrial School speak for many there: "It is with great pleasure I take this opportunity to tell the Ne - braska Public Library Commission of my sincere appreciation of the work they are doing. I am sure that I voice the sentiment of almost two hundred other inmates of this Institution when I say the library provided free for us here is one of the greatest factors for promoting contentment among us. The books, both fiction and non-fiction, are of the highest possible standard and of a kind that tend to improve one's mind as well as afford great pleasure in reading." The eighth and ninth grade girls at the Geneva Training School have expressed their pleasure in the library in themes written for their English classes. "My teacher gets some books from our library and brings them over to our schoolroom and that way we can use them to help us with our studies." "The first book I read, I just had to force myself to read it. Now I cannot read enough. I have found a great pleasure in reading." "By reading good books I have become acquainted with people which any one would like to know personally; but after reading about them I can count them as my friends." The children from the School for the Deaf say: "I like many kinds of stories to read. They help me with my language. I wish to thank you very much for your kindness." "I enjoyed reading 'Little Women' and stories like it. In doing so I improve my language and get pleasure at the same time. Thanks for sending us nice books." "I surely am interested in reading the new books. They will make us use our brains and will help us improve our language." NEEDS For several years we have registered the need for additional service to the state by the Library Commission Comparing the tenth biennial period with the fourteenth, the requests filled and the volumes we loaned are as follows: This is an increase of 167% in requests in ten years. Over the same period there has been an increase of 102% in loans. This has been ;iennial Perio Request Loam 1918-1920 4,020 10,795 58,644 118,51' 1926-1928 </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT accomplished by a staff augmented by the half time of one person and a slight increase in hourly assistance. We have stressed the need of a sufficient staff to visit all libraries of the state each two years. As previously referred to in this report, the increased appropriation of the last Legislature was cf material help in meeting the requests for special aid and in systematically visiting the libraries. We have kept faith by using as advantageously as possible the fund available. There remains much to be done. Visits of longer dura - tion for definite assistance are needed. We have therefore submitted in our legislative estimates, a request for a salary fund that will be commensurate with these needs. Extra travel requires extra main - tenance. Request has been made for an increase in the maintenance fund. There has been no increase in the book fund in ten years. It was cut one-third during one two-year period. If the requests for books are at all adequately met, more money must be provided. At midwinter last year, there were forty-five requests for traveling libraries which could not be filled within a reasonable period of time. The patience of both borrower and staff is unduly taxed by such a condition. Our esti - mate accordingly includes a request for a substantial increase in the book fund. </seg>
