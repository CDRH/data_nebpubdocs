            <seg id="p187">155 DEPARTMENT OF BANKING STATEMENTS Showing the Condition of the 80 Building and Loan Associat ons in the State of Nebraska at the close of business, June 29, 1935 </seg>
            <seg id="p188">DEPARTMENT OF BANKING The accompanying graph has been prepared to illustrate certain ■facts relative to the Building and Loan Associations in this State. The graph covers the period from June 1905 to June 1935, in order to show the rapid growth of the building and loan business in the state prior to the beginning of the depression in 1929, and the rapid liquida - tion since 1929. : ■ . ' ■• • ' ■,■'.■ ■ i ■' "' ■■•'■.' ASSETS Line "D" shows the total assets of the associations which increased from $8,000,000.00 in 1905 to $163,000,000.00 in 1929, or at an average rate of over $6,000,000.00 per year. A steady, normal growth had been made during the early history of the associations up to the year 1910. The rate of growth after 1910 shows an increase up to 1922, and a very rapid increase from 1922 to 1926, the growth during the latter four-year period being at the rate of $16,000,000100 per year. The growth continued during the next three - year period at a somewhat lesser rate, and in 1929 the peak of $163, - 000,000.00 was reached. Then came the market crash and following it a period of rapid liquidation and as a result of this rapid liquidation the total assets of the associations have decreased in 6 years from the peak of $163,000, - 000.00 to the present total of $85,000,000.00. Had the normal rate of growth up to the year 1910 been main - tained the total assets of the associations would have reached $90,000, - 000.00 in 1935, as shown by line "G", which is very near the present level. REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LOANS Line "E" shows the total real estate mortgage loans of the associ - ations, and it will be noted that this line parallels the line of total assets during the period of normal growth, which indicates that the funds of the building and loan associations were being safely and profit - ably employed, as practically no foreclosures or repossessed real estate appear. However with the very rapid increase in funds seeking in - vestment in building and loan associations line "E" begins to fall far - ther below line "D" with a corresponding increase in foreclosures, re - possessed real estate and real estate sold on contract, indicating that the saturation point for safe home loans had been reached and loans of a more or less speculative nature were being made, which loans were not proving to be satisfactory investments. Following the market crash in 1929 many borrowers were unable to continue their payments on loans, foreclosures continued and a marked increase in the amount of repossessed real estate is shown. Practically no new funds were seeking investment and the loanable funds of the associations were soon depleted due to the fact that many investors, unable to realize on other investments, were requesting re - tirement of their shares in the building and loan associations. Even 'though the associations were permitted under the statutes to use 50% of their available cash funds for loans, they used but a small portion of these funds for loans and the balance was used to meet the demands of investing shareholders who were requesting retirement of their shares. This rapid liquidation has continued up to the present time. Many distressed borrowers have refinanced their loans with the Home </seg>
            <seg id="p189">DEPARTMENT OiF BANKING Owners' Loan Corpt ration and from the proceeds of the bonds received in exchange for thiir mortgage loans many of the associations have been able to meet 1 11 requests for the retirement of shares. As a re - sult of the continued liquidation of loans we find the total outstanding mortgage loans bac c to approximately the 1918 level. RESERVE FOR CONTINGENCIES Line "F" shown the ratio of reserves to total assets, exclusive of cash on hand. The degree of safety of the funds entrusted to a build - ing and loan association can be measured by the reserve strength of the association. Must authorities have considered a 5% reserve fund sufficient for a bui ding and loan association and the past history of building and loan i ssociations shows that actual losses sustained have been much less than 5% . In 1905 the ratio of reserves to total assets, exclusive of cash, of the associations in Nebraska was 2.2%, and in 1929 the ratio was 3.2%. Under the jrovisions of the statutes of this state the associ - ations are required to set aside to the reserve fund each year at least 5% of the net earnings of the association, until the reserve fund has been built up to at least 5% of the total assets of the association, ex - clusive of cash, an&lt; on recommendation of the directors of the associ - ation and approval of the Department of Banking further additions may be made to tlie reserve fund but not after the reserve fund has been built up to 1 )% of the total assets of the association, exclusive of cash. The additions to the reserve fund required by statute had been made by the associations but at the beginning of the period of rapid liquidation tut few associations had a 5% reserve fund. The necessity for buildi ig up these reserves more rapidly was apparent but to build them up luring a period of rapid' liquidation when earnings were being reduce 1 meant that dividends to shareholders had to be curtailed and in sc me instances passed entirely. The passing of divi - dends created fear in the minds of some investors in the associations and as a result additional requests for the retirement of shares were filed. This fear was increased by the activities of unscrupulous sales - men who swarmed over the state trying to induce shareholders to trade their shares for ot ier investments, which for the greater part, were of a very speculative value. ACTIVITIES DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS The general c mditon of the building and loan associations in Ne - braska shows a mi irked improvement during the past two years. The delinquencies in mortgage loans have been reduced over 50% and during the past year foreclosures have shown a marked decrease. Repossessed real estate still presents a problem to some of the associ - ations, but real es tate holdings in the associations have been reduced $902,000.00 and contracts for the sale of real estate have been reduced $603,000.00 during the past two years. Reserves for contingencies now equal 8% of the total assets of the associations, exclusive of cash, which is the high:st ratio of reserves to assets the associations have shown during thei:' history of over forty year?. Requests filed for the retirement of shares have been normal during the past two years, over 70% of the associations either have no requests filed or are paying re - quests within a sixty-day period. The cash funds in thfe associations have been increased $5,400,000.00 and investments in liquid bonds have been increased $3, i00,000.00. The associations have at the present time </seg>
            <seg id="p190">DEPARTMENT OF BANKING $15,000,000.00 in cash and liquid bonds or more cash and bonds than they have had in their history. While the gross income of the associ - ations has been reduced during the past two years, still in keeping with this reduction in income operating expenses have been reduced 169'r and real estate and foreclosure expenses have been reduced 22&lt;7r. During the past two years four building and loan associations have been reorganized and placed on a restricted basis. This makes the total number of associations in reorganization or liquidation 12. The total assets of the 12 associations represents only 27r of the total assets of all the associations in the state. During the past two years three associations have been converted into Federal Savings and Loan Associations: Broken Bow Building and Loan Association, Broken Bow, Nebraska. Home Building and Loan Association, Falls City, Nebraska. Fidelity Savings and Loan Association, Lincoln, Nebraska. ■ ' GENERAL The building and loan associations in Nebraska are in position to make desirable home loans, as evidenced by the fact that they have $15,000,000.00 of available funds in cash and liquid bonds. To encour - age home building the tendency during the past two years has been toward lower interest rates to borrowers but investment funds cannot be attracted if dividend rates are too low, which means that there is a limiting point to which interest rates to borrowers can safely be re - duced. The building and loan associations in Nebraska are meeting legitimate competition for home loans not only from the standpoint of interest rates charged but also from the standpoint of mortgage re - payment plans. </seg>
