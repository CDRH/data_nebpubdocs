         <seg id="p001">Director's Introduction _ This following are some of the more important activities of this Department which have received special attention during the past year. 1. The Personnel Division is operating in conformity with a joint Merit System covering the State Employment Service and the Unem - ployment Compensation Division of the Department of Labor, the De - partment of Health, and the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare of the Board of Control. This Merit System was set up in order to com - ply with Federal regulations included in the Wagner-Peyser Act as amended. 2. The basis of allocation of assistance grants to counties was changed from the Population to the Need basis. This required that stand - ards bei set-up and uniform procedures be used in all counties in the State and that these standards and procedures be used in the determi - nation of eligibility of all persons applying for assistance grants. 3. The fact that practically all forms of relief in the various coun - ties in the State are handled through the local county assistance offices made it advisable to install a reporting medium which would cover all forms of relief. To this end what is known as the Household System has been provided. • ¦ . 4. The administration of the assistances as well as the child welfare and crippled children services as the single responsibility of this De - partment made it advisable to consolidate the field staffs which had formerly supervised these activities and there is now one field staff cover - ing the thirteen districts into which the State is divided. This field staff has the responsibility of supervision of all of the State Assistance ac - tivities in their respective districts. 5. In order to secure more uniform administration of the various activities falling under this Department's jurisdiction, manuals of in - struction covering all activities which it supervises have been issued and these manuals of instruction are used by the various county staffs in administering the various activities included in their jurisdiction. 6. The provisions of the State statutes setting up Liens make it necessary that procedures and policies be set-up for use in all counties in the State to care f&gt;r these provisions of the statutes. This has been done and Statistical Table No. 52 indicates that a considerable amount ! of recoveries have been secured because of this statutory provision. Also, many applications have been withdrawn by persons who did not wish to have their property encumbered by a lien. It is felt that probably more saving is represented by applications with-held because of this provision than the actual recoveries realized because of liens. 7. The Social Security Act provides that one-half the administra - tive costs of Blind Assistance and Aid to Dependent Children may be 1 </seg>
         <seg id="p002">carried on with Social Security Board participation. In order to obtain this participation it has been necessary for the Department to establish what these costs are, and, since the various counties handle many ac - tivities, it has been necessary to conduct a "Time Study" in the various counties to be used as a basis for claiming additional administrative matching funds. 8. The listing of names of persons entitled to assistance grants is being done in the State Office with I. B. M. equipment. This saves the clerical personnel in the counties considerable time. 9. Out-state clinics under the supervision of the Crippled Children Services have been held in any counties. These clinics not only permit of check-up of old cases, which have been receiving Crippled Children's Services and which might not be seen if the clinic had not been held, but also has given expert services to many persons who might never have been able to secure these services either because of ignorance of the facilities available to them or because of the travel involved in bringing them to Lincoln. 10. The State Department of Assistance and Child Welfare has played an active part in the installation of the various Surplus Market - ing Administration Food Stamp Plans, and the installation of the House - hold Card mentioned above has been an important and useful medium in this installation. The Department has felt that the Stamp Plan offers many inducements as a relief medium, especially because of the fact that the expenditure of $1.00 for food gives a purchasing power of $1.50 and also because the food-stuffs were handled through normal channels of trade and persons selected themselves the foods they desired and needed. There has been one weakness in the Stamp Plan, i. c., it does not provide any benefit for persons who do not have the money with which to purchase the Orange Stamps. This is a serious matter in many counties where the county is unable to provide funds for this purpose. * * « It has been the purpose of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare to administer the various activities coming under its jurisdiction as effectively and as economically as possible, realizing that so-called "red tape" should be reduced to a minimum and yet retain sufficient con - trol so that the proper supervision would be maintained at all times and hold expenses on a basis consistent with adequate and_£pmpetent staff. At all times we keep aware that the funds expended in these activities represent tax funds often paid by the taxpayer at great personal sacri - fice, and that the use of these funds should be limited to need, that per - sons who are able to care for their own needs should not receive grants, 2 </seg>
         <seg id="p003">and those who cannot meet their needs should be cared for as adequately as the funds available would permit. The administration funds for the State Assistance staff is limited by State statute to 2% of the funds, available for assistance. Our ex - penditures have actually run less than 1.7%. If there had been ho ad - ministrative costs whatsoever and all administrative funds, both State and ftederal, for Old Age Assistance had been given instead to the twen - ty-eig)ht thousand persons on Old Age Assistance, their average monthly grants would have been increased only approximately 25c each. Tjhere are further changes being made in the administration of the activities of this Department at this time and others -will need to be made from time to time in order to comply with changes in the statutes affecting the various activities coming under its supervision. As these changes appear necessary it is the policy of the Department to work them out slowly with the counties, trying out proposed changes in a few counties after having carefully considered them with the counties. This is done in order tp avoid costly revisions of policies or procedures. Each division of this Department has a section in this report; there are statistical and financial reports covering the various activities. Per - sons interested in these activities will find a wealth of information in the material included in'this report. 3 </seg>
         <seg id="p004">PART I DIVISION OF ASSISTANCE | The Division of Public Assistance of the Department of' Assistance and Child Welfare is responsible for establishing the policies and pro - cedures for administering the social security grant-in-aid programs in Nebraska. These programs include aid to dependent children, old age assistance and aid to the blind. The Division also works cooperatively with Federal agencies in the establishment of policies and procedures for the referral of applicants to Work Projects Administration, National Youth Administration, Farm Security Administration, for the selection of boys for Civilian Conservation Corps, for the certification of persons eligible to receive Surplus Commodities, and the distribution of Surplus Commodities. The staff is composed of the chief of the division, the administrative assistant, and five units which are the certification, field review and correspondence sections, the assistant supervisor of CCC selection and the consultant or. liens and recoveries. Each unit performs specialized duties for which it is responsible to the chief of the Division. The work of the Division as carried on by this staff during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1940 is described below with emphasis being placed both on the major changes that have occurred, and on the immediate objectives of the Division. Manual of Policies and Procedures In February, 1940 a completely revised copy of the manual covering all of the activities coming under this Division was issued. This was necessary because much of the material in the manual first issued in December, 1937 had become obsolete by reason of changes in the laws governing both the assistance programs and the Federal certification programs. The legal changes necessitated the formulation of new poli - cies and procedures for administering these legal provisions effectively. As subsequent changes have occurred, material has been added to and removed from the revised manual in order to keep it current. It is the plan of the Division that this practice will be continued. This revision of the manual was also submitted to the Social Security Board as that part of the State Plan which was concerned with the poli - cies and procedures for the administration of public assistance in Nebraska. 4 </seg>
         <seg id="p005">Safeguarding Confidential Information The policy of the Department provides for safeguarding the confi - dential nature of records, papers filed, and communications, including the names and addresses of applicants for and recipients of assistance. This policy provides that before any confidential information is released to anyone other than an agency of accepted standards, the person or or - ganization requesting such information shall make a formal request of the Board of Control indicating specifically what information is desired and the purpose for which it is to be used. ¦' - ¦¦¦¦ I" ¦¦¦•¦¦¦¦' ;-; ¦'.'¦ ¦¦' ' ¦ '-¦¦':¦ Budget In the 1939 session, the Legislature amended the assistance law to define need as "the need for assistance based upon the budgetary de - ficiency requirements of a needy individual .. . ." The standard budget which jwas made effective for the entire State immediately following the passage of the law has been studied during the year to determine the effectiveness of its application, particularly in relation to the range of average grants ;for old age assistance. Ten counties were selected—five with the highest average grants, four with the lowest, and one whose average was very close to the State average. The highest iwas $24.12, the /State average was $18.98, and the lowest was $15.40, which made the range $8.72. Each case was studied in the five counties having very small case loads and a sampling was done for the other five counties. '' I • ¦ ¦ ¦'¦'¦ :¦¦'¦¦;! ¦¦ ¦¦ i Each budgetary item in these cases was studied, and it was found that the greatest variances came in the items of shelter, fuel and medical allowances. The average allowances for shelter ranged from $7.15 to 88c, making- a difference of ?6.27. This may be accounted for by the fact that this highest allowance was the average for a large metropolitan area where rentals and property expenses are much higher than in rural areas. The other eight counties fell between $3.14 and 88c, making a range of §2.26, which is no doubt more representative of the actual situation. Fuel allowances ranged from $3.52 to $1.52, or a difference of $2.00. Both of these items will normally be expected to vary because of the difference in living conditions in the counties, the proportion of home ownership in the case of shelter, and the amount of wood available in the case of fuel. The make-up of the household will influence both items, depending on whether or not a large proportion of recipients live with relatives who share the expenses. : Medical allowances ranged from an average of $6.35 to 50c, making a difference of '$5 85. This seemed to be the item having the greatest effect on the county averages and presented some proof of the inadequacy of the medical planning on a State-wide basis. It is felt by the Division that there is a real need for developing some types of plans satisfactory to all counties. Such State-wide planning has been complicated by the 5 </seg>
         <seg id="p006">lack of funds to pay one hundred per cent of the actual needs. This makes it virtually impossible for a recipient to meet his medical expense from his grant according to the amount allowed in his budget. A variety of suggestions have been made, including the possibility of eliminating the medical item from the budget, in which case such expenses would need to be met from county funds. Expert consultation has been requested from the Social Security Board, and it is hoped that plans will go forward during the next fiscal year. In the fall of 1939, a complete study was again made of the current food prices. After consulting with the technical advisory committee, it was decided that the change in the costs was so slight that it was un - necessary to revise this item of the budget. Amount of Grant The maximum monthly grant allowable by law for OAA and BA is $30, and the minimum is $5. The maximum grant for ADC is $18 per month for the first child and ?12 per month for each of the other children below 16 years of age in the home. In no event, however, may the amount paid be less than $3.00 per month for each dependent child in the home. Although one hundred per cent of the individual grants is paid for BA because the law requires that these grants may not be reduced, funds have not been adequate to pay one hundred per cent for OAA and ADC during the entire year. Following the Special Session of the Legislature, OAA and ADC recipients were paid one hundred per cent of their grants during the months of January, February and March, 1940, but flat reduc - tions of $4.00 or more per person for OAA and $3.00 or more per child for ADC have been made from July through September, 1939; 77 per cent of the grant was paid in October and November, 1939; 83 per cent in December; and 87 per cent from April through June, 1940, making five different bases of payment during the fiscal year. At the end of the fiscal year it appeared that there would be suffi - cient funds to continue paying 87 per cent until the winter months, when it was anticipated that 100 per cent would again be paid. This plan of keeping the percentage the same for a longer period of time has had a stabilizing effect on the entire program, and is already reflected in the reduction of the number of appeals filed and in the number of complaint letters received by the State office. In the blind program, which provides for temporary assistance for treatment either to prevent blindness or restore eyesight, there was little or no activity. New plans are being made, however, whereby more extensive financial assistance may be given to those persons in need of such services, and it is hoped that the program may be more effectively used in the future. 6 </seg>
         <seg id="p007">Certification Beginning in 1937, counties were given responsibility for reviewing their own cases,as soon as their case records indicated that adequate work was being done. This number was gradually increased until there were 73 counties doing their own reviewing by June 30, 1940. The trend has been away from centralized reviewing in the State office and toward more responsibility for the individual counties for this phase of the work. Since county staffs had demonstrated that they were able to assume this responsibility, it was thought that it was now time to take an even more definite step in the decentralization of reviewing. A good deal of replanning&lt; of procedures for both the county and State offices was found to be necessary; therefore, a committee of county directors and field supervisors was asked to consult with the Division. This committee gave very valuable suggestions regarding the handling ; of routines and the new system of forms to be used. On the advice of this committee, the forms and procedures were installed on an experi - mental basis in five counties whose directors volunteered to use and evaluate them before putting them into effect for the entire State. This experimental period began in April, 1940 and as a result some changes and simplifications were made, but on the whole the system seemed to work quite satisfactorily. This iplan required more supervision of case reviewing on the part of the field supervisor, and it was therefore de - cided that counties would begin using the system gradually. During June plans were made for one county in each supervisor's district to begin the following month. It is not expected that all counties will have changed over until late in the fall. j The system itself involves keeping all case record material in the county office and sending to the State office only a copy of the application and the finding of the county board, which is required by law and must have the approval of the State Director. Any subsequent changes in the grant or the status of the case are also submitted to the State office along with a brief statement of the reasons for such changes. This information is posted |to the original application and monthly pay rolls are made up accordingly. One of the important objectives of this system is to shorten the time .between the date the application is taken or modification is made, and the date the recipient receives his warrant. If this can be achieved, it will result in more prompt service to the recipient. r Case Reviews During the year, quarterly reports were made to the field super - visors by the counties regarding jthe status of home visits in each county. As of June 30, 1940, a State-wide report was secured which showed that the statutory requirement of yearly visits had been met to the extent of 96.13 per cent of the recipients in all three categories having been 7 </seg>
         <seg id="p008">visited during the year. The administrative regulation of semi-annual visits to recipients of OAA and BA and quarterly visits to recipients of ADC, had been met to the extent of 84.13 per cent of the recipients in all three categories having been visited within the stipulated time. The re - port obtained was complete for all counties except Douglas County, which submitted its findings as of a later date. All counties were asked to give immediate attention to those cases that had not been visited. It is planned that these reports will continue to be secured quarterly by the field super - visors. Field Reviews In addition to the field supervisor's work, field reviews are made by a staff of field reviewers for the purpose of studying the administra - tion of the assistance program within a county. This is done by the sampling method of selecting individual cases on the basis of every fifth, tenth, or twentieth case, depending on the size of the case load. These selected cases are studied to determine how well the county is establish - ing eligibility, and how it is applying policies and procedures. While making such a study, the field reviewer is able to observe the way in which the program itself affects the recipients and the effectiveness of the county personnel in its relationships to the recipients, the board and the community. All the material thus gathered is put into report form and is used in various ways. Some of the conclusions in this report are used, along with information from other divisions, as the basis for a ietter of evaluation of the program, which is addressed to the chairman of the county assistance committee. The field supervisors use the review for the purpose of supervision, since it brings out both strengths which may be built upon, and weak - nesses which may need to be remedied. Field reviews are valuable to the Division as a basis for analyzing the workings of policies and pro - cedures in the county programs as a whole. It is a device which should help the State office secure a better picture of the practicability of the rules and regulations the counties are asked to put into effect. Correspondence Section The case correspondent handles all complaint letters as well as inter-agency inquiries received in connection with the Division's activities as the forwarding center for the State. In addition, the case correspond - ent interviews persons interested in securing information about the program and persons who wish to discuss their grievances. About two-thirds of the letters received are both complaints and inquiries about various aspects of the program—that is, eligibility re - quirements, the status of liens, the status of an application just made, etc. Approximately one-third have to do with the amount of grants given. Usually the number of letters of this type increases during the 8 </seg>
         <seg id="p009">late autumn and early winter and decreases during January, February, and March when payments are based on 100 per cent of the grant. It is' noticeable that since April 1, when payments have been paid on 87 per cent of i need, complaints are still fewer and the monthly number quite consistent. This can be accounted for in part by the stabilization of-the payment. The work in regard to inter-agency inquiries from other states in - volves forwarding these letters to the proper county agency in Nebraska for appropriate action. Liens and Recovery A new position was created in July, 1939 with the title of con - sultant on liens and recovery.; This consultant is available to assist the State office, the field supervisors, and the county directors with problems relative to recovery and the filing of liens, and also with other problems involving real estate. : At the Special Session of the Legislature in January, 1940 some changes were made in the sections of the law which impose a lien on real estate for the old age and blind assistance payments which are made. The Legislature also passed a provision for the release of these liens. Under the original lien law, effective May 22, 1939, the old age assistance furnished after that date automatically became a lien on the real estate of the recipient and/or his spouse. The Certificate of Award was indexed and recorded merely to give notice of lien. There has been a provision for a lien on real estate owned by a blind assistance recipient and/or his spouse since the beginning of the State Assistance program in 1935. Since the amendment, effective January 13, 1940, the blind assistance and old age assistance payments made do not become a lien until a cbpy of the Certificate of Award has been indexed and recorded in the office of the county cleric or register of deeds, as the case may be, in the county in which the land is situated. The lien covers real estate owned by the recipient of such assistance or his spouse if the name of the spouse is stated in liens legally existing and appearing on Tecord. Old age and blind assistance payments which are not covered by the lien upon the death of the recipient may jbe allowed as a claim against the estate. The claim or lien cannot be enforced against the real estate of the recipient jor the real estate of the person who has been a recipient while it is occupied by the recipient's surviving spouse or by a dependent child. No statute of limitations shall apply to any cause of action belonging to the State or county and arising under these provisions while the re - cipient, former recipient, spouse, or such dependent child survive. There is no provision for a lien to attach to personal property owned by an old age recipient. However, there has been a provision for a lien on the personal property owned by a blind assistance recipient since the beginning of the program. The filing of the certificate for blind assist- 9 </seg>
         <seg id="p010">ance with the county clerk constitutes notice of the lien upon the personal property of the recipient or his spouse, other than personal effects or household goods. Eeal estate owned by Indian tribes residing in Nebraska is not subject to the assistance lien. There is no provision for a claim or lien to recover assistance furnished to dependent children. The county board has the responsibility of initiating steps to make recovery. The assistance claim may be presented to the county court or probate court by the county treasurer when directed to do so by that board. The law provides that any amount which is recovered by a county or the State with respect to old age and blind assistance furnished shall be paid to the State Assistance Fund and the State Department is au - thorized to pay promptly to the United States the proportionate amount of any such recovery to which the Federal government may be entitled. Actually, any amount recovered by the county is left with the county assistance fund and the transfer of these funds is accomplished by book - keeping entries. The board of county commissioners or county supervisors of the county in which the recipient had legal settlement at the time the assist - ance payments were made may fully release the assistance lien when: (1) the amount of the lien is paid; (2) recovery of the amount of the lien is not probable. The release is to be signed in the name of the county by the chairman of the board of county commissioners or supervisors after he is authorized by vote of such board. A release form has been prepared for the convenience of the county, and is available to them upon request. There has been a very noticeable increase in the amount of the re - covery and refund made since the claim has been secured by the lien. During the past 12 months $16,261.82 has been recovered as compared with the total of $7,021.64 recovered in the previous 41 months. Fifty - seven of the ninety-three counties have made recovery. (See Statistical Table No. 52.) More than nine thousand old age assistance liens have been indexed and recorded in the past year. i&lt;_ . . Institutions During the spring and summer, a study was made of institutions in which assistance recipients were living. The purpose of the study was to determine whether or not these institutions were public according to the definition adopted by Nebraska from the Social Security Board. The definition follows: "The term 'public institution' may be considered as including a place of residence which affords shelter or care to two or more persons and (1) is managed in whole or in part by or through any public instrumentality, official, or employee acting in an official capacity; (2) or a place of residence which, by reason of the circumstances of its origin and charter or (3) mainte - nance from public funds, may properly be termed a public insti - tution; or a place of residence in which shelter or care is afforded by agreement with a State or any of its political subdivisions for a consideration of money or moneys worth." 10 </seg>
         <seg id="p011">In the future, grants to persons living in public institutions may not be matched by Federal funds. A survey was first made by the field supervisors in order to learn the names of the institutions where recipients were living. This included boarding homes as well as county poor farms and incorporated institutions. From this material, it appeared necessary to study thirty institutions. This was done by the field re - viewers on the basis of a special questionnaire. County directors, county board members and other officials, the managers of the homes, and per - sons in the community were very cooperative in giving the necessary in - formation. The report made from the questionnaire was to be the basis for making the decision as to whether or not the institution was public. By the end of June, eight county poor farms and four other institutions had been studied. I ¦ • '-. ¦¦-¦'¦. ' I I Federal Agency Programs ' -' '; '"'¦¦¦' I•" ¦• Work Projects Administration The major changes in policy which affected the carrying out of the program in regard to the Work Projects Administration were that the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare became a Teferral rather than a certification agency, and the county agencies assumed the re - sponsibility for reviewing all cases every six months. The former change had little influence on the actual procedures in the counties since most of the persons referred by the county offices were certified immediately by the Work Projects Administration. The latter change, however, entailed much more work on the part of the county staff members and wasjac - complishedjwithout additional personnel since there were only State funds available for administrative purposes. | Farm Security Administration No notable changes occurred in the Farm Security Administration's subsistence grant program which affected the work of the county assist - ance offices with regard to this program. There was, however, an in - creasing emphasis upon the consideration of emergency grants as the first constructive step in the rehabilitation process. The drouth caused many farmers to make application for this type of aid in the fall so that the work in this program was heaviest during this season.. National Youth Administration ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦¦ ' - : ¦.¦¦¦! ¦ ¦ - The major change in the National Youth Administration Out-of- School Work program was to piace more emphasis on certifications for youth from non-relief families. JA youth from a family receiving some type of aid was said to be automatically eligible for certification and 11 </seg>
         <seg id="p012">youth from families not receiving aid but who were in need of employ - ment were eligible to make application. There has been some discussion recently of lowering the age require - ment from 18 to 17 years of age, and it seems probable that this will be done in the near future. This would seem to be a very constructive step to take since youth between the ages of 16 and 18 years of age are not planned for under any of the youth programs in Nebraska except CCC, and it gives preference to boys over 17 years of age. Civilian Conservation Corps The Civilian Conservation Corps has placed further emphasis on the selection of boys from families who are not receiving aid, but who are in need of additional income in order to maintain an adequate stand - ard of living. Nebraska took advantage of this liberalization of policy to the extent of 3 per cent of the number of boys enrolled, as compared to 36 per cent of the boys enrolled throughout the nation in January, 1940. In the April enrollment, however, 13 per cent of the boys enrolled were from non-relief families, as compared to 38 per cent nationally. Although there was an increase in the national total of non-honorable discharges during the first six months of 1940, as compared with the corresponding period in 1939, Nebraska's record shows a result which is contrary to this trend. The non-honorable discharges in Nebraska de - creased 0.67 per cent. An analysis of the total of these discharges shows that desertions in Nebraska decreased 6.1 per cent during the same period. In accounting for this decrease, one factor is believed to be the promptness and concern with which local selecting agents investigate the situation of the boys who are out of camp without permission. Surplus Commodities The two major changes that have occurred in the Surplus Commodity program have been the installation of the Food Stamp Plan by the Surplus Marketing Administration in ten counties in Nebraska, and a liberalization of the eligibility requirement for persons to receive com - modities through the direct distribution method. The latter change makes any person eligible who is receiving' either public or private aid, if his income does not exceed his budgetary need as figured according to the standard assistance budget. Unfortunately, there are two groups of persons who receive Surplus Commodities under the Bulk Distribution Plan who do not participate under the Food Stamp Plan because of inadequate funds in some counties in which the Food Stamp Plan has been introduced. These two groups are those certified for WPA but not assigned, and the direct relief cases who do not have sufficient funds to purchase the required minimum of orange stamps. 12 </seg>
         <seg id="p013">PART II FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING The original appropriation to the State Assistance Fund for the biennium July 1,19J39 to June 30,1941 was for $8,400,000.00. The Special Session (Fifty-fourth) of the Nebraska Legislature in January 1940 amended this amount to an estimated $8,880,000.00. This amount is allo - cated to the different programs, as follows: 1. State Administration Expense not more than 3%......... ? 266,400.00 2. Child. Welfare, Boarding Home Care, and Crippled Children Services. 1 i 178,000.00 3.

Additional federal funds were also made available through the increase in matching of aid to dependent children assistance payments from the basis of one dollar federal to each two dollars state funds to an even matching of one dollar federal for each one dollar state funds. During the period July 1939 to December 1939 reductions were made in the amount of the individual grants for the reason that the original appropriation could not be exceeded even though the collections were sufficient to pay larger amounts. For the months of April, May, and June 1910 the grants were again reduced in order to limit the expendi - tures to the amount of the estimated appropriation of $8,880,000.00. The reductions made on individuals grants for the year 1939-1040 were as follows: 13 </seg>

         <seg id="p024">PART 111 DIVISION OF RESEARCH AND STATISTICS Statistical data on cases and obligations incurred for the three Social Security categories and the several county programs appear in the following tables and graphs with certain summary data on other Federal programs. The Division completed important work in re - organizing the statistical recording and reporting for the Child Wel - fare and Crippled Children programs. Data on these programs follow the Child Welfare Division's narrative. During this fiscal year the Division completed the installation of the uniform system of recording cases on a household basis, and the time study to determine administrative costs. Both projects were large undertakings and required a great deal of cooperative effort from the county staffs. The effective work of the county directors is to be highly commended. The time study was conducted from February 1 through April 17, 1940 in the 93 counties and the resultant data was coded and punched on I. B. M. cards from which computations were made. The time study data form the basis for determining administrative costs of each program at county and state levels. In the case of aid to dependent children and aid to the blind, one-half the actual costs of administration are met by the Federal Government. Installation of the Household System The Board of Control through the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare with the chief of the Division of Research and Statistics as representative sponsored a state-wide professional and service project with the Nebraska Work Projects Administration by which the Federal government set up $50,585.00 for the employment of WPA clerical workers on the installation of the household system. The Department as sponsor agreed to furnish at least one-fourth of the project costs in cash outlay for printed forms and instructions and in services for state and county supervision, heat, light, space, equip - ment, and other items in the state office and counties where project workers were employed. Through this project the state and county offices were relieved of most of the cost of installation, and already burdened staffs were in the majority of counties able to carry on regular functions without interference. The change over from the former individual case method of recording to the household basis was effective all over the State on July 1, 1940. A number of counties changed over individually at earlier periods; the first to do so was Pierce County effective February 1, 1939. 24 </seg>
         <seg id="p025">Household System Forms Each county is furnished by the State with the forms in quantities needed. The household system provides a uniform method of recording for all programs of assistance and service. These forms are as follows"; APPLICATION RKGISTER, Form RS 1. A book of pages with num - bered lines for entering each day the applications received, serving as an "intake log". See Exhibit A. HOUSEHOLD NUMBERS BOOK, Form RS 2. Each household is assigned a number from this record which is also a paged book with numbered lines opposite which the name of the head of the household is entered. See Exhibit B. HOUSEHOLD CARD, Form RS 3. Each individual household in the county is set up on a Household Card. This card provides for recording summary data about the household. See Exhibit C. The card provides a basis for integrating all essential data about the head of the household, its members, application and case status, and financial postings, for all forms of assistance and service. The Household Card is printed on buff colored stock with rulings in blue and brown ink for ease of use. The card is medium weight or nine and one-half points thickness, with room for the two fiscal years of a biennium since it is printed on both sides tumble style. Cards are filed in order by household number in an active and a closed file, with numerical guide cards inserted at ; one, fifty, one hundred, etc., in sorting trays holding approximately five hundred cards with signals attached. VISITOR'S CARD, Form RS 4. This is the visitor's desk record of households under care and records summary data from the Household Card and on the back has space for; recording date and type of visit with brief notes about each visit. By using metal month signals, the next review date can be conveniently signaled for each case by the program pre-printed on the top face of the card. See exhibit D. MASTER INDEX FILE. This is a master index to all the names of applicants known to the agency. Each case head is separately in - dexed as indicated on the control check on the Household Card where the names to be indexed are checked to the left of the person's line number. A sample of such indexing is shown in Exhibit E for the household shown in Exhibit C. The entry on the card carries the following minimum identification data: surname, first and forename, with the maiden name of a married woman in parenthesis; the county and household number; and the name of the spouse for further iden - tification. .: 25 </seg>
         <seg id="p026">Method of Operation The recording of application and case status in the appropriate section of the Household Card is interpreted on the top of the card by the use of colored metal file signals. This is determined by refer - ence to the Household Signal Guide Card, Form RS 3S. See Exhibit P. Each program is assigned a certain color on the following basis (each program has a code letter also which when added to the county and household number, provide the individual "case number" as 28-6201A2 for Mrs. May Lea Smith): Program Code Letter Color Old-age assistance A Silver Aid to the blind B Black Aid to dependent children C Light Blue County home relief D Lemon WPA W Light Red FSA F Brown CCC CCC Dark Green NY A N Light Green Surplus commodities SC Orange, Child welfare CW White Crippled children CC Dark Red Mothers' pension MP Dark Blue Soldiers and sailors' relief SR Pink County blind relief CB Black-Silver •Note: To indicate other than home relief, the lemon colored signal i s used with the letter "B" lettered in to indicate "Burial", "M" for "Medical Care", "H" for "Hospitali - zation", and "T" for "Transient Aid". Thus, by use of color the program is indicated, next by the position of this signal the status is indicated. The receipt and disposition of applications are covered through the first four positions of the House - hold Signal Guide Card, and the status of cases through positions five to nine. At the end of the month the signals are read, card by card, for the preparation of the statistical report on applications and cases foi- all assistances and services, and a count of those Household Cards having signals in positions five, six and seven furnishes an unduplicated count of the number assisted. Under the specialized forms of assistance available, a particular household frequently receives two or more forms of assistance as re - sources to meet its needs. Administrative and case control are en - hanced by this device and under it no unintentional duplication of aid is possible. This is particularly important since several of these assist - ances are not under the administrative direction of the local county office which must integrate the available resources at the point of service, the household. 26 </seg>

The total amount of refunds for the fiscal year 1939-40 was $3,929.26 to 247 recipients. The refunds are included in the total amount of obligations incurred shown in this table.

Payments were made within the month, usually the latter part, for which the assistance was intended. Payments are not made to persons other than those certified for blind assistance for rendering services to recipients nor do the figures include assistance in kind. ¦ •••Obligations incurred for aid to the blind have been corrected to July 1, 1940, for all errors in reporting cancellations of warrants and retro - active payments. The corrections were made to the month for which the assistance was intended. There is no month to month agreement between obligations incurred and the monthly record of disbursements. The grand total of the disbursements to July 1, 1940 will agree with the grand total of the obligations incurred after the disbursements records are adjusted by the amount of blind refunds which were netted to the disbursements or carried to the disbursements records as a reduction of gross disbursements. The total amount of refunds added back to reported net obligations incurred (before correction) was $821.41 of which $102.34 applies to the fiscal year 1939-40. Deducting the refunds $821.41 from the total of Table 32, the total $548,614.45 represents the regular net disbursements from March 1, 1936, through June 30, 1940. 75 </seg>

A grant is made to cover only the needs of one person. A separate grant may be received by his spouse or by another blind person residing in the same household. Corrections to the number of recipients receiving blind assistance have been made to July 1, 1940, for retroactive pay - ments, cancellations, and errors in reporting in those instances where a caseload is involved.

         <seg id="p131">PART IV DIVISION OF PERSONNEL According to the! "Regulations For A Merit System Of Personnel Administration", adopted on February 20, 1940, by the Department of Assistance and Child! Welfare, the Department of Health, and the De - partment of Labor, and approved by the Social Security Board, "each State agency shall designate a staff employee to serve as Personnel Officer." The regulations stipulate that "the Personnel Officer in any agency shall be responsible to the administrative head of his agency for the internal personnel administration of that agency." The regulations further state that it shall be the responsibility of the Personnel Officer: "to develop and put into effect procedures for carrying out the personnel policies of the agency; to participate .In the preparation of and to administer the classification and compensation plans; to maintain personnel records of all persons employed in the agency and records of all personnel actions; to request certifications of cligibies by the Supervisor; to report to the Supervisor on the selection of elfeibles, promotions, salary advancements, demotions, transfers, dismissals, resignations, and all types of appointments; to recom - mend to the appointing authorities, on the basis of reports received from the supervisory official concerned, the retention or termination of probationary appointees at the close of the probationary period;-to provide and administer ( a system of service ratings; to make a report at least annually to the administrative head of his agency on the personnel activities of the agency, a copy of which shall be filed'with the Council; to notify the Supervisor, as promptly as; practicable, regarding vacancies which may occur in the agency; and to perform such other duties as are prescribed by these regulations or the agency." v ' ¦ ¦r i '. ¦ .'.¦;.' '..• ' ¦' A Division of Personnel has been an integral part of the Depart - ment of Assistance slnd Child Welfare since January 1, 1938, carrying on most of the functions as outlined in the present regulations. Much attention has been given to the selection of competent and qualified per - sonnel to perform the many and varied functions of this program. Be - cause of this emphasis, the educational level of the staff has improved materially as shown in Table 7 of this report. All the new county di - rectors appointed during the last year have had college training. Nine of them are college graduates, three have their Master's degrees, and four have had one year or more of professional training. The personnel turnover, however, has been too high. During the period from April 1, 1939, to June 30, 1940, fifteen counties in Nebraska, including the two largest, selected new county directors. There has also been a total of one hundred and forty-two appointments made to techni - cal positions. The primary reason for this is the low salaries paid to public welfare employees in Nebraska. Counties were paying as low as $60.00 a month to directors in full-time positions. Some visitors were receiving $50.00 a month while stenographers were paid as low as $35.00 and $40.00 a month in several counties. In comparing the salaries paid case workers and other members of the profession with those in sur- 131 </seg>
         <seg id="p132">rounding States, it was found that the Nebraska salaries, on the average, were the lowest. When a compensation plan was being considered as a part of the merit system, this situation was called to the attention of the County Assistance Committees throughout the State; and since that time, progress has been rapid in providing more adequate compensation for the various positions. The Department has received the whole - hearted cooperation of most of the County Assistance Committees. The following principles should be kept in mind regarding salaries and an effective compensation plan: Salaries paid for positions in a State agency should be related to salaries for jobs of similar difficulty in other State departments. If the positions for the technical staff do not seem comparable to any other State position, clerical salaries can be set in relation to clerical salaries in other departments for equally difficult clerical work; and the technical salaries can be set by relating the importance of the technical duties to the clerical duties. All positions should have some range to allow for differences in preparation and experience of individual workers. Salary ranges for workers in charge of local units should provide also an opportunity to recognize differences in the size of job to be done. Such differences depend upon the number of workers to be supervised and the size of the case load. Staff members directing and supervising other workers should be paid larger salaries than the staff responsible to them. It is desirable that salaries for similar work should be in the same salary range throughout the State. Transportation should be kept as a separate item in the adminis - trative budget and should not be included in salaries. Workers should be reimbursed for the amount spent on public conveyances, or at the rate of a given amount a mile if they use their own cars. Expense vouchers covering the daily amounts expended should be submitted at regular periods by each worker and payment made aftei' the voucher has been carefully audited. Since the "Regulations For A Merit System Of Personnel Adminis - tration" wen; adopted on February 20, 1940, and a classification plan in which all positions have been classified has been completed, it is ex - pected that examinations for the positions of Visitor; County Director III; County Director II; County Director I; Case Worker; Child-Welfare Worker II; Child-Welfare Worker I; Junior Case-Work Supervisor; Senior Case-Work Supervisor; Chief, Division of Public Assistance; Chief of Field Services; and Chief of Personnel will be given sometime in August, 1940. The statement of policy as given in the regulations sets forth the purpose of the merit system as follows: "In order to assure an efficient and economical administration of the functions of social security legislation and to provide equal 132 </seg>
         <seg id="p133">opportunity for all qualified persons to compete for positions in the agencies administering the social security program, these agencies have adopted these regulations to carry out the merit principle. All appointments shall be made on a nonpartisan merit basis. Except for emergency and provisional appointments, positions shall be filled from registers of eligibles established by merit examinations. Ex - aminations shall be conducted according to the provisions of these regulations and shall apply to all positions in the classified service. "It shall be the policy of the agencies to make possible a career service by making promotions based on efficient work and providing tenure in office for those who give satisfactory performance. "No employee in the classified service of any of the agencies or of the Council shall participate in any form of political activity, direct or indirect, except that he shall have the right to express freely his views as a citizen and to cast his vote. No person shall be disqualified from taking an examination, from appointment to a position, or from holding a position because of political or religious opinions. '¦ . : "These l^egulations shall apply to all personnel of the agencies. No appointments shall be made except in conformity with these regulations unless such exception is authorized by law."

         <seg id="p136">PART V DIVISION OF FIELD SERVICES Until November 1, 1939, the field staff of the Division of Assist - ance, consisting of ten persons, represented the Department of Assist - ance and Child Welfare in the supervision of the local administration of assistance and the certification and referral of applicants to Federal agencies. The Child Welfare Division was represented by nine district child welfare consultants. These consultants carried the so-called "State cases" and a few county cases and furnished technical consultation serv - ices to local offices handling child welfare problems. On November 1, 1939, the Board of Control effected the integration of the field services for assistance and child welfare by creating a Division of Field Services. This Division consists of a chief of staff and thirteen district field su - pervisors, and displaced the ten Division of Assistance field representa - tives and nine child welfare consultants. At this time, the State Department discontinued responsibility for child welfare case work serv - ices (except State Home for Dependent Children cases). These activities were assumed by the county child welfare boards, in whom the statutes vest this responsibility. The County Child Welfare Board is composed of the members of the county board of commissioners or supervisors, or the County Welfare Board, if there be one. The case work responsibilities formerly carried by the child welfare district con - sultants were assumed in most counties by the members of the local as - sistance staff and the other responsibilities formerly held by the nine child welfare consultants were incorporated in the duties assigned to the newly created Division of Field Services. The duties of the Division of Assistance field representatives were also incorporated in the func - tions of this staff. Thus, the function of the Division of Field Services has become that of interpreting to the county assistance committees and staffs State laws, policies and procedures, the maintaining of direct su - pervision in all matters (except fiscal) pertaining to the administration of old age assistance, aid to the blind, aid to dependent children, child welfare and crippled children's services, and the certification and re - ferral of applications to federal agencies including WPA, NYA, FSA, CCC, and Surplus Commodities. All supervision indicated above flows from the State Department through the field supervisors, to the local offices. It is the function of the Division to promote uniformly high stand - ards of administrative efficiency throughout the State in accordance with policies and procedures established in the other divisions as formulated or approved by the Director of Assistance, under the general direction of the Board of Control. 136 </seg>
         <seg id="p137">The field supervisors make their headquarters in district offices established at Lincoln, Grand Island, Norfolk, North Platte, Scottsbluff, O'Neill, MeCook, and Nebraska City. In each of the first four cities mentioned two supervisors have their headquarters office together. The field supervisor makes regular and emergency visits to the county assistance offices in his district. In addition to consulting with local directors on cases involving eligibility problems, he offers assistance in solving problems in general administrator Help is also given the local directors and assistance committees in problems of personnel se - lection and personnel practices. / The various divisions of the State office are kept informed regarding the problems and progress of the local offices through regular and special Teports from the field supervisor. The field supervisor plays an im - portant role in the evaluation of all county programs for which the Department has responsibility. Staff development at the local level is largely the responsibility of the field supervisor. In addition to the regular day-by-day supervision, the field supervisors conduct informal study groups of assistance work - ers in which considerable interest has been shown and much progress has been made. They also attend and participate in the district meetings of the directors and public welfare workers which are held regularly by five different groups in the State. One group comprises the counties of the northeast section of the State; one, the southeast section; another, the central section; a fourth, the southwest; and a fifth, the counties of the western "Panhandle." The Division holds general staff meetings at the State office from four to six times per year as needed. These meetings are attended also by members of the staffs from other divisions. In these meetings, the field supervisors have an opportunity to report to the various division chiefs the problems encountered in the field and to make recommenda - tions regarding proposed policies. Likewise, the various members of the State office staff have an opportunity to explain new policies and pro - cedures to insure uniform interpretation and performance throughout the State. There is a mutual interchange of ideas between the field and central office staff s which makes for a better coordinated program. The State and Federal assistance laws relating to OAA, BA, and ADC provide for the right of a tax payer, applicant, or recipient to ap - peal from a decision of the local assistance committee to the Board of Control. When an appeal for fair hearing is filed, the field supervisor or a representative of the State office is directed to visit the appellant, make whatever investigation is needed, and if the appellant still desires 'it, to conduct a formal hearing. In this hearing the appellant has the right to call witnesses and to present any testimony he wishes. The testimony is taken under oath and a verbatim transcript of the entire hearing is transmitted to the State Assistance Office where it is reviewed 137 </seg>
         <seg id="p138">by the Board of Control. The decision of the Board of Control is final and is sent by registered mail to the appellant. During the fiscal year July 1, 1939, through June 30, 1940, 55 ap - peals were filed in connection with the three categorical programs. Of this number, 23 were voluntarily withdrawn by the appellants and in one case the appellant did not appear for the hearing. Of the 31 hear - ings held, the Board of Control sustained the decision of the local assist - ance committee in 30 cases and reversed it in one. In many cases, the local committees, after receiving additional information, reversed their own decisions. This accounts in part for the large percentage of volun - tary withdrawals of appeals. , 138 </seg>
         <seg id="p139">PART VI DIVISION OF CHILD WELFARE AND ' SERVICES FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN We must look to the State welfare department to provide leadership in developing State and local services for children and in improving standards of care. State departments will need to administer such serv - ices as cannot be provided practicably in local units. Community and State services designed to meet the needs of Nebraska's children should be developed on the basis of careful planning participated in by health, educational, and social-service agencies, public and private, and by rep - resentative citizens. Inter-departmental cooperation in the administra - tion of child welfare is increasingly important. Nebraska has made much progress in child welfare during the past few years. May these gains, be preserved and serve as a foundation for further strengthening of our local.and State services. Our concern is the health and well being of our children, which is inextricably inter - woven with the integrity, economic security and general well being of the family. ¦ ' 1. RESPONSIBILITIES, j The Division of Child Welfare and Services for Crippled Children was established by executive order of the Board of Control in May, 1937. The Chief of the Division was made directly responsible to the Director of Assistance and Child Welfare and to the Board of Control for the administration of the child welfare duties as assigned by the 1937 Legislature.

ORGANIZATION. In order to administer the above outlined responsibilities of the Division, the staff is comprised of professionally trained administrators and supervisors, all of whom have had experience in the field of child welfare. The Chief of the Division, under the administrative direction of the Director of Assistance and Child Welfare and the Board of Control, is responsible for planning, organizing, and administering the State child welfare activities for the care and protection of children. He is re - sponsible for initiating and promoting the enforcement of laws for the protection of children, the establishment of policies and procedures for the administration of such other laws as are delegated to the Division for administration; he acts as State child-placing agent for the Board of Control; he coordinates the work of the Division with that of the other Divisions of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare; and other work related to the planning, organizing and administering of the Division.

The supervisor acts as secretary to the Case Committees of these institutions and maintains, in a large measure, the flow of ,work between the individual county welfare agencies and the State training institutions. Pending the re-esteblishment. of psychiatric services in the Division, the super - visor is at present handling applications for admission to and placement and dis - charge from the Institution for Feeble Minded. This work is done in cooperation with the Superintendent of the Institution, the Board of Control, and the Division of Child Welfare. Supervisor of County Child Welfare Units. The supervisor of county child welfare work has the specific responsibility of developing county child welfare services in the State through joint planning with staff members of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare, the County Child Welfare Boards and their agents, and other county child welfare officials. In addi - tion to the initiation of the program, the supervisor is responsible for the super - vision of the activities of all county child welfare service workers, giving general planning and direction to the case-work, community organization, and educational ! activities of these workers. The supervisor consults with county workers, county directors, staff of the State Department, and other parties on community child welfare problems and assists these individuals in activities designed to improve ¦ local conditions as they relate to children. Supervisor of Special Services. The supervisor of special services is responsible for evaluation of the activities and services of private child-caring and child-placing agencies; assisting the Chief of the Division in the formulation of standards as a basis for licensing such ¦ ¦ ¦ i ' ' ¦ 141 </seg>
         <seg id="p142">agencies ; providing consultation services in assisting child-placing and child-caring agencies in the improvement of the standards of their programs. In addition to this work the supervisor provides, on selected cases, case-work treatment, consultation, and/or supervision for unmarried mothers, planning and arranging lor maternity and post-partum care, either in the State Institution or in private maternity homes or lying-in hospitals. This involves activity in the preparation of social studies, the handling of legal forms in connection with admissions to the State institutions, and the relinquishment and commitment of children born out of wedlock when requested by the unmarried mother. Supervisor of Medical Care Policy. The supervisor of medical care policy (part-time position) serves as the con - sultant on all medical problems relating to the State child welfare and services to crippled children programs. The supervisor reviews all medical reports relating to maternity homes and child-caring institutions and agencies and supervises the medical program of the State children's institutions. Supervisor of Medical 'Social Work.

This work includes responsibility for determination of eligibility of chil - dren for medical services; the planning and arranging for extension clinics held for the purpose of case finding, diagnosis, and follow-up care; the giving of con - sultation on medical-social problems to the State and local staffs; and similarly related matters. In addition to the administrative staff of the Division outlined above, the field supervisors of the Division of Field Services have definite re - sponsibilities for the general supervision of the local administration of the child welfare and services to crippled children programs. The field supervisors give consultation services to the county child welfare boards and their agents, to the juvenile courts, and to other county officials on child welfare activities; supervision of all of the various child welfare activities of the county child welfare boards; serving as liaison parties between the State Department and the local administrative unit; general interpretation of the rules and regulations of the State Department, as well as responsibilities for interpretation and participation in local community programs on child welfare. 3. RECENT CHILD WELFARE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEBRASKA. At the beginning of the last fiscal year, July 1939, the Division was administering its statutory and administrative responsibilities for chil - dren through a field staff which covered the entire State. Nine district child welfare consultants, with headquarters throughout the State, were providing the case-work services for the State children's institutions, demonstrating child welfare case work on a selected number of local children's problems, providing consultation to local officials on child welfare cases and strengthening of community services, and in general representing the Division. This organization of field services of the Division continued during the first four months of the fiscal year, July through October, inclusive. Table CW-1 presents a picture of the ex - tent of their services during this period of time. The nine district con- 142 </seg>
         <seg id="p143">sultants were providing services to approximately 1,000 children each month, the greatest number of whom were wards of the State by virtue of their being dependent, delinquent, and physically or mentally handi - capped. In October 1939, the Board of Control issued an administrative order which outlined briefly a plan for the establishment of a Division of Field Services to supervise the local administration of child welfare, public assistance, and the other related activities of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare. The Board of Control recognized that child welfare, as well as other public welfare services, could best be administered through a local administrative unit equipped to serve its community in all phases of public welfare. This action of the Board of Control was consistent with the intent of the Nebraska Assistance Act passed in 1935 and resulted in the elimination of the district child wel - fare work being performed by the Division's staff. This reorganization of the field services for the Division was made on November 1, 1939, and the county child welfare boards were asked to cooperate through their agents, the county directors, in the estab - lishment of services to children through their county office. The 1937 Assistance Act* made it the duty of the county child welfare boards to coordinate and cooperate with the county mothers' pension board, county visiting nurse, local municipal, judicial, public and private insti - tutions, charities, hospitals, and organizations for the care, support, edu - cation, health, morals, and general welfare of children in the county in both rural and urban areas. The Nebraska Assistance Act also defines seven classes of children's cases over which the county child welfare board has jurisdiction (dependent, destitute, abandoned, neglected, de - linquent, physically or mentally handicapped). The law provides that the powers of the county child welfare board shall include the following: ?See C. S. Supp. Ncbrnskn, 1837: 43—502-OS and 2&amp;—1001-06. a. Investigate the family circumstances of each child reported as in need of service, in order to determine what care, supervision, or treatment, if any, such child requires; b. Administer and supervise relief to families with children needing service, when such families are unable to give the necessary care; ' ' c. Furnish indigent children with suitable clothing, shoes, books, food, and other necessities to enable them to attend upon instruc - tion as required by law; ;.:. d. Assume charge of and provide support for any child who cannot be cared for properly in his ownj home; c. Investigate complaints of neglect and abuse of children; f. Bring cases, when necessary, before the juvenile court for ' adjudication; , i g. Institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction against a parent or adult for neglect and/or abuse of a child; 143 </seg>
         <seg id="p144">h. Provide any necessary medical or hospital care for chil - dren; i. Care for any child discharged to its care by a juvenile court or pending action by a court; j. Investigate complaints of alleged delinquency of children; k. Provide for a child born out of wedlock and his mother as for any other person in need of public relief or care; 1. Institute proceedings to establish paternity and secure the support and education of children born out of wedlock, or make a compromise with the father of the child in accordance with the pro - vision of the laws relating to children born out of wedlock; m. Care for children born out of wedlock with their mothers or in a free or boarding home; n. Provide for expert mental and physical examination of any child whom it has reason to suspect of mental and physical defect or disease, and pay for such care from public funds; o. The county child welfare board is responsible for making reports to the Division of Child Welfare on its activities with respect to child welfare. The integrated county child welfare program made possible under the Nebraska Assistance Act and the administrative decision of the Board of Control of October 1939, means that in most of the counties the work of the county child welfare board, the juvenile court, the juvenile probation officer, will be administered by one agency. The coun - ty has the following specific duties: a. Making of pre-commitment social studies on all children committed or admitted to State institutions; b. Planning for children who are to be released from State institutions, with particular reference to the boys' and girls' train - ing schools, and the Institution for the Feeble Minded; c. Supervision of children who are on parole from the boys' and girls' training schools; d. Supervision of children who have been placed from the In - stitution for Feeble Minded; c. General supervision for dependent, delinquent, and neglected children; f. Case-work services for unmarried mothers who request it; g. Investigation of applications for services for crippled chil - dren and after-care services. The State administrative and supervisory agencies and the county child welfare boards and their staffs have much reason to be proud of the general improvement of the services rendered on behalf of children during the last several months. Each county agency, without exception, has assumed its new responsibilities in the field of child welfare with a minimum of loss of momentum and with an increased interest in and 144 </seg>
         <seg id="p145">activity for the dependent, neglected, delinquent, and mentally deficient children in the county. Table CW-2 presents a county-by-county distri - bution of the active county child welfare and crippled children's cases reported to the State Department on June 30, 1940, the close of our fiscal year. A total of 1,031 cases, involving 1,461 children, were known to the county agencies. This represents an increase of approximately three hundred children over the number served by the former district field staff of the Division at the beginning of the fiscal year. The emphasis of the State Department on the improvement and strengthening 1 of county welfare programs has had a decided effect upon services to children during this past year. County directors and their staffs, through the aid of the field supervisors and the consultation services of the Division, are steadily improving the quality of their child welfare activities. There has been widespread acceptance of their statu - tory and social responsibilities to children, and a firm foundation has been laid for a constantly increasing program during the coming years. The Division has carried a major responsibility in the program of reorganization. Much of the staff's time has been devoted to the conduct of programs to aid local staffs and officials to meet their responsibilities, through an educational,and staff development program, giving consul - tation on general and specific child welfare problems, and similar ac - tivities. Specific accomplishments of the Division during the past fiscal year may ba mentioned briefly. A Manual of Instructions and Suggestions on Child Welfare was prepared by the Division for use by the State, dis - trict, and county staffs and officials. The use of this tool made it possible for the reorganization to proceed at a rats much faster than could other - wise have been expected. A State-wide statistical reporting program of child-welfare activities and services was likewise initiated and developed by the Division of Research and Statistics during the year in order that a proper accounting could be made of child welfare services by the county departments. Ths Central Index, or State central exchange on children's cases given service or assistance by the State or by private child welfare agencies, has been maintained by the Division. This ex - change has found increasing use by the State and county offices in order to avoid duplication of work and to aid in the preparation of social studies on individual children. There has been further extension, also, of county child welfare services, through Child Welfare Service funds and through State funds. There have been a number of additions made to the child welfare library and an increased circulation of reading ma - terial among State and local staffs, all of which has made it possible to maintain certain standards of work performed by the State and local personnel. 4. CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. The term "child welfare services" is being used increasingly to designate the care and protection of children who are dependent, neglected, 145 </seg>
         <seg id="p146">delinquent, physically handicapped, mentally defective, or children whose physical and moral welfare is endangered by conditions in the home or community. The specific activities of the Division to provide care and protection for children are outlined briefly as follows: a. Dependent and Neglected Children. The main objective of child welfare services is to preserve for the dependent and neglected child the unity of his own home when - ever possible, and for those needing foster care, a home embodying spiritual and moral training, guarding of the child's personality, health, love, and security, and physical comfort. Because family life is the foundation of our society and of democracy and because every child is entitled to the care and security of a home among his own people, the first effort in the care of dependent children should be to preserve the child's own home. The Division, with its limited facilities, is attempting to provide those services which assist the county child welfare boards and their agents in their efforts to preserve the homes of dependent and neglected children. The consultation services of the staff are being used increasingly by the county directors and other county officials on matters relating to the care of the dependent child. The foster-care service program of the Division provides homes for children who have been committed to the care and custody of the State Home for Dependent Children. With a staff of three foster-home workers and the supervisor of case work for children, the Division, with funds made available by the last Legislature, was caring for over three hundred children during the last fiscal year. Table CW-3 gives a brief picture of the foster-care service program. On June 30, 1940, there were 330 children outside of the Home for Dependent Children, 281 of whom were under supervision in 240 foster homes. Applications totaling 559 were received during the year from parties wishing to care for a child in their home. The largest number, 310, were individuals who wished to provide a boarding home; 156 wished to adopt children; 59 were prospective work homes; and 33 offered a free home. During the year there were approximately 200 foster-home in - vestigations made by the staff after there had been a general sifting of the homes to remove those obviously unfit and those which did not meet the accepted standards of recognized child-placing agen - cies. There were 125 children placed in foster homes; many of these placements were first placements of children, and a number were replacements. Six children, not wards of the Board of Control or committed to the custody of the Home for Dependent Children, were cared for in foster homes through State boarding-home funds. These children were in nesd of the intensive care and supervision which foster 146 </seg>
         <seg id="p147">homes could provide, and the placements were made with a view of demonstrating to local officials the values of foster-home care in meeting problems of delinquency, disturbing behavior patterns, and so on. It is hoped that the Division will be able to increase this service as it is constantly being asked by local agencies to provide temporary care for children whose own homes are either unfit for their care or incapable of meeting the needs of the children. b. Delinquent Children—Probation and Parole. Direct administrative responsibility for planning for placement and supervision of boys and girls on parole from the State Indus - trial School and the Girls' Training School has been delegated by the Board of Control to the county child welfare boards, to be ad - ministered by its director in cooperation with the Division, which acts as the liaison agency between the county child welfare board and the superintendents of the boys' and girls' training schools. A staff member, the supervisor of juvenile probation and parole, co - ordinates the work of the county directors and the State training institutions on matters relating to social studies of children com - mitted to the training schools, the preparation of parole plans for children prior to their release, and the supervision of children while on parole. A case committee, comprised of a member of the Board of Control, the superintendent of the. training school, and the Chief of the Division, passes upon plans for the release of children from the training schools and is responsible for decisions relating to the final discharge of the child from parole when a satisfactory adjust - ment has been made. Table CW-4 presents the distribution of children on parole from the State training schools who were served by the Division during the fiscal year 1939-40. It is noted that the average monthly number of children on parole each month was 308, with a constantly decreasing number of children under parole supervision during the year. This has been the result of the policy of releasing children from parole after there has been a satisfactory adjustment over a reasonable length of time. During the year 240 children were dis - charged from) parole. During the year 170 children were placed from the training schools, and placements have averaged 14 children per month. It is particularly significant that only 25 children were returned to the training schools during the year. Approximately half of this num - ber were returned because of: parole violation, and the rest were returned for relocation because their placement was not proving satisfactory in regard to their welfare. On the basis of the recent experience of the Division, it can be stated that the present program and policies relating to the super - vision of children released from the training schools on parole is the 147 </seg>
         <seg id="p148">most effective method possible under our present organization. The success of this program is due, in a large measure, to the splendid cooperation which the Division has received from the county di - rectors and their staffs and other county officials. The superintend - ents of the Boys' Industrial School and the Girls' Training School have been most cooperative in planning with the Division, and an improved program of rehabilitation of delinquent children through constructive use of parole has resulted. The supervisor of juvenile probation and parole is also avail - able to county directors, county officials (including sheriffs and juvenile court judges) on problems relating to the care and treat - ment of the delinquent child in his own community. Although these services have not been used as frequently as would be desired, there is a growing recognition of the need to plan programs for the pre - vention of juvenile delinquency. During the past year there has also been a greater use of the facilities of the county welfare agen - cies by the Juvenile Court judges in planning programs of proba - tion This is one area to which the Division will need to give more attention in the coming years. With the development of adequate case-work services in connection with the Boys' Industrial School and the Girls' Training School, the Division can be relieved of much of this detailed work and can better spend its efforts in assisting the county officials throughout the State in meeting the needs of pre-delinquent and delinquent boys and girls before their situation becomes serious enough to warrant the costly rehabilitation program of our State institutions. c. Unmarried Mothers and Children Born Out of Wedlock. The Division is vitally concerned with safeguarding the wel - fare of unmarried mothers and children born out of wedlock. The Nebraska Statutes (1) delegating responsibility to the county child welfare boards for providing for the child born out of wedlock and for his mother as for any other person in need of financial assist - ance and care, (2) requiring the maternity homes and hospitals in the Stats to report to the Division every unmarried mother who enters a maternity home, and (3) establishing facilities for care for unmarried mothers through the State maternity home, provide a setting for the conduct of the present program of the Division. A staff member of the Division is responsible for coordinating the work of the county offices, the private maternity homes and hospitals and the State maternity home, and the work of the Di - vision in order that the medical, social, and financial resources of the counties and State are used to further the best interests of the un - married mother and her child. Some of the activities of the Division which relate to this pro - gram may be enumerated as follows: 148 </seg>
         <seg id="p149">(1) Consultation service to the county directors and other officials on all matters relating to the care of the unmarried mother and her child; suggestions as to use of resources within the State for the medical care of the mother; (2) Planning with mothers'in the State maternity home for the care of their children. If a mother is able to give proper care to her child through her own resources or through those of relatives or the A. D. C. program, this is encouraged by the Division, a practice in keeping with modern child wel - fare philosophy. ' (3) In event the mother wishes to relinquish her child, the Division assists her in preparing the necessary forms, ar - ranging commitment of the child to the State Home for De - pendent Children, or puts the mother in touch with a private child-caring' agency, which in turn handles these mattsrs. Some idea of the extent of the Division's activities in this area can be obtained from Table CW-5, which gives a month to month distribution of the referrals which were received by the Division during the last fiscal year. There were 287 referrals from private hospitals and maternity homes; 54 came from the Nebraska Indus - trial Home (Milford maternity home); a total of 341 mothers who were in need of medical and social treatment for themselves and for their children to be born out of wedlock. An average of 28 referrals per month were received and handled by the Division. d. Children with Physical Handicaps. The Division is likewise concerned with children who are handi - capped in their social and vocational adjustment because of a physi - cal disability. In addition to the Services for Crippled Children which will be discussed below, the Division has assumed responsi - bility for the locating of handicapped children who can profit from training offered by the State schools for the blind and the deaf, directing children and their parents to medical care and attention made available through local and State resources, and assisting parents; teachers, and county officials in their understanding and handling of problems created by a physical disability. Each year, the Division refers a number of children to the State Department of Vocational Rehabilitation for consideration in planning a training program for these children. The.field, clinics of the Division, which are primarily used for the purpose of providing medical services for crippled children, are also available on a diagnostic and consultative basis to families and physicians who wish to refer any child for further study. This service is quite limited, however, and it is hoped that the future will find the .field clinics of the Division serving greater numbers of children who have disabilities which at present are not covered by 149 </seg>
         <seg id="p150">the administrative definition of a crippled child. The preventive work which can be accomplished by proper case finding, early diagnosis and treatment, and increased attention to the social and vocational problems resulting from a physical disability -will result in fewer socially maladjusted and vocationally unfit adults in Ne - braska. c. The Mentally Handicapped Child. The Division acts as the liaison agency between the county child welfare boards and their agents and the Institution for Feeble Minded at Beatrice. The case situations of all children -who are committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded are reviewed by the Division and admittance of the child to the Institution is subject to approval by a case committee, comprised of a member of the Board of Control, the Institution Superintendent, and the Chief of the Division. This procedure prevents the admission of children whose mental condition has been improperly diagnosed and those whose needs for supervision and care can be best met in their own home or in their own community. The diagnostic and consultation services at the State Orthopedic Hospital and the psychological services of the University of Nebraska are resources which are used by the Division in the study and planning for treatment of children who are committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded. In a survey of mentally deficient persons throughout the State, which was conducted by the Division last summer, it was learned that there was a greater number of individuals under twenty-one years of age who were in need of institutional care than there were over twenty-one. Approximately seventy per cent of the individuals who had been diagnosed as feeble minded had been committed to the Institution and were awaiting admission. Some thirty per cent of the individuals who had been diagnosed as feeble minded were awaiting commitment by the courts. These findings have resulted in more adequate planning for the admission of children to the In - stitution and have required that the Division give extremely careful consideration to each request for admission in order that those in greatest need can be cared for at the earliest possible opportunity. f. County Child Welfare Service Programs. Under the provision made by the Social Security Act, Title V, Part 3, Federal funds for child welfare services became available to the states in 1936. These funds have enabled the state public welfare agencies to establish, extend, and strengthen—especially in rural areas—child welfare services for the protection and care of homeless, dependent, and neglected children and children who are delinquent and handicapped. The Social Security Act specifies two major activities for which allotments of Federal money may be ex- 150 </seg>
         <seg id="p151">pended: (1) For paying part of the cost of local services in areas predominantly rural, and (2) for developing State services for the encouragement and assistance of adequate methods of community child welfare organization throughout the State. Nebraska began participating in the program in 1936 and has used the funds within the above areas for stimulating and coordinating developments of needed services for children within the existing programs of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare and the county wel - fare agencies. The fiscal year 1939-40 has seen an increase in the number of counties requesting that the services of skilled child welfare workers be made available for children in their communities. At the close of June 1940, six counties, Lincoln, Gage, Pawnee, Seward, Platte, and Madison, were being served by child welfare workers; four counties, Cass, Otoe, Butler, and Morrill, had re - quested the services of a worker. It is expected that there will be twelve child welfare units in operation during the next fiscal year. Each of the counties which has the services of a skilled child welfare worker is paying part of the cost of these services by pay - ment of a portion of the salary, travel expenses, and/or office expense. ' * In addition to using these funds for the development of child welfare programs within the counties, the Division has paid a por - tion of the salary and travel expense of the field supervisors of the Division of Field Services, the staff which is responsible for consul - tation on children's cases, general child welfare education, and co - ordination of existing services for the welfare of the needy child in the several counties in their district. At the close of the fiscal year the county child welfare service workers in the six counties had 373 children under their care and supervision. These children had been referred by county officials, teachers, private citizens, the county assistance office, or the State Department because of neglect, dependency, delinquency, serious behavior problems, physical and mental handicaps, and other situa - tions which required the protective and rehabilitative services made possible through this program. Approximately one-third of the children served by these workers came from families which were not known to the county offices because of the family's need for financial aid. This fact illustrates that these services are being made available to children because of their need for skilled atten - tion, sympathetic handling and understanding, and not because they are among children whose families are being aided through the public assistance' and works programs. . In addition to handling individual case situations of children, the county child welfare service workers were active in the initiation and development of plans for better organization of services to children within their community. In several instances, housekeep- 151 </seg>
         <seg id="p152">ing-aide services through the WPA were developed in order to meet problems of home supervision of children which were caused by the absence or illness of one or both of the parents. Recreational programs have been strengthened through the activities of these workers, and in several counties medical and dental care has re - ceived a stimulus toward more adequate service through the activi - ties of the child welfare worker. That there has been success and achievement in this phase of the Division's program is indicated in the increased financial partici - pation by several of the county child welfare boards, an increased number of referrals of children's problems in each county, and in - creasing: demands from other counties in the State for these serv - ices. In addition to the county child welfare programs made possible under the Federal grants-in-aid, the Division has assisted the two heavily populated counties, Douglas and Lancaster, to meet more adequately services to children within their boundaries. Some of the Division's funds have been budgeted to permit Douglas and Lancaster counties to have the services of a full-time child welfare supervisor, because the case loads of delinquent boys and girls from the State training schools have been too large for the staffs of the county to handle without assistance. The responsibility of the per - sonnel made available to Douglas and Lancaster counties include, in addition to case-work activities above mentioned, the participation in staff development of the personnel in the county office, the de - velopment of resources in the community to meet present needs of the disadvantaged child, and to give desired interpretation and edu - cation of the county child welfare activities to the citizens of the community. In both these urban areas there is a need to work out cooperative relationships with the existing public and private agen - cies which are operating in this field in order that there may be a well-rounded program of services. g. Licensing Activities. The Division is responsible for supervising and licensing the child-caring and child-placing institutions and agencies in the State. Consult Table CW-6 for listing of the private child-caring and child-placing agencies and a report of the number of children under care as of June 30, 1940. A staff member of the Division handles the activities of the Division in this field on a part-time basis. The need for supervision, consultation, and more adequate planning would require the services of a full-time person. During the past year visits have been made to most of the institutions, and a joint meeting of the representatives of child-placing agencies was held in the spring, at which time standards of child care were discussed and mutual problems were shared. 152 </seg>
         <seg id="p153">Responsibility for the inspection and licensing of maternity homes and lying-in hospitals was assigned by the Board of Control to the Division in May 1937. The Division requires inspection of the maternity home or lying-in hospital by| a local physician, and ap - proval of the application for license must be given by the local board of health. The supervisor of medical care policy reviews all reports and applications of the maternity homes and lying-in hospitals and advises the Chief of the Division on matters relating to the granting of licenses. ¦ ; . h. Psychological Services. The Statutes of Nebraska require that State and county or - ganizations shall provide expert mental examinations, and that the Board of Control shall provide expert psychological services for in - mates of State institutions when need is indicated. Through ar - rangements with the University of Nebraska psychometric services are available to the Division and to the county offices by arrange - ment. This resource has been widely used during the past year, and a number pf children have been brought to Lincoln for psycho - metric study as a phase of proper case-work planning and treat - ments. The psychologists of the Department of Educational Tests and Measurements of the University of Nebraska have made several field trips to selected counties and have conducted examinations for a number of children at the request of the county agency. In all instances where such field clinics have been held, the local school officials have participated in the referral of children for examina - tion, in sharing part of the costs of the clinic, and in providing facilities for the examination. As the cost of field clinics are much less than they would be if the individual children were sent to Lin - coln, the county welfare and educational officials have been most eager to use these services. ' ¦ ': Table CW-7 gives a record of the number of psychological ex - aminations given to children during the past fiscal year. A total of 541 examinations were given to 380 individuals. Of this number, 188 examinations were given to 124 children referred by county officials. The balance of the examinations were given to' children referred by State children's institutions and the Crippled Children's Service program. Field clinics were held in Lincoln, Cass, Stanton, and Custer counties. 5. SERVICES TO STATE CHILDREN'S INSTITUTIONS. The Division, by administrative direction of the Board of Control, has responsibility for the supervision of the social services for the State children's institutions. This involves joint planning with the su - perintendents of the State children's institutions for all children com- 153 </seg>
         <seg id="p154">mitted to their care. This action was taken in an effort to carry out the intent of the Legislature when it abolished the former Child Welfare Bureau in 1937 and assigned its work to the Board of Control to tetter effect an integration of the State's services for children. The present integrated child welfare services means a more effective program for the State children's institutions and makes possible better planning and coordination with county agencies which are ultimately responsible for supervision of a child when returned to his own home. The children's institutions with which the Division is working are as follows: Correctional: Boys' Industrial School, Kearney. Girls' Training School, Geneva. Dependent: State Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln. Physically Handicapped: Orthopedic Hospital,l Lincoln. Educational: School for the Deaf, Omaha. School for the Blind, Nebraska City. Mentally Defective: Institution for Feeble Minded,- Beatrice. Maternity Care: Nebraska Industrial Home, 3 Milford. Before any child is admitted to any institution, other than the cor - rectional schools, a complete social study is made by the county agency of the child's residence, and admission of the child to the institution is granted on the basis of the findings. In this manner the children most in need of the services offered by the particular institution may, on a selective basis, receive these services. As a result of this intake policy other plans are frequently made, in cooperation with county officials, for children who will benefit from care in their own community. For all children admitted to institutions the pre-commitment social study is gathered as a basis for planning for that child within the insti - tution. The facilities of the Division are used in planning for the child after he is admitted, and his release from the institution is worked out through joint planning with the superintendent of the institution, the Division, and the local agency in the county to which the child is being returned. The present organization for institutional social services places the major responsibility for child welfare case work within the institution on the personnel of that institution, and outside of the institution on the local welfare agencies. The Division is primarily concerned with the development of adequate standards of care, an effective procedure for relating the State and local services towards the end of rehabilitation of children, and the establishment of satisfactory working relationships beuveen all parties interested in a child who has need for the educational, vocational, and social training which the State children's institutions provide. 'The program of this institution has been integrated with Crippled Children's Services. -The Division works only with the persons under 21 years of age. "The Division works with both the mother and her child. 154 </seg>

         <seg id="p164">SERVICES FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN During the past year the emphasis in the Services for Crippled Children program has been on the improvement of services already established. There were no significant administrative or organizational changes. The only expansion in the services consisted of the employment of a public health nursing consultant, in the establishment of the Crippled Children's Register, and the improvement of statistical reporting. The broadest concept of adequate medical care has been the philosophy underlying the administration of funds appropriated for the care of physically handicapped children. Because this program of the Division has been closely coordinated, and in several respects integrated, with the Orthopedic Hospital, the activities of the two agencies should be reported together. The report of the Orthopedic Hospital's activities is a complete account of the hospital care of children with orthopedic conditions. All children in need of hos - pital care, with the exception of cleft palate and hare lip cases, were hospitalized at the Orthopedic Hospital. The report of the hospital pro - gram is not being duplicated in this report because of the fullness of the report of the Orthopedic Hospital.l 'Consult biennial reports of the Board of Contrel. State funds for the care of physically handicapped children have been considered as a resource to supplement and not supplant existing local facilities. Consistent with the trend in the Nebraska child welfare program, the first objective has been to strengthen and improve local administration and services. To this end group conferences have been conducted for county personnel on three different occasions during" the year. Careful reports on referrals made by local doctors have been sent to each family physician in an effort to help him in every way possible in working with the physically handicapped child. Careful attention has been given to work with county directors in order that they might better understand problems of administration of medical care, cooperation with community agencies and case work when indicated with the child and his family. No child has been admitted to the services for treatment who could be satisfactorily cared for in his own community. Referrals are made principally by local doctors and are made either because the local physi - cian desires consultation on a particular case or feels that the child's condition requires the use of resources not available in his own com - munity. The most outstanding development during the year has been the inauguration of an extensive clinic program. During the preceding fiscal year several clinics were held in the western part of the State on an experimental basis. From the experience gained in these clinics it has been possible to set up a manual of procedure and policies relative to extension or field clinics. A regularly scheduled clinic program has 164 </seg>
         <seg id="p165">been set up in eleven towns in Nebraska. Clinics are held in these places at three-month intervals. The local physicians, individually and through the county medical association, the local hospitals, the Elks lodges, and in | some cases the schools, cooperate with the Division and the county welfare agencies in the conduct of these clinics. The Elks have in all cases furnished free lunches at noon for the children and their parents. This clinic schedule brings a diagnostic service within one hundred miles of every Nebraska child. In keeping with the public health concept of these clinics, every child may have an examination after proper re - ferral. One of the functions of the program is to locate physically handi - capped children. Medical care is arranged either through public funds or through private funds. The clinics serve this purpose as well as making it possible to check up on children who are already under treatment and living in their own homes. Formerly it was necessary for all children to come to Lincoln for out-patient clinic services. At the present time only the children living near Lincoln, or children;who are to receive treatment must come to the Orthopedic Hospital. The clinic staff'consists of an examining orthopedist who is a mem - ber of the Services for Crippled Children staff, a guest pediatrician, a public health nurse who is also a consultant on physical-therapy, and a medical social worker. The public health nurse is responsible for the organization and general direction of the clinic. Local physicians are invited to attend the clinics and do spend much time in the examining rooms. ' The general advisory and technical advisory committees have met several times during the year. These committee meetings have been extremely helpful in effecting coordination of the crippled children's program with other related public and private services and in bringing to the administration 1 of the program the point of view of persons not directly connected with the work. The Medical Technical Advisory Com - mittee has given much expert advice both through committee work and individually. The assistance of these voluntary consultants has been in - valuable. . Table CC-1 presents a picture of the number of crippled children under care during the fiscal year 1939-40. A monthly average of ap - proximately 1,100 children was reported as active cases, and many of these children were receiving medical or social services, or both, from the Services for Crippled Children program and the county welfare agencies. A considerable number of the county welfare agencies reported service on all of their crippled children's cases during the fiscal year. These services included the location of crippled children, social and medical investigations as to their eligibility for service, arranging trans - portation for hospital and clinic visits, and many other types of care and service. . The services extended to physically handicapped children'by the Services for Crippled Children program during the last fiscal year are 165 </seg>
         <seg id="p166">indicated in TabJe CC-2. An average of 150 children per month were receiving: hospital care from the State Orthopedic Hospital and the Im - manue! Hospital;* the greatest number, of course, were in the State Orthopedic Hospital. An average of 247 children per month were seen in the Orthopedic Hospital out-patient clinics, and an average of 375 visits per month were made by these children. The extension clinics which were held throughout the State to reach children in the rural areas examined an average of 53 children a month for the eight months during which these extension clinics were in opera - tion. During the fiscal year an average of 59 children per month were receiving convalescent-home care provided through the Services for Crippled Children program, with the greatest number being in con - valescent homes during the months of July and August, when school was not in session. An average of 83 children per month were furnished with appliances or appliance service through the Services for Crippled Children program. Data is not available for the number of children who received appliances through their own resources or those of the individual counties. •A private hospital in Omaha to which cleft palate and hare lip cases arc referred and paid for from Crippled Children funds. 166 </seg>

         <seg id="p168">PART VII SURPLUS COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION One of the purposes of the Surplus Marketing Administration is to assist in the removal of farm surpluses through direct distribution in such a way that the movement of these foods will not interfere with private business, that is, the normal channels of trade. This is ac - complished through allocations of surplus foods to designated State agencies for distribution to eligible certified relief clients and school lunches. Direct distribution has been used in Nebraska for a number of years. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1940, another method of surplus removal was added in Nebraska, namely, the Food Stamp Plan. This has for its purpose the removal of farm surpluses through the regu - lar channels of trade. Food purchases under the Stamp Plan are made by certified clients using food stamps as a medium of exchange. Nine Nebraska counties adopted this plan during the year and, therefore, the direct food distribution for these counties as shown in the report reflects this situation* and includes only periods as follows: Eight months' food and twelve months' clothing distribution for Lancaster; eleven months' food and twelve months' clothing for Boone, Knox, Madison, Nance, Pierce, Platte, Stanton, and Wayne Counties. Dawson County came into the direct distribution program during the year and the figures as shown in the report cover a period of six months' participation. Pay rolls for the Commodity Distribution Division including both Stamp Plan and Direct Distribution were met principally from WPA funds. At the close of the fiscal period, six persons were on the State pay roll, whereas a monthly average of about 215 WPA workers were em - ployed on these projects during the year and paid by the Work Projects Administration. The following tables give a report of Commodity Distribution ac - tivities in Nebraska during the fiscal year July 1, 1939, to June 30, 1940. •Counties in which the Stamp Plan is operating are not eligible £or Direct Distribution of Surplus Commodities. 168 </seg>

SUMMARY OF CASELOAD, EXPENDITURES AND VALUA - TION OF COMMODITIES DISTRIBUTED. BY COUNTIES. : The fiscal year was characterized by a gradual increase in the num - ber of cases certified and served, a very large expansion of the school lunch program, and the introduction of the Stamp Plan in nine Nebraska counties. : The purchase of foods in Nebraska by the Surplus Marketing Ad - ministration increased greatly over any previous year with a total of 1,738 carloads bought within the fiscal period, a large number of which were shipped to adjacent states. The trade balance in favor of Nebraska processors and growers through this purchasing program was 1,263 car - loads of food for the year. Fumigation of stocks was. curtailed considerably during the year, being necessary in only a few instances. Extensive spraying with in - secticides controlled the situation very well, eliminated the hazards of frequent fumigation and resulted in a substantial saving of funds, as well as the time jof our field personnel. Considerable: progress was made in improving warehousing facili - ties, issuing outlets, and working conditions. Emphasis on this phase of the program is being carried on through the current period with ex - cellent cooperation from the various counties. The scope and size of the distribution program in Nebraska for the next fiscal year, July 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941, will be largely dependent upon the extent of the Food Stamp Plan expansion within the State. At the present time the receipts of surplus foods are unusually heavy and the variety larger than at any time since the program started operation. Indications are that this will continue in the immediate future. General conditions make it inadvisable to attempt to visualize the probable course of the program beyond that point. 173 </seg>
