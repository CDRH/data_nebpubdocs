Henri/ denies, Silas .1. floleotnh, and Euf/ene O. Maifficld. Gentlemen: I have the honor, as well as the privilege, to submit herewith the seventeenth biennial report of the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, covering the period from December 1, 1916, to December 1, 1918. During this period we have made but one change in our official family. Dr. Emma Lawrence resigned and Dr. J. A. Burford was appointed by the Board as assistant superin - tendent and physician. During this period we passed through the greatest crisis the world has ever known and have been confronted by many difficulties. I wish here to thank the Board of Commissioners for its kind consideration at all times and to thank the officers and employees for their loyal support. We have a new building under course of construc - tion at this time. It was the intention of the legislature to have a building costing $40,000 and an addition to our hospi - tal building, which was badly needed, costing $10,000. How - ever, on account of the high cost of material, labor, etc., it was found that the building could not be erected for $40,000. It was, therefore, decided by the Board that the money ap - propriated for the addition to the hospital be used in addition to that appropriated for the new girls' cottage and erect a new cottage for girls. We have endeavored to keep the institution in a good state of repair, having painted the interior of several wards and rooms, and the exterior of the stone cottage, also, re - paired the floors. We have equipped with window strips, the windows and doors in the administration building, boys' cot- </seg>
            <seg id="p004">154 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF tage No. 1, and the girls' brick cottage. The grounds and roads have been continually improved. New tables have been made for part of the dining rooms. A flag pole was erected. A new steam main was laid from the engine room to the girls' stone cottage. New fences have been erected and a new hog house with cement base built with old mater - ial already at hand. A new porch has been erected on the south of the administration building, also, a top to the front porch on the west of the administration building. We have kept everything at least up to standard and improved the condition in many instances where it could be done without too much expense. Regarding our school work there is a great diversity of opinion as to why this can be called a school and whether or not every child committed to us goes to school. We en - deavor at this time to manage the institution in such a way as to have some school work for each child. For the boys we have our occupational pursuits, â€” farming, garden work, work in the greenhouse, laundry, carpenter shop, brush making, shoe making and mattress making; and for the girls, laundry work, sewing, dining room, kitchen and all domestic arts. Besides these, we have a school building which is devoted entirely to special school work. The number of pupils doing grade work is thirty-five, the number in the industrial department is forty-five, the number in the gymnasium is forty, and the number in the music department is twenty-five. The average attendance in all departments is eighty-five. The ages of the school children are from seven to twenty-five. The children in the grade rooms spend two-thirds of their time at reading, writ - ing, arithmetic, spelling, geography and history. Those in the kindergarten department do paper cutting, drawing, and construction work, such as paper weaving and paper fold' ing, and learn to read and write. Those who are able to read use the books from the library and report on them to their teacher, who uses every possible means to encourage the reading of good books. A great deal of time is spent with music, both vocal and instrumental, as the school chil- </seg>
            <seg id="p005">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 155 dren provide the entertainment for the other children at the institution. The orchestra, consisting of nine pieces, re - hearses for one hour four days a week to provide music for the dance held on Monday night, the picture show on Thurs - day night, and for all special occasions, such as Hallowe'en, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. The choir of twenty - five voices leads the singing for the chapel service. The music is rehearsed during school time. Special programs are given at Hallowe'en, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Washington's Birthday, Easter and the closing day of school. These pro - grams consist of singing, folk and aesthetic dancing, and reci - tations, which are very often in the form of a cantata. Private lessons are given in dancing and in vocal and instrumental music for solo work. The work carried en in the gymnasium is drilling and dancing, that is, the children learn the steps of the dances. Aside from this, they play basket ball, captain ball, arch ball, and many bean bag games. Indian clubs and dumb bells are used for drilling and the children are able to give exer - cises to the accompaniment of music. The work of the industrial department consists of art embroidery, crocheting of all kinds, basketry, knitting, hand - loom work, and common sewing stitches. There are forty industrial students this year. Fifteen girls who are not skil - ful in hand work, spend one-half hour each day hemming tea-towels, which are used in the institution. Twenty-five girls have learned to crochet and half of that number em - broider well. About ten girls have been taught to do basket - weaving, but because of the high price of all materials used in basketry, that work has been discontinued for the pres - ent. Five girls, who knit well, were allowed to take part of their time knitting sweaters for the local Red Cross Society. A number of the girls in this department work in the sewing room part of the day, making garments fcr the other chil - dren. The girls also help in the making of the costumes used in the programs given by the school children. The in - dustrial room supplies the institution with all the necessary scarfs, tray cloths, center pieces, pillows, etc. The articles </seg>
            <seg id="p006">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF 156 made during the year are taken, first, to the State Fair and later, to the County Fair, with the school exhibit. The bulk of the articles is sold at these places. The State Library Commission furnishes the books and magazines for the institution. At present the library con - tains over nine hundred and fifty books. Over one hundred and fifty of that number are adult books, one hundred and seventy-five are boys' books, one hundred and fifty are girls' books, one hundred and twenty-five are books concern - ing history and nature study, two hundred are children's books, and one hundred are picture books. In addition to the books, we are furnished the following magazines: Amer - ican Boy, American Magazine, Bird Lore, Country Gentle - man, Garden Magazine, Everybody's, Independent, Ladies' Home Journal, Literary Digest, Modern Priscilla, Needlecraft, Pictorial Review, Popular Mechanics, Primary Education, St. Nicholas, Saturday Evening Post, Woman's Home Com - panion, and Youth's Companion. Every Saturday books are issued to the children who care to read. The average number of books issued during the month is two hundred. Of that number about fifty are read by employees, seventy-five by inmates, who read adult books, thirty-five by those who read children's books, and forty picture books are taken out by those who cannot read. The school children make use of the library in connec - tion with their grade work. About every two weeks, some of the boys who do not go to school spend an evening read - ing in the library. The children realize the value of the books and are careful in using them. They consider it a privilege to be permitted to have access to the library. As stated in my last biennial report, I would again bring to your minds that it is imperative for the state to enter into a building program at this institution, in order to take care of all of this class of unfortunates and have them prop - erly segregated. It is an economical procedure on the part of the state, as it has been well shown that a great number of our crimes are caused by the irresponsibility of the indi - viduals committing them. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 157 It is true that some of the states are taking up exten - sively the matter of social and juvenile research work, Ohio being one of the foremost at this time. They have what they term the bureau of Juvenile Research and its direc - tor, H. H. Goddard, says, "States have wasted untold wealth trying to reform its hardened criminal and to cure the chronic diseases." It is a fact that a very high percentage of the troublesome children of our communities are actually lacking in mentality and most of them are truly feeble - minded, the rest dull and backward. Feeble-mindedness, as you know, becomes a very vital problem to everyone engaged in sociological and reformatory work, and institutions of all kinds, such as our public schools, are becoming more and more interested in this subject and are demanding that they have trained teachers, who are able to sort out those who are the most feeble-minded and see that they are placed in their proper environment and protected from themselves as well as protect society at the same time. I do. not want to be termed a dreamer, but I believe the time is fast approaching when everyone of our progressive schools in the state will have what might be termed an op - portunity room where the children, who are backward and show lack of mentality, may be sought out and specially trained. Then, in turn, when they are found to be truly feeble-minded, they should be committed to an institution for the feeble-minded. It is necessary to have teachers who have had special training along these lines for these special rooms. It must be remembered that our inmates are all irre - sponsible and must be watched and cared for. They must be continually guided from paths of temptation into paths of right living and thought. The feeble-minded, with very few exceptions, are the most contented, the most easily managed, and the happiest persons imaginable. They are easily led in the right path, but also just as easily led in the wrong. They cannot be reformed because they do not have the men - tality to overcome temptation. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">158 THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF Therefore, in summing up, I believe the Nebraska Insti - tution for Feeble-Minded Youth should be one of the socio - logical centers of the state and a large part of the social problems should be worked out from it; that we should carry on a training school for teachers, who desire to have a spe - cial training among these unfortunates, so that they may ac - cept positions in different schools in the state and seek out those who should enter this communal life; and that, in turn, the state should enter into a building program whereby all could be accommodated, who seek admittance here. There should be no stone unturned to protect and guide them and to make their life a happy one, but, at the same time, to see to it that they remain in an institution or that they do not marry and thereby bring into the world other unfortunate children. I believe that, if this program should be carried out, it would lessen the amount of crime and insanity in our state. What greater work can be done at this time than the conservation of our human race? Our dining room at the present time is inadequate as to size, arrangement, and sanitation, for the number of children who are here. Our kitchen is in very bad condition and it is impossible to keep it in proper sanitary condition, although the Board has authorized the improvement of this in every possible way. The rooms which are now used for dining rooms for the children on the lower floor of the administra - tion building are badly needed for offices and employees' quarters. I, therefore, recommend that the legislature be asked to appropriate $65,000 to erect a new two-story build - ing, â€” the lower floor to have a kitchen, bakery, refrigerating and vegetable room, and employees' dining room; the upper floor to be used as a dining room for children. I assume that we will be able to erect one that will seat about six hundred children. Hence, we are building for the future, because I feel that, when the institution has a population of one thousand children, the general dining room should seat six hundred. I would also recommend $10,000 for equipment for this building. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 159 I recommend asking for an appropriation of $15,000 for an addition to the hospital, which was not erected as con - templated. We have approximately three hundred acres of land belonging to this institution. We are leasing forty acres of land from the Beatrice Cemetery Association, making three hundred and forty acres at our command at this time. This includes the ground for campus, etc. We have the help at the institution to work more land and it could be done to the states benefit. There are one hundred and thirty acres directly east of us adjoining the state land, which would be very valuable in connection with the ground here. It is owned by Mr. Thornburg and I have taken the matter up with him. He has given his word verbally that he will sell this to the state for $225 an acre. I, therefore, recommend that the legislature be asked to appropriate $29,250 for the purchase of this tract. The administration building is badly in need of some repairs. It will also be necessary to make some changes on the lower floor so as to equip it for living rooms, offices, etc. Besides, we have several roofs on different cottages that are in need of repairs, and I believe this absolutely necessary to keep the property from deteriorating. 1, there - fore, recommend that the legislature be asked to appropri - ate $15,000 for general repairs about the institution. The greenhouse has been in bad shape for the past few years. It has been repaired from time to time, but the recent storms wrecked the glass and the top, and it is beyond repair, and the only thing to do is to build a new one. Therefore, 1 recommend that the legislature be asked to appropriate $5,000 for a new greenhouse. As to the amount that will be necessary for the engine room and wells, although I recommend that some en - largements and improvement be done, I leave to the good judgment of the Board and the chief engineer. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF ltill Expenditures, general maintenance, April 1, 1917, to Sep- tember 30, 1918, eighteen months $155,462.36 Taking amount of expenditures as basis, we will require 207,283.14 Add 10 per cent as average increase of population during biennium beginning December 1, 1918 20,728.31 $228,011.45 Increase in salaries and wages and for three more employes for manning the new building for biennium 6,700.00 Increase in general repairs under maintenance 10,000.00 $244,710.53 During the biennium our population has enjoyed good health, with the exception that we have suffered from two epidemics. One of variola, which started in July, 1918. We had eighty-nine cases and one death, and that was a low grade boy who had very little resistance. The other epi - demic was the influenza which has affected every part of the country. During this epidemic two hundred and seventy - five suffered from the disease and we had twelve deaths, they being children of low vitality and in nearly every case some chronic trouble with the respiratory organs. I wish again to express my appreciation for the services that have been rendered the state and the loyal support by the officers and employees of the institution, also, to the honorable members of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions for their wise counsel and advice. Respectfully submitted, D. G. Griffiths, Superintendent. Beatrice, Nebraska, November 30, 1918. </seg>
