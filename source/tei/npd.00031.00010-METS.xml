Morehead Governor of Nebraska. rr: — Complying with the law governing the Board of Education hav - control of the Nebraska State Normal Schools, we herewith transmit to you the biennial report and statement of expenditures made by. this Board from January 1, 1913, to December 1, 1914, together with budgets for the next two years.

            <seg id="p005">BIENNIAL REPORT 5 BIENNIAL REPORT To Governor John H. Morehead: In administering the affairs of the institutions under its control the Board of Education has kept constantly in mind the statement of the law that "The exclusive purpose of the normal schools is the training and instruction of persons, both male and female, in the arts of teaching and managing schools, and in the principles and practice of the various branches of learning taught in our public schools." o I The product of the state normal schools enters the service of the te, trained to perform a difficult and a most vital work — that of edu - ing the boys and girls of today to become worthy, industrious, and patriotic citizens of a great commonwealth. It was a realization of the purpose of normal schools that actuated the legislature of 1913 and your - self as governor in levying and approving a tax direct for their mainten - ance instead of the former method of a special appropriation for each school. In its actions during the current biennial period the Board has en - deavored to improve the work of the schools by eliminating unnecessary expense and waste wherever possible, by providing such new buildings and equipment as the needs of the schools demand, and by formulating a policy to meet the future development of these vigorous and growing institutions. ECONOMY By a careful study of the different schools it was found advisable not to maintain classes having fewer than seven students enrolled, to make five recitations daily the minimum work of a faculty member on full pay, and to secure the unification and consolidation of related work into not more than ten standard departments, with only such special departments as are essential to each institution. It was also determined that the teaching force could be reduced without injury to the work and at a saving of about $20,000 for the biennium. By placing more responsibility on the registrar of each institution the principal has been freed from much of the immediate oversight of the physical plant and given more time to devote to the purely educational welfare of the school. Each registrar was bonded in a sum sufficient to protect the funds of the state in his custody at any one time, and with all employees other than members of the faculty he was made more di - rectly responsible to the Executive Committee of the Board. This </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION arrangement has resulted in economy educationally as well as finan - cially. In the matter of bulletins and other printing a considerable saving has been effected by contracting for a year at a time. An important saving will also be made by reducing the number of copies printed of the biennial report to three hundred fifty. Of the last report more than six hundred copies were left over and had to be destroyed to save storage room. The watchword of the Board is economy without injury to ef - ficiency or quality of service. BUILDINGS In the erection of new buildings the Board has followed a compre - hensive plan of taking care of the schools in the order of their most urgent needs. The first to receive attention was Chadron which has been furnished a modern fireproof dormitory. This building cost $27, - 257.00 and was occupied at the beginning of the present semester. A fireproof wing on the west of the main building, costing in all $27,569.00. is nearing completion and will be occupied at the beginning of the second semester. These buildings ought to provide for the state's youngest normal school until each of the other schools has received due attention. At Wayne a new and modern building had been provided by the legislature of 1911, but it was no sooner completed than it was filled and more room demanded to accommodate the increased attendance at this school. A modern administration building and auditorium, to cost E 282.00, is now being erected and when finished will supply the urgent ands of the immediate present. The work of the Peru normal school has been crippled for years because of poor facilities for the training school — that part of a teachers' school that distinguishes it from all other schools. At first it was thought nothing could be done at Peru out of the present appropriation, but by rigid economy in maintenance of all the schools and by good fortune in the matter of contracts at Chadron and Wayne, sufficient funds were available for the Peru training school. Work on this build - ing has begun and its cost will be $83,598.00 on the general contract. PLANS The school at Kearney has outgrown its present auditorium and it haa no facilities for physical education and manual training, or prac - tically none. It is the purpose of the Board to add to the main build - ing a wing to the rear according to original designs to serve as an au - ditorium. It should be large enough not only for present needs but also for a reasonable growth in the future. Provision must also be made for the proper housing of the work in manual training and for a suitable gymnasium. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">At Chadron also a gymnasium for physical training must be pro - vided. As the school grows it will require an increase in room and it will need a better training school equipment. However, one of fa urgent needs at present is a model rural school building for training teachers who go out into the one and two room schools in this part of FINDS The legislature of 1913, by adopting a definite and rational pla was necessary to increase the Kearney appropriation to $150,000, maV ing a total of $500,000 for the four schools and leaving a bahn $221,107.00 as a fund for building purposes and general expenditure The actual expenditures from each of these five funds is shown ir the financial statement of the Board of .Education and in the statement of each of the schools, all of which are herewith submitted and form j part of this biennial report. Nebraska. The campus at Wayne is small and there is no field for out door athletics and in fact no provision for indoor physical education. The old administration building will require considerable outlay to remodel it for training school purposes, and the question of an alequate supply must be met as soon as funds are available. Removing the training school at Peru to the new building finished will release the room now occupied, and this should be utilized for industrial purposes. But to install in it the departments of home economics and manual training will require remodeling, changing | tions, concrete floors, and other changes. The present available for agriculture makes it impossible to develop this work to the extent found in many first class high schools, to say nothing of trainint dents to teach this important subject. the support of the state normal schools, not only fixed responsibility for their proper maintenance on the Boai d but also made it possible for the Board to formulate and put into effect a fixed policy looking toward their future growth and their harmonious development. That th. sponsibility has been realized is evident from the unanimous action of the Board in all matters of finance, from assigning each school its amount for maintenance at the beginning of the biennium to the letting of the recent contract at Peru. The amount of the normal fund appropriated as certified by the office of the auditor of public accounts is as follou 1913 — 85/100 of 1 mill |4M,MfcM- :•&lt;&gt; per cent appropriated, $360 I 1914—85/100 of 1 mill $401,143.85 — 90 per cent appropriated. |361,l Total tax available for all purpose? *721.: Because of unexpected repairs on heating plant, dormitory, etc.. i! </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ESTIMATES r There will be an increase in the operation expenditures for the com - biennium. due to enlarged physical plants and to increased attend - ance at each school. It is estimated by the Board that $540,000 will be required for maintenance and $185,000 for necessary improvements during the next two years. The present levy of 85/100 of 1 mill should therefore not be changed.

            <seg id="p013">CHADRON STATE NORMAL SCHOOL 13 CHADRON STATE NORMAL SCHOOL CHADRON. NEBRASKA Joseph Sparks, President Chadron, Nebraska, January 1, 1915. To the Honorable Board of Education of the State Normal Schools: Gentlemen: I am pleased to submit a report upon the progress and condition of the State Normal School, Chadron, Nebraska, for the bien - nium 1913-15, with some suggestions as to the probable needs of the school 1915-17. NEW BUILDINGS The new dormitory for girls is a great acquisition to the school. It was seriously needed. It will house fifty young women, and gives them a pleasant home at much less expense than was possible before its con - struction, and, most important of all, the young women are under the di - rect care of the school. I The new extension to the main building is now completed, and will occupied at the opening of the school. January 5, 1915. This will afford iously needed relief. Our classes were cramped for quarters and we had not adequate laboratory facilities. Also, it was necessary to use the hallways for recitation purposes. The new building has eight class rooms of adequate size and an assembly room. All of these will be used at once. We will be able to start manual training and domestic science for the model school, though the quarters available for this work will still be scant. ATTENDANCE The attendance has shown a gratifying and steady increase. This year's senior class numbers twenty-four, with an excellent enrollment in all of the lower classes. Great care has been exercised in giving to the model school the best opportunities possible. It will be desirable to give to this department of the school work additional equipment during the next two years. This additional equipment should consist of a playground with inexpensive Eipment, and also there should be added a room or building suitable for typifying of rural school work. ■ work in agriculture heretofore possible should be increased, lly all of the schools to be served by Chadron are rural schools, vities of the people are almost solely agricultural and grazing. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION The normal school will devote its energies toward serving the interests of its constituency. PHYSICAL EDUCATION Facilities should be afforded at the school for physical education. At the present time, the Y. M. C. A. gymnasium is under the control of the normal school through rental. This gymnasium is nearly a mile from the normal school. Its usefulness is therefore restricted very much. Gym - nasium facilities should be afforded on the normal school grounds. FACULTY The faculty is thoroughly competent and is working in reasonable harmony and producing excellent results. Some additions to the faculty will be needed in the coming biennium. The enrollment for the year 1913 - 14 was 323. Deducting model school teachers and omitting the president and his assistant in office there are eleven teachers, making thirty-two enrolled for each teacher engaged in direct instruction. This includes one laboratory assistant as a teacher, but of course, excludes the librarian and others who do not teach any classes. We will be able to maintain practically the same ratio between number of faculty members and num - ber of students attending. A reasonable estimate for increase in the num - ber of pupils is thirty a year. The faculty will need to be increased to take care of the increase in attendance, as demand arises.

            <seg id="p032">32 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION PURPOSE OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL tThe state normal school was established for the express purpose of ling teachers for all lines of work in the public schools. It is the public institution established for that purpose exclusively. It is mque in that every dollar expended for its support, every effort put forth in management and instruction has for its aim the better preparation of teachers to go into the various specialized lines of public school teach - ing. Thus the liberal taxpayer receives direct benefit for every dollar ex - pended in this line, in form of an improved, intelligent, industrious citizen - ship in every community that recognizes and employs the properly pre - pared, carefully trained teacher. While college work is required of the state normal school of today it is very different from the work of the liberal arts college. There the student goes to acquire knowledge and discipline for self culture and general self efficiency. The student goes to the college class in the state normal for three things: First, to acquire knowledge and discipline. Second, to acquire a knowledge of child mind and skill in the educative process. It is sup - posed that every person employed in a teachers' school should be selected because of his exceptional power and clear cut example as a teacher. Third, to receive that training in leadership and in character-forming that is to be the main work if the product of our public schools is to stand the test to be given by the advanced standards of the 20th cen - tury. Again, every professor or teacher employed in a teachers' school should be selected because of his high standard of unquestionable char - acter, exemplary habits, and a deep devotion to an everlasting efficient service to others, especially to young people. It is readily seen that a teachers' college can never be simply a liberal arts college and still hold to the broadest purpose for which it was established. While it is essential that the teachers' school must do college work, it must do it with this broader purpose constantly in view. Being a technical school it must be true to its assigned line of work. While it is essential that we encourage attendance at these schools as we are training too small per cent of the public school teachers of the state and a large per cent of teachers of the state wholly lack any spe - cial training, yet there should be more careful sifting, resulting in train - ing only those who give fair promise of making successful teachers in the school-room. Quality rather than numbers should be one aim of the SPECIALIZATION LThis is a time of a high degree of specialization in all lines of human vity. Along no lines is this more needed than in lines of teaching. Public schools are demanding this and teacher schools must continue </seg>

This want may be largely met by the erection of the proposed auditorium and gymnasium buildings. pose DORMITORY LIFE FOR STl'DEXTS There is accommodation in the one dormitory for about eighty youn tmen who receive excellent care for the nominal rate of 35 cents to cents a week. Conditions here are excellent. Young women receive careful attention, hours of study and of recreation so planned that the physical energy as well as the mental is looked after, and each girl has a desirable social life. It would be for the best interest of the s </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION and especially for the students if it were possible to have more dormi - tory accommodation for young women, and a dormitory for young men also would be desirable. Such would be highly appreciated by patrons of the school and render efficient service to the state. The boarding department under the present management of Mr. and Mrs. John Saunders, is very satisfactory. The meals are excellent as to quantity, quality, variety, and manner of preparation and serv - ing. It is due to the most careful and wise selection and purchasing of material, and strict economy that it is possible to render such service at the very reasonable charge of two and a half dollars per week. Thus it is possible for $103 to $117 to cover the entire expense of board and room for one school year. THE PROBLEM OF SECURING A FACULTY The requirements demanded of a person who would successfully teach in a teachers' school, where so much stress is placed upon the future teaching efficiency of those taught in addition to accuracy in scholarship, are certainly more than those made of the ordinary teacher in any other school or college. Such qualifications are rare indeed. Ac - curate and extended scholarship, teaching ability, natural culture, heart power, dignified, inspiring, sympathetic personality, and a noblent - a strong, exemplary character, successful experience, all combined in one person is worth more than is usually paid to members of a faculty of a teachers' school. It costs money and untiring effort to make proper preparation for this work by the one who has the essential natur - al qualifications and a continual expenditure to keep up with the advance - ment in all lines of this particular line of work. Salaries commensurate with these rare qualities and high demands should be paid. This would mean an increase in present compensation. If it were possible perhaps a plan to pay each person in proportion to his or her value to the school would be a just and businesslike way of determining salaries. Length of service should not be the only qualification to be considered. May it be hoped that a fair remuneration shall be the portion of the faithful ef - ficient and growing teachers of this institution. A QUESTION As to entrance requirements, is it not made too difficult for young people to enter the state normal school ? Would it not be better to admit to secondary work any person looking forward to the work of teaching, since all lines of secondary work are now offered in training schools or in normal classes, apart from college work? Is it not a faUe idea to consider the state normal school in any way a rival in competi - tion to any other public school of this state? Would it not be better to give every possible opportunity for the state normal school to serve to her limit every public school interest of this commonwealth? </seg>

The following let - ter was sent out to county superintendents, principals and superintend - ents of graded schools of this part of the state early in the fall: 'My ilear Superintendent: I write to explain our plan of Study Center Work, trusting that it may be of interest to county superintendents of this section of Nebraska. Pany time and place convenient of access to us, where ten or more teachers will meet and agree upon a subject or subjects, a mem - members of the faculty of the Kearney State Normal School will meet with them, plan the work, and give all possible assistance. After sufficient study, examinations will be given and due credit allowed on courses in this school. The faculty of the Kearney State Normal offers service in this way. hoping to greatly extend the sphere of usefulness of this institution founded especially to serve the teachers in all phases of public school work. There is no charge for this service, but it will b? eted if your county finds it possible to defray the nece penses of the faculty member, if this work is undertake chers. By we hear from you on this subject, or upon any topic that may I in serving your teach&gt; Most cordially your GEORGE S. DICK. President P result, much interest has been expressed and .seven Stud\ are organized and at work, with a total membership of about one red persons not enrolled in school at this time. This effort to - people at work and those not able to attend school at present is certainly a legitimate line of work for a teachers' school. The expense so far has been met mainly by localities served, a very little being paid tthe institution. So far this work has been done and is being done by few members of the faculty, mainly on Saturdays, in addition to their gular work in the school. There is a marked willingness on the part of each member of the faculty to serve in this way when called upon. It would seem that there is a future for this line of service, which will be continued and increased in its efficiency. THE NEW Al DITORICM AND THE NEW GYMNASIUM EFhe proposed auditorium and gymnasium will be of untold value to work. If carefully and wisely planned they will provide needed for manual training, domestic economy, and extra rooms for other itial work of the growing, efficient teachers' school. </seg>

            <seg id="p063">PERU STATE NORMAL SCH&lt; 63 PERU STATE NORMAL SCHOOL Peru, Nebraska, December 31, 1914. To the Nebraska State Board of Education: Gentlemen: I am pleased to submit herewith the biennial report nf the Peru State Normal School, which includes a detailed statement of the receipts and expenditures for the biennium up to December SI, together with an estimate of the funds needed for the next biennium. Peru with her sister normals rejoices over the present status of the Nebraska State Normal Schools; ll) because of the present metho. handling 1 the normal school budgets. The levying 85-100 of a mill tax which was inaugurated by the state legislature? in 1913 for their sup - port has proved to be a long stride in advance of the old methix procedure in securing necessary appropriations. The method of hand - ling these funds by the State Board of Education has proven most isfactory to all of the schools and particularly to the peoDle of the whom the schools are designed to serve. (2) Because of the prevalent feeling of good will, good fellowship and the spirit of mutual helpfulness of all of them. (S) Because of the high standards of character and scholarship demanded by the State Board of Education of those who would be certificated through the state normals to teach Nebraska's boys and girls. i4&gt; Because of the Board's attitude not only in permit - ting, but in urging, a further extension of the normal schools' influ - ence to reach the better training of rural teachers. This is just, not only because rural people contribute more than three-fourths of the funds which maintain the normal schools, but because Nebraska is distinctly a rural state and her people largely agriculturalists. (5) Be - cause it is the policy of the Board to recognize the needs of the miim rather than the select few. This recognition is indicated by the variety of courses that have been adopted from time to time for the benefit of the varied educational interests of the state. This recognition finds ex - pression in supervisory courses offered in Manual Training, Domestic Science, Commerce, Public School Art, Public School Music, Physical Training, including Playground Supervision and Expression. In many respects the closing biennium has been the best two years in Peru's history. The work is characterized by a harmonious faculty, each working not only toward the development of his own particular department but for that larger development of all the interests of the PERU. NEBRASKA D. W Hayes. President </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION school. The student body is made up of young men and women of pur - pose and high ideals, those who value character higher even than schol - astic ability, yet who are second to none in their efforts toward intel - lectual and social growth. GROWTH IN PERI Eie past half dozen years in Nebraska have witnessed a greater ac - y in the establishment and advancement of agencies toward teach - -aining than any other period in Nebraska's history. State normal schools have been established at Chadron and Wayne, the teachers' col - lege of the University of Nebraska has been more active than in any for- mer period, while a score of private and denominational schools and col - leges have introduced courses having in view the preparation of teach - ers for Nebraska public schools. More than a hundred high schools have put in departments of teacher-training for the purpose of furn - ishing rural school teachers. Notwithstanding the establishment and the growth of all these agencies. Peru will graduate a larger number of students this biennium than in any other equal period in the his - tory of the school; in fact more in these two years alone than during all the first thirty-two years of its history. In the face of all agencies that are engaged in training teachers, the total annual list of grad - uates is inadequate to meet more than one-fourth of the yearly demand. The accompanying table of figures recently compiled at the registrar's office speaks unmistakably of past achievements as shown by the re - sults accomplished; it shows the present high standing of the school and augurs for greater achievement in the future. Year Grad luates Year Graduates 1867 0 1883 « 1868 0 1884 ■ 1869 0 1885 " 1870 2 1886 • 1871 I 1887 " 1872 2 1888 « 1873 0 1889 ■ 1874 1 1890 1875 -I 1891 ... 1876 . 8 1892. • 1877 . 9 189:? 1878 ■ 7 1894.. 1879 .17 189.". ' 1880 7 1896 </seg>
            <seg id="p065">PERU STATE NORMAL SCHOOL 65 This shows a grand total of 2291. Nor does the number of graduates alone measure the extent of service rendered by Peru. More than twenty - six thousand different students have been enrolled since 1867. Peru is glad to feel, however, that her greatness does not consist alone in bigness, but rather in the quality of her "finished product, evidences of which are found in the hundreds of letters annually received from superin - tendents and boards of education in every part of the state expressing satisfaction with the Peru teachers employed in their schools. The fol - lowing is a table of the enrollment during the past four years. This list includes all students of the state normal school exclusive of the grades in the training school: Summer School Regular Year Total for Yr. Net for Yr To understand the meaning of the figures it is necessary to remem - ber that the personnel of the student body has very largely changed in the pas* two years. At the beginning of that period the major part of the enrollment consisted of preparatory and under-collegiate students, while today an overwhelming majority of the students are of colleg - iate rank. Thus, the large number of schools of secondary rank in the state that are now training teachers for the elementary schools has caused a falling off in the attendance of secondary students which is more thnr counterbalanced by the increased enrollment of students of collegiate rank. KThe following table will indicate that there are very few state nor - al schools in the United States that can show a greater number of students enrolled compared with the number of faculty members em - ployed; in fact the average standard is fifteen pupils for each fa 1907 900 29 901 50 1909 902 ....

            <seg id="p100">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 100 WAYNE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL WAYNE, NEBRASKA Wayne, Nebraska, December 1, 1914. To the State Board of Education of Normal Schools: Gentlemen: I am pleased to submit herewith the biennial report of the Wayne State Normal School. Improvements in the school dur - ing the past biennium have been very gratifying. There has been a substantial growth in the enrollment and each year shows a large in - crease in our advanced classes. The transition from the conditions of the old school to the needs of a state normal is not so readily made as might be expected. For twenty years the Nebraska Normal Col - lege was establishing its reputation as a school where young men and young women who had missed their opportunity for a high school education could attend, and its enrollment was made up largely of this class of students. Most graduates of neighboring high schools attended other schools and colleges where longer courses were given. The school year of the Nebraka Normal College was divided into terms of eight weeks each and a large percentage of the students was accustomed to attend one or more terms instead of the entire year. Much effort has been necessary to preserve the best features of the old school and to es - tablish a proper understanding of the aims and purposes of the State Normal School. The first year of the school there were but three completing the advanced course; the second year there were twenty-three; the third year thirty-three; the fourth year, forty-six; and the present year there will be about fifty-five. The annual enrollment exclusive of the training school has increased from a little over five hundred to more than seven EQUIPMENT PHhe new administration building is now nearing completion. This ing, with the Science Hall which was completed three years ago. afford most excellent quarters for all departments of the school with the exception of manual training, physical training and the train - ing school. In the selection of apparatus and furniture the policy has been to purchase nothing but the most substantial. I have felt it a matter of economy in many instances to do without certain kinds of U. S. Conn, President </seg>
            <seg id="p101">WAYNE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL 101 equipment rather than buy something cheap which would be unsat - isfactory and have to be replaced in a short time. FACULTY The faculty has been efficient and progressive and has co-operated in every way toward making the school a success. Each one was select - ed because of his successful experience and special fitness for the work he has to do. More than half of the faculty have been superintendents of county or city schools, or have occupied supervisory positions. Each of the other members has occupied responsible positions in public school work, and nearly every member of the training school corps has taken a year or more of special study on a leave of absence since his connection with the school. All of these things contribute in a very marked de - gree toward the efficiency of the faculty as worthy trainers and direc - tors for young: men and young women preparing to teach. EXTENSION OF CAMPUS The grounds consist of but ten acres. These should be extended very materially before it becomes burdensome on account of the advance in the price of property. The extension should be at least half a block east and half a block west of the present boundaries. This addition, together with the present campus, would make about twenty acres. We should also look forward to the time when an additional tract of land can be obtained for demonstration work in agriculture and horticul - ture. This is an agricultural state and every teacher should be in sym - pathy with the chief business of our commonwealth. The practical phases of agriculture cannot be more effectively taught than by a small demonstration farm. This should be in charge of a farmer who will do the work under direction of the head of the department. WATER SUPPLY The water supply has been unsatisfactory. The pressure has been so slight that the service has been practically worthless at times. The city of Wayne, however, is planning to install a much higher tank and tower and when this is done the pressure will be ample. The greatest objection to the city water is that it contains some clay and other min - eral ingredients, making it impossible to use it for our heating plant. As a result we have to take all of the water for this purpose from our own well which is free from these objectionable features. Under the circumstances it would be a matter of economy to install our own in - dependent water system. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">102 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS Gymnasium Physical training is now recognized as being quite as important as mental training. Teachers should not only have physical training for their own good, but they should know how to direct it in their own schools. We have been unable to give our students this very important part of a teacher's equipment because we have no facilities for so doing. A thoroughly modern and well-equipped gymnasium is one of our most urgent needs, and I hope a way may be found to meet this need during the ensuing biennium. Training School EThe old auditorium, which will be vacated as soon as the new ad - stration building is completed, should be remodeled for a training ol. In order to make it modern and properly suited for this purpose a general re-arrangement of its interior walls should be made and a substantial addition added to it. Manual Training The manual training department has greatly outgrown its quarters. It is now located in the basement of one of the dormitories. The room is poorly lighted and the constant confusion and noise arising from the manual training shop make it a source of annoyance to those who room in the hall. The temporary roof on the power house will have to be replaced soon by a new one. By a comparatively small outlay a second story could be placed over the power house and this would furnish ideal quarters for the manual training department.
