         <seg id="p003">Effect of Organic Matter Decomposition on the Solubility and Fixation of Phosphorus in Alkaline Soils H.F. RHOADESI Department of Agronomy Remarkable increases in yields of crops have been obtained by the application of treble superphosphate to many soils in the irrigated section of western Nebraska. These increases have been obtained for the most part on calcareous soils that are high in total phosphorus but low in soluble phosphorus. The supply, of available nitrogen is low in these soils and consequently it has been necessary to plow under legumes for green manure and to apply all the manure obtainable. The fact that good yields of crops have been obtained by such applications to soils known to be deficient in soluble phosphorus suggests that the soluble phos - phorus supply may also have been increased by manure and green manure. Such an increase maybe due to phosphorus liberated from the organic materials or to the solvent action on the native soil phosphorus of acids resulting from the decomposition of organic matter. It is the purpose of this bulletin to report a laboratory study on the effects of organic matter decomposition on the solubility and fixation of phosphorus in alkaline soils. The study included the following: (1) a comparison of the effects of a decomposing organic material with those of a physiologically acid nitrogen fertilizer, and (2) a comparison of the effects of different organic materials of varying: phosphorus contents. REVIEW OF LITERATURE It has been generally observed that the application of manure to irrigated alkaline soils has greatly increased crop yields. This was at first attributed to an addition of readily available nitrogen in the manure. However, it has been pointed out by Das (10), Hibbard (17), and Pittman (27) that applications of manure actually increased the soluble, phosphorus in such soils. 7/ - ¦';• :; ¦ : : '•¦'¦ ¦¦' !;¦'¦..• ¦' .'¦: "¦ : ¦'¦": ¦ ¦ Several investigators (5, 8, 16, 23) have reported that the addition of crop residues and green manures increased the supply of available phos - phorus in soils. It has also been shown that the important organic phos - phorus compounds found in such: materials are readily made available (2,-23, 29). Spencer and Stewart (33) studied the penetration of soluble organic and inorganic compounds in calcareous soils and found a high fixation with little penetration for the inorganic compounds but a very low fixation and a high penetration for the organic compounds. Chapman (8) found that on calcareous soils the availability of phos - phorus to Sudan grass was increased by the use of physiologically acid nitrogen fertilizer such as urea and ammonium sulfate. Other investigators 1 The writer wishes to express his appreciation to Professor I. C. Russel. for his suggestions and erhlciimt and to Mr. Hubert AUaway for assistance with the analytical part of the study. </seg>

It is generally considered that the native phosphorus in alkaline soils occurs as some form of calcium phosphate. Gemtnerling (14) concluded (hat the native phosphorus in chernozem soils is tri-calcium phosphate. In calcareous soils the native phosphorus may he a carbonato-apatite (7, 22) or a hydroxy-apatite (4). McGeorge and Breazeale (22) reported that native phosphorus is most insoluble in soils with a pH of 8.0 to 8.5. The pH of the soil may not only affect the solubility of the native soil phosphorus but above a pH of 7.0 the phosphorus may occur in a form that is difficult for plants to absorb ((&gt;). A study (19) of crop responses to phosphate fertilizer on a large number of calcareous soils in Colorado showed no definite relation between pH of soil and crop response. Scarseih (30) showed that the addition of calcium to an acid clay in - creased phosphate adsorption. With additions of calcium above the saturation capacity a precipitation of calcium phosphate occurred. In the presence of excess calcium carbonate all of the phosphorus was made in - soluble. A number of other investigators (I, 3, 11, 12, 24, 26, 34, 35) have reported that the addition of soluble calcium salts and calcium carbonate caused a precipitation of the soluble phosphates. Soils with a high clay content arc known to fix soluble phosphates to ;i much greater extent than sandy soils. Scarseth and Tidmore (31) found it necessary to apply 2,000 pounds of 16 per cent superphosphate per acre to obtain satisfactory yields on a calcareous Black Belt soil which had a colloid content of 50 per cent. They recommended that phosphates be in a pellet form to prevent such rapid fixation. Other investigators (18, 20, 33) consider the method of phosphate placement to be extremely im - portant in calcareous soils because of the rapid fixation in such soils. These studies suggest that organic matter will influence the solubility and fixation of phosphorus in alkaline soils and that its influence will be greatly affected by such soil factors as pH, calcium-carbonate content, clay content, and calcium-ion concentration of the soil solution. DESCRIPTION OF SOILS The soils used in this investigation were bulk samples taken to a depth ol six inches from the unphosphated portions of four cultivated fields in the North Platte valley of Scotts Bluff county, Nebraska. The descriptions are as follows: Soil I — Minatare silt loam. —This soil is a first-bottom soil of generally poor internal and surface drainage. At a depth of eight to ten inches it has a layer about four inches thick of heavier texture, puddled structure, and a cheesy consistency. This layer greatly interferes with the pene - tration of irrigation water. The water table is encountered at a depth of .ibout three and one-half feet. The soil is highly calcareous throughout its profile and the soluble salt content is so high in local areas as to prevent growth of crops. At the time of sampling, this soil was in sugar beets. </seg>
         <seg id="p005">Phosphorus in Alkaline Soils The application of phosphate fertilizer increased the yield about 400 Der cent that season. r : Soil 2—Mitchell silt loam.— This soil occurs on a high bench and is developed from materials washed down from higher areas. It is a uni - form, light-brown, mealy silt loam to a depth of 36 inches. It contains a moderate amount of calcium carbonate and a rather high content of soluble salts. This soil when sampled was in alfalfa, which showed a very great response to phosphate fertilizer. Soil 3—Mitchell very fine sandy loam.— This soil is a grayish brown very fine sandy loam to a depth of 36 inches. It contains only a slight amount of carbonates in the surface and the soluble salt content is low. The field was in alfalfa and was very productive without the use of phos - phate fertilizer. ¦•-' So/7 4—Tripp very fine sandy loam.— This soil is found on well-drained bench land. The surface soil to a depth of nine inches is a mealy brown very fine sandy loam moderately supplied with organic matter. Between 9 and 27 inches there is no change in texture but the color is considerably lighter. There is no carbonate present to a depth of 36 inches. The field was in beans and was very productive without the use of phosphate fertilizer. .

Finely ground sugar beet tops, including parts of the crown customarily removed in topping beets, were used for the organic material. Urea was used for the physiologically acid nitrogen fertilizer. The urea and sugar beet tops were applied in amounts to give 700 parts of nitrogen per million of soil In addition, the sugar beet tops supplied P 2 O 5 to the extent of 120 parts per million of soil. These treatments were given the four soils with and without application of treble superphosphate at the rate of 500 ppm of soluble P s O t .:, The treatments in Series 2 were designed to compare the effects of the decomposition of different organic materials containing varying quan - tities of phosphorus. The treatments included wheat straw, potato tops </seg>

These were added to Soils 1 and 4 at a rate of 15 tons of dry matter in two million pounds of soil. This amount was considered to be equivalent in dry weight to a 50-ton application of. ordinary moist barn - yard manure. In addition urea and ammonium sulfate were applied to these- soils at a rate of 350 parts of nitrogen per million of soil. Method of Incorporation and Incubation Water was added slowly to the bulk sample of sieved air-dry soil until .1 moisture content somewhat below moisture equivalent was obtained. Two portions, each containing 1500 grams of oven-dry soil, were weighed out lor each treatment. The treatments were thoroughly mixed with the samples and additional water was added to give each soil its moisture - equivalent wetness. The samples were then placed in two-quart Mason jars and compacted to a volume weight of 1.0. They were then incubated :it 25 C. in a constant-temperature room for varying periods up to 22 weeks, water being added frequently to keep the soils at moisture-equivalent wetness. A quantity equivalent to approximately 250 grams of oven - dry soil was removed at each sampling period from one jar of each treat - ment. The duplicate jars were sampled alternately. After each sampling all the samples were thoroughly mixed and compacted again to a volume weight ot 1.0. Analytical Methods In Series 1, soluble phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, and pH determinations were made at two-week intervals for 10 weeks and at foui-week intervals for an additional 12 weeks. Similar determinations were made in Series 2 by two-week intervals for H weeks. The phosphorus and calcium con - tents of the displaced soil solutions were determined after 8 and 22 weeks of incubation in Series 1 and after 8 and 14 weeks in Series 2. Nitrate nitrogen at each sampling period was determined immediately on a portion of the fresh sample by the phenoldisulphonic acid method. The pH determinations were made on air-dried portions by a colori - metric method developed by J. C. Kussel and reported in detail by Green - await (15). Soluble phosphorus was determined by leaching a mixture of air-dried sample equivalent to 80 grams of soil and 80 grams of washed quartz sand with two liters of a solution buffered to the initial pH of the soil (28). The solution was 0.01 normal to sodium carbonate and potassium chloride, with sufficient boric acid to give the desired pH. It was necessary to add potassium chloride to obtain clear percolates from Soil 1. The sand was added to facilitate percolation of the same soil. The apparatus used for the percolation, the method of packing the soil, and the colorimetric pro - cedure used for determining the phosphorus contents of the percolates were reported by Rhoades and Russel (28). The siphons were made of capillary tubing with tips constricted and adjusted to drop 120 cc. per hour. The percolates were obtained in two 250-cc. portions and three 500-cc. portions and analyzed separately. </seg>
         <seg id="p007">Phosphorus in Alkaline Soils _¦ The soil solution was displaced by a method described by Rhoades and Russel (28) except that 400-gram samples were used instead of 1,000-gram samples. The phosphorus content of the soil solution was determined by the method reported above. Calcium was determined on the displaced soil solution by the soap titration method of Schreiner and Failyer (32). with the following modifica - tions. Sodium oleate solution of a concentration approximately equivalent to 1 mg. of calcium in 6 cc. was prepared. A standard calcium sulfate .solution equivalent to 1 mg. in 5 cc. was also.prepared. The soap solution . was then standardized with's-, 10-, and 15-cc. portions of the standard calcium sulfate solution; The results were graphed and this graph was used for reading the milligrams of calcium in the unknown solution. A brief description of the procedure for determining the calcium content of an unknown solution is as follows: Measure a quantity of unknown solution into a stoppered bottle and dilute to approximately 50 cc. Add 6 cc. of alkaline tartrate solution and mix. Then add sodium oleate solution about 1 cc. at a time from a burette, shaking with each addition, until near the end point. Now add the soap solution by 0.2-cc. portions until the characteristic foam is obtained. The end point is better recognized as a foam that persists for about one minute after the bottle has been given one or two violent flips with the wrist, than as a foam that persists after violent shaking. If the titration requires more than 12 cc. or less than 6 cc. of soap solution, repeat the procedure with smaller or larger amounts of the unknown solution. .'¦''-¦¦'¦'"..] EFFECTS OF THE DECOMPOSITION OF UREA AND SUGAR BEET TOPS—SERIES I Nitrate nitrogen was determined at each incubation period to indicate the degree of decomposition of urea and sugar beet tops. Maximum nitrification of urea was obtained at four, six, eight, and fourteen weeks in Soils 1 to 4 respectively. Maximum nitrification of sugar beet tops oc - curred at the fourteenth-week incubation period in all the soils. Much less of the total nitrogen added was recovered as nitrates from the decomposi - tion of sugar beet tops than from the decomposition of urea. However, nitrate production alone is not an adequate measure of the completeness of decomposition of the sugar beet tops. -'.. • The decomposition of sugar beet tops had no appreciable effect on the pH at any stage of incubation. Urea lowered the pH of all the soils. The maximum reductions in pH were as follows: Soil 1, 8.4 to 7.5; Soil 2, 7.8 to 7.2; Soil 3, 8.0 to 6.5; and Soil 4, 7.4 to 5.0. Phosphate applications had no effect on the pH of Soil 1 but they did lower the pH of the other soils slightly. . ¦ ! • Soluble Phosphorus Table 1 shows the amounts of P 2 O 5 removed in two liters of percolate at different stages of incubation.

With the phosphated samples, urea decidedly accelerated the normal course of fixation. After two weeks' incubation with urea the recoveries of the added phosphate, as measured by two liters of percolate, were ap - proximately 2S. 40, 30, and 44 per cent for Soils 1 to 4 respectively. At the same period, the recoveries without urea were 47, 59, 67, and 61 per cent respectively. After 22 weeks the differences were less. With urea the recoveries in two liters of percolate were 11, 22, 16, and 30 per cent while without urea the recoveries were 14, 32, 20, and 39 per cent respectively for Soils 1 to 4. The recoveries of the added phosphate re - moved in 10 liters of solution were approximately 41, 51, 38, and 51 per cent respectively lor Soils 1 to 4 treated with urea, compared to recoveries of 45. 63, 44, and 58 per cent for the samples without urea. When sugar beet tops were decomposed in the unphosphated soils there were decided increases in soluble phosphorus. The increases were generally progressive with the period of incubation. Assuming that these increases resulted from the phosphorus released by the decomposing sugar beet tops, the recoveries ot the applied phosphorus removed in two liters ot solution after 22 weeks' incubation were approximately' 8, 14, 23, and 21 per cent respectively for Soils 1 to 4. However, after leaching with 10 liters of solution the recoveries were approximately the same for the four soils. The amounts of P. 0.-, removed in 10 liters of solution were in - creased by 32.64, 34.82, 44.19, and 31.21 ppm. respectively for Soils 1 to 4. A study of the data in Table 2 shows that the removal of phosphorus from Soil 1 was much more gradual than for the other three soils. </seg>

Urea had no appreciable effect on the P 2 O 5 content of the soil solution displaced from the unphosphated samples of Soils 1 to 3 but depressed the P.Ob content of the solutions displaced from the unphosphated samples of the same soils. However, with Soil 4 the urea increased the P 2 O S con - tent of the displaced solution for both the phosphated and unphosphated samples. : ; . Sugar beet tops increased the PoO r , content of the solution displaced from the unphosphated samples of all the soils. With the phosphated samples treated with sugar beet tops, the concentrations were in every case less than those obtained jfrom the samples receiving phosphate only. These latter data are just the jreverse of those obtained for the recovery of the applied phosphate whenj percolated with 2 or 10 liters of solution. : Discussion. The increased solubility of soil phosphorus in alkaline soils due to the nitrification of a physiologically acid nitrogen fertilizer depends largely on the reduction of the pH of the soil. In this experiment the nitrification of urea greatly increasedjthe calcium content of the soil solution and at the same time lowered the pH. In the calcareous soils minimum pH values of 7.5. and 7.2 were obtained for Soils 1 and 2 respectively and the in - creased solubilities of phosphorus were small. Apparently the pH was not lowered sufficiently to permit an appreciable increase in the solubility of soil phosphorus in the presence of such a large quantity of soluble calcium. On the other [hand, in the non-calcareous soils minimum pH values of 6.5 and 5.0 were obtained for Soils 3 and 4 respectively. In the latter soils the pH was j apparently lowered sufficiently to permit an in - creased solubility of soil phosphorus in the presence of considerable soluble 'calcium... . ¦ ¦ .

Since the decomposition of the sugar beet tops had no appreciable effect on the pH of these soils, it seems reasonable that the solubility of the. native soil phosphorus would not be affected. Urea accelerated the fixation of phosphorus in the phosphated samples. Since the urea treatments greatly increased the soluble calcium, an ap - preciable precipitation of, the soluble phosphate would be expected regard - less of the pH. The apparent acceleration of fixation at first by the de - composing sugar beet tops was undoubtedly due to the great biological activity. -However, later increases in solubility of phosphorus indicated a retardation of fixation. It is probable that certain humates found in the decomposition prevented the phosphate from being precipitated. Fleig (13) found that a humus substance dissolved from one part of brown coal by alkali was sufficient to hold four parts of P 2 O O in solution through apH range of 4.2 to 8.0 when calcium salts were added/, </seg>
         <seg id="p014">Acrici'lti'ral Experiment Station Research Bulletin 113 EFFECTS OF THE DECOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC MATERIALS OF VARYING PHOSPHORUS CONTENTS.—SERIES 2 As in Series 1, nitrate nitrogen was determined at each incubation period to indicate the degree of decomposition of the added materials. Urea and ammonium sulfate were nitrified completely within four weeks in Soil 1. and to a high degree of completeness within six weeks in Soil 4. The minimum pH values were 7.7 and 7.6 in Soil 1 for the urea and ammonium sultate treatments respectively, while in Soil 4 the minimum values were 5.9 and 5.0. None of the other treatments had any appreciable effect on pH. Wheat straw and horse manure depressed nitrate produc - tion throughout the 14 weeks. Potato tops and alfalfa roots had a de - pressing effect at the beginning but at the end this was not significant. Alfalfa tops increased the nitrate content of the soil at all the stages of. incubation. These results indicate that there was considerable decomposition of the residues in every instance. Soluble Phosphorus Table 5 shows the amounts of P L .O.-, removed in two liters of percolate at various periods of incubation and the increases due to the treatments. Table (i shows the amounts of PjO,-, removed in ten liters of. solution com - pared with that removed in the first and last two-liter portions. .Vitrification of urea and ammonium sulfate affected the solubility of phosphorus differently in the two soils. The amounts of P ; O 5 removed in two liters of percolate from Soil 1 were not affected significantly at any stage ot incubation. Leaching with 10 liters of solution after 14 weeks' incubation gave similar results. The PjO.-, removed in two liters of per - colate from Soil 4 increased progressively with incubation. At 14 weeks there were 28.6 and 61.6 per cent increases in the P^.O.-, removed in 10 liters due to the urea and ammonium sulfate treatments respectively. The organic materials performed in an entirely different manner. All of the materials resulted in increases in the P20.-, removed in two liters of percolate from Soil 1. The increases varied with the material and the stage of incubation. In general the materials high in phosphorus gave large increases, while those low in phosphorus resulted in much smaller in - creases. It is apparent that the increases resulted from a release of the phosphorus from the organic materials. An increase in solubility of the native soil phosphorus would not be expected since the pH was not changed and the urea and ammonium sulfate treatments failed to increase [he solubility even though they decreased the pH. In Soil 4 also, the amounts of P-.O 5 removed in two liters of percolate were increased by the organic materials. However, larger increases were obtained for the ammonium sulfate treatment than for any of the organic materials except manure. Urea gave increases similar to those for sugar beel tops, alfalfa tops, and alfalfa roots. Wheat straw and potato tops gave lower increases. Even though urea and ammonium sulfate lowered the pH sufficiently to increase the solubility of phosphorus in Soil 4, it docs not seem likely that the decomposition of the organic materials would </seg>

It is interesting to note that the concentrations are similar in both soils with the exception of the manure - treated sample. In the ilatter instance the concentrations are appreciably greater in Soil 4. The data indicate that the concentrations of P u O a in the soil solutions are directly related to the P«O 3 contents of the applied material and inversely related to the calcium contents of the soil solution. Potato tops contain more phosphorus than wheat straw but the P«O S con - centration in the soil solution and the P^O., removed by two liters of per - colate are lower. This may be due to the larger amount of calcium made soluble by the decomposition of the potato tops. Urea and ammonium sulfate had no appreciable effect on the P 2 0 s content of the displaced Isoil solution of Soil I, and urea had no effect on the PoQ S content of the soil solution from Soil 4. However, the ammonium sulfate increased the PoOj content of the soil solution from Soil 4 con - siderably. This latter treatment lowered the pH of the soil to 5.2 at the last sampling period. , ¦ . :. : . .¦'.;•¦'' Discussion It is obvious from the results obtained; in the studies in both Series 1 and 2 that two entirely different phenomena are involved in the increased amounts of P 2 O 5 obtained from decomposition of organic materials and the nitrification of urea and ammonium sulfate. With the latter materials, the increased solubility is correlated with an increase in acidity. In cal - careous soils the acids produced by the decomposition of. these materials .would first attack the calcium carbonate and thus there would be only small amounts, if any, available to dissolve the native soil phosphate. Large quantities of calcium would become soluble. At the same time the pH of the calcareous soil would not be sufficiently lowered to allow an in - creased content of soluble phosphorus in the presence of large quantities of soluble calcium. In the absence of carbonates or where only small quantities are present the pH of the soil may be sufficiently lowered to al - low for an increased solubility of the native phosphates in the presence of considerable soluble calcium. : The fact that the decomposition of crop residues and manure in the alkaline soils studied did not affect the pH while at the same time the soluble calcium was greatly increased indicates that these materials have no appreciable effect on the solubility of the native phosphorus compounds. In addition, much larger increases of soluble phosphorus due to the application of organic residues would be expected if the increases were in part due to the solubility of the native phosphates. The increases in soluble phosphorus due to the applications of organic materials depend chiefly upon the amounts of phosphorus added in the materials. Thus, wheat straw and potato tops gave smaller increases than such materials as sugar beet tops, alfalfa tops, and alfalfa roots. The </seg>

The fact that potato tops and alfalfa tops released less phosphorus in calcareous soils than would be expected from their phosphorus contents indicates that some other factor affects the amount of phosphorus made soluble. These same materials produced a larger quantity of nitrates and increased the soluble calcium more than did the other materials. Apparently, the larger quantity of soluble calcium caused a greater precipitation of the phosphorus released from these materials. GENERAL SUMMARY A study is reported on the effects of the decomposition of organic matter on the solubility and fixation of phosphorus by alkaline soils. In one scries of experiments urea and sugar beet tops were applied in equiv - alent amounts of nitrogen with and without treble superphosphate to two calcareous and two non&lt;alcareous alkaline soils. The calcareous soils responded to phosphate applications in the field while the non-calcareous soils were non-responsive to phosphate applications. In another series wheat straw, potato tops, sugar beet tops, alfalfa roots, alfalfa tops, horse manure, urea, and ammonium sutfate were added to one calcareous and one non-calcareous soil. These materials were allowed to decompose in the soil under uniform conditions for various periods up to 22 weeks. The phosphorus removed in two liters of solution by percolation with a solu - tion buffered to the pH of the soil, the nitrate nitrogen, and the pH of the soil were determined for each period of incubation. The calcium and phosphorus contents of the soil solution were determined twice, and the phosphorus removed by 10 liters of solution was determined at the last incubation period. The nitrate supply was greatly reduced throughout the experiment by the organic materials low in nitrogen, such as wheat straw and horse manure, slightly reduced by alfalfa roots and potato tops, and increased by sugar beet tops and alfalfa tops. Urea and ammonium sulfate were quickly and completely nitrified in the soils. Crop residues and manure had no appreciable effect on the pH of the soils. Both urea and ammonium sulfate caused a lowering of the pH. The nitrification of urea and ammonium sulfate had no appreciable effect on the phosphorus removed from the calcareous soils but caused decided increases for the non-calcareous alkaline soils. Urea accelerated the fixation of applied phosphate. Crop residues increased the soluble phosphorus in all the soils studied. Horse manure increased the soluble phosphorus much more than any of the other materials. In general, the increases were greater for those materials with a higher phosphorus content. The decomposition of sugar beet tops retarded the fixation of applied phosphate. The calcium content of the soil solution was greatly increased by the urea and ammonium sulfate treatments, moderately increased by alfalfa </seg>

The phosphorus contents of the soil solutions were not appreciably affected by the addition of urea and ammonium sulfate. The phosphorus content in the soil solution was increased by the addition of organic material. The results of these studies indicate that the increases in soluble phos - phorus due to applications of crop residues and manure to alkaline soils are largely due to the phosphorus released from the organic materials and not to a solubility of the native soil phosphorus. </seg>
