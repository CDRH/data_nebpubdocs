HON. T. M. MABQTTETT. 

Hun. T. M. Marc|iicit was bora near Springfield. Clarke Couty, 
Ohio, in 1831, and graduated from the Ohio Iniveisitv at Athens 
in lsr&gt;."i when l!4 yean of age. Baring visited Kansas ami Iowa. 
he made choice of Nebraska as a future home in 1866, in which 

war lie was admitted to the bat 

After one year's residence in &lt; 'ass County, he was elected 

three yean in succession to the Territorial House of Bepreaeata 
lives: and so well were the voters satisfied with the ability, 
ravage and capacity of the young statesman, that lie was called 
ii|H&gt;n to serve them four years in the Council (answering to the 
State Senatel subsequent to 18S#. 

FIRST STATE ELECTION 

To prevent confusion of facts relative to the first election to 
Cwgff , in Nebraska, under the State Constitution in ISM, it 
should be remembered that it took plan during the 39th Congress 
while Mr. Hitchcock was territorial Delegate. Mr. Mari|iiett 
held toward it a dual position, being elected both as member 
and delegate. In case admission of the State should occur 
during that Congress. Mr. Marquett was elected member of the 
unexpired term. Or, if it remained a Territory during the 40th 
Congress, he was to serve as a delegate. But if it was found 
ite in the 4(lth Congress. Mr. Taffe wan elected to meet that 
emergency. Accordingly when it became a state in the expiring 
days of the 39th Congress, that retired Mr. Hitchcock, and made 
Marquett member for two days closing the 39th Congress. Becoming 
a state also superseded Marquetfs election to the 40th 
Congress, and advanced Mr. Taffe to the membership.

            <seg id="p002">
Mr. Marqnett has remained at the bar. in absolute devotion to 
his profession, from the date' of his admission, and has been 
resident attorney, at Lincoln, for the immense and complicated 
business of the Burlington A Missouri Btvef Kailroad Company 
since its establishment in Nebraska. Many friends pressed him 
for I'niTetl States Senator when Mr. Tipton was re-elected in 
ist&gt;!». Without a stain upon his professional honor, his name 
stands Ugh upon the roll of the States most cherished and 
honored lawyers. 

Of his spoken eloquence, upon the stump and at the bar, but 
little has been recorded, for an utter neglect of his intellectual 
propeny lias lieen the characteristic of a modest and fearlessly 
independent personality. 

PERORATION OK AN [ \l I'EAl !IM KNT ARGUMENT 

In the most noted trial of the State in which Mr. Marquett 
was an attorney, in defense of &lt;iov. Butler, he closed a most 
elaborate and powerful speech with the following appeal: 

Senators -The blow, unarrested. falls not alone on him 
Would to God it did: Would to Clod that no wife, no child 
were to feel its (/rushing 1 weight! Senators — You this da 
stand upon the banks of a Rubicon, beyond whose flood lie 
the dreary waste of political strife and dark contention 
Humanity bids you pause. But yesterday the people place&lt; 
upon the brow of David Butler a wreath intertwined wit! 
the laurel; to-day it is proposed to write there a brand o 
infamy; a burning brand; a brand which time cannot erase 
and which not even the good angels above can wipe out, o 
hide from human view. 

Senators — As 1 close this case, let me remind you tha 
those appeals of the counsel to the effect that the peopl 
demand the conviction of the accused, — that you need no 
show crime, or even a corrupt motive. — is only asking you 
to trace backward from the sunlight of today to those dar 
ages when a court, spurning evidence, yielded to outsid 
clamor and sent a sainted Baxter to the block, and bad 
Algernon Sidney tread the narrow steps of thfe scaffold 
Posterity will review our acts, and cannot do otherwise than 
condemn you if. by your verdict, you pronounce him guilt 
when the people have declared him innocent. 

Around you in this crowded hall, in the galleries and corridors, 
are those who anxiously await your verdict. God's </seg>



            <seg id="p003">
own justice bids you at once break this dreadful suspense, 
calm those palpitating hearts, dry the tear which forbidden 
comes, and answer the prayers so earnestly made by pronouncing 
the magic. — and now by the behests of justice 
made golden, — words of "not guilty." 

NEBRASKA IN CON6BES8 

« &gt;n the 2nd day of March, 1867, the Globe report of the House 
'•clings, in Congress, has the following entry: 

Mr. T. M. Marquett. of Nebraska, appeared, and having 
taken the oath to support the constitution, and the oath 
prescribed by the act of June 2nd, 1862, took his seat. 

The next business before the House was the presentation of 
iin resolutions, affirming the refusal of ten states lately in 
rebellion, to adopt the 14ih Amendment to the Constitution; 
¦ad thai as toag as thej contiuued to refuse its adoption they 
would not be entitled to representation in the House; and 
ivfusal long persisted in would merit more stringent conditions. 

I "he object of the amendment in question was to define citizenp. 
and it declared all persons born or naturalized in the 
md States t « &gt; lie such and equally entitled to the protection 
tlie laws. This, of course, included all the emancipated 
It also provided a national penalty for a State's deny: 
any one the right to vote, "on account of race or color or 
vious condition of servitude." It also excluded certain partiants 
in the rebellion from seats in Congress and from other 
utions. and declared the sanctity of the national debt. Next 
ne the very elaborate veto message of President Johnson, of 
till "To provide for the more efficient government of the rebel 
The question was. "Shall the House pass the bill, the 
ssident's objections t&lt;B the contrary notwithstanding?" 

It'p to this time, the voice of the State of Nebraska had never 
?n uttered upon a recorded vote; but upon sustaining a ruling 
the presiding officer, Mr. Marquett broke the silence by voting 

Aye." and did the same on Mr. Blaine's motion to suspend the 
rules, that the bill might be carried over the veto. And then. 
of course, on the final vote he was found with the constitutional

hraska placed squarely upon the platform of the Republican 
( "ongressional reconstruction, "amid thunders of applause on 
i lie floor and in the galleries." Again, during the same day, 
MM another veto message, of "A bill to regulate certain civil 
offices," which was so conspicuous, finally, in the impeachment 
of Andrew Johnson; and once more Mr. Marquett voted in the 
affirmative on its passage. Another affirmative vote of much 
value was upon the joint resolution to enable the United States 
to participate in the Universal Paris Exposition of 1867. But 
the last time he responded to the roll call was to suspend the 
ratal and instruct a committee to report a bill to reduce members' 
salaries, and before the result could be announced, the 
hour of adjournment having come, the Speaker, Mr. Colfax, delivered 
his valedictory address, proclaiming the inexorable fact 

As these parting words are said, another Congress wait for 
our seats.'" The seat occupied by Mr. Marquett for two days 
was at once labeled for John Taffe. of I&gt;akota County, who was 
elected to the 40th Congress; and in the selfsame hour Senators 
John M. Thayer and T. W. Tipton put on the robes of office in 
the chamber at the other end of the Capitol. Had Mr. Marquett 
Keen elected to the 40th Congress as a member he would have 
made an efficient and popular representative. Of his ability 
his constituents had ample evidence in his career in the territorial 
legislature, and at the bar and upon the hustings dur

HON. .1OIIN TAFFE.

Two years after liis arrival he 

was elected to the Territorial 

re of Representatives and in 18M we find him presiding 
the Council, answering to the State Senate. 

In lStii' he was commissioned Major of the Second Nebraska 
• 'avalry, and during a l."&gt; months" service, was with (icneral 
Sully"s expedition against the Indians, in which the Second Ne 
braska under Col. Furnas received the hearty commendation 
of the general commanding. 

veral times baring received votes in congressional conven 
tions he was finally nominated and elected a member of the 
4nth. 41st and 42nd Congress, in the years IMC, 1MB and 18T9. 
After leaving Congress he was Receiver of Public Moneys in the 
Land Office at North Platte. Lincoln County. 

ri the occasion of his death in 1884, in an obituary notice of 
in the Historical Transactions of the State Society, we have 
following: 

In his congressional course Mr. Taffe was a faithful 
worker in the interest of the state of his adoption, energy 
and zeal lieing the predominating- features of his work in 
the halls of congTess as well as at home. His work was 
successful without ostentation, and thorough with all the 
elements of a practical nature. 

In the Forty-second congress he served as chairman of 
the house committee on territories, while at the same time 
holding important positions on two other committees. 

After leaving congress he l«ame editor of Thr RepuUicai) 
and filled the chair with considerable ability ami success. 
He was a plain, practical, and earnest writer, and, on 
political issues, throughout the State, in those days was 
considered almost infallible. An excellent proof of this is </seg>

•F 



found in the fact that in a certain presidential election h 

not only forecast the vote of our own state to a nicety but 
ill so that of many of the states of the Union. 

After his retirement from The Ki'inibliran he returned to 
the practice of his profession, taking some interest in mining 
o|&gt;erations. 

He was honest and honorable in all his dealings, and 
loyalty to friends was the ruling characteristic of his head 
and heart. 

Tin* iacMMed votes cast at the several dates of Mr. TmMtt'u 
three elections show i lie growth of population: beiag 8,923 in 
isilC. 1.-,.|)412 in 1MB, ami 2t£42 in 1871, while his major; 
first of 748. and second of S.4M, and third of 4.4OS. indicate 
the growth of the Republican party. 

At the same time his competitor in each canvass was a man 
of acknowledged ability, of unblemished character, and established 
citizenship. First. A. S. Paddock, since I'. S. Senator: 
then A. .1. Popplcton, in the highest degree an ornament of the 
Omaha bar: and third. Judge Ocatge 15. Lake, after Chief .lustier 
of the State Supreme Court. 

In the election of Mr. Tart'r there were two points in tin- 
State's favor relative to a faithful service: the first arising 
from the fact that her representative possessed a legal edin-a 
tion. and the second, that he had legislative experience, and 
practice in the application of parliamentary law. Hut as to any 
sudden acquisition of reputation in the new arena of action, 
tlie chances were decidedly against the incumbent, for the spirits 
that had raised the storm were determined to ride the wl 
and already the prow of the Impeachment Steamer was facing 
the Senate in the case of President Andrew Johnson, floating 
from her masthead, for the enlightenment of all new NWfl — 
"Vessels large may venture more; but little boats should keep 
near shore." In addition to this the new member's associations 
were of Territories, Lands and Indians, all intimating soil, with 
no "distance to lend enchantment to the view." While he never 
attempted to be offensivelv aggressive, his svmpathies wen' 
all on the side of the harassed and exposed emigrants from 
Indian raids and plunderings. and hence he had to meet the 
|K»puIar clamor in behalf of the "noble red man." </seg>


            <seg id="p007">

With peat penevcraaee he tried to secure an amendment 
to iin appropriation bill, to the effect that where members of 
¦ iribe went upon the "war-path." annual payments should be 
made only pro rata to those remaining peaceable. To the chairman 
of the Indian Committee he said: "If an Indian goes into 
a white man's stable, in broad daylight, and takes away a horse, 
while the government is paying an annuity to that tribe. I would 
like to know what remedy the white man has under the law." 

Mr. Shanks of Indiana having explained that if application 
were made to the Interior Department within three years the 
daini could lie settled. Mr. Taffe continued: "I submit, with 

dm- reaped to the gentleman, that, as a matter of law, he is 
entirely mistaken. I hold that today, if there are a thousaml 
Indians in a tribe, nine hundred and ninety-nine of whom .u&gt;on 
the "war-path.' they can commit depredations and still re&gt; 
their annuity from the Cioverninent under existing laws; ami 
no white man lias any remedy for any of their depredation-. 

On a subsequent day he said: 

I would like to make ¦ brief 

statement. 1 said day before 
itood no money appropriated 

rdav that as the law now 

by the Gorerameat, no article contributed by the Government 
to these Indians was liable for any depredations committed 
by them. In other words, all the depredations that 
they ha\r heretofore committed, and all that they may 
hereafter commit, under the law and under the amendment 
framed. 1 beUere, by the uentlenian who now has charge of 
this bill, were to l&gt;c exempt from all claims, whatsoever, of 
citizens of the United Si 

And in addition to that we make an appropriation to 
prosecute any citizen of any state, or of the West, whoever 
pursues, upon a reservation, an Indian with a horse he has 
stolen. I hope I may not be misunderstood. That was 
voted down in this house two years ago. But as the law 
certainly is now. though it is denied by the chairman of the 
( ommittee on Indian Affairs, we are to have no redress 
whatever. You can make no reprisal under penalty of the 
law: and there is an appropriation to punish you for pursuing 
an Indian upon a reservation, with stolen property. 
That is the law of congress today. I offer this amendment 

so there shall not be a premium upon robbery and scalps </seg>



            <seg id="p008">
The amendment was voted 

down. In answer to Mr. Farns-

Mr. TattVs fidelity to the work of the Committee on Territories, 
of which be was chairman in the 4^d Congress, and his 
general reputation as an intelligent worker on the committees, 
caused Mr. l&gt;awes. of Massachusetts, to girt him an unmerited

Recurring on another occasion to Indian Affairs, he said

ne or two separately, and I protest against paying a prem- 

ium on white scalps, by giriag the marauders blankets and 

guns and ammunition to perpetrate these outrages. If I did 
not misunderstand the gentleman who has charge of this 
bill, he stated that he hoped for a better state of things 

before these appropriations are paid. 

In those days of fleecing the government, when robbery 
the rule and honesty the imaginary exception, we find him 
tilating the conduct of mail contractors.

to be tr;ms|&gt;orted. and that when there is express freight 
they will carry it to the exclusion of mail matter. 

I live at Omaha on this thoroughfare, and I have liveii 
there for twelve years. I do know that there are a largi" 
number of responsible citizens who declare that they have 
seen mail matter upon the ground and left for days exposed 
to destruction. 

I know furthermore, that Indians constantly bring; in mail 
baps to the military posts, that they have found thrown 
out and left upon the ground. 

In the House. February 27th. 1*71. Mr. Taffe offered an amend 
ment to an appropriation hill increasing tin- amount from 
fl!. r ).&lt;Ml0 to |5A,Mi tot coatimrfag the construction of a I"nited 
States Conrl House and l'ostoftice in the city of Omaha. 

Mr. Speaker At the time this improvement was com 
mi'iiiTil the Secretary of the Treasury was called on to 
make a recommendation. Accordingly the Secretary sent 
in another list of buildings, among- which was the building 
at Omaha. 

After the first appropriation was made the citizens of 
Omaha subscril&gt;ed and paid $'•!."&gt;.&lt; MM) for the purchase of the 
land on which this building was to Ih» erected. 

Now I cheerfully admit, and 1 will not undertake to disguise 
the fact, that arc want a building that will cost more 
than $100,000. After we ha\e had an appropriation of $2 r .-000, 
after we ha\e had the implied promise of the government 
that the building shall lie prosecuted, after the citizens 
of Omaha have themselves purchased the ground at ¦ 
cost of $!_'r&gt;.000. we think it not unreasonable that the appropriation 
in this bill shall be increased to $50,000. I hi&gt;l&gt;e 
the amendment will not be considered as obnoxious to the 
objections raised by the gentleman from Massachusetts. 

I will not urge this appropriation on the ground that it is 
all tin- State gets; but it is a fact that we do not happen to 
have large rivers running through the State, or lakes lhat 
require to be excavated: hence we cannot ask immense 
appropriations for rivers and har!&gt;ors. but we ask the con 
strnction of this building as necessary for the accommodation 
of the government officers and on account of the commercial 
importance of Omaha. 

After an adroit and eloquent argument by Mr. Van \V\vk. 
of New York, in behalf of Omaha and the appropriation, the 
aniendnu nt was agreed to. nnn-h to the delight of Mr. Taffe and 
his grateful coiiHtituents. </seg>

HON. LORENZO CBOUN8E. 

March 4th. 1873— March 4th. 1»T 

When Lorenzo CraUK MM to Uulo. Richardson County. 
Nebraska, in UM, he MM to have been the "right man in the 
right place." The immediate community and the Territory 
stood in need of self-reliant citizens, and one who had made 
professional life powiMe, by teaching in winter, in order to 
acquire a legal education, had certainly demonstrated thin 
potent quality. Born in Schoharie County. New York, January. 
1834 — admitted to the bar in 18M — married in I860 — Captain 
of Battery K. 1st Regiment New York light Artillery in IStil — 
wounded at Cedar Mountain in IMS and in same year resigned 
and resumed practice till lst&gt;4 — he was therefore 30 years of 
age when he settled ujMin the shore of the turbid Missouri. 

E republican in politics, he at once affiliated with the soldier 
tent, and being of sound morals, his legal acquirements inted 
him as worthy of legislative and constitutional convenhonors. 


His advocacy of the adoption of the first state constitution 
satisfied the people of his fitness for Associate .lust ice of the 
Supreme Court, to which he was elected in IMC, and in which 
he presided till 1S7L'. when elected a member of Congress. 

|)n the 1st day of lVcemher, 1ST:?, at the beginning of the 
•d Congress, .ludge Lorenzo Crounse responded to the roll 
1 of Nebraska. At the previous session of the 42nd Congress 
«lary bill had been passed to equalize the pay of members: 
t the party in power had been charged with great extravag 
?e in appropriating money, which their opponents pressed so 
;orously, that a portion of themselves joined in the popular 
nand for the repeal of the act. Accordingly, in the first hours 
the session, many who voted for and received their pay under 
I denounced law joined the army of repealers: and out of the 

CONGRESSMAN </seg>



            <seg id="p011">
tiist nineteen bills placed upon the House calendar, sixteen were 
for repeal, or a radical change of the enactment, some going so 
far as to advocate a reduction of salaries till all amounts returned 
should leave their salaries as under the former law. But 
this theorv received its quietus when Butler, of Massachusetts, 
&lt;l*-iiianded that all "back pay." in former years, under similar 
laws, should also be refunded. Amidst the clamor of the day 
Mr. i'1-ouiise delivered his maiden speech. In this brief effort he 
di-iKiuiKcd political death-bed confessions, pell-mell retreats, and 
«-i-i 11 jii njr supplications; but also recognized the fact of "vox 
ptjmti, raj- I hi." when not issued from Hades. 

Mr. &lt; hoinse: I am not advised very particularly in regard 
to the amendment offered by the gentlemen from Ten(Mr. 
Maynard). While I might at the proper time 

and under proper circumstances vote for it, I apprehend 
that at this time it will embarrass what I think is the prin&lt;-iple 
which is controlling this House. 

I have sat here for some time listening attentively to this 
debate oa the salary &lt;|iii'stion. for the purpose of dis. 
ing. if possible, what principle is guiding this House in 
this action. It is conceded that the act of March last found 
its warrant in the Constitution, and that it had precedent 
after precedent to support it. It is conceded on all hands 
that, so far as the action of this House is coueerned. it is 
fully warranted by law. Now. if T have been able to disrover 
the motives which prompt the action of this House at 
this time it is a reflex of the principles and the sentiment 
which it is said emanate from the people, and which brands 
the act of the last Congress in regard to salaries as a fraud 
in lain. That is why I would have liked to support the 
amendment of the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Poland), 
for the purpose of testing the honesty of the House. 

It is a very cheap business for gentlemen to make their 
proclamations of obedience to the will of the people, and 
all that; but, sir, it costs something when gentlemen have 
to put their hands right down into their own pockets and 
pay $5,000 for such a proclamation. I say I am totally opposed 
to attempts to make this sort of cheap reputation 
for honesty and frugality; and I am glad to have an opportunity 
to proclaim my conviction on this question. I desire 
that my acts upon this floor shall be characterized by honesty 
of motive. I want not to be scared by any false 
clamor: nor will I co-operate with those who create such </seg>



            <seg id="p012">
clamor and then run from it, hastening in a sort of scramble 
to see who can run fastest, and dive deepest, and stay 
down longest. [Laughter.] Such a course is belittling; it 
is degrading to the dignity of the House. If we do a ri^ht 
act. let us stand by it. clamor or no clamor. It is not, I 
say. the province of a statesman to cower before the clamor 
of his constituents. It is his duty to mold public sentiment. 
If \\c find, upon full examination, that it is necessary to 
increase our salaries to $10,000. let us do it; if we find it 
necessary to bring them down to $5,000, let us do it. But 
let M consider the question like gentlemen and like statesmen. 
Let us not stand here trembling in our shoes lest we 
may not return to these seats again. I let no consideration 
of that kind weigh with me. There is an old French say 
ing, "What must a people be whose god is a monkey?" I 
say. what must a people be who are to be satisfied by idle 
clamor and protestations of bowing to the popular will? 
I have but little confidence in a large part of these protestations. 
I make no reflection upon any member: but I 
appeal to all whether there has not been a sort of heartlessness 
and emptiness in much that has been said here. 

If it should be the disposition of this House to repeal the 
act of last .March, so as to put all these salaries back in 
statv quo, 1 shall stand with other gentlemen in support of 
such a measure; and when the proper time comes, I will 
consider fairly, squarely, and honestly this question of salaries; 
but at present let us repeal the act i» Ma, if that is 
a proper reflex of the sentiment of the people. 

BuBied with committee duties and keeping up a very volum 
inous correspondence with interested constituents, he next a«] 
dressed -the House in opposition to army reduction. This 
occurred February 4th, 1874, when he ran counter to the or 
thodox doctrine of Indian Affairs. 

Mr. Chairman, so far as this bill contemplates a reduction 
of the army it will have my opposition. There are considerations 
of a general nature, perhaps, which might lead 
us to oppose this bill, lying in the fact that this Government 
should keep an army sufficient to protect itself and to 
maintain its dignity. 

I wish, however, to speak more particularly from my 
standpoint. With the present number of the army I find 
there are allotted to my State but 1,032 soldiers. That, I 
wholly inadequate to meet the demands of the 
; of that State. And I might speak in behalf of the </seg>





            <seg id="p013">
Territories Im'ViiikI the Stiitf I represent, which have no 

it&lt;' nn this floor. 

Hut I s|H-;ik understanding^-. I s|&gt;eak intelligently. I 
think, when I say that this number is wholly inadequate 
to the demands of the people of Nebraska. And when I 
&gt;peak for the people of Nebraska 1 do not s|&gt;eak for that 
long-haired set of bullies whom some gentlemen may consider 
as the representations of the frontiersmen. I speak 
for a class of men who haw lx'en induced to emigrate to 
that western country in search of free homes, and honest 
Momanrv. men who called for the const ruction of the 
Pacific liailroad. and who arc seeking to develop the resources 
of that far off country. 

Sir. it was an ill-advised remark of the gentleman having 
h»rg« of Ihis bill when he suggested that necessity might 

demand that we retract the borders of civilization. Sir, it 
would be a sad anil humiliating confession for this (iovernment 
to declare its inability to protect any of the citizens 
within its borders. I demand for the ]&gt;eople of my section 
that protection to which their honest energy entitles them. 
I am not s|&gt;eaking in the interest of contractors. I repudiate 
the intimation which fell from the lips of some gentleman, 
that the West is clamorous for the increase of the 
army as contributing. i&gt;erhaps. to the Wnetit of the contractors. 
I speak not for that class of men. I say that the 
man who has not read of the troubles existing upon the 
borders of my own State has given but little attention to 
the history of this country. I could produce here letters 
from the (iovernor of my State, received within the last 
day or two, in which he asks for military protection to the 
settlers. I might refer to the columns of the daily newspapers, 
by which it could be shown that almost every morning 
we are startled with news of raids by the Sioux and 
other Indians upon the peaceful settlers of that State. Such 
things retard the settlement, not only of our State, but of 
the entire West. It is important that the Government should 
adopt such a policy as shall give to settlers that feeling of 
security which will encourage emigration. 

K'hen Mr. Shanks, of Indiana, demanded evidence of Indian 
ilities, Mr. Crounse replied: 

I can give the gentleman the authority of the Governor 
of my State, a gentleman who needs no eulogy at my 
hands. 

Mr. Shanks: We want evidence, not eulogies. 

Mr. ( rovnbe: If the gentleman wants a scalp I have not 
provided myself with one to show him. [Laughter.] </seg>

In a discussion, on renoviag the restriction from the timber

"Men of enterprise :md capital would go into this matter upon a

their course: and in addition to other arguments said: 

I come from a state where this sort of legislation has 
prevailed to some extent; and I know that upon the whole 
it has been benefieial to the State of Nebraska. I represent 
to-day upon this floor not less perhaps than three hundred 
thousand souls; I represent a state that has not less than 
twehe hundred miles of railroad. Every foot of that railroad 
has been built by just the kind of aid which is sought 
here. And I know further that not one foot of that railroad 
would probably have been built to-day had it not 
been for such aid. and Nebraska would to-day have been 
almost a wild without it. 

The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Burchard) is one of a 
number of representatives whose constituencies are worth 
millions, and who. without their great railroad interests, 
would, as it were, be worth nothing. The railroads, and 
they alone, have built up the states which they represent. 
This territory is away off by itself; it is represented here 
by a delegate who has the simple privilege of opening his 
mouth, but who has no rote upon a question of vital interest 
to his people. For some reason or other in the 
organic law of that territory was a clause prohibiting giTing 
aid of this kind. That delegate has brought forward 
here a case which I think in all particulars must commend

EXPOSED CONDITION 11F NEBRASKA. 

Eh- &lt;|iiesiinii licinji on an appropriat ion of $50,000 for

I send to the Clerk's desk and ask to have read the lecotn 
memlation of (ieneral Ord. who is in command of that dis 
trict in favor of this appropriation. 

The Clerk read as follow 

"I have again to call attention to the exposed conditioi 
of Nebraska, north of the Union Pacific railroad, and ex 
tending from the Missouri Hiver for three hundred mile 
westward, in which there is nut a single military station 
This country is as rich as any other portion of Nebraska

¦abject to frequent raids from the Sioux, from Spot 
ted Tail's and now from Ked Cloud's reservation. Whei 
on a recent \isit east of the first named chief he did BM 
the honor to call, with his lieutenants and concubines, at tn\ 
office. I called his attention to a raid which some of wha 
were considered to be his people had just committed on the 
lile Baptist and Danish settlers on the Loup. he re 
plied in quite a haughty manner that he had not come here 
to lie talked to in that way. As I had no power to con 
trol his movements, or make him or the people whom he 
claimed to rule respect the property of the white settlers 
the touching upon facts put an end to further conversation 
I think a post should be established somewhere about mid 
way on a line drawn from Fort Randall, on the Missour 
River, to Fort McPherson on the Platte. It need not cos 
to exceed $50,000, and under the sense of security whicl 
it would give to settlers the rapid increase of a tax-payine 
population would soon repay the outlr.y." 

Mk. Croi'SSE: I would say in addition to that that this 
appropriation is warmly recommended by the Secretary o: 
War. I have not his letter here, because this matter has 
been sprung upon the House at a time when I did not antic

want of this military post. If we hail had such a post there 
we could have intercepted their approach. They came 
immediately from the north into the part of Nebraska

A JOB IIXKH VI 

I "pon this (piestion ill relation to the government of the 
Territory of I'tah the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.PoIand) 
seems to have identified himself with the subject from the 
very outset. The annals of Congress show that each * 
a "Poland bill" has been introduced. It is generally introduced 
on the first day of the session, and is referred to 
the Committee on the Territories and to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. It seems that this gentleman has taken, in 
familiar taagnage, "the job" of fixing up the affairs of 
Utah. And when I reS|&gt;ect fully asked the liberty to propound 
a question while the gentleman was making- a statenrent 
here, he found it convenient to deny me the right of 
propounding interrogatories or correcting what I regard 
misstatements. when he would tolerate other gentlemen 
whom he knew to Ik- in sympathy with the bill. The trentlenian 
from Mississippi (Mr. McKee I could get up and 
interrogate him at pleasure, and it was entirely convenient 
ami pleasant for this to be done; but the gentleman knew 
from my connection with the bill that it would perhaps 
not be profitable to tolerate any questions on my part.

FALLACY EXPLODED 

The srentleman says that while the United States appoints 
its marshals, the Territory, in defiance of law. 
appoints its marshals. Why is this? Tl nice of United 
States marshal is as distinct from the office of territorial 
marshal as day is from nijrht. Their offices run in different 
directions. One is charged with the execution of the 
writs, processes, etc.. emanating* from the United - 
courts and in I'nited States cases. I have the record of a 
case her*' where the judges who were sent out t" 
attempted to set aside the territorial marshal. That Territory 
saw fit under its laws to appoint a marshal: for 
what? For the disposition of Matters arising under their </seg>




            <seg id="p020">
Now. that they have a ripht to do. If that is denied them. 
Ihca one of the first principles of a republican system of 

j.'o\ eminent is front- and wiped out. When a people in a 
territory cannot be accorded the ripht to enact their own 
laws — those that relate to themselves, as long as they do 
nut (-'inflict with the Constitution of the United States, and 
if they cannot select their own officers to execute those 
laws, then I sa\ jam are striking down the very first principles 
of American lil)erty. You are taxing men without 
n -presentation: you are demanding obedience to laws which 
they have no voice in making-, and you foist u|H&gt;n them offi- 

Bto execute the laws under no responsibility to the 
e governed. It is a proposition unheard of in the 
•y of American law-making- or jurisprudence. 

I say then that the charge brought here was that they 
i -leeted a territorial marshal in defiance of the laws of the 
United States, which provided a United Stales marshal. 
Judge McKeon. of the supreme court of that Territory, took 
1 hnt position: a position never taken before in any other 
territory of the United States. That case was broug-ht to 
the supreme court of the United States, and how was it 
terminated there'.' I have the record before me. but cannot 
take time tn read it. Her. is the information tiled by the 
1 nit.-d States officer and the answer of the territorial marshal, 
where he distinctly says that he disclaims any ripht 
to interfere in the control of United States affairs: that 
elected under the organic act relating to the affairs 

f Utah, is elected by the lepislature of Utah, and in pur 

suance of that election he acted in the discharge of his 
duties as such in serving writs and processes which emanated 
from the court as far as they related to territorial 
matters; for instance, the crime of larceny, murder, or 
any offense which is made such by the laws of the Territory 
of Utah. In those cases where the processes went 
forth through the territorial marshal, he executed the writs 
and processes, as he had a right to do. and as he should do, 
involving no infraction of any law of the United 
States. Hut that. I say. is made an offense. 

GAG BILF 

When I asked from the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. 
Poland) the privilege of interruptinp him that I mipht inquire 
whether or not the United States had not sustained 
that position. I was denied that courtesy. This bill must 
be pushed down our throats as thouph this House were a 
lot of willing subjects only too ready and anxious to go to </seg>



            <seg id="p021">
to be put through under the whip and spur of the previous 
question, lint an hour — one poor hour — is given to the discussion 
of matters involving the rights of one hundred 
and thirty-five thousand people, whose only fault is that 
they entertain religious convictions differing from those 
entertained by gentlemen here. I tell you. sir. it will not 
do for this congress to assume a mock regard for particular 
laws while unmindful of others. I.ct e\erv man turn 
i/ht inward; let him stand before the forum of his 
own conscience; let him ask himself whether he ha 
religious convictions at all. Men who have none at all arc 
perhaps too apt to be intolerant toward those who have 
that while I deplore the system prevailing in 
while I am not in sympathy with that form of religion, 
while I desire and hope that in the progress of civilization 
it will be wiped out, I hope the American Congress 
will not act hastily in this regard. 

As I wish to be sparing- of the time of the gentleman 
from I'tali (Mr. Canniiri], I can only say that 1 did hope 
ail this bill in its detail. There are several views 1 
would like to submit in which 1 am satisfied this House 
would concur with me 

HOME BULK DEMANDED. 

I am satisfied that this House would not upon deliberation 
enact the sccmini! anomaly of having one set of peo 
pie make laws while otlicers appointed by another and 
distinct authority are to execute those laws. Why, sir. by 
this mode of proceeding you strike down the very lawmaking 
power itself. If these people cannot have their 
own marshals and their own prosecuting attorneys, to proagaiaal 
offenses arising' under their own laws, they 
will make no laws. They will wi]&gt;e out their laws entirely 
if they cannot have a voice in executing them. Kvuiiiimall 
the laws that have been passed since the organization 
of this (iovernment. and where will you find that any like 
this lias been enacted? 

Mit. Kmihkimii : The gentleman will allow me to si 
to him that the marshals ¦elected by the local authorities 
of Utah sustain precisely the same relation to that Territory 
that our sheriffs bear- to the respective states. There 
is no difference or distinction in that regard. 

Mr. (roinse: Precisely. That is what I wish to have 
understood by the House; that we are asked to enact a 
law which is in defiance of all precedents in our legislation, 
and for no sutlicient reason; because the system of 
polygamy, if it is to be assailed at all, is to be assailed </seg>



            <seg id="p022">
iindfr the laws of the United States. Congress should not, 
and I say cannot in consistency with the principles underlying 
our institutions, enact laws which will thrust upon 
that people a set of Government officials responsible to no 

me I'Mrpt the Government here at Washington 

EQUAL RIGHT 

I say that this people does not deserve such treatment. 
Aside from the question of their religion they are entitled 
to the same rights, immunities and privileges which would 
be claimed in behalf of any other people. They have shown 
themselves law-abiding- and industrious. You may look 
over all the States and Territories of this I "n ion. and nowhere 
will you find the rate of taxation lighter than in 
that Territory. In this respect the people of that Territory 
have made a record which ought to be the envy of the 

general government ami of every state sroverninent . I say 
that people who have behaved in this manner should not 
bring down upon their heads the enactment of laws which 
must simply operate to enrich Knifed States officials and 
turn the people over, bound hand and foot. U) the tender 
mercies of officers whom they have no voice in choosing. 

While I would not antagonize the bill in gross. I hope 
that as presented here and sought to l&gt;e forced through it 
will be voted down, and that the opportunity niav be given 
to correct and modify it in those essential particulars which 
1 know this House upon calm consideration would not ap- 

prove. As a Congress \v

As in tin- darkness of the niirlit the electric flash reveals the 
form and foliage of the tree that ]&gt;erishes l&gt;y its stroke, so ia 
the iin'inoi inl addft— ei of Cmmgnm reveal the manly virtues

biographical sketch; and from them this brief summary must 
be extracted. For all his innate modesty allowed him to report 
in the Coiiiinxsioiiiil IHnitorii was "Frank Welch, of Norfolk, 
was elected to the 4."th ComgraM as a Republican."

and State Governments, and in 1876 was elected a member 
of the Forty-fifth Congress. He represented the largest 
Congressional district in the Union, both as respects territorial 
extent and population. He was alone in the other 
House from Nebraska — a state embracing an area of seventy-five 
thousand square miles, with a population of nearly 
four hundred thousand — a comparatively new state, having 
innumerable and varied interests in process of development, 
dependent largely upon Federal legislation and Federal executive 
administration for encouragement and protection. 

There was put upon him the labor of three men, and Inday 
and by night unceasingly he struggled through the 
protracted and exciting session of last year to do it all. 
Mr. Welch was a man of great energy, industry, and pertinacity 
of purpose, lie would do all required of him although 
he should know the effort would cost him his life; he did 
all, and as many another before him in like circumstances 
had done, he went prematurely to his grave. When the 
session closed, Mr. Welch returned to his constituency very 
much worn and broken in health. He needed rest, but he 
took it not. At once he entered upon an active and an 
exceedingly laborious political canvass. His physical machinery 
could not endure the additional strain put upon it. 
and then the end came, soon and swift but pangless. In the 
evening of the 4th dav .it September. 187S, in a public meeting, 
in the midst of a numerous audience composed largely 
of his political friends and admirers whom he was about 
to address, he was suddenly stricken and fell in death. 

But it was not left to Ntbraska alone to garland his

Mr. Speaker, I knew him long and well. For him time and

life, like a vigorous tree cut down in the wealth of 
its summer bloom ere the bright green of a single leaf had

Wiggintox, of California 

We of the Committee of Public Lands all knew him with 
the most unhesitating confidence in and respect for his 
character and abilities as a man, and with a 'most cordial 
regard inspired by his genial and gracious temper as an 
associate. In the brief course of his parliamentary career,

Firsi Nebraska Infantry, afterward Cavalry, and served until 
1m;i;; mastered out with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. 

He was ¦ member of the Territorial Council; served iu the

tiageat Member of Oaagrcaa in is"i; and 1878; was elected a 
representative to the 4."ith Congress in place of Frank Welch, 
deceaaed; and again elected a contingent member to the 4(!tb 

&lt; tang 

The election of a contingent member proceeded upon the asumption 
that the population of Nebraska had increased so 

much ¦mbaeqacatlj to the census of 1870, and previous to that 
of 1880, as to entitle her to another member of the House of 
Representatives; Imt as the discretion was with the House, no 
additional one was granted till, under the apportionment of 1880, 
tlie state was found entitled to three instead of one. Hence, 
Mr. Majors was never known as a contingent member, but as 
the successor of Hon. Frank Welch, in the third session of the 
45th Coagreaa, which commenced December 2nd, 1878, and adjourned 
March :'.rd. 1 sT'.t. As this was a short session of ninety 
days only, there was no opportunity for the voting and new 
member to signalize his term, either by oratorical displays or 
legislative achievements. 

Subsequently Mr. Majors was twice elected Lieutenant Governor: 
Imt in 1894, when Republican candidate for Governor, he 
was vigorously attacked by a leading and powerful paper of his 
party, the Omaha Bee, and defeated, while his party elected the 
legislature and all state officers. </seg>

to pive the farmers a knowledge of the present status of 
their crops. Grain speculators, pram pamblers, have held 
the agriculturists in their prip for years. They spend thousands 
upon thousands of dollars to send agents through the 
entire agricultural regions of the country. If they desire 
to work upon wheat, they send their apents into the wheat 
repions; if upon cotton, they send their apents into the 
cotton repions; and they know by the time the crop is 
pathered, if not before, what the crop is. We want the 
farmers to have the benefit, if there be any, of a short crop

received a valuable lesson. 

Mr. Valkxtine: During the Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh 
Congresses I had the honor to be a member of the

will confine myself particularly to one subject, leaving the 
discussion of the constitutional question to those who have

the same year was elected Judge of the First Judicial District 
and re elected iii L 879, holding the office until a Representative t&lt; 
the 4Mh Congress; and was reelected to the 4!tth Congress. ( )i 
¦CCOOat of the rapid increase of population the census of 1880 
entitled Nebraska to two additional members of Congress; an&lt; 
accordingly in ISM' Weaver of Kichardson, Laird of Adams, anc 
Valentine of Curning County, were elected. This gave a valuabi, 
combination of talent and experience. Four years of previous 
MBgiessioM] experience made Mr. Valentine a valuable worker 
training on the bench prepared Judge Weaver for legal investi 
{rations; while a vivid fancy and impetuous nature made Lain 
an impromptu orator and "picturesque character." 

Kbill being before the House for the protection of cattle 
i "contagious diseases," and men from New England arguthat 
state laws could answer the purpose, Mr. Weaver exned: 


What has Massachusetts of the cattle industry of this 
country? Not enouph to make a breakfast for the people 
of the United States. In Massachusetts, if all the steers 
and stag's and bulls were cows, there would be only one

The magnitude of the industry, and the danger from Texas 
fever, admonished him th.it only the interposition of Congress, 
under tlic clause of the constitution for the regulation of "iniirsiate 
commerce," could Beet the emergency. 

THE VOICE (IF VANDERHILT THE VOICE OF GOD. 

Jadge Weaver was conspicuous in the debates upon land 
grants to railroads, and all questions relative to the administration 
of the public domain. He took a very active part in the 
passage of a bill to regulate railway charges upon lines passing 
into and through states, and illuminated his precise judicial 
style with a flash of irony in the following paragraphs: 

Mr. TJrovn goes so far as to argue that Congress has no 
power to i&gt;:iss ;iny bill interfering with or regulating transportation 
of freight from state to state; but does make 
one strong admission, which forever ought to set the American 
people at ease, and operate as an estoppel against any 
railway seeking to gainwy the proposition, namely, that 
Congress has the power to appoint its agents for gathering 
statistical information in reference to any branch of indus- 
M that if we never succeed in passing this or any 
other bill, we have at least secured a concession of a representative 
of 6.000 miles of railroad that Congress may go 
into the statistical business with perfect safety. The gentleman 
evidently thinks the creature is bigger than the 
Creator and has reversed the adage, vox populi. nix Dei. and 
come to the conclusion that the voice of Vanderbilt, Gould 
and Huntingtou is the voice of God. 

COINAGE OF SILVER 

Kuring the first session of the 49th Congress he delivered a 
comprehensive speech for the "free coinage of silver." 

rthe opening sentence he charged "a conspiracy to doable 
national burden and the industries of the country, by mak 
money dear, and all species of property cheap." </seg>






            <seg id="p038">
Continuing he said 

Who has ever sen gold dollars doiag the business of this 
country V Cold is not the money that keeps alive the thousand 
industries that supply bread for the sustenance, and 
clothes for the protection of the millions. 

After a very thorough statement of our money supply, the 
value of our property subject to taxation, the increase of our 
population, rnamrrct, manufactures and agriculture, and a 
comparison of thorn all with the great nations of the civilized 
world, there followed the emphatic declaration: 

From the standpoint of national indebtedness, alone, we 
can readily see how impracticable it is to undertake to erect 
a single standard of gold; but when we go a step further 
and consider mechanical, corporate and private indebtedness, 
and then consider the amount of gold there is in the 
world, together with the annual product, the proposition 
appears too absurd to « 1 1 — &lt; 

He knew of but one firm of 

New York brokers "who have 

shown the manhood to expose the fallacies of this great cry 

against silver," and he added 
hensive circular.

The noble tniits of John A

Man) Wallace to strike mightily for freedom of his country 

men, then it was. I say. that this great warrior and states 

man breathed upon the discontented and wavering element 

of his own party utterances of Bach pure and patriotic devo 
tion to his whole united countrv as will make his meinorv 

lasting and imperishable as the Republic itself 

The noble traits of his character in his devotion to hi 

country were made more conspicuous Ivecause of his lifelong 
affiliation with a party that was now engaged in a war 

r the destruction of the Union and the dedication of one 

part thereof to human slavery 

I'.efore the buf_'lc blast of war had called any of our

ttested the fearful truth that 

civil war with all its dire consequences was about to test

This was but a patriotic declaration before the clash of 
aims; but in contirniat ion of his entire consecration and 
devotion to the preservation of the Union we have only to 
let impartial history l&gt;ear witness. Not content to serve 
his country in the halls of Congress away from the exposure

in me had been \icarious rather than personal. Whrn as a 
young man. in IBM, I left the halls of my nlmn Mfer, the 
University of Michigan, and became principal of a smal 
academy in southern Michigan. I found there two young 
men by the name of Laird; and before the close of the term

afterwards found was their brother. I lost sight of him 

then and never to my knowledge met him again personalh 
until he came to me in this chamber, and introduce&lt; 
himself as the same lad, James Laird. In the meantime the 
two brothers who had been under my instruction both die&lt; 
in the cause of the Union, as soldiers in the army. Thi 
trifling circumstance of our first meeting was the slende 
thread that bound us; but when we found ourselves a few 
weeks later in adjacent seats at the same committee table 
where we served together continuously, side by side, fo 
six years, this beginning of acquaintanceship ripened into 
a friendship which lasted as long as life endured. On th </seg>


            <seg id="p042">

¦very first occasion in which I participated on this floor I 
found my colleague and myself upon opposite sides of the 
question. I discovered on that occasion the quality of his 
steel. It was that debate, now historical, in regard to the 
restoration to the army of General Fitz-John Porter. Mr. 
I.aird had left his home when a mere boy (I think about 
thirteen years of age), and enlisted in the lfith Michigan 
Infantry; had gone to the front and become one of that 
5th Army Corps which was then under the command of 
General Porter. So when he found his old chieftain attacked 
here, with all the enthusiasm of his boyish admiration and 
love, and with all the vigor and strength of his manhood 
he came to his defense. I never ceased to admire and 
respect the chivalry, the earnestness and the enth 
of the man. Whenever he participated in debate his methods 
were earnest, direct and eloquent. There was in his voice 
the sound of the ring- of the sabre; there were in his utterances 
the rattle of the small arms in battle. 

In the committee room we found him always attentive to 
his duties; always faithful to each trust reposed in him; 
laborious and careful in the examination of his facts, but 
when his mind was made up, earnest and pertinacious in 
the defense of that which he believed to be right. 

TWO HEARTS AS ONI 

Mr. Tarsxf.y: Mr. Speaker, as I stand here, as it were. 
over the open grave of James Laird, it is not of the lawyer, 
the orator or the statesman I am thinking. It is not in any 
of these characters, though he was great in all, that he is 
recalled to me. I see him now as the playmate of my earliest 
boyhood days, the companion and schoolmate of 
my riper youth, and the comrade of the years that followed 
in the field of arms. James I.aird was born in the 
State of New York, but when a mere child his parents 
removed to Hillsdale County, Michigan, then almost a wilderness. 
His father was a native of Scotland, a minister of 
the Presbyterian faith, a man of gTeat intellectual power 
and of wonderful eloquence, qualities richly inherited by 
his son. In that same wilderness, with only the advantages 
and comforts afforded in a pioneer community, we passed 
the first years of our lives together in attending' the district 
school. The village academy followed the district school, 
and then came the war with its tests for separating the 
gold from the dross of American manhood. In IStVj we 
both entered the army. In one of the first regiments to 
leave the State at the beginning of the war each of us had 
two elder brothers. In this organization I enlisted and </seg>

joined his brothers and my own; he enlisted in another regiment, 
lnit am- were not separated, for our regiments were 
assigned to the same division. 

Following every battle in which we were engaged, scarcely 
vtould the tiring cease when he wmilil come with anxious. 
loving heart to find how fared it with those he loved. Once, 
sir. for him there was a sad coming: it was on the night 
that followed that dread day of the -'ml of .Inly at (ieitysburg. 
He came to tind a brother dead: a friend he lined

The appearance of Mr. Laird 

as a speaker before the House of

would I do it; and I would thank (iod that my loyalty to 
my country, as I understand her honor: that my loyalty to 
my general, as 1 understand my duty: that my loyalty to

above the possibility of ignominious change to come 
from cowardly considerations affecting my life or future

Mr. Speaker, is it for this the pioneer has fought? I&gt; 
there no voice that pleads his cause who bravely holds his 
way along- the front of civilization, laying deep anil strom.' 
the foundations of a mighty state? Frum the toil and strife 
of these men sprang Kansas and Nebraska, the- first antislavery 
states, even as in the olden time sprang the avenging 
Maritis from the "dust and ashes." Thus born into the 
sisterhood of states, they have bloomed as might two purple 
flowers rooted in a pool of human blood. We know 
there is nothing in all the unstoried greatness of this class 
that of itself alone should speak to the judicial mind, but 
when laws are passed for their protection it is meet that 
tliii.se who sit upon the softly-cushioned seats of advantage 
should heed those laws in a contest between abstractions 
(corporations) and such men. The human being is entitled 
to the benefit of the doubt; by how much more is he entitled 
to the benefit of the written law! 

These settlers read the laws of Congress granting homesttails 
and pre-emptions to actual settlers; they read the 
instructions of the Department of the Interior, and they 
saw that they were within these. They read the platform 
of the great Republican party which promised them the 
earth if they would vote the straight ticket, and then they 
read the platform of the gTeat Democratic party which 
promised them not only the earth, as the other platform 
did, but everything over it and under it, and they said, "We 
are safe; our friends the politicians will take care of us," 
and they are still strong in their faith; they still hope to"read 
their title clear" in the light of your promises; they 
still believe that Congress — this Congress, gentlemen — want 
to, and will do what is right. And so they come, stripped 
by legal jugglery of their homes. — your "glorious birthright

MY COMRADES 

Mr. Speaker, these men are my constituents; they are 
my neighbors; they are still more, my comrades, for 
in the heroic days nearly nine-tenths of them were Union 
soldiers. This will not prejudice their case with you men 
of the South, for you were brave, and must be generous 
and just. Nearly all of those for whom I plead are known 
to me personally, and accordingly I take a keen and personal 
interest in their rights and wrongs. I have known 
them from the "ground up," for I knew them when they 
lived in the earth, in "dug-outs," and have watched them 
for years, as they spread the seed and gathered the harvest 
which was the trust of the armies of laborers of the world. 
The v have fought a brave fight and redeemed the desert of 
twenty yi ars ago. They are of the class of men that Miller

BOLD, DEFIANT, KI.iiiiIKM 

Early in the first session of the 50th Congress a proposition 
was before the House, to allow a clerk to each member. In its 
behalf it was argoed, that it "would be a measure of economy to 
the entire people." and would "place every member of the House 
on an equality." as fifty-four chairmen of committees were already 
supplied with clerks, and that it would put the poor members 
on an equal footing with the rich, who were able to pay for 
clerks out of their own funds, and could thereby be exempt from 
making the daily, perpetual rounds of the departments, looking 
up the personal business &lt;&gt;f their constituents. 

Against the proposition was paraded the bugbear of ''salary

Nebraska held and uttered decided views.

THI 

SURPLUS. 


a question for |&gt;aving a 

citizen of the South, for army 


taken without vouchers delivered. Mr. Laird said: 

I \\:is reminded, during the discussion of this question, 
by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Warner) of the fact 
that during the war out of which this claim arises it did not 
by any means take a dispensation of Providence to pet a 
mule, and wherever there was anything 1 of an eatable nature 
to be gathered we were there in the midst of it, and it was 
about so also if it was of a ridable nature. 

We hear a great deal said about the surplus in this country; 
and I take it that when it comes to a question about 
the payment of an honest claim we are not banded together 
for the purpose of an increase of that surplus by any 
means. If the Government of the United States would pay 
its honest debts, such debts as it allows to remain unpaid 
until, if a private individual were substituted for the general 
I iovermnent, that private individual would be disgraced and 
driven from the community — if the Government of the United 
States would pay the millions it owes to honest claimants 
representing the French spoliation claims; if it would pay 
the millions which it owes to men on the frontiers for losses 
sustained at the hands of predatory Indians; if it would 
answer as an honest man answers promptly to the claims 
• if the millions of individuals to whom it stands honestly 
indebted to-day, there would be no surplus in the treas- 

ry. I am certainly for the 

payment of this claim.

I fancy, is that he has had his affairs too long in the 
hands of gentlemen who imagined they were better able

It is ¦ notorious fact that until the passage of the Hatch 
bill agriculture as a great productive interest has never 
been represented directly in the councils of the country; 
had never had a half million dollars bestowed upon it. It 
is the industry from which flows the daily life of the Nation, 
and yet anybody who cares to be conversant with the facts 
knows that it has been treated very differently in this country 
from what is the case in Russia, Italy, Sweden, France, 
(iermany. and Austria, whose governments pour out millions 
for the benefit of agriculture and have this department of 
industry represented in their cabinets. 

Dviag a heated discussion in regard to the land office policy 
of ('(imniissioner Sparks under the administration of Mr. Cleveland. 
Mr. Laird indulged in a violent excoriation of that official, 
who had refused to allow him (Laird) to examine the papers in 
the case of a constituent's suspended entry. 

In that connection he paid the following beautiful compliment 
to the pioneer settlers of Nebraska: 

My colleague, Mr. McShane, and myself can speak upon 
this subject with the authority which comes from personal 
knowledge. 

We have known these men in Nebraska "from the ground 
up." because we knew them when they lived in the sod 
house, and have seen them evolve themselves from the sod 
into the frame house and happy home, and have seen the 
wild prairie, which science condemned twenty years ago as 
a desert, pass from the sea of grass in which the bison 
swam into a great land of schools, churches, colleges, 
thrift, civilization and wealth. [Applause.]

of this country lias had a considerable amount of amuse 
ment but a larger amount of mortification from the light 
which has been cast upon this subject by gentlemen lik« 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. McAdoo). It is a eon 
venient thing to say that the settler, the man who stands 
on the ground, is a thief, to the end that he may be pre 
judiced in the minds of gentlemen who know nothing aboil 
it; and so accordingly upon that string all the thousands o 
those who sing of reform are forever playing. </seg>

Mr. I.aird: Nothing. "I am all right"; only I do not propaM 
n&gt; l&gt;e labeled a thief by every demagogue that mistakes 
notoriety for reputation. These gentlemen talk about 
the cattlemen. Is there any man on this floor who is ignorant 
of the fact that it takes thirty-four acres of this land, 
which you are talking of splitting up into rods, feet and 
indies, to graze one steer fur a year'.' (ientleinen talk 
about the cattlemen entering into ¦ conspiracy to get land 
enough to raise a thousand head of cattle on. Why every 
ho knows anything about it knows that the minute 
the] ha\e got to buy the land, that minute they move off. 
If bj holding 160 acres they can hold grazing ground for a 
thousand head, they hold it. but when they have to buy 
the land they move elsewhere. Now where do these men 
come from that I am defending here, and that gentlemen 
on the other side are holding up to obloquy? They come 
from Texas and Missouri. They are Democrats, and they 
do not spend their time invoking blessings upon your heads. 
If there is any man here who does not know that the cattle 
business now and always has been impossible where the 
owner of the herd had to own the land on which it ranged, 
then your ignorance amounts to imbecility. 

Wain, gentlemen talk about fences, and draw a fancy 
picture with which to harrow up the fears of those who are 
ignorant of the whole matter. I have been inside those in- </seg>

homesteader? Be sa\s. "(ireat (Jod! let the fences alone. 
They furnish mm- ¦ sure pasturage for jny little bunch of 
cattle so that I know where they are. but if the fences are 
torn down I shall not know where they range, and I can 
not afford to herd them." Misfortune has in many cases 
robbed the cattle men of 7."&gt; |&gt;er cent of their herds, anil at

the flijrht of the cattle, and what happens? They die and 
are piled up by the thousands at the barrier. And long before 
the proclamation of the Executive the cattle men were 
willing to take down the fences and get rid of them. 

Now as to the question presented by the amendment, if 
there is anything to be done, let it be the reservation of 
every permanent water course, and not the proposition of

Always prominent in state affairs, he- bore a conspicuous 
part in forming the present constitution of his adopted 
state, whence he was three times elected a member of

approved by his constituents. Endowed with a profusion of 
naiiirr's choicest gifts, a vigorous and comprehensive intellect,

eloquence, courage, and tender sentiment, a fine physique, 
health, strength, and manly bearing -he ought to have

hadows fall nearest the pathesirahle 
and life's work most 

to one of the youngest and 
;i surprise and a sorrow to his 
upon this floor. 

No extended delineation 

f his character will be at- 

Iited by me. Standing in this presence, to say that he 
no faults would be to claim for him that he was not 
in. and would l&gt;e as offensive to him living as untruth&gt;f 
him dead. Be despised shams and pretenses in all 
forms. What he seemed, he was. what he thought, he 
what he felt was right, he did. He sought the foe in 
open field, refused atnlmsh. and practiced no disguise, 
ichieve success or promote a personal end he never 

compromised with an enemy and never betrayed a friend. 
He feared no man nor hated one. He !&gt;elieved in God and 
loved his fellow man. The generosity of his nature was as 
lioumlless as the prairies of his home, where the sun seta 
as on the sea. In the softer charities of human weal, in the 
relation of husband and father, he never lived. Two brothers 
fell fighting by his side on the battlefield, and another 
«as killed by accident on the western plains. An aged 
father, then a widowed mother left him. some years ago, 
the sole surviving member of his family, "to walk the path 
of life alone." 

A« a citizen, .lames Laird was public spirited, progressive, 
lilteral and wise. As a lawyer, he was able, earnest, industrious 
and faithful to the interest of those he served. As 
a soldier, he was ever found at the post of duty, displaying 
the highest form of moral courage, seeing and knowing a 
danger, yet daring to meet it. Bold, dashing and impetuous, 
he was a born leader of men. inspiring confidence by 
the exhibition of his own courage, commanding obedience </seg>



            <seg id="p057">
by this strong- and unyielding will, and winning admiration 
by the quickness and correctness of his judgment. Like 
every true soldier, the flag of his country was ever the object 
of his veneration. To him that flag was not simply a 
few yards of tri-colored bunting, but a symbol of majesty 
and power. It was the emblem of his country, her greatness, 
her beneficence, and her power. heF people, her institutions, 
and her laws: with every rod of territory, where 
might be seen or felt the print of human foot, the touch 
of human hand or the beat of human heart, sacredly dedicated 
to liberty, justice and right. But, Mr. Speaker, the 
fires of passion that burned unceasingly in his being are 
quenched. The currents of the rich red blood of health 
that coursed through liis veins are choked at the fountain. 
The warm glow of health. tha"t literally flowed off his 
finger ends, is chilled. And during the long weary months 
of pain and sickness, when strength failed, when the strong 
will was bowed and broken, when the bright and powerful 
intellect was clouded, when burdened with the weight of 
public cares and duties undischarged for want of health. 
worn and worried because of promises yet unfulfilled and 
useful work uncompleted, friends, in kindness all, could not 
be made to feel that he whose strong right arm had turned 
aside the blow not aimed at self, that he who oft had met 
the storm of l&gt;attle undismayed, indeed was faint and weak 

Under such a strain endurance ceased, the mind was 
turned, the heart was grieved, and in solitude he sought 
relief. 

He closed liis door for rest and peace and thus to him 
came death. 

Of him I say what I believe. He kept a faithful friendship 
with his friends, whom loyally he served before himself. 
He locked his lips too close to tell a lie. He wasln- I 
his hands too white to touch a bribe. 

Eccupying only one congressional term, the above was the 
f lengthy address presented by Mr. Laws, to the House — 
address so honest in utterance, so pure in taste, and lont 
in liiiii'iiaL'P. as to be a veritable surprise and charm. </seg>

I ["he debut of Mr. Connell in the House of Representative-* was 
the role of scholarly eulogist, rather than that of political

predecessor, Mr. Connell addressed the House as follows: 

Mr. Speaker, once more the busy turmoil of the House 
is hushed in memory of the dead. All differences, political 
or sectional are silenced. Contentions and controver 
sies are forgotten while with a common sorrow we offer 
our tributes to the memory of a departed brother. In 
summing up the life and character of my late colleague 
from Nebraska I would not, if I could, paint a picture free 
from blemishes. Frailties are incident to the m&lt;&gt; 
alted characters. Faults and failings are the shadow* 
which nature, no less than art, demands for her most perfect 
work. As a new member I had hoped to have received 
the friendly counsel of my colleague in place of joining 
in this memorial service. During the three terms of a 
member of the 48th, 49th, and 50th Congresses he \v;i* a 
striking and picturesque character on the floor of this 
House. He was a remarkable combination of extremes. 
His character was of the composite type, having in it the 
ruggedness and grandeur of the mountain, with the genial

all sides were his services demanded, and to everv call he

unable to fill his engagements for the last days of the

FREE COINAGE 

Though Mr. Connell's debut in the House was in the role of 
scholarly eulogist rather than that of political orator, on the 
-1st day of June. 18t6, &lt;&gt;n a bill involving free coinage of silv.-r. 
he indulged in a strain of wit and irony. 

Mr. Speaker Like my friend from Nevada I Mr. liartine) 
I am a new member from "the wild and woolv West." 

I am free to admit that I

perienced so far as tin- nil 
are concerned. It may be 
knowledge and inexperienc 

haw only a limited knowledge 
&gt;n. I confess that I am inex- 

¦s and practices of this House 
that it is due to such limited 

that I am unable to under- 

stand the position of Uepuhliran menil&gt;ers about me who 
declare in favor of free coinage and vote in the opposite 
direction. There is much regarding the rules and procedure 
of this House which I do not understand. But 1 do not 
propose in the brief space of two minutes, which has been 
yielded to me, to undertake to tell all, I do not know, aa 
that would be impossible. I do wish, however, to refer to 
one thing I can not understand, and that is. why this is 
made a political question. I can not see why a line shoulc 
be drawn through the center of this hall, dividing 1 Democrats 
and Republicans. I deny that this is- a political ques 
tipn. It is above and beyond that, and if you wait until the 
roll is called you will hear members on the other side vot 
ing according to their convictions, not their political convictions, 
but according to their belief on this question o 
free coinage. </seg>



            <seg id="p061">

Then uhv. on this si. If. should not members who are in 
favor of free ami unlimited coinage of silver vote ai'cnrdiiijr 
to their convictions, rota as the representatives of the 
people who sent them here? Why do not the western members, 
who know the sentiment of the West, stand up like 
men and vote according to their convictions and not vote 
according to the speeches they have been delivering here 
in this House? 

Now, Mr. Speaker, there is one other thing I do not understand, 
ami that is wh\ those who favored limited debate 
when the silver bill was originally discussed are now pleading 
for time for its further consideration. If not for the 
purpose of "burying" the bill, it must be to suspend it, like 
Mohammed's coffin, "between high heaven and earth." 

I am in favor of meeting all questions arising under the 
aim'iidiiM'iits proposed by the Senate right here and now. 

Jul.v 14. ISM, Mr. Connell entered an emphatic protest against 
a bill grutiag additional special privileges to the Baltimore &amp; 
Potomac Kailroad. 

Mr. Chairman, I am in favor of this amendment. When 
it (the bill) first came up for discussion a few weeks ago, 
after carefully reading its provisions, I was a good deal 
puzzled to understand how any member of this House, 
having any regard for the interest of the people, or the 
rights of the public could approve it. It seemed to me to 
indicate on its face that it was an unmitigated steal. I could 
not but regard it as a bold attempt to obtain something for 
nothing. 

I do not know where the bill originated, but if we can 
judge by the ear-marks it is safe to assert that it was prepared 
by some salaried attorney of the Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company, solely in the interest of that great corporation, 
and in utter disregard of the rights of the people. 

GAG RILE 

August '.». 1890, on a bill touching the interests of a small 
remnant of an Indian tribe in his district, he demanded independent 
action on questions non-political and non-partisan in 
the following strain: 

Mr. Speaker, I might talk here for three hours instead 
t fifteen minutes. I might read at length the voluminous 
timony which is before me, but what avail would it be. 

AN VXMITIGATBD STEAL 
</seg>





            <seg id="p062">
when we are prevented from tnkinjr any action with refrrenee 
to this senate amendment? This resolution, which 
I have opposed, has the effect of a pap rule. Now I fail to 

see. in consideration of matters of this kind which are not 
political in their character, why such a resolution should 
be supported by the members on this side of the House, 
merely because it comes from the committee on rules, a 
majority of which are Republicans. 

EIGHT HOUR LAW 

On the 28th day of August, 1890, he called up a bill prescribing 
eight hours as a legal day's work for laborers, workmen 
and mechanics employed by the Government of the United 
Suites. In his management of Tin- affirmative side of the debate 
he evinced a very commendable degree of efficiency for a new 
member in his first term, and in debate displayed much research, 
abounding in faultless statement, deep conviction and well 
chosen periods, meriting and receiving the hearty applause of 
the House. 

The closing paragraphs of the argument were as follows: 

Mr. Speaker, on one occasion, many years ago, in the conideration 
of a great financial problem by this House, the 

brilliant but eccentric Randolph, of Roanoke, tragically 
exclaimed: "I have found it. I have discovered the philosopher's 
stone. It is pay as you go." I do not claim to be 
a Randolph, or to be possessed of the remarkable gifts 
which made him such a striking and picturesque character 
in the history of our country. I do claim, however, that 
the philosopher's stone has again been discovered, and that 
a remedy for the evils of the present labor system has 
been found which will bring happiness to the wage worker 
and peace and prosperity to capital. It is to so raise wages 
and reduce the hours of toil as will make life worth living 
and give work to the unemployed. 

Why should not the wage worker have some of the sunshine 
and leisure of life to enjoy the beauties of nature 
and the comforts of his home? 

The poet Goethe has truly said: "Every man should hear 
a little music, read a little poetry, and see a fine picture 
every day of his life, in order that the worldly cares of life 
may not blot out the sense of the beautiful implanted by 
God in the soul." As the tired laborer drags himself homeward 
after 10 or 12 hours of weary toil, what are these 
words of the poet to him but hollow mockery? Where is </seg>


            <seg id="p063">

his opportunity for recreation and enjoyment, where the 
time for cultivating the sense of the l&gt;eaiitiful? The sky 

may be azvire blue: the heavens may be studded with sparkling 
gems; and all nature may rejoice; but the weary wage 
worker trvdgeu along- his way unconscious of it all: the 
sense of the beautiful has well nigh been blotted out of 
his soul. 

All hail the dawn of a new day breaking. 
When a strong-armed nation shall take awav 

The weary burdens from backs that are aching- 
With maximum labor and minimum pay."

March 4th, 1891. 

George \V. E. Dorsey was Itorn in London County, Virginia. 
January SSth, 1842; removed with his parents to Prescott 
County in L8M; WM educated at private schoolB and Oak Hill 
A&lt; -:idi'iny ; recruited a company and entered the 1'iiion Army in 
August, 1861, M first lieutenant Sixth West Virginia Infantry; 
was promoted to the rank of captain and of major, and was nius 
tared out with the Army of the Sliciianiloah, in August. ' 
removed to Nebraska in L8M; studied law and was admitted to 
tin- bar in 1810; in L874 eagftged in banking at Fremont. an&lt;l 
continued in the business, achieving very great success; wu a 
member of the Board of Trustees of the Insane Hospital, a mem 
ber and vice-president of the State Board of Agriculture of Xe 
bra8ka: was also chairman of the Republican State Central 
Committee: and in 1884 was elected a Representative from Nebraska 
to the 49th Coagn 

Dariag the 4!tth Congress Mr. Dorsey received his initiation 
into the mysteries of national legislation, and addressed the 
House in a contested election case, also upon a bill to protect the 
dairy interest from that of oleomargarine, and in the interest of 
settlers upon public lands, and in behalf of pensioners. 

I recapitulation, from the index to the lln-nnl of the 6#th Con 
s. gives a fair average of the current duties of the Nebraska 
ber in the twentieth year of the State's existence. Bills and 
t resolutions introduced were fifty-three, and petitions and

&gt;sed by lobby agents or attorneys before committees the 
iber had as arduous duties to perform as an attorney before

labors in committee of the whole, and then again in the

May 1st. 1888, Mr. Doraey opened his discussion of the subject 
with a history of tin- wool interest of the United States from 
1610, the date of sheep importation. 

In announcing his conclusion he said 

Mr. flull ¦Mil, it will Ih 1 seen from these facts that under

great interest of the farmthe 
protective system and 

There is no good reason 

Turning attention to the benefits of protection to the interests 
of agriculture, he placed great reliance upon a report of "J. R. 
Dodge, the statistician of the Agricultural Department for more 
than a generation"; a man, however, who has been severely 
criticised for his attempt to warp and construe national figures 
to the interest of his favorite party. The historical argument 
was also reinforced by reference to the repeal of the corn laws 
of Great Britain, from which he claimed that the promises of 
Cobden and Bright, members of Parliament, were not realized. 
Taking up the tariff reform messages of President Cleveland, 
attention was called to many of his declarations. 

We are told that— 

k" Millions of our people who never use and never saw any 
the foreign products purchase and use things of the </seg>



            <seg id="p066">

¦kind made in this country, and pay therefor nearly 
te the same enhanced price which the duty adds to 
lported articles." 

Kis a serious error if intended to apply generally to 
actured necessaries in common use, as a little atten) 
facts will show. 

We are further told that 

"The worker in manufactures receives at the desk of his 
niplover his wages, and perhaps before he reaches his 

Kis obliged, in his purchase for his family use of an 
which embraces his own labor, to return in the payof 
the increase in price which the tariff permits the 
arni'd compensation of many days of toil." 

I this were a common occurrence, as is intimated, it 
i be a serious matter, liut what are the facts? What 
ifactures are chiefly consumed by "workers in manu- 
Their food is for the most part necessarily of 
production. The cost of meat and bread can be very 
affected by the tariff. The tariff upon sugar is more 

considerable than that upon any other article of food and 
affects the cost of living of wage workers more than that 
upon all other food products combined. 

Doubtless all will agree with the President that such 
articles as do not in any way compete with our own products 
should be placed upon the free list. Probably we 
might safely, also, place upon the free list some things 
which we produce to a very limited extent, but for any considerable 
production of which our soil, climate, or other 
conditions are unfavorable. 

The President has received much praise in certain quarters 
for his courage in advocating radical tariff reduction. 
This Congress may well hesitate before entering upon s 
course fraught with such apparent peril, even if it fails to 
receive like approbation from the same source. In endeavoring 
to steer our financial bark from the Scylla of 
treasury accumulation we should be careful to avoid wrecking 
it in the Charybdis of gold exportation. 

¦. Chairman, we all agree upon two propositions, namely, 
the surplus should be reduced and that our revenue 
should be revised. 

Then what is our duty? Should we not deal with these 
.(u.stions in a businesslike manner? I think so. Then let 
us do those things which are for the best interests of the 
country, and at all times be guided by the experience of the 
past. Let us follow the course so plainly marked out, turning 
away from the seductive pleadings of the theorist and 
following the advice of the practical business men of the </seg>



            <seg id="p067">
country. Each member upon this floor has fixed opinions 
upon the questions under consideration, and probably no 
two could agree in all details as to what is the true policy. 
Notwithstanding this fact, it is the duty of every member 
to submit for consideration the views he may entertain and 
then try to reconcile the differences that may exist. In my 
judgment it is the duty of the President to at once expend 
the surplus now in the treasury in purchasing and retiring 
our bonds. 

Then Congress should authorize the disbursement of the 
one hundred millions of gold now held in the treasury for 
the redemption of the legal-tender notes. The holding of 
this vast sum is the height of folly. Why should the Govment 
lie required to hold within its own vaults any sum to 
make pood its promise to pay? Using the surplus now in 
the treasury and the one hundred millions of gold he would 
at once put into circulation over 000,000,000 that are now 
hoarded, and the obligation of the government upon which 
we are paying interest would be decreased that amount less 
the premium upon the bonds. 

To prevent such aeeumulations in the treasury in the 
future, we should have a fair, just and equitable revision of 
our revenue laws. This should l&gt;e done after a careful investigation 
and a patient hearing of all the interests a" 
by the changes proposed. The principle of protection to 
the interests that have been developed in this country 
should nev-r be forgotten. If we could place lumber, coal 
and salt on the free list, and reduce the duty on sugar and 
molasses so the revenue arising therefrom should not exceed 
$10,000,000 per annum, and use the portion of th;r 
.-try to encourage sugar-growing in the country, the 
revenues vvo\ild he reduced to the extent required and the 
people of the country benefited and no industry injured. 

If we pass the bill under consideration, we strike down 
and destroy one of our most important agricultural industries, 
in which over one million of our people are inter. 
we will force a reduction of the compensation paid to over 
two millions of wage-workers in the different industries 
affected by the reductions in duty made in the bill; we give 
the Canadian farmer a market for his products, and place 
him upon an equal footing with our farmers of "the North 
and West. Time will not allow me to show all the vicious 
provisions of this bill. It should and would be defeated.

BEET SUGAR. 

On the 20th of May, 1890, Mr. Dorsey argued 

I think we should encourage the beet-sugar industry, that 

is attracting so much interest at this time. Germany did 
that and is doing it now and also the Republic of France, 
(iermany not only lays a duty upon sugar, but pays a 
bounty upon the domestic product from beets. France does 
the same, and if gentlemen on this committee will take the 
time and will carefully read the report made by the Senate 
Committee on Agriculture and notice what is said by 
the Agricultural Department regarding the capabilities of 
this country, I am sure they will agree with me, that in 
fifteen years, if we do not strike down the protective system 
and put sugar upon the free list, the States of Iowa, Kansas, 
Nebraska. California and South Dakota can produce all 
the sugar consumed in the United States. Mr. Chairman, 
the farmers of my district will ask. if I vote for this bounty, 
which I may have to do — [Laughter and applause on the 
Democratic side. I 

Mr. Dockeky: Why do you feel obligated to 

Mr. Dorney: I say. while I may have to vote for this bill, 
they will ask why have you not given us a bounty upon 
corn? 

Mr. Dockeky: Yes. of course they will, and very properly 

Mr. Dorsey: Corn is not profitable in Nebraska, and has 
not been for years; and they may ask why we do not put a 
bounty upon honey and protect the little busy bee. Laughter.! 


Mr. Oithwait: P.nt you put l&gt;ees-wax on the free list. 

Mb. Dorset: I am opposed to that. I think the bee ought 
fo be protected. 

I am a protectionist and a Republican; and I think if the 
Republican party puts sugar on the free list and strikes 
down the protective system they make an argument stronger 
than any that may be made by an advocate of free trade on 
the floor of the Houses. 

Again, upon the same day, Mr. Dorsey, the protectionist, wm 
found advocating free lumber. — "In obedience to the wishes of 
the people of Nebraska, as expressed by joint resolution passed 
by the Legislative Assembly of the State."' 

In the last days of his congressional term Mr. Dorsey, as chairman 
of the Committee on Banks and Currency, called up a bill </seg>



            <seg id="p069">
for an increase of bank issues, to the full amount of deposited 
bouds. instead of the former maximum of !)0 per cent. Said he: 

Some gentlemen upon the floor of the House and in private 
conversation have claimed that the national banks are 
close corporations. This is not so now. Any five gentlemen 
of standing in any town or city of this country can. if 
they will raise $50,000. organize a national hank. Of course, 
there is not much money in the business now. The banking 
interests of the country have served the business interests 
of the country. Xow if the House pass this bill it will 
be an encouragement of the national banks to continue 
to hold the bonds that they are holding to-day at a 
positive loss, and it will give them cause to hope that this 
Congress will pass such a measure as will perpetuate the 
national banking system of the country. I know it was 
popular some years ago. especially in the West, to cry out 
against the national banks, but I am happy to say that day 
has passed. Now. as I have said, to pass this measure will 
encourage the national banks, and will encourage other 
private banks and state banks to go into the national 
system; and I ask the House, as a matter of justice to 
the banks, to pass this bill. 

His tiiiiil contribution to the literature of Congress was on the 

last day of his third term, when through the Comjnxsional 
Hniiid lie introduced a voluminous newsjiajMT article eulopizin^ 
the first two wars of the administration of President Harrison. </seg>

HON. .IIUIN A. M. SHANK 

March 4th, 1887— March 4th, 1889 

John A. McShane. of Omaha, was born in New I,exington. 
Perry County. Ohio. August SSth, I860, ami worked upon a farm 
until twenty one years of mgt, receiving only such education as 
could be obtained in the common schools; in 1871 went to Wyom 
ing Territory and was employed on a cattle ranch: in 1873 became 
a cattle owner: in 1S74 he removed to Omaha, but retained 
his interest in Wyoming until 1883, when he merged his individual 
cattle interest in the Bay State Live Stock Company, of 
which lie is a director: he was one of the promoters of the I'nion 
Mock .Yards at South Omaha, and is president of the company: 
he was also a promoter of and a director in the South Omaha 
Imm4 Company: is a director in the First National Bank in 
Omaha and helped to organize, and is president of. the I'ninn 
Stock Yards P.ank at South Omaha: in 1886 he was elected to 
the lower house of the State Legislature from Omaha for hra 
years; in 1882 he was elected for another term: in 18M he was 
chosen to the State Senate, and was elected to the 50th Con 
gress, as a Democrat, receiving 23,396 votes against l»».:i~3 for 
Church Howe. Republican. 

Being an intelligent Democrat, and in all things a practical 
worker, it is not to be considered a matter of astonishment that 
the modes of purchasing army supplies arrested his attention, 
and evoked from the first elected Democrat from Nebraska adverse 
criticism. 

Mr. McShane: It has been the custom heretofore in the 

purchase of such supplies to concentrate them at two 
points, namely, in .Teffersonville, Ind., and in Philadelphia. 
Pa. These were the two general depots of supplies for the 
army, and from these two points the supplies were distributed 
throughout the country to the various posts and sta- 

tions. Now, it was not part of the duty of the Secretary of 
War, where the supplies had been concentrated at these 
two points — or rather I should say he was not enabled to </seg>



            <seg id="p071">
purchase where he could purchase cheapest, for the reason 
that it was necessary to concentrate the supplies at the 
points named, and proximity to those points was often an 
element in determining the purchase. 

I will state .to the gentleman that the amendment proposed 
by my colleague from Nebraska (Mr. Laird) is intended 
to take the place of provisions in former bills. It 
provides that the purchase of these supplies shall be made 
where they can be bought cheapest; but one of the most 
important elements of cheapness may be the cost of transjHirtation. 
I do not BM how there can be any objection 
to such an amendment as that, and from the fact that the 
distributing point in former bills has been stricken from 
this bill. So that it is simply right and proper that a provision 
should be put in this bill compelling the Department 
to purchase where they can purchase cheapest on the conditions 
named. 

Two important objects were to be obtained by the amend 
ment proposed, the one to purchase in the cheapest market and

LAND 

SYSTEM. 

I lie land system was also an object of very special interest, 
eil. paramount to all others, on account of the agricultural 
rests of the State, and the fact that ¦ majority of the settlers 
e yet awaiting the maturity of their titles. The administraof 
President Cleveland had found the land laws evaded 
violated l&gt;y all the adroitness of land shark syndicates and 
vidual frauds. Large cattle ranges had been fenced and 
rded. pre-emption claims fraudulently located and sold. To 
ore these claims to market required the services of soldiers 
special agents. That mistakes were sometimes made by the 
detectives cannot be doubted, but as their acts were not </seg>

need officials and the correction of errors. 

this subject Mr. Methane uttered his sentiments as 

In offering the amendment to this paragraph and in any 
remarks I made in support of the amendment I do not re- 

call that in any manner I east any reflection upon the Com 
missioner of the General Land Office or the management o 
the General Land Office so far as the administration of tha 
office is concerned. That was far from my mind, but the 
action and procedure of the special agents in the field is 
what I object to. In providing the necessary funds to en 
alil&lt;- the (leneral Land Office to detect frauds and prose 
cute fraudulent entries I will go as far as any gentleman 
on this floor. 

Hut I sav here that the special agents of the Genera 
Land Office in the field do not confine themselves to the 
fraudulent entries on the public lands, but rather, in my 
section especially, to the prevention of honest homestead 
ers from securing titles to their claims. This is what 
object to. I believe $50,000 is amply sufficient to provide 
the necessary special agents for the detection of fraudu 
lent entries by cattle syndicates, or any other syndicates 

cither foreign or domestic, in their fraudulent land entries. 
Hence, it is not necessary that we should appropriate 50,-000 
additional for the purpose, as I have named, of persecuting 
honest homesteaders in the agricultural states of 
Nebraska and Kansas. 

1 say that this money has been to a certain degree 
squandered, and I say further that this fraud has not been 
perpetrated by Democratic officials or special agents, but 
in most cases by Republican special agents who have held 

&gt;\er from preceding administrations, 

Mb. Laird: Put them out. 

Mr. McSiianf.: Some of them have been put out 

Mr. Laird: Put the rest out. 

Mr. McSha^e: I say that those special agents have carried 
on this process of the persecution of honest homesteaders 
to an extent working great hardship and inconvenience 
to those poor people who have undergone the 
hardships and sacrifices of frontier life to the end that 
they might secure homes for themselves and their children. 

I have knowledge of cases where the special agents have 
expended $1,800 in an endeavor to procure testimony that 
would defeat the claim of a settler. After expending this 

PBCIAL AGENTS </seg>



            <seg id="p073">
amount of money they found the title of the settler complete 
as it was possible to make it; that he had in every 
particular complied with the law. Even after expending 
this amount of money the special agent made request of 
the General Land Office for $1,200 more to continue the 
prosecution and the gathering of testimony against this 
settler. That would make $3,000 expended in prosecuting 
one case. 

After spending the $l,S0O and finding nothing, he suspended 
the case until he could get $1,200 more. 

This is a matter I am opposed to. Those are the proceedings 
to which I am opposed to appropriate money to 
continue. But so far as the honest prosecution of fraudulent 
land entries, whether they are made by individuals, 
cattle syndicates, or any other syndicates is concerned. I 
will go as far as any gentleman in appropriating the necessary 
funds. 

EXORBITANT CHARGES 

Understanding that clerks and notaries public were in the 
habit of charging exorbitant prices for the taking of testimony 
in certain proof cases, he advocated an amendment, not to exceed 
|3 per case. 

Mn. Mi Shane: Under the existing law notaries public 
and clerks of the district courts in the different counties 
have the power to take the testimony of the final proof and 
forward the same to the district land office. In the majority 
of cases the final proof is taken before the clerk of 
the district court in the county in which the homestead is 
located. The existing law does not fix the amount of fees 
to be charged in such cases; but where the proof is taken 
before the district land office the fees are limited. The 
charges usually in such cases before the clerk of the district 
court and county clerk are from two to five dollars, 
and are in excess of the amount allowed where the proofs 
are taken before the register or receiver. An imposition is 
being practiced all through the West on homesteaders making 
their final proofs from the fact that even at the exorbitant 
price charged by those officers it is cheaper than to 
pay railroad fare in many cases 75 or 100 miles to the district 
office. I hope the committee will accept this amendment. 
It is only to guard against the imposition of the 
officers in the different counties. 

LAND MONOPOLY

            <seg id="p074">
Eession of 450,000 acres of land under the "desert-land act." 
e each citizen was limited to an entry of only 640 acres, waa 
ifest on a bill to prevent monopoly in the public lands. 

Mr. McShane: I am going to state just how it occurred. 
I find syndicates who procure men who make their declarations 
and take up the lands under the desert-land act. and 
after they have paid the amount necessary to procure the 
possession of the lands these syndicates perform the necessary 
work required under the law to make the final proof. 
That I will say, the first declaration of the first settler, 
and, by the way, he is not required to live on the land, but 
to make certain improvements; he is not even required to 

go to the land district to make his filing under the law, 
but his filing 1 is placed upon record, and the syndicates perform 
the necessary requirements from that time on during 
the period of three years to effect and complete the improvements 
and secure the title. They have an assignment 
of the claims from the original party and when the 
proofs are completed we find the claims being transferred 
and the patents issued to the syndicate performing the improvements 
of the land. 

&lt; &gt;n an occasion when the question was upon fees received from 
homestead proofs covered into the treasury, and not thereafter 
expended, in full, for clerical services, in cases where land 
officers had to bear part of the outlay from their own salaries, 
Mr. McShane. as usual, remembered the toiling settler. 

HoMKSTKAD HEI.IEP 

Mr. McShane: I am speaking of the fees collected from 
homesteads. The last report of the Commissioner of the 
General Land Office shows that the revenue from homesteads 
alone for 1887 was nearly $1,700,000; $1,700,000 collected 
from the settlers on the public domain, who are supposed 
to have little, in many cases nothing at all, not even 
enough to pay necessary legal fees in proving up their 
claims. 

Is it pretended that this Government is to collect from 
this class of people a revenue of $1,700,000 in every year 
when we must admit that the intention of the law was that 
the minimum amount should be collected from settlers 
on the public domain— only enough to meet the expense of 
maintaining the clerical force? In 1834 there was $145,000 
appropriated for clerk-hire and contingent expenses in one 
hundred and six offices. In addition to this the registers </seg>



            <seg id="p075">
and receivers received all of the fees collected for reducing 
testimony to writing, and also for the furnishing of abstracts 
and plats, but in the present bill, with one hundred 
and eleven land offices, the committee appropriate only 
$150,000 and cover into the treasury the fees collected. Of 
the $120,000 that was appropriated for contingent expenses 
last year $86,000 was covered into the treasury, leaving a 
balance of only $34,000 in that fund. Now, I desire to say 
that the money appropriated by this bill is not money 
taken out of the treasury at all. The salaries of the registers 
and receivers, and also of the clerical force in the 
local land offices are based upon the amount of fees collected 
in those offices, and if there is not $3,000 collected 
in fees the officer does not get that amount. 

This money is appropriated merely as a guaranty fund; 
it is collected back from settlers proving up on their 
claims; so that in the appropriation of this money there is 
not a dollar of real expenditure on the part of the Government. 
The settlers pay the money into the local land 
offices, and from there it is covered into the treasury and 
appropriated back by Congress for the payment of the 
cX|H'nses of the service. 

KKKE IKON AND STEEL. 

"When ¦ tariff liill was under discussion, with a provision that 
"Iron and steel hoops for cotton tics and baling purposes" 
should come in free, and a clamor was raised that such legislation 
would Ik- a special favor to the South. Mr. McShane offered 
an amendment, and said: 

Mr. Mi Shane: I am in favor of admitting hoop-iron of the 
class mentioned in this paragraph free of duty, provided 
that when admitted it may be used for any purpose whatever. 
The amendment that I offer will accomplish that object 
and admit iron and steel hoops not thinner than No. 20 
wire gauge free of duty and will allow the same to be used 
for whatever purpose parties may choose to use them. 

Mr. Batnk: I suggest to the gentleman that he will not 
fully accomplish his purpose by his amendment, because 
they use more wire than hoop-iron for baling. 

Mn. McShane: I want them to have the privilege of using 
hoop-iron if they see fit. and I merely want to say now, 
because I do not wish to take up the time of the House, that 
upon a failure to allow this hoop-iron to be used for any </seg>

A FAITHFUL WORKER 

The Congressional Record shows that while Mr. McShantgave 
special attention to the subject of lands, the Committees 
of Indian Affairs and Public Buildings were those to which he 
was specially assigned, and which were of vital importance to 
the new state. From the Committee of Public Buildings it was 
his good fortune to have reported in favor of T'nited States buildings 
at Omaha, Beatrice and Hastings; and from Indian AtT 
in behalf of the interests of the Flatheads, Omahas, rmatillas 
and Winnebagoes. 

The list of pension applications presented by him, and argu&gt;'&lt;] 
before the committee, was. as usual, voluminous; while Western 
Territories appealed to the kindly offices of one who had far 
exceeded many of their citizens in a residence west of tin- 
Missouri. 

As a man of active business habits, he was known as a 
worker, more than a mere talker; and before the end of a single 
term was longing for the interchangeable recreation of life upon 
the range with that of the board of trade, the counting house 
and railroad construction </seg>

March l!t. 1800; attended public school until fifteen years of age, 
spending his vacations on the farm; in the fall of 1875 entered 
Whipple Academy ai Jacksonville. Illinois: filtered Illinois College, 
Jacksonville, in 1877; completed a classical course and was 
graduated with the highest honors in 1881; attended Union 
College of Law. Chicago, Illinois, for two years, during which 
time he was connected with the office of ex-Senator Lyman 
Trumbull; began the practice of his profession at Jacksonville; 
removed to Lincoln, Nebraska, October 1, 1887. and became a 
member of the firm of Talbot &amp; Bryan; never held an elective 
office prior to his election to Congress; was elected to the Fiftysecond 
congress as a Democrat, receiving 32,376 votes, against 
LTi.t.t;:: votes for William J. Connell, Republican; 13,066 votes 
for Allen Root, Independent; 1,670 votes for E. H. Chapin, Prohibitionist, 
and 8 votes scattering. 

He was renominated by acclamation in 1892, met his opponent 
in joint debate and was elected by 140 plurality, in a district 
giving the Republican State ticket 6,000 plurality. To defeat 
him Governor Foraker and McKinley, of Ohio, entered the canvass. 
He was again placed on the Ways and Means Committee 
and took an active part in preparing the tariff bill of 1894. 
Three years from his arrival in Nebraska he was nominated and 
first elected to congress. During joint discussions with Hon. 
W. J. Connell, in a campaign memorable for honorable competition 
and manly decorum, the culmination came in the following 

CLASSICAL EPISODE. 

Mr. Bryan to Mr. Connell: We now bring to a close this 
series of debates, which was arranged by our committees. 
I am glad that we have been able to conduct these discussions 
in a courteous and friendly manner. If I have in 
anyway offended in word or deed, I offer apology and regret.

and as freely forgive. I desire to present to you in remembrance 
of these pleasant meetings, this little volume, because 
it contains "Gray's Elegy," in the perusal of which I 
trust you will find as much pleasure and profit as I have. 
It is one of the most beautiful and touching' tributes to 
humble life that literature contains. Grand in its sentiment 
and sublime in its simplicity, we can both find in it a solace 
in victory or defeat. If success should crown your efforts in 
this campaign and it should be your lot 

The applause of listening- senates to command 

And I am left 

"A youth to fortune and to fame unknown 

Forget not us, who in the common walks of life perform 
our part, but in the hour of your triumph recall the verse: 

"Let not ambition mock their useful toil. 
Their homely joys and destinies obscure, 

Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile 
The short and simple annals of the poor." 

If, on the other hand, by the verdict of my countrymen 
I should be made your successor, let it not be said of you — 

"And melancholy marked him for her own 

But find sweet consolation in the thought 

rFull many a gem of purest ray serene 
The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear; 

Full many a flower is born to blush unseen. 
And waste its sweetness on the desert air." 

But whether the palm of victory is given to you or to me, 
let us remember those of whom the poet says: 

Far from the madding- crowd's ignoble strife. 
Their sober wishes never learned to stray; 

Along the cool, sequestered vale of life 
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way." 

These are the ones most likely to be forgotten by government. 
When they cry out for relief they too often hear no 
answer but the "echo of their cry." while the rich, the 
strong, the powerful are given an attentive ear. 

For this reason is class legislation dangerous and deadly; 
it takes from the least able to give and gives to those who 
are least in need. The safety of our farmers and our laborers 
is not in special legislation, but in equal and just laws, 
that bear alike on every man. The great mass of our people 
are interested, not in getting their hands into other 
people's pockets, but in keeping the hands of other people 
out of their pockets. 

Let me in parting express the hope that you and I may </seg>

be instrumental in brinpinp our government back to better 
laws, which will treat every man in all our land alike 
without repard to creed or condition. I bid you a friendly 
farewell. 

REXOMIXATIOX DECLINED. 

As the cud of his second congressional term tpproAcked.il the 
fall of 1894, Mr. Bryan declined to be a candidate for re-election, 
and was announced as a candidate for United States Senator, 
according to ¦ provision of The constitution of Nebraska. Havin. 
been endorsed by a Free-Silver Democratic State Convention, 
which also adopted the Populist candidate for Governor, he en 
tered upon the campaign with all his accustomed zeal and power. 
Had the Populists and Democrats elected a majority of the legislature 
his election to the Senate was generally conceded. 

Of joint debates, with the Hon. John M. Tburston, who vrai 
elected to the Senate by a Republican legislature, it is saf 
say. that no such wild enthusiasm ever before possessed Ne 
braska audiences: and no greater display of forensic eloquentever 
repaid their &lt;levoted attention. 

HONORABLE PROMOTION 

On his first election, as the second Democrat from the Stan 

and predicated on his splendid canvass, party papers at on«e 
demanded for him unusual recognition upon the committees of 
the House. In addition to this, his Illinois friend, Mr. Springer, 
was made chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, and 
knowing of the ability and acquirements of the young member 
from the West desired him as a colleague. But to the members, 
generally, he was only a legislative novice from a purely agri 
cultural state. On the 16th of March, 1892. he delivered a tariff 
speech of which a correspondent said: 

When William Jenninps Bryan arose in his seat in the 
House last week to address that body on the tariff question 
those who knew him best did not doubt that he would 
do himself and his party credit, but even his most sanguine 
friends were unprepared for the sensation that his speech 
created. It is no stretch of the imagination to say that this 
speech was a sensation, for rarely before in the history of </seg>

awarded the praise that has fallen to the rising young 
statesman from Nebraska. When he began to speak the Republicans 
looked on with something of curiosity, but curiosity 
soon gave way to interest, and interest developed into 
admiration as the conviction became apparent that it was 
not the argument of a novice that was being delivered. 

When the next morning's sun arose Mr. Bryan found that 
he was famous and that his political sun was already high in 
the heavens. Without exception the papers all over the 
country spoke in the most gtowiag terms of this new light 
in the Democratic party, and predicted a brilliant future 
for him.

person who uses the finished product. 

Another reason for believing that raw material should 
be upon the free list is because that is the only method by 
which one business can be favored without injury to another. 
We are not, in that case, imposing a tax for the 
benefit of the manufacturer, but we are simply saying to 
the manufacturer: "We will not impose any burden upon 

you." When we pive to the manufacturer free raw material 
and free machinery, we give to him. I think, all the 

encouragement which :i people acting under a free (iovernment 
like ours can legitimately give to an industry. 

N('T i LASS LEGISLATION. 

Our friends have said that this is class legislation. That 
is. that when we say we will deprive the wool-grower of 
any advantage he has under the present law we are guilty 
of class legislation. It is sufficient evidence, Mr. Chairman, 
that this bill does not advance class legislation that the 
Republican part}' is solidly opposing it. If it were class 
legislation we could reasonably expect their united support. 
[Applause on the Democratic side.] 

I'.ut. sir, I desire to call the attention of the committee 
to this distinction. We have referred to it in the report

highest duties upon the luxuries of life. And then I should 
collect another part of the revenues from a graduated income 
tax upon the wealth of this country. [Loud applause 
on the Democratic side.] It is conceded by all writers that 
a tariff upon imports operates most oppressively upon the 
poor. A graduated income tax would fall most heavily 
upon the rich, and thus the two would partially compensate 
each other and lessen the injustice that might come 
from either one alone. That, I say, would be my idea, if 
it were possible. 

RF.DUCTIO AD ABSURIUM." 

Mr 

Ri-yan showed jrreat ability in the "Reductio ad abmmlitm 
of argumentation: 

......1. 

Now. what is a protective tariff, and what does it mean? 
I simple device, by which one man is authorized to 
collect money from his fellow-men. There are two ways 
in which you can protect industry. You can give it a 
bounty out of the Federal Treasury, or you can authorize 
it to take up the collection itself. This is the only differ.inf. 
Suppose that the Chairman desired to help some 
particular industry — for instance, one in the home of my 
friend from New York (Mr. Raines), who has asked the 

question. He might do it in either of two ways. He mipht 
pa^s around the hat here and collect the money and turn 
it over to the favored industry, or he might simply say to 
the man. "I will put a tariff upon the imported article and 
make the price so high that you can collect the additional 
price for your home-made article." 

Now. what is the difference except that in the one case 
the Chairman passes around the hat and turns the money 
over to his friend, and in the other case he authorizes the 
friend to pass the hat himself. 

WHO WILL JUSTIFY IT? 

I ilrsire to say that no man on that side of the House in 
ihis session of Congress will stand up before you and 
justify a law that takes from one man one cent and gives 
it to another man if he will admit that that is the operation. 
Take an illustration: Here are ten men owning 
farms side by side. Suppose that nine of them should pass 
a resolution, "Resolved, That we will take the land of the 
tenth man and divide it among us." Who would justify 
such a transaction? Suppose the nine men tell the tenth 
man that he will get it back in some way: that it is a 
great advantage to live amongst nine men who will thus </seg>


            <seg id="p089">
MI.MT.KHS OF I. S. Hi.lSK OF REPRESENTATIVE. 

be better off, and that indirectly he gets an advantage 
from the transaction? [Laughter and applause on the 
Democratic side.] 

How long do you suppose it would be before they would 
convince that man that they were right in taking his land? 
Would you, gentlemen, dare to justify that? You would 
not justify the taking of one square foot of his land. If 
\ou do not dare do that, how will you justify the taking 
of that which a man raises on his land, all that makes the 
land valuable? Where is the difference between the soil 
and the product of the soil? How can you justify the one 
if not the other? 

MOKE BLESSED TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE. 

New, there are two arguments which I have never heard 
advanced in favor of protection; but they are the beat 
arguments. They admit a fact and justify it, and I think 
that is the best way to argue, if you have a fact to meet. 
Why not say to the farmer. "Yes. of course you lose: but 
does not the Bible say. 'It is more blessed to give than to 
ri'ii'ivr' — [laughter] — and if you suffer some inconvenience, 
just look back over your life and you will find that your 
happiest moments were enjoyed when you were giving 
-"iin'tliing to somebody, and the most unpleasant moments 
wire when you were receiving." These manufacturers are 

(sacrificing. They are willing to take the lesser part, 
the more unpleasant business of receiving, and leave 
&gt;u the greater joy of giving. [Loud laughter and aple 
on the Democratic side.] 

Why do they not take the other theory, which is borne 
&lt;&gt;m by history — that all nations which have grown strong, 
powerful, and influential, just as individuals have done It, 
through hardship, toil, and sacrifice, and that after they 
have become wealthy they have been enervated, they have 
gone to decay through the enjoyment of luxury, and that 
the great advantage of the protective system is that it goeu 
around among the people and gathers up their surplus 
earnings so that they will not be enervated or weakened, 
so that no legacy of evil will be left to their children. 
Their surplus earnings are collected up, and the great mass 
of our people are left strong, robust, and hearty. The»e 
earnings are garnered and put into the hands of just as 
few people as possible, so that the injury will be limited In 
extent. [Great laughter and applause on the Democratio </seg>

minority seem to think of more consideration ) that it 
means INjNO a year to eserv bin lin^r-t wine inaniifact urer 
in this country. This tax is a small matter. Mr. ( hairman:

you concede the riyht of 1 1&lt;&gt;\ iTiinii-ut ti&gt; collect from the

may make .*•_'(!, ihmi a \ear more, you concede the right of 
Government to collect from that farmer 1 cent an acre on 
each of two hundred additional items for the "protection" 
of other industries, until you have absorbed every cent of 
his income from his farm. They told us the other day that 
there are twenty-five hundred articles upon the tariff list. 

Now. if there are twenty-five hundred articles upon that 
list, and you can take one at a time and deal with it upon 
this principle, imposing 1 a tax of 1 cent an acre upon the 
farmer for each article, then you can impose an aggregate 
tax of $25 an acre upon the farmer for the benefit of somebody 
else. This binding-twine tax is a trifling 1 consideration, 
but the farmers of this country who have been oppressed, 
who have been made to bleed at every pore by 
your infamous system, will welcome even a trivial advantage 
as an earnest of that complete relief which will come 
when it is in our power to give it. [Loud applanse on the

Mr. I'avne, of New York, said 

its pMatfe, Mr. Bryan, reply 

I ask them why it is that people who manufacture this 
article are so anxious to continue a system which they 
say reduces the price of that which they have to sell'.' We 
have listened too long to the men who levy these charges 
upon the farmers and who continually assert that they are 
the only friends of the farmer. It is too much like the parable 
of the fox, who when the farmer undertook to build a 
fence around his chicken house, said: "You go about your 

business; we foxes will takf

used to that sort of thing; w

Mr. Speaker, the farmer has been allowing these men to 
attend to this business for him long enough, but he has now 

come to the point where he is going to attend to it himself. 
anil gentlemen who represent farming constituencies upon 
this floor will have something more than child's play on 
their hands when they go back and undertake to explain 
to their constituents why it is that they are willing to refuse 
even the benefit of 1 cent an acre to this oppressed 
class. I do not care to consume more time. I demand the 
yeas and nays upon the motion to MMpaad the rules and

PINKBRTOS DETECTIVES. 

¦t after the bloody repulse of the Pinkerton detective 
imicsiead strikers in Pennsylvania, the House of Repn 
s ordered an investigation. 

Mil Bryan: I only desire to say, Mr. Speaker, that this 
resolution ought to pass. It is simply to investigate whether 
there has been any violation of the Federal Constitution or 
laws by the action of these men. I believe in law and order, 
I mt I believe that the law and order should be maintained 
by the lawful authorities, and not by private armies. Governments 
are organized to protect life and property. These 
functions should not be transferred to private individuals 
ami hired detectives until we are ready to acknowledge government 
a failure. It is not fair to compel corporations to 
protect their property in this way. nor is it right that the 
safety and even life of the citizen shall be imperiled by a 
private and irresponsible soldiery. Let public order be 
preserved by public authority. [Applause.] 

Mb. Hiivam 1 am in favor of the gold and silver coinage 
f the Constitution. I am in favor of the free coinage of 

goM and silver at the present ratio and believe that our 
paper money should be issued by the National (lovernment 
alone, and convertible into coin on demand [applause]; I 
am not willing, either by my voice or vote, to continue national 
banks as banks of issue: neither am I willing that 
i he states shall authorize private corporations to issue 
money which would have all the objectionable features of 
national-bank notes without their advantages. If we are 

going to have a currency issued by private corporations — I 
rc|H-at I do not think we should have it at all — I want a currency 
that is guaranteed, that will be as good in one state 
as another, and that will not be subject to the fluctuation 
which the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joseph D. Taylor) has 
spoken of. I do not want a currency which will make it 
-ary whenever a man travels from one state to another 
to have telegraphic communication with all parts of the 
Inited States in order to know whether his money is good.

to the people, we who have souirht to afford such relief are 
justified in refusing assent to such extravagant expenditures. 
| Applause on the Democratic side.] 

Mr. Speaker. I believe in a sufficient navy We have this 
now, either in existence or in construction. We do not need 
more. It is not necessary for us to establish a navy greater 
than any other in the world, any more than it is necessary 
for us to organize a larger standing army than any other 
nation. I desire to emphasize the thought which has been 

so eloquently expressed by my friend from Indiana (Mr. 
Holman) — that we are becoming a nation of splendor, a nation 
of extravagance, a nation of show. I may be pardoned 
for repeating — not because gentlemen have not heard it. because 
the thought conveyed deserves to be impressed upon 
every mind — the truth so beautifully expressed bj the

Mr. Speaker, if it is the object of the body at the other

country, let it be our object to Imild up a happy land. We 

can afford to go forth to our people upon such a record

Mr. Speaker— The President of the United States, in the 
discharge of his duty as he sees it, has sent to Congress a 
message calling attention to the present financial situation, 
and recommending the unconditional repeal of the Sherman 
law as the onh means of securing immediate relief. Some

of our admiration or even respect if he demanded a homage 
which would violate the primary principles of free repreitive 
government. 

Let his own language rebuke those who would disregard 
their pledges to their own people in order to display a false 
fealty. In the message which he sent to Congress in De- 

cember. ISM, lie said, in words which may well be our guid« 
in this great crisis: "The zealous watchfulness of our con

have always demanded'.' Is it necessary to betray all parties 
in order to treat this (abject in a "nonpartisan" wavV 

The President has ri-cdininended uneonditional repeal. It 
is not sufficient to say that he is honest -so were the 
mother*, who. with misguided zeal, threw their ehil Iren into 
the (iang-cs. I'll.- question is not "Is lie honest?" hut "Is he 
right?" lie won the confidence of the toilers of this country 
because he tausrht that "public office is a public trust." 
and iMH-ause he convinced them of his eouraire and his sin- 

cerity. Bui are they willing to say. in the lufaafa of Job, 
•Though lie sla\ me. yet will I trust Him"? Whence conies 
this irresistible demand for tin conditional repeal? Are not 
the representatives here as near to the people and as apt 
to know -heir wishes? Whence comes the demand? Not 
from the workshop and the farm, not from the workingmen 
of this country, who create its wealth in time of peace 
and protect its Mag in time of war. but from the middle-men, 
from what are termed the "business interests." and largely 
from that class which can force Congress to let it issue 
money at a pecuniary profit to itself if silver is abandoned. 
The President has Ix-cn deceived. He can no more judge 
the wishes of the great mass of our people by the expressions 
of these men than he can measure the ocean's 
silent depths by the foam upon its waves. 

THE MASSES OIMM.SK UNCONDITIONAL KEI'EAI 

Mr. Powderly. who spoke at Chicago a few days ago in 
favor of the free coinage of silver at the present ratio and 
against the unconditional repeal of the Sherman law, voiced 
th.' sentiment of more laboring- men than have ever addressed 
the President or this House in favor of repeal. Go 
among- the agricultural classes; go among- the poor, whose 
little is as precious to them as the rich man's fortune is to 
him. and whose families are as dear, and you will not find 
the haste to destroy the issue of money or the unfriendli•¦ 
silver which is manifested in money centers. 

This qildtioa can not ba settled by typewritten recommendations 
and wifanUnm made by boards of trade and 
sent broadcast over the United States. It can only be settled 
by the great mass of the voters of this country who 
stand like the Rock of Gibraltar for the use of both gold 
and silver. [Applause.] 

There are thousands, ve 

tens of thousands, aye, even 

million*, who have not yet "bowed the knee to Baal." Let 
the President take courage. Muehlbach relates an incident </seg>

During the delivery of this most remarkable speech, occupying 
three hours, and covering every material point necessary to indicate 
the policy of "unlimited coinage of silver," the hall of the 
House — the capacious galleries — approaching corridors, retiring 
rooms and lobbies — with every doorwav and entrance, were 
packed to the last point of endurance, amid a silence so profound, 
that it emphasized the thiindtM-tnirsts of applause. The spirit of 
the audience may be inferred from the manner in which its enthusiasm 
punctuated such passages as the following: 

The poor man is called a socialist if he believes that the 
wealth of the rich should be divided among the poor, but </seg>

which the pittance of the poor can lie converted to his use. 
| Laughter and applause.] 

The poor man who takes property by force is called a 
thief, but the creditor who can by legislation make a debtor 
pay a dollar twice as large as he borrowed is lauded as 
the friend of sound currency. [Laughter and applause] 
The man who wants the people to destroy the Government 
is an anarchist, but the man who wants the Government to 
destroy the people is a patriot. [Applause.] 

The man who has $10,000 in money becomes worth $20,000 
in reality when prices fall one-half. Shall we assume that 
the money-lenders of this and other countries ignore the 
advantage which an appreciated currency gives to them ami 
it simply for the benefit of the poor man and the 
laborer? What refining influence is there in their business 
which purges away the dross of selfishness and makes pure 
and patriotic only their motives? [Laughter.] Has some 
new dispensation reversed the parable and left Lazarus in 
torment while Dives is borne aloft in Abraham's bos..m?

Sirs, what will be the answer of the people whom you 
represent, who are wedded to the "gold and silver coinage 
of the Constitution." if you vote for unconditional repeal 
and return to tell them that you were commended for the

Shall we confess our inability to enact monetary laws? 
Are we an English colony or an independent people? If 
the use of gold alone is to make us slaves, let us use both 
metals and be free. If there be some living along the eastern 
coast — better acquainted with the beauties of the Alps 
than with the grandeur of the Rockies, more accustomed 
to the sunny skies of Italy than to the invigorating breezes 
of the Mississippi Valley — who are not willing to trust their 
fortunes and their destinies to American citizens, let them 
learn that the people living between the Alleghanies to the

and rise or fall with it. [Loud applause.] 

One hundred and seventeen years ago the lil&gt;erty bell gave 
notice to a waiting and expectant people that independence 
had been declared. There may be doubting, trembling 
ones among us now. but. sirs, I do not overestimate it when 
I say that out of twelve millions of voters, more than ten 
millions are waiting, anxiously waiting, for the signal which 
shall announce the financial independence of the United 
.Slates. [Applause.] This Congress cannot more surely win 
the approval of a grateful people than by declaring that 
this .Nation, the grandest which the world has ever seen, 
has tht- right and the ability to legislate for its own people 

n every subject, regardless of the wishes, the entreaties,

On the other side stands that unnumbered throng which

their sad appeal. They bmr of iiririiiji wealth increased on

see an over-production of everything desired because of

punish betrayal with their condemnation. Although the 
ones who most deserve the fostering care of Government. 
their cries for help too often l&gt;eat in vain against the outer

The South and West can vote for this bill because, while 
it gives protection to the Northeastern States, it makes the

"In New York ( ity and Brooklyn the local taxation is

by the officials in authority. Add to this high local 
taxation an income tax of 2 per'eent on every income exceeding

living in this country. A very short period of income taxation 
would show these gentlemen their mistake. The} custom

bankers and brokers could drain the gold reserve by presenting 
treasury notes and taking out gold, and then returning the game 
gold and exchanging it for bonds, leaving the treasury not one

bearing debt. Said In-

If you do not want to give them this money, then let it 
fro forth that this Congress, or those who are opposing this 
bill are in favor of confining a growing country to the 
present volume of currency, which must mean an appreciating 
dollar and falling prices, increasing debt, increasing suffering 
and the piling up of the wealth of this country in the 
hands of the few more rapidly than it has been done heretofore. 
If you are ready to say that, let us go out and 
Sgfct the battle before the people. Let us leave it to them 
tn determine the question. But. sirs, you cannot excuse 
\ ourselves for not giving the people this money unless you 
;ir&lt;- prepared to show them how you can furnish them a 
Wtter money with which to do their business. [Applause.] 

Of the other discussions, in which he took a prominent part 
iluriiif: the 33rd Congress, was one upon the character of money 
in feaera] — a constitutional currency in particular — a home currency 
expanding with even demand of trade — free from the 
manipulations nf bankers and brokers, and responsive to every 
legal tender demand. 

Kpon a bill to punish {rambling, by boards of trade, in the pro

Mu. Hhyan: I care not whether the pmrptt of the gambler 
is to help or not. If the gentleman could prove that the 
• fl&lt;it &lt;if gambling was to take the cost of handling and 
transportation out of the pocket of somebody other than 
the producer and consumer, then he might justify gambling 
by showing that it is wise for us to promote laws which 
enable gamblers to take from the people who are willing to 
gamble and give the benefit of their losses to the producer 
and consumer alike. 

I'.ut. Mr. Chairman. I am not going to assume that the 
gambler simply makes his money out of the people who buy 
for speculation. I am going to assume, upon evidence satisfactory 
to me, that these gamblers increase or decrease 
to some extent the price of the products speculated in, 
increasing it to the man who buys or decreasing it to the 
man who sells. No citizen has a natural right to injure 
any other citizen: and the Government should neither enable 
nor permit him to do so. Therefore, no man has a 
right to lessen the value of another man's property, and 
the law should not give to a man. or protect him in. the </seg>

My district is perhaps an average district; about half of 
my constituents live in cities or towns, and about half are 
engaged in agriculture. I have in my district the second 
largest city in the State. Lincoln, the State's capital — a city 
of 60,000 inhabitants. My home is in that city, and I have 
no hesitation in declaring that it is one of the most beautiful 
and prosperous cities of its size in the United States. 
The people who live in rities will, if gambling 1 in farm 
products reduces the price of such produce, be the beneficiaries 
to that extent. But. sir, I do not come here to 
lower the price of what my city constituents have to buy. 
by enabling jrrain ganblm to t;ike it from the pock 

those who riiisc farm product: 
not ask that of me. and I would

which must come to the farmer as they scarcely come to 
anvbedy else: when he has escaped the grasshopper and 
the chinch bup- and the rain and the hail and the dry winds. 
I insist that he shall not then be left to the mercy of a 
gang of speculators, who. for their own train, will take out 
of him as much of the remainder as they can possibly get. 

There is no difference in the moral character of the transaction 
between the action of the burglar who goes to a 
man's house at night and takes from him a part of that 
which he receives for his wheat, and the action of the gambler 
who goes on the board of trade, and. by lietting on 
the price of the product, brings down that price and takes 
that much from the farmer's income.

after it has paid a brief visit, like a royal guest, to

liather let us believe that lie who. in His apparent prodigality, 
wastes not the raindrop, the blade of grass, or the 
evenings sighing zephyr, but makes them all to carry out 
His eternal plans, has given immortality to the mortal, and 
gathered to Himself the generous spirit of our friend. 

Instead of mourning-, let us look up and address him in the 
words of the poet:

Thy sun has risen, not - 
Thy life is now beyond 

The reaeh of death or change 
Not ended- but begun. 

&lt;). noble soul: 0, gentle heart: Hail, and farewell.' 

Such was the rapidity of his advance as a profound political 
iehltar and captivating orator, that in a little over two years 
from his first appearance in the House of Representatives his 
spwdies were read in every state of the I'nion. while upon ;« 
variety of themes he had charmed audiences in many cities, 
among which were New York. Chicago. DeBTCr, Omaha, and 
Washington. 

In the same brief space of time he had risen from the ranks 
to the leadership of the Nebraska democracy, and was their 
candidate for T'. S. Senator. 

LAST SESSION OK FIFTY-THIRD CONGRESS. 

In the last session of the fifty-third Congress, Mr. Bryan

he hoped to modify in future such decisions as that of Judge

the mails and rolling stock at the present time, regardleaa 
of the original cost, regardless of the amount of 
indebtedness, and regardless of the amount of capital stock

I have no doubt that this will cause a smile on the face of 

some of the representatiws of the railroad interests, but 
vet. sir. that is the oasis upon which profits are calculated 
in the private occupation* of the country. 

And I am &gt;imph asking that you apply to railroad companies 
the same principle that must be applied to every man, 
woman, and child who goes into business, but who is not 
fortunate enough to have a monopoly of the business. 

The ¦abject of the currency Mag before the House, December 
22, 1894. which he had so elaborately argued in former sessions, 
was handled "without fear. affection or favor," under the mottoes: 
"I was derided as a maniac by the tribe of bank mongers, 
who were seeking to filch from the public their swindling and 
barren gains." — Thomas Jefferson. "So persecuted they the prophets 
which were before von." — Matthnr v:12. 

The introductory sentences were equally emphatic. Mr. 
Bryan said: 

Mr. Chairman, I desire, in the first place, to call attention 
to the extraordinary circumstances which surround the 
presentation of this measure. This is the closing session o1 
the Fifty-third Congress, and nearly half of the members oi 
the House will retire in about two months. Yet the President 
of the United States has asked this Congress to pass 
a bill which changes the entire character of our paper 
money. 

I doubt if you will find a parallel in the last twenty-five 
years. I doubt if you will find such a repudiation of the 
theory of democratic government. Why do we have platforms? 
It is in order that the people who vote, knowing 
the policies to be pursued, may express themselves on those 

\n&lt;l in determining the rett 

IRRENCY. </seg>

            <seg id="p112">

If that is the purpose of platforms, if we believe 
that what power we have really comes from the people, and 
if we believe that they are competent to govern themselves, 
what excuse can be given for proposing- so important a 
change in the monetary policy of the country, without ever 
having submitted the question for public consideration '.' 

Has any President ever proposed before to annihilate the 
greenbacks? Has any party ever declared for it? Have 
any campaign speakers ever presented that issue to the 
American people? Ami yet after an election, one of the 
extraordinary elections ever held in the United States, 
after a political defeat without precedent, the defeated 

party in control of Congrei 
turn over th&lt; 
banks. More than that, the

vited to eoaM and be hetrc

Banking and Currency Commitstion 
and certain people are in-

pirit of his exordium, while COB 

testing with ten of his colleagues, who occupied half his tim.-with 
&lt;|uestions and interruptions, he eune to his conclusion, in 
the style of intrepidity defiant. 

If the President is dr 1 1 1 mimed to make our financial 
bandage still more oppressive than it now is. let him carry 
out his purpose with the aid of a Republican Congrcwe 
can not relieve the people, we can at least refuse to be 
responsible for further wrong doing. 

We arc told that the President will not approve any bill 
which carries out the pledge of the last national platform in 
favor of the coinage of gold and silver without discrimination 
against either metal or charge for mintage, but is that 
any reason why we should join him in making the restoration 
of silver more difficult for the Administration which 
shall succeed his? It is useless to shut our eyes to the division 
in the Democratic party. We who favor the restoration 
of silver deplore the division as much as our opponents: 
but who is to blame? Did not the President ignore the silver 
Dem. ..rats in making up his Cabinet? Has he not 
ignored them in the distribution of patronage? Has he 
not refused to counsel with or consider those Democrats 
who stand by the traditions of the party? Did he not 
press through Congress with all the power at his command 
the unconditional repeal of the Sherman law. in spite 
of the earnest protest of nearly half the Democratic mem- </seg>

Did he not oppose the income tax, which a large majority 
of the Democratic party favored? Has he not in fact joined

the wishes pt the Democrats of the South and West?

If the party is rent in twain let the responsi-

other Democratic President ever tried to fasten a gold 
standard upon the country or to surrender to the banks the 

control of our paper currency. Let the fight go on. If this 
bill is defeated the people will profit by the discussion it 
has aroused. I have confidence in the honesty, intelligence, 
and patriotism of the American people, and I have no doubt 

that their ultiniale decision will be right. [Loud applause. 1 

I'ACIFIC RAII.KOAI 

Mr. Chairman. I shall avail myself of the brief time aimed 
and run over the principal points to which I desire t&lt;&gt; 
all attention, and then put in the ltunnl some extract* 

from the I'attison report which I shall not have time la 

read. This bill affects mainly

two classes of people, namely. 
&gt;t defrauding the Government 
:1s and those who for the next 

charged by these roads for

embodied in it, I think the title of this bill ought to be made 
to read as follows: "A bill to so amend the eighth commandment 
that it will read, •Thou shalt not steal mi a 
small scaU,' to visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the 
children uf xumi IhkIii rl.ir unto the third and fourth generations, 
and for no other purpose." [Laughter.] 

For one generation the patrons of the roads have suffered 
from extortion, and the pending measure would extend the 
injustice for two more generations and at the same time 
condone the crimes of those who have been in charge of the 
roads. In behalf of the inhabitants of the transmississippi 
region I appeal to you to foreclose these liens, squeeze the 
water out of the stock, reduce the roads to a business basis, 
and allow the Western States to secure reasonable rates for 
their citizens. [Applause.]

ARBITRATION" 

ret alert and ready for work, the hist »wk of his congre*al 
life found him ui&gt;{&gt;ealin£ in behalf of arbitration between 
iers enpip-d in interstate commerce and their employees. 

Society cannot afford to allow the employer and the employees 
to fig-ht out their differences even if they both 
desire to do so. and certainly neither desires to do so. 
Courts of justice are established to settle disputes, to construe 
contracts, and to award damages. ( ommissions are 
established to fix transportation rates and for various other 
purposes. Courts and commissions are simply arbitration 
boards instituted by society for its own protection and for 
the economical adjustment of personal difficulties. This 
bill seeks to extend the principle of arbitration to disputes 
between common carriers and their employees in regard to 
"wa^es. hours of labor, and conditions of employment." I 
am in hearty sympathy with the purpose of the bill and 
shall gladly support, it. 

There is no more danger of the abandonment of arbitration 
after a fair trial than there is of our going from the 

court of justice back to the wage* of battle. Arbitration is 
in the line of progress and, like the adoption of the Australian 
ballot, is an indication, if not proof positive, that 
6'vilizatinn is advancing, and that each new generation 
tches its camp on higher ground. </seg>

has not beea as happy t o-ni&lt;rlit as usual; perhaps I Plight 
not to say "happy." because he is always happy when he 
is talking, but he was not as felicitous as usual. The gentleman 
stated in the beginning that he had reeehed a pile

His word is good here; lie need not hmVC made his s|&gt;,e.h 
in order to satisfy us that he had not read the information

without the additional evidence afforded by his speech.

upon our horses. Why. my dear friend (if he will allow 
me to address him in that way), we want antitoxine admitted

March 4th, 1891— March 4th, 1895 

In the year 1800, Mr. McKeighan removed from Pontiac. Illinois, 
to a farm near Bed Cloud. Webster County. Nebraska. 
Prior to this he had served during the war of the rebellion in 
the 11th Begiment Illinois Cavalry and had taken an active part 
in organizing the Farmers' Association. He was at that time 
thirty-eight years of age, having Ik-cii born in 1842 in the State of 
New Jersey, from which he was removed in his sixth year to 
Fulton County, Illinios. His education was obtained in the cmsmon 
schools of that comparatively new State, during short intervals 
of change from the incessant toil of farm life. 

Weady for any fate, he graduated from the dug-out to the &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;1 
house, and within live years responded to the title of judge, having 
been elected to that county office. In the sixth year of his 
residence lie was I lie democratic candidate for Congress against 
.lames Laird, but failed of an election. 

The district contained twenty-five counties, in which he made 
a canvass, famous for bold aggressive attacks, sledge-hammer 
arguments and a prodigal display of plain Anglo-Saxon language. 
Mis Alliance training and Democratic doctrines stood 
him in good demand and so vigorously did he press the work of 
political reform that in ISiMi the People's party made him their 

standard bearer — the Democr

'Phis "best money" outcry, and the claim of "hon-

And now. Mr. S|&gt;eaker. I 
this already too long discus 

have but few words to add to 
&lt;ion. for I cannot close without 

reference to the general situation. Our people are very 
much in earnest in this money reform or restoration. They 
are not dishonest, nor are they fools. They cannot Im&gt; anv 
longer deceived by this "honesty" racket. What they have 
long borne as a hardship they have now come to understand 

as a gigantic wrong. Only by a study of this uprising 
aw Wig the people who are the chief victims of this spoliation 
can be gotten any adequate notion of the intensity of 
their comictions. the high moral quality of their motives, 
and the resoluteness of their purpose. They have l»een studying 
the subject, and the breadth of their reading, tin- extent 
of their economic intelligence, and the cogencv of their 
reasoning puts to shame the shallow ness of so-called great 
"'financiers" and the prigs of the counting-house. 

Mr. Speaker, the people I represent are not anarchists, 
they are not opposed to the accumulation of wealth, but 
they are opposed to its unjust distribution, they believe that 
the accumulation of wealth is the first step in social improvement, 
and that the next thing- in importance is its 
proper distribution among the several nieniliers of socictv. 
This distribution, if left free to follow natural laws, would 
t found to !»¦ in accordance with the skill, industry and 
nomv of those who toil.

is causing alarm in the minds of all thoughtful men. That 
wealth in this country has become a great political power, 
no fair-minded man will deny. Our people rely on their 
inherent sovereignty as the true basis of just government, 
and they are not willing that power and dominion should 
have any other foundation. They believe that when wealth 
usurps the place of man in governnu nt. it Irooraes man's 
oppressor. They believe that man should be above every 
and that in man all political power must center or 
calamity "ill follow. 

The old idea that the favored few ought to govern and 
the modern idea of a government of the people are mutually 
antagonistic. There can 1m- no compromise between 
two opposing forces. The people are organizing for 
a great political contest, a contest the result of which wil 
|iro\e That the integrity, honor, courage, and patriotism o 
our people can be relied on in any emergency. This con 
v ill not end until corporations, combinations, am 
monopolies bow in submission to just law. I will close by 
using language different, though similar, to that used bj 
my eloquent young colleague. I say. "In that day" the 
people will be sovereign; "long live the sovereign." [ Lnm

BBCOXD SPEECH. 

ednesdav. April (i. 1892. The question being to place wool on 
free list, and lime being limited to five-minute discussions. 
McKeijihan said: 

Mr. Chairman Owing to the fact that my time is limited. 
it is not my purpose to enter into any general discussion of 
the tariff question at this time. 

I have never been able to bring 1 myself to believe that it is 
the business of the government to interfere in the regulation 
and adjustment of the business of our people, believing 
as I do that the men who are trained in the school 
of actual experience know better how to conduct and regulate 
their own business than the members of this or any 
other Congress know how to regulate it for them. 

Taxation is to levy and collect from the people a sufficient 
amount of money to pay the necessary expenses of our govt 
rnment. Of this kind of taxation I do not complain, but, 
sir. when the United States government lays its heavy hand 
¦ ¦ my business for the purpose of building up the business 
&lt; f some one else, or takes a single cent from my family. </seg>

            <seg id="p121">
505 


ing that end in view should be promptly repealed on the 
grounds that we have equal rights. 

The reasons given for supporting the bill were, its passage 
would lead to a general reduction of duties, because it offers to 
place wool on the free list. — reduce duties on the manufactured 
article, — and because it would reduce the tax on mixed wool 
and cotton goods, so much worn by Nebraska farmers. 

I and the people I represent are in favor of a system of 
national taxation that will compel the man who possesses 
one million worth of property to pay more money for the 
support of the go\ernment than it compels the man to pay 
who only has $2,000 of property. [Loud applause.] Any 
system of taxation that does not do this is not a just and 
equitable system. 

Time being extended ti\e minutes more, it was occupied by 
showing the fallacy of a reform that taxed the farmer |1.50 and 
promised to return in benefits fifty cents.— that assumed to run 
his business for him, — and offered him relief where it would not 
interfere with some other constituent's prerogative to plunder. 
hi conclusion he said: 

I thank (iod that the threats of a sugar manufacturer will 
not deter any member of the Nebraska delegation from 
standing in this House and saying that we are willing to 
jiiiv t;ixt-s to support this government, but we are nol 
w illing- to pay a single cent of tribute to a manufacturer of 
sugar or to a manufacturer of twine. When the Democratic 
party puts itself in harmony with the toiling masses then 
and not till then will it be entitled to the support of the 
people of the country. [T.oud applause.] 

When the people ask for the free coinage of silver, the opposition 
to it predict the most direful calamity. When the 
people ask for a proper regulation of interstate commerce 
the cry of calamity is loud and long: when we ask that the 
hand of the tariff robber be taken from the pockets of our 
people, the cry of these aristocrat "calamity howlers" goes 
up like the howling of a pack of hungry wolves in a gravevard.

themselves or to distort the facts in the economic

Mil. Me Kkighan: We are asked to make this appropriation 
to aid the World*! Exposition, on the ground that it 
will bring us into closer commercial relations with other 
nations. This argument is advanced by gentlemen who are 
in favor of tariff taxes that restrict trade. 

When the farmer sells his farm produce he is allowed to 
export it without paying a tax. But. sir. when he exchanges 
it in the world's market for supplies for the use of his 
family these advocates of "wider commercial relations" 
have passed laws that compel him to pay a tariff so high 
that he can not bring his goods into this country, thus forcing 
him to buy in a market rendered, artificially dear by 
reason of this un justifiable legislation. This is what they 
call "widening our commercial relations"; I call it robbing 
the American farmers for the sole benefit of American 
mill-owners. 

(ientlemen. if you will take the shackles from the strong 
iirnis of the American farmers you will not need to vote 

*.i,000,000 to teach us how to sell our produce or where to 
buy our goods. The great wholesale and jobbing houses 
haw in their employ thousands of bright, educated, ener- 

getic, and intelligent commercial travelers; they are on 
board of our ocean steamers, bound for all parts of earth, 

-seeking for the finest fabrics of every country and choicest 
/mils of every climate. They are on board of every train 
thai crosses the mountains and plains of our own fair and 
fertile land; they crowd our hotels and display their samples 
in every country store and in every mining camp. 

l.ct (dngress stop erecting costly monuments to dead 
heroes, stop building costly naval vessels, stop all such appropriations 
as the one proposed by this Senate amendment, 
let the people keep the money they have earned; do this and 
our merchants will find a revival of trade, the commercial 
traveler will find plenty of customers, and the farmers 
enough of money to pay their debts with. 

Take the weight of class legislation from the backs of 
-American people, and they will take care of themselves. Do 
this, and American skill, energy, and industry will widen 
our commercial relations and build a strong government on 
the sure foundation of equal rights to all. </seg>

Gentlemen, the howl of "calamity shrieker" has no argument 
in it. There were calamity shriekers at the time of 
the flood: they were in Egypt before her splendid civilization 
went down in chaos and darkness: they were in Persia 
l&gt;efore the Greek army shattered their magnificent forces 
&lt;&gt;n the plains of Marathon; they lifted up their voices in 
the states of Koine, and gave their warning's in her senate 
chambers: they warned Greece of her approaching doom; 
they sounded their peculiar cry in Scotland when she was 
a nation: they were not silent when Irish nationality was 
being: lost; they annoyed the court of England when her 
conduct was driving to desperation the colonists whose 
valor taught the mother country a lesson in that great 
siruggle that depriwd Kngland of an empire. The.calamity 
shrieker has never failed to give warning, and it will be 
wise to heed rather than treat lightly the warning they are 
giving on our own country. 

What hiis already been written of Mr. McKeighan's "First 
S|M-.-cli" in the ."&gt;:2ud Congress on "The Free Coinage of Silver" 
i- 'i|iiall\ applicable to his more elaborate and sennlii logical 
¦ li&gt;' ussion during the extra session of the 53rd Congress. 

To &lt;)uote from the body of the argument proper, would be as 
unsatisfactory as the exhibition of a single brick in order to 
i oiivey an image of a giant structure. 

tfew paragraphs, however, may be relied upon to indicatf 
temper and spirit in which it was conceived and delivered. 

Mu. McKlMKAX: This is no time to scold or criminate, 
no time to mete out to political parties the share of blame 
belonging to each of them. Sir, in this discussion Pilate 
and Herod have been made friends on this floor, and the 
political Judas has shown no disposition to go out and hang 
himself. But there is a to-morrow for political parties in 
this country, a to-morrow that will bring condemnation and 
death to any political party that turns a deaf ear »o the just 
demands of our people. 

There is ¦ God that rules over the destinies of men and 
nations: a God that is not deaf to the earnest appeal of His 
humble poor: a God who will see to it that, the desire of 
the people of this great nation shall "not fail." but shall

themselves as the ehief benefacton of the race, and because 
they see in times like these multitudes of men deprived of 
the comforts of life because Viable to lad employment under 
a boss, they honestly believe thai the boas creates wealth 
and distributes it among his hired men. It never occurs to 
them that the reason why sueh multitudes of men are thus 
dependent upon them is that they, and those who aet with 
them, have monopolized all the natural opportunities given 
by God to the American people, and hare thus compelled 
the masses of the people to come to them, hat in hand, saying. 
"I'ut me. I pray thee. in one of the offices, that 1 may 
earn a morsel of bread." 

A COMPANION 1'IKIF 

I am ashamed to have to explain to anybody the transparent 
humbug of this Dodge philosophy, but it must be 
done. It is not to the interest of any farmers or of all 
farmers to raise small crops. There is no such thing.' as 
overproduction. There are people enough in a few European 
countries to eat all the wheat, corn, beef, and pork 
which we can raise, and who would be glad to do so if we 
would give them a chance. We want hungry customers. 
We do not want a few fat monopolists. If the farmers all 
over the world were to take the Dodge advice and to raise 
only half crops they would starve the rest of the world 
and would kill off their only customers. If by any such 
act of monstrous cruelty, they could get $2 a bushel for a 
single year, they would only get 25 cents for corn the next 
year: and meantime they would stop the production of the 
very things which they want to get with their money. 
Money is of no use to them unless they can get the comforts 
of life with it; and if they starve people who make 
for the farmers the things which they need, they would kill 
the goose which lays the golden egg. </seg>

KRKE TRAD1 

Europe could easily send us. every year. ;it km* .",110,000,-ii 
north of the very tktega which f iin ncrs waat; and we 

should pay for these things principally in wheat, rorn an.l 
cotton, liecf and pork. 
Strike down the bars which keep out MMgMMM of En- 

rol,,;,,! products, and you would, by the same blow, strike 
douu the bars which keep in $:&gt;immnio.inn&gt; worth of American 

(inn products, which force back our own wheat and corn 

upon us. choke up our markets and compel us to leave 
"heat to rot on the ground, and corn to burn for fuel. A 
deep cut in the tariff would enable our American farmers 
to sill all which they now raise, at prices 50 per cent higher; 
and the total abolition of the tariff would (rive to every 
farmer loo per cent more in exchange for his products 
than he now reeei\- 

It is said that if we admitted f.VMi.iKKl.lXK) worth of foreign 
manufactures we should throw out of work people who are 
making the same amount among' ourselves. Suppose this 
were true. Yet the farmers would be better off, because 
they would pet the $500,000,000 themselves in directly increased 
purchases of their products, while the whole number 
of people who would be thrown out of work, even if 
American manufactures were reduced by this amount, 
would be less than 30,000. We farmers can afford to maintain 
those 30.000 men without working and pay them as 
large wages as we earn upon our farms and still make a 
yood bargain off the transaction. As the whole cost of this 
would l&gt;e only $12,000,000, even if they were out of work for 
a year, and the farmers would make a profit of $500,000,000 
by even half-way tariff reform, we could afford to pay the 
people handsomely out of it. 

TIN GOD. 

We have the McKinley tariff in full force. The goods are 
weighed by McKinley weighers. The duties are calculated 
by McKinley clerks. The values of imported goods are 
decided by McKinley appraisers, and the rates of duty are 
determined by McKinley judges. The law was made by 
McKinley, and the men who have interpreted the law and 
ruled upon its meaning are all McKinleyites. No change has 
been made in anything about the law or its administration 
by the Democrats. Everything stands to-day just as Harrison

We know for certain that the tariff calls for revenue 
in proportion to the necessities of each man's family, 
instead of in proportion to either his income or his accumulated 
wealth. We want to put an end to that ¦ 
and to establish in taxation, as in everything else, the rule 
of fairness, equality, and justice. 

The light is dawning, though but dimly: and feeble 
though the dawn may be, it gives hope and encouragement

VALUE 

OF A DOLLAR 

The gentleman claims that the silver dollar by being 
cut down iS cents under free coinage, the wages of labor 
will be cut down so much on every dollar paid; that is to 
say. that each one of these 55-eent dollars would buy and 
pay for "KXI cents worth of labor." Why. my impetuous 
and bemuddled friend, please stop and think a moment 
and sec how in the same sentence in which you affirm a 
debasement in the silver dollar, you show that none at all 
has taken place in the case supposed, for it still buys 100

HON. O. M. KEM 

March 4th. 1891— March 4th. 189 

Whi'n (»mer Madison Kern, at the age of twenty-seven years, 
landed in the vicinity of Broken Bow, Custer County, Nebraska, 
March. 180, excavated a dug-out and settled upon a homestead, 
his ambition was to own and cultivate a better farm than was 
his Indiana liomc. His history was written in a few words: 
"tooogfct up on a farm and received a common school education." 
Amidst privations and discouragements he held his steady wa\ 
for eight years, until in 18M he removed to the county seat, in 
urdiT to assume the duties of Deputy County Treasurer. Ordi 
narily it required all the arithmetical skill of "u common school 
education" to ascertain the amount of salary due, where lands 
were not yet subject to taxation, the personal property valu&gt; 
and the impecunious emigrant unable to pay. The excited imagination 
of the pioneer told of the trembling of the earth win n 
the wild buffalo herd swept by. or the earthquake telegraphed 
its arrival, or the cyclone moved to the music of thunder; but 
Mr. Kein lost all interest in such tictions after the political 
ground-swell of 1S!M». In that year he was nominated for Con 

Eis liy the People's Party, against the Hon. G. W. E. Dm 
i a Republican member, receiving fi.391 votes of a plurality. 
le L'L'JSoS were cast for \V. H. Thompson, Democrat. 

If the whole opposition vote had been cast for Mr. Kem. as it 
might have been, his majority would have been 28,944. 

On tariff reform, coinage of silver, issue of greenback « ur 
renev and other prevailing questions, in the 52nd Cong! 
there was a close co-operation among the Nebraska delegation 
composed of one Democrat and two Populists; showing plainly 
that their line of separation involved "a distinction without a 
difference." In the sixth month after he took the oath of office 
in Congress, a question of irrigation being up for discussion, in 
which a portion of his constituents were deeply interested, he </seg>

and 

came to the front with a plea for Western Nebraska, dear 
tinct, intelligent, in manner modest. Imt In and ready for 
emergency. 

1REAT STEALS COVEREM V V 

At the very threshold of discussion lie repudiated the niod&lt; 
crowding appropriation hills to immense proportions, under 
plea that each item was a paltry sum: 

Time and again have I heard the point urged on the 
¦oar of this House in favor of an appropriation, that it was 
small ami oujrht to meet with no objection. Particularly 
was this true of the appropriation asked for the Ell—I in 
sufferers, and when it was refused a great cry went up 
from a certain class of newspapers, and we were accused 
of the sin of refusing to donate to suffering humanity the 
paliry sum of $100,000. 

Lei me remind these gentlemen that it was the appropriation 
of these paltry sums of ten. fifty, and one hunilred 
thousand dollar*, here and there, gathered together, 
that brought the last Congress up to the billion-dollar 
point, and the wrath of the people down upon those responsible. 
The argument favoring an appropriation be- 

cause it is small is not the argument of a statesman, 
neither is it worthy the consideration of such, other than 
with feelings of the greatest contempt. 

There seems to be .1 well-settled conviction among the 
people thai each session of Congress appropriates vast sums 
of money that amount to but little less than an actual 
theft of their substance, and but a few days since a meml&gt;er 
who has been on this floor for years said to me that he 
had ne\er voted for a ri\er and harbor bill because of the 
great steals embodied therein. This evil is looked upon by 
all with too great indifference and as unavoidable in procuring 
the appropriations necessary. 

PEN" PORTRAIT OF SETTLERS 

The portraiture of the constituency for whom Mr. Kern a 
justice, was executed by an artist, inspired with sympathy 
painting from nature.

which in time will g-ive to the people a supply of water, 
under their own control, free from the manipulations of 

&gt;rporation or tru 

tl'he appropriation we ask for is preliminary to. and 
fleets a problem, upon the proper solution of which the 
rospcrity and welfare not only of thousands of our own 

generation, but millions of those to follow rests. The water 
necessary to irrigation, like every other necessity of the 
1 1'1' - - is f"*t passing- under th- control of corporations, 
and if not cheeked in a short time the water supply of the 
West will be completely in the hands of a few individuals 
and the millions will be at their mercy, for he who controls 
that supply is monarch of all he surveys, and the 
¦cople will be compelled to pay him whatsoever avarice and 
freed mav dictate. 

INJUSTICE To EMIGRANTS 

Mit. Rut: Mr. Chairman, the [tintli ¦!&gt;¦ from Indiana 
(Mr. llolman) says that this work of Irrigation is going on 
well enoiifrh. I beg- leave to differ with him on that point. 
The fact is that over a great portion of the territory mentioned 
in this amendment nothing has Ihtii or is being 1 
lone. There arc thousands of citizens who have entered 
their lands in good faith, believing, as they had a right to 
iclieve. that they were within the rain belt, that there 
would be sufficient rainfall for the purposes of agriculture. 
They were justified in so believing because these lands were 
ipened for settlement under the homestead, pre-emption. 
and timber-culture laws. If there was not sufficient rainfall 
for agricultural purposes they ought fo have been opened 
under the desert-land law. 

I say those settlers have gone in there in good faith, and 
the amendment offered is to do justice to as good a class 
of people as you will find on Cod's footstool. 1 make no 
exceptions whatever. They are industrious, sober, hardworking, 
economical penple. and are earnestly endeavoring 1 </seg>

ti&gt; establish for themselves homes and have paid millions to 
the Government for the privilege of so doing. I have here 
;i U'tter from the Commissioner of Public Lands, which 
MM idea as to the amount of money that these people 
have paid into the Treasury of the United States. 

The tetter pnre about |300.(MKUHK» drawn from the settle 

the region in qoeatfon, during twenty-three years. Mi 
continued : 

Now in all this work, covering a period of twenty-three 
w-ars. there has been expend) d of this vast sum but 3.-'.'(K1.(KHI. 
and about half of that in the Kastern States, as the 
map will show. These settlers have found by sad experience 
the rainfall to be insufficient, but have been hanging 

11. as it were, by the evel.r 
ach sueressive year noiil 

ir after year, hoping that 
prove better than those pre- 

eding. 

Sow, I wish to say. in 

Hiswer to the question of the 
that it would be nothing more 
dollar that has been paid into 

gentleman from Mississippi 
than fair and just if e\erv 

the publie treasury in the manner T have referred to. except 
the amount necessary for tiling fees, was used for 
I he purpose ,&gt;f establishing irrigation systems that would 
-upplv the want of rainfall to these jx-ople on the lands 
upon which they have settled, and thus place these lands 
on an equality with other lands, opened under the same 
provisions, which are embraced within the rain belt. 

And I say. sir. that the homestead law will never be fulfilled 
until this pimision has bet n made, lint all we ask 
here is that .*t.0.000 of this appropriation shall be used in n 
certain territory that heretofore has been almost wholly 
and totally neglected in this work. By referring to the 
map it will hi seen clearly where the work has been done. 
and you will find that the territory mentioned in that 
amendment has been almost entirely neglected in the past. 
We only ask now that this sum be used in the manner 
proposed within the territory indicated, and which has aeea 

grossly neglected in past years. 

I say that if you will give us one-tenth of the amount 
which you have received in the way of appropriations as a 
protection to your people from overflow, and benefits that 
you have derived by appropriations for the improvement of 
your rivers and harbors, we will be willing to compromise 
on that. You have had vast sums for improving your 
Sers. for building levees of the Mississippi Kiver to prot 
your lands liable to inundation. </seg>

Now, I want to say, Mr. Chairman, it does seem to me 
that every time there is a motion made or a step taken in 
this House for the purpose of aiding or helping in any way 
the farming class of our country, there is a constitutional 
or some other kind of objection raised against it. It seems 
to me, sir, that there is a combination in this House against 
the Western wealth-producer. I do not make the charge 
;is true, but 1 say it seems to be true. And yet this amendment 
is offered in the interest of a class of people that feed 
the world, and on whose shoulders this Government rests 
and without them it could not exist six months. [Applause.] 

ELECTION OF PKESIDEXT BY THE PEOPLE. 

Near the close of the 1st Session of the 52nd Congress, he appeared 
in advocacy of the election of V. S. Senators by direct 
vote of the people. 

In this speech, quite elaborate and carefully prepared, was set 
forth necessity for ¦ change, inasmuch as the fathers adapted 
the constitution to the prevailing condition of their day, provided 
for amendments as ptogw and experience should dictate. 
In reply to the conservative cry "Let well enough alone," he 
responded: "Nothing is well enough that can be made better, 
and he who conforms to the idea of well enough, has not only 
ceased to advance but has actually turned the wheels of progress 
backward." In his introduction he said: 

Tin- disposition of man to take advantage of the misfortunes 
and prey upon tin 1 weakness of his fellow man 
made government a necessity. Since the day our first parents 
were driven from Eden, this disposition of one man to 
steal from another his birthright has followed the human 
race like a curse; it is the underlying principle that has demoralized 
and destroyed every government that has gone 
down in past ages, and will destroy every government now 
existing, unless carefully guarded against by wise, just, and 
wholesome laws, righteously administered. 

Mans greatest enemy is man, and I know of nothing 
against which he needs protection so much as against his 
fellow-men. This is not a new thought, but is as old as 
history, and every government that has and does exist, was 
and is a monument to its truth; and it is evident to raj 
mind that the fathers of our own government realized this

He fanci&lt;-&lt;l the Catben doubted the ability of the people 
govern themselves unless aided with checks and balances. 

Mr. Kem: This fear manifests itself perhaps with no 
greater force than in the provisions for electing the President 
of the United Stales, which has at different times in 
the history of our country resulted in defeating the popular 
will by placing- in the executive chair a man whom the majority 
did not want and for whom they did not vote, thus 
defeating the very principles sought to be maintained. 

In 1870 the American people were brought to see the dang-er 
of an electoral system, which made it necessary to provide 
an Electoral Commission in order to preserve the peace, 
and that placed the judges of the Supreme Court in a position 
that caused many people to feel that the decision rendered 
was not free from party prejudice. Mr. Chairman, if 
I had the power I would go much farther than this resolution 
seeks to go; I would remedy this defect in the Constitution 
in order to guard the people against the dangers that 
threatened the peace and safety of the Republic during- the 
continuation of the electoral ontest referred to. by Baking 
the President elective by the popular vote. I would allow 
no middle man. as member of an electoral college, to stand 
between the people and the consummation of their desires 
as expressed at the polls and defeat the popular will, as they 
have done in the past. The evil of this defect is so apparent 
and the necessity for a remedy so plain that all sickly 
sentimentality should be thrust aside and a fair amount 
of American common sense applied to the blotting- out of 
this remnant of British monarchical misrule. 

Turninj; attention to a speech of Senator ('handler, of Ne 
Hampshire, who said such a change would produce a "Feder

easily effected by the states ;.s the election of members of th 
House was at the present time. As to the charge that briber 
could exist in a nomioatiag convention as easily as in a star 
legislature, he contended that the people at the polls had 
chance to reject a nominee, but BOM as to a bribe elected Sen 
tor of a legislature. 

He met the argument that men of wealth could secure noiui 

nations by the answer that if 
no bar to their election, but 
supreme. In one terse epigr 
man should l&gt;e allowed to sit

ammatic sentence he said: "No 
as a representative of the people 

whom for any reason they do not want." 

Of historic views on the subject, he instanced those of Senator 
Benton. of Missouri, previous to 18M: 

Mr. lienton held as fundamental truth to which there 
was in. exception, "that lilxrty would be ruined by providing 
any kind of substitute for popular election"; asserting 
that all elections would degenerate into fraud and violence 
as the result of intermediate elective bodies. He showed further 
that it was the law of the few to disregard the will of 
the many when they -jot power into their hands, and that 
liberty had been destroyed whenever intermediate bo lies 

obtained the direction of the popular will; he reasoned both 
from history, the philosophy of government, and the nat 
ture of man, and referred to the period of direct voting 
in Greece and Koine as the "grand and glorious periods of 
popular government." when the people were more prosperous 
than at any other period in the history of those 
governments, and wound up with these words: 

"1 believe in the capacity of the people for self-government, 
but they must have fair play, fair play at the .'lections 
on which all depends." 

VIEWS &lt;)F SHI. 

MADISON 

The i|uestion of universal suffrage was discussed long ami 

earnestly in the Federal convention, and the present 
method of electing United States Senators was a compromise 
between the two extremes, one side holding for 
direct popular suffrage without any restrictions, and the 
other contending- for a property qualification. 

Mr. Madison, in commenting' on the abow situation, held </seg>

holders, that the time would come when the majority would 
be without landed or other equivalent property, and called 
attention to the danger of property holders allowing- that 
kind of a majority unrestricted suffrage. Mr. Madison's prediction 
as to the diminution of numbers of property holders 
of the NfttiOB is onh too true, and becoming more apparent 
every day, but he in his reasoning did not seem to grasp 
the idea that legislation would or could have anything to 
do with bringing about this result or that restricting the 
popular franchise would or could in any degree be responsible 
for the apgrepation of the property of the country in 
the hands of the few. Nevertheless, we are firmly convinced 
that if it had not been for the legislation that gave 
l'.il.iHto.tiixi acres of the people's land to the railroad corporations 
more of the people would have homes; if it had 
not been for the wicked, vicious financial legislation in the 
hist twenty-five years more people would own the property 
of our country. If it was not for the unjust tariff laws of 
the past and present by which certain classes engaged in 
certain occupations are fjuaranteed a profit while all other 

- have not only to run their chances on profits, hut 
must also pay the other fellows' profits there would undoubtedly 
be more property owners.

millionaires a curiosity"; that 9196,600,600 could be raised easier 
now than $31,000,000 thirty years ago: that 31,500 persons own

and "on this floor it is opposed by that class of Republicanand 
Democrats who. in the- recent tijiht for the people's money. 
gave us the unprecedented spectacle of Cleveland Democrats 
and Cleveland Republicans standing side by side, as "two souls

To the charge that the law would lead to perjury, he replied: 

Tin- individual who is only waiting for an opportunity to 
perjure himself is already a perjurer, and his morals can 
not be corrupted. 

The whole principle of taxation means search and inquiry

MONOPOLY 

In a speech delivered March ( .t, ix&lt;)4. Mr. Kein. denouncing the 
Washington Gaslight Company.'" proclaimed his theory of 

monopoly 

Mr. Chairman. I believe in the principle, and have advocated 
it before my people, that it is the duty of government 
to see, so far as it is possible, that no corporation or 
combination of men shall control any of the necessities oi 
the people; for it is evident that, when such conditions 
exist, the party or the power having control of such necessities 
will also have the power to extort for those necessities 
more than the people ou^ht to pay as a matter of justice 
and equity. 

Therefore, Mr. Chairman, 1 believe each municipality 
should control these necessities, such as local transportation 
of freight, humanity, or intelligence, water systems, 
and lighting plants, by its own municipal government. I 
believe in forming a monopoly &gt;f all the people to con- </seg>

mind of man ean scarcely comprehend it. and no power on

Narrow strips on the eastern and western borders of this

PATERNALISM 

Mr. &lt; hairman, is a word that has been in great demand 
nice the organization of the Populist Party. It has 
I.e. -ii hurled at us upon every occasion with a vim and enworthy 
of a better cause. We are accused of seeking 
to establish a paternal government. Why should we seek 
ablish something we already have in its very worst 
form? Paternalism is just what we are organized to de- 

Iiat is paternalism in government? It is the favoritism 
ie government towards a few of its citizens by which 
are given special privileges, enabling them to control 
necessities of the people and rob them. The Pacific 
oad case just eited is an example. This is the governt 
paternalism of an unjust parent pure and simple. 

I it I think it should be called infernalism, for really that 
s nature. Xo more paternal infernalism, if you please, 
have already had too much of that under Republican 
Democratic rule. Our motto is: "Equal rights to all

soon when the present paternal form of government, which 
means the government for the few and the devil take the 
balance, will he changed to a fraternal form, which means 
the good of all. 

In denouncing precedents of railroad construction, spe 
protection and monopolistic hanking he said: 

The relation that should exist between the Government 
and the people is not the same which exists betweea the 
parent and his helpless infant or a doting father and a 
favorite son. in which the father lavishes upon the son all 
the good things of life, while his brothers and sist.

between the members (if a fraternal organization and its 
officers, the members contributing to the support of the organization 
according to their several abilities, the officers in 
turn enacting and executing the laws in such a way as to 
give protection to all alike. 

The conclusion of a candid and searching speech, of w 
these few extract! give but a faint idea, was not enthnsh 
of immediate results: 

Mr. Chairman, as above stated. I have no hope of getting 
any relief from Congress as now constituted. It is almost 
impossible to get even a hearing on this matter, to say 
nothing of action that will accomplish the work. Thousands 
of dollars are appropriated for monuments to dead 
men, thousands for firing the sun-down gun, millions to 
build cannons so large that it costs hundreds of dollars to 
fire them once, and millions more for the general interest* 
of the East; but not one cent for irrigation, the Wests

papers and jm riodii als to a lower grade of postage, and the hill 
being disfavored bv the Post Office Committee, at the investigation 
of the P. o. Department. Mr. Hainer was specially delighted 
when a deluge of a 1 .0(»O.(MM) petitioners demanded its pasand 
as an amendment to an appropriation bill it was enacted 
into law. 

ARIFF. 

Kring th&lt;- second session of the 53rd Congress, the Wilson 
hill being before I he House. Mr. Hainer delivered a care 
prepared ¦peeci upon protection and free trade, without 
iptiag to discuss the minutiae of the bill. 

In the introduction he made beautiful reference to liis con- 

st it uencv: 

I represent :i constituency having their homos in the 
territorial center of iht- United States. To the east are the 
|1(S&gt;1 manufacturing and business marts of the distributing 
centers. To the west are the great Rockies with their 
wealth of ores, and seinitroi&gt;ical California. To the north 
are the immense fields of wheat and oil and forests of tim- 

Iht. To the south are the broad fields of cotton, cane, and 
\ly people arc ensragcd largely in agriculture and 
the trades dependei«: upon that great industry. The 
the products of their fields mainly to Americans engaged in 
manufacturing, mining, transportation, and in mercantile 
pursuits. They are excelled by no constituency in intelli- 

gence, straightforwardness of purpose, and loyal devotion 
to country. They are not to be deceived by words, be they 
uttered with the vehemence of the tempest or the easy 
grace of the most polished and suave orator. Xo smiting of 
the Congressional breast, coupled with agonizing protestations 
of a determination to "serve God and the people regardless 
of party dictation." will reconcile them to a measure 
which strikes down the industrial independence and 
interests of our Nation, cripples its markets and degrades 
its labor. 

Kid in his conclusion, twined a garland for his adopted 
try: 

Mr. Chairman, the supreme test of true greatness In 
either individual or nation is its capacity to endure pros- </seg>



            <seg id="p147">

&lt; 

perity. In adversity and great trial America not only retained 
her place among the nations but deservedly pained 
the unqualified admiration and respect of the world. Entering 
upon her second century, favored beyond the power 
of speech to declare, may she be given the saving common 
HMi to cherish and "hold fast that which is good." Respect 
comes to the self-respecting. Freedom is his who 
waits not on another; who commands that which satisfies 
his wants — abiding greatness and prosperity to the nation 
which promotes thrift, dignifies labor, and encourages, 
advances, and protects its people. 

In the spirit of Kossuth, his thoughts were of the exile and 
•migrant: 

Prosperity MMM* only from industry, labor, saving, and 
thrift. Waste does not conduce to it. Above all, Americans 
will l&gt;e independent. That spirit has become a fixture 
here. Our forefathers and some of us grew tired of contributing 
by our sweat to the luxury of lords and to 
enrich royalty. We welcome to our midst, even as we ourselves 
were but recently welcomed, every honest. Industrious, 
law-abiding man who wants to better his conditions 
and become a loyal American citizen. Let such bring here 
their machinery, their skill and strength, wealth and enterprise, 
their manhood, and join with us in upbuilding and 
sustaining a policy which has for a generation made our 
country's name synonymous with opportunity. 

In bis argument, proper, he contended, that all the President 
liuve favored protection; that the country prospered most unde 
the highest tariffs; that free trade would equally cripple agri 
culture and manufactures; and that an income tax was the pe 
of demagogues; and in illustration of these and kindred propos 
tions, numerous authors, messages, speeches and statistica 
tables were consulted and arguments adroitly adduced. II 
arrayed the bill itself against the doctrine that protection waa 
unconstitutional : 

The pending bill refutes the oDJection. The committee reporting 
it admit, as everyone who examines it must see, 
that it is not shorn of protective features. It covers nearly 
4,000 articles. The greater part of these are produced in 
this country. No one giving the question a moment's consideration 
will deny the proposition that a tariff on an 
article the like of which is produced in this country is </seg>

            <seg id="p148">
532 


¦arily protective. It may not be sufficiently high to accomplish 
any useful purpose, but it is protective. The importer 
must in the first instance pay the duty. That is conceded. 
With this added cost he meets in competition the 
domestic article which has not paid the duty. 

(an you convince the importer this is no disadvantage to 
him? Will the tariff reformer who is selling the domestic 
article deny the duty is a protection to him? 

Nevertheless, Mr. llaincr retired from the arena of deliate. 
exclaiaiag: "This bill lias bo merits. It is full of demerits. Its 
M-r.v shadow is a lilifiht and palsy. In its operation it will he 

worse than pestilence." 

FEDERAL ELE&lt; 

TIoN LAW 

On the :Jfith day of September, 
advocated his bill. "To repeal all 
of elections and special deputy 
- " Mr. Tucker said: 

1893, Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, 
tatutes relating to supervisors 
marshals and for other pur 

I'lu- first proposition, tin 
attention of the House is this 
anates from the state and is 
tion on the citizen by the 

refore, to which I ask the 

That the riijhl of suffrage eranot 
conferred in the Constitu- 

Federal Government, but Is 

reserved to ilie states and so declared to be in the Constitution 
itself. In the second section of Article I of the Constitution 
we find this provision: 

"The House of IJepresentat ives shall be composed of members 
chosen every second year by the people of the se\eral 
states: and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications 
requisite for electors of the most numerous branch 
of the St«te Legislature." 

That is, whatever provision Congress may make under Its 
powers with reference to the "manner of holding" elections 
the origianl right of suffrage rests with the states of the 
Union. By this provision of the Constitution suffrage is 
conferred through the states, and it leaves in the states the 
determination of the right and the conditions of suffrage 
and the citizen is entitled to it because he is a citizen of the 
state and not because of his citizenship of the Unitec 
Stat. 

Such right of suffrage and conditions of are subject to 
the suffrage laws of the state of the citizen and must l&gt;e 
prescribed and limited by such state. The state may sa; 
that no man under 21 years of age can vote, which is a con 
dition of suffrage: or it may say that none but property 
holders can vote, which is a condition of suffrage; or it ma. </seg>

            <seg id="p149">
533 


say that no man can vote until he registers, which is a condition 
of suffrage; or it may say that no man shall vote 
who can not read or write, which is a condition of suffrage. 
None of these conditions, confessedly, can be regulated 
by the Federal Government, but are left wholly to the 
states. 

These laws ought to be repealed. Mr. Speaker, because 
they seek to take away from the state, that alone can bestow 
suffrage on the citizen, the power of determining the 
right to vote; they ought to be repealed because they have 
been the subject of collisions and jealousies and unnecessary 
clashing of authorities since their enactment; they 
ought to be repealed, sir. because they are reconstruction 
measures, the unhappy reminders of a period in our history 
forever gone, except from the memory of the people; they 
ought to be repealed because the states are as much interested 
in seeing that their Representatives are properly 
elected as the Federal Government can possibly be. 

Mr. Hainer, of Nebraska, indicated his readiness to enter the 
discussion by pmw ¦iliag, an inquiry; and a week thereafter 
occupied the House with a carefully prepared speech. He said: 

Mr. Speaker— The question now before the House is one 
of the deepest interest, affecting essentially the foundations 
of the Federal Government. Nominally the bill under consideration 
seeks merely to repeal certain sections of Federal 
law looking to the supervision of Federal elections by 
supervisors and deputy marshals, practically it goes further 
and seeks to wipe out every jmssible trace of Federal control 
and Federal supervision of elections. 

Tn approaching the discussion of this question, I confess I 
hail from a district which regards this Union not simply 
as an aggregation of states, but as a great nation, not 
merely exercising delegated but original powers based upon 
the fundamental law. 

Representing as I do. iu part, the people of a state nearly 
every quarter section of which is occupied by a man who 
gave evidence of his loyalty to the Union by bearing a 
musket in the days when many gentlemen who now declaim 
against these laws were fighting against the Government. 
I confess that I have some feeling on this question.

SUGAR BOUNTIES 

A proposition to repeal the act allowing a bounty on sugar, 
which had cost the government |9,000,t)00 per year, met the opposition 
of the member from Nebraska. He claimed that "it 
is the duty of the government to continue the bounty now provided 
by law till July 1, IMS." 

Iuoting from President Cleveland's Hawaiian message: "That 
Tinted States in aiming to maintain itself as one of the most 
jjhtened of nations would do its citizens &lt;;ross injustice if it 
lied to its international relations any other than a high 
idaid of honor and morality, " he continued : 

That these sentiments are correct aii'l creditable will 
hardly l&gt;e questioned. They have met with general approval 
on both sides of the IIou&gt;.-. 

I quote them only to re -enforce the suggestion that a 
principle so strangely and strenuously invoked in l&gt;ehalf 
of a foreign Queen, disreputable l«Jth in public and private 
life. lie not withheld when dealing with nations with whom 
we have treaty relations, anil our own people who have 
taken the Government at its word and invested millions in 
a useful industry. This bill annuls our reciprocity treaties, 
without even consulting the other contracting parti' 
takes from our own people the inducement which alone led 
them to enirapre in an otherwise losing venture. 

We have no moral riffht to do this. I greatly question 
ur legal right to abrogate this law. running as it does 

for a specific time, and for which the appropriation ha 
already been made. 

It is more than a mere bounty or gratuity: it confers a 
vested riffht. 

En the supposition that the Democratic majority must respect 
sentiment of parly friends, lie attempted to arrav Secretary 
ton. the Omiilm Hnaltl and Dr. Miller upon the side of the 
ir bounties. His conclusion was as follows: 

I am surprised that any &lt;*entleman should hesitate for 
jne moment to vote the protection needed. You ought not </seg>

l&gt;ortion of the (.'round which should be traversed. I know 
ihat gentlemen on the other side are only too anxious to

But. gentlemen, let me tell you that two years from now

MISSOURI RIVKR COMMISSION. 

ithout indirection, circumlocution or hesitancy Mr. Hainer 
iked the general course of improvement by the Missouri 
i- •CiiiTiiissidii. March lit. 1n«I4: 

Mr. Chairman, what is the object of this Missouri Kiver 
Commission? Its first and gTeat object, in the broad sense, 
is and must be to facilitate and extend commerce; not simply 
to make that, river navigable, though that may be incidental 
to the final object to be attained. 

What is the character of the commerce along this stream? 

Clearly it is of a double character. First, it is the commerce 
which extends up and down the stream itself, and 
-eroinlly. the CO irie which goes over and across the 
¦tma. 

As a matter of fact, the commerce which extends up and 
down that stream is. as the gentleman himself admits, incimsideralile. 
On the other hand. th« commerce which 
- over the river at the city of Omaha alone exceeds 
all the commerce which floats either on the Mississippi 
TJiver. the Missouri Kiver, or both combined. There is no 

question about that fact. 

Let us get at the truth of this matter, the real kernel of 
it: for what we want to do here, as intelligent legislators, 
is in expend the money of the people in serving the needs 

of the. people. We are not interested simply in making a 
stream navigable if no commerce is to be benefited thereby: 
iiid if there is more of benefit to be had in improving the </seg>

            <seg id="p153">
537 


river along those points where commerce is engaged, then 
it may be wise and to our interest to expend money for that 
purpose. 

E.ving affirmed that improvements should proceed from upiii 
downward and finding that f 1.000,000 had been expended 
stretch of fourteen miles near Jefferson City, where no boat 
mmerce was entered, he exclaimed: 

Now, at that rate. Mr. Chairman, how much money will 
be required to bring that Missouri River into a navigable 
condition from its mouth to Sioux City? Why, it would 
take $80,000,000. How much time will it require at the rate 
which work has been progressing? It will take one hundred 
and twenty years. And yet these jrentlemen say that 
the contract system requires that all expenditures be made 
in continuation of this project, slower in execution than the 
wrath of God. and more expensive than the most prodigal 
would care for one moment to stand as sponsor. 

Eaving by an unanswerable array of facts shown that the 
merce crossing the river at Omaha and other points wm 
lliarly "interstate and transcontinental." and was threat-1 
by disasters to the great bridge from floods and changing 
inels. be gave an analysis of the pending bill: 

Take the appropriations asked for here. They are 750.-000. 
What does this Commission propose to do with that? 
It proposes to pay for traveling expenses and salaries 20.-(WfO: 
for surveys, permanent bench-marks and gauges. $30,000; 
for operating snn«r boat. $35,000: and for a system of improvement 
in the first reach, that means from the mouth 
of the OHgC River down, about 1M miles. $665,000, which 
makes up the whole $7.10.000: and not a particle of it is for 
the protection of the real commerce that goes across this 

iver. or for the protection of the great interests which 

lit to be protected, .is it seems to me. 

It is time that great national interests located in the West 
were heard in these halls. The South and East find ready 
audience, and their petitions seldom denied. 

Of this I do not complain, but submit to your sense of 
fairness that the reasonable and just claims of the West be 
no longer ignored. 

Ending his labors in the 53rd Congress, second session, he

Mil. Mercer: Mr. ( hairnian. there are some persons on 
the floor of this House who, never having had occasion ti 
go farther west than the Allegheny Mountains, are forget 
fill of the fact that far beyond the Mississippi River extenda 
rich country filled with people and with vast natural re 
sources, a country through which they have never travelei 
and of which, perhaps, they ha\e never read. When m\ 
friend from Tennessee, in an off-hand way. says that whei 
the committee recognize Cincinnati and St. Louis they have

pone west far enough. I wish to say to him that when you 
fro as far as those cities you have scarcely pone a third of 
the way across this continent. 

Does not the pentleman know that the Missouri River runs 
throuph the ideographical center of this preat country? 
(ientlemen of the Eastern States should realize that there 
is a large body of people living west of the Missouri River; 
thai there is a large amount of capital invested in that 
repion: that there are paper-manufaeturinp industries out 
there as well as printinp industries, which are of too great 
importance to be ignored. 

I sorely repret the attitude assumed upon this 'floor by 
many Kastern and Southern members in the discussion of 
legislation affecting the West. The city of Washington is 
no longer Ihe center of population of this Nation. "Westward 
the star of empire takes its way"' and has been so 
traveling for lo. these many years. IVcause Washington 
continues to be the seat of our National Government, and 
is so near the great cities of New York and Philadelphia 
and within a few hours' ride by train to populous New England 
and the East, is no reason why representatives of the 

great West should be forbidden the privilege of reminding 
the country that beyond the Mississippi River lies a magnificent 
empire which some day will refuse to perform the 
services of tail to the dog. will protest against the dominalions 
of the East, and will obtain a recognition in national 
councils befitting its resources and station, and this recognition 
will be obtained, not by war. not by threat or intimidation, 
but by peaceful legislation. 

The lime is not far distant when the center of population 
will be near that great metropolis, the queen city of the 
Missouri Valley, the commercial gateway to the Occident — 
my home city, Omaha. Some people in New York City 
firmly believe that Central I'm k is the center of population 
in the Tnited States. The poor deluded creatures. 
That point is now in southwestern Indiana, and at the rate 
population is increasing in America it will find a location 
at Omaha before tins century will have ceased numbering 
rears. 

This bill docs not recognize in section 3 that there is any 
United States west of Chicago and St. Louis. But there is 
a great deal of America west of those two cities. Early in 
this century Indiana and Illinois could properly be considered 
in the West: but since civilization has traveled to the 
Pacific Ocean, leaving in its wake magnificent cities, beautiful 
and fruitful farms and mines of wealth in almost 
every state west of the Mississippi River, we politely ask </seg>

            <seg id="p157">
541 


the conservative East to include in the West all that region 
west of the Father of Waters. 

Does the gentleman from Tennessee not know that Omaha, 
Kansas City, Sioux City, Lincoln. Des Moines, Minneapolis, 
St. Paul, Denver, Salt Lake City. Los Angeles, San Francisco, 
Portland, the beautiful cities of Washington, and 
many other commercial centers in the great West are as 
much superior to many of the older cities of America as is 
the illumination of the sun stronger and brighter than that 
of the moon'.' These cities began where the Kastern cities 
finished, taking advantage of experience. 

We profit by experience in the West, while the East is 
eternally experiencing a profit at our expense. All we ask 
is a recognition that we are still a part of the Union. We 
pay taxes, we will fight to preserve the Union, but we ask 
a little more than glory and empty promises. Omaha is the 
home of newspapers. In this city they prosper, they grow. 
they succeed. Our people are a reading, thinking people, 
and they include advertisements in their literary bill of fare. 
I will venture the assertion that an advertisement inserted 
in one of Omaha's newspapers would receive as much notice 
and call for as many replies as would a similar notice appearing 
in any newspaper published in half the cities mentioned 
in section '¦). 

Our papers circulate to the Pacific Ocean, to the Gulf, and 
even force an entrance into cities along the Atlantic seaboard, 
while we all know there are cities mentioned in this 
bill whose papers have a limited circulation beyond the 
confines of the State in which they are published. In our 
city we have one of the largest newspaper office buildings 
in the world. In fact. Omaha is such an important factor in 
Western America that I propose to read you a few statistics 
simply as an "eye-opener" to those of you who have been 
confining your visits to a small -fraction of this great 
country.

FIRST REGl LAR SKSSIuN 

FIFTY-THIRD CONGRESS 

Early in the session of the SMI Congress Mr. Mercer supplemented 
his maiden ¦pceck, as above, with a large mass of 
manufacturing statisiics. and the protests of numerous business 
turn and manufacturers against the reduction of tariff duties on 
foreign importations, all tending to add additional lustre to 
Omaha's crown of honors. 

But in the midst of general jubilation his farmer constituency 
were not forgotten: 

Mr. Chairman The farmers of Douglas. Sarpy. and Washington 
Counties, tlie territory which comprises the Congressional 
district which I have the honor to represent upon 
this floor, have been materially and handsomely benefited 
by the growth and development of Omaha and South Omaha 
as markets for the products of the farm. The more manufacturing 
plants, the greater the diversity of interests 
the stronger becomes the home of such benefits as a receiver, 
consumer, and distributer of farm products. Then 
too. a home market like Omaha and South Omaha increases 
in value the price of farm lands tributary thereto. Although 
not to so great a degree, the smaller cities and towns in this 
territory afford a convenient market for the product o1 
farms situated nearby. Town people and the agriculturists 
should be the best of friends. Their interests are reciprocal 
and protection to one is protection to the other, and in al 
instances they should be inseparably joined in a contes 
against foreign invasion, whether that invasion be of the 
nature of pauper immigration or the products thereof. I 
America is to be flooded with the cast-off cheapness o: 
foreign lands the stability of our institutions will surely 
fall from its foundation and American honor will have 
suffered an unfortunate stain. 

I am proud of the enterprising citizenship in the State 
of Nebraska. I am proud of the important and prominent 
position occupied by Douglas County and its enterprising </seg>

cities in the agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing 
domain of this Republic, and I firmly believe that with a 
national policy of protection in America this greatness in 
Nebraska will increase aixl the pood times of the Harrison 
Administration will return 1&lt;&gt; this land now stricken with 
a business depression brought about by a false economic 
policy. 

BEET 

SUUAU. 

A few (lavs later, while iiulitat in&lt;r the palky of a bounty i 
beet Mgmr production, lie exploded a rhetorical bomb in 
camp of the Arkansas delegation, they having failed to sue 
in the new industry, and beiag opposed to that policy whic 
believed desirable for Nebraska. 

Mr. Merckr: Mr. Chairman, some M-ars ago a farmer in 
the state of Ohio made up his mind that he would change 
his place of residence and move to Arkansas— the reason 
why nobody knows; history has never piven us an explanation. 
It seems that a short time after he landed in Arkansas 
a country fair was held. He had taken with him from Ohio 
to his new home some very fine Chester White pigs — six in 
all— beauties every one of them. He thought it no more 
than right that he should encourage the industry of raising 
fine thoroughbred hops in bis new home; so he took to this 
country fair these six elegant Chester White pips and placed 
them on exhibition. After the awards had been made the 
Ohio man discovered that the breed of hogs in which he hac 
been dealing all his life were not appreciated in the State 
of Arkansas. The first premium ribbon was pinned upon a 
pen that contained six "razor-backed looking" hogs — hogs 
with long legs — hogs that looked more like greyhounds than 
any hogs ever before raised upon American soil. 

The man from Ohio was not very much chagrined because 
he had not received the first premium, but his curiosity was 
excited. So he called upon the chairman of the awarding 
committee and asked him the reason why his hogs were rejected 
for a premium while the pen containing the "razors' 
was recognized. The chairman said to him. "My dear sir 
you must be a stranger in this part of the country. In 
Arkansas the people have no use for hogs that can not 
outrun a negro."' [Laughter.] 

Now. Mr. Chairman, I am not surprised that Representatives 
from the State of Arkansas on this floor — 

Mr. McRae: Before the gentleman gives us another 
chestnut will he please pick out the worm? </seg>

MEMBERS OF V. 8. HOISE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 

Mr. Mercer: The gentleman by rising in his seat has 
given one himself and therefore it is not necessary that I 
should do so. 

Mr. Chairman, the people of Arkansas tried the experiment 
with beet-sugar seed. They sent to the Agricultural 
Department of the United States for seed, and they were 
furnished. They experimented, as also did the people of 
Missouri, and the people of those two states made the poorest 
exhibit made by the people of any state where the experiment 
was tried. 

TARIFF 

tgain, upon the 27th of January the Record contains a speech, 
i editorial and manufacturers' views, ami sentiments from 
author of the McKinley tariff, and from the Hon. James G. 
ne, with Mr. Mercer's protest against a reduction of tariff 
es. Of employer and employee he said: 

Profit and loss as knowledge should be common property 
to employer and employee. If the head of an establishment 
is living beyond his means, he should throw pride to the 
dogs and make a confession. If prosperity smiles upon him. 
he should see to it that the wage .vorker shares with the 
stockholder in some of the dividends. If reverses occur, the 
wage earner should in turn extend the employer aid and 
assistance. While legislation does not compel this course, 
an honest conscience and a generous heart would suggest it. 

In regard to a certain equalization of wages he said: 

These are cruel words. When such a condition exists in 
America I trust my days will have been numbered, as I hare 
no desire to witness the scenes of starvation and struggle 
for bread that will then be daily observed upon this American 
soil, a soil hallowed in patriotism, love of country, and 
protection to American industry and American labor. Then 
will the dignified, intelligent American bread-winner grorel 
in the mire side by side with the pauper labor of Europe; 
then will hordes of Mongolians infest our territory, enjoy 
the fruits of our labor accumulated in better days, and the 
anarchist will prevail in resplendent glory. 

In rebuttal of all charges or insinuations against his constituency 
he drew the following glowing picture of life upon the 
farm: 

It is my privilege and pleasure to represent a constituency 
rich in natural and acquired resources. Although there are 

36 </seg>

            <seg id="p162">
546 



only three counties in my district, these three counties in 
agriculture, in manufacture, and in commerce, challenge the 
world for superiors. The counties of Washington and Sarpy 
and the agricultural part of Doug-las are filled with bountiful 
farms and intelligent farmers and farmers' families. 
The farmers in this district are well to do and many quite 
wealthy. They have excellent farms and they know how to 
farm them. What is more, they farm the soil with the plow 
and other implements and machinery and not with the 
mouth. Instead of occupying a place upon a dry goods box 
with the whittling knife in hand, grumbling at that which 
labor and industry would prevent the happening, the farmers 
of these counties exercise their brain in the management 
and control of their possessions, and they employ industrious, 
honest labor in the cultivation and management of 
the same. 

The farmers in this district ride in carriages. They dress 
in fine linen, and their homes are conveniently and advantageously 
furnished. It is not a strange thing to find a 
piano in the farm houses. Brussels carpet upon the floor, 
excellent parlor furniture, pictures upon the walls, welldressed 
inmates, and bountifully-laid tables. The rich 
meadows and rich soil properly tilled produce magnificent 
crops of everything planted therein, and the whole country 
blooms with prosperity and richness. If I cannot say something 
good about the neighborhood in which I live, rest 
assured I would not call attention to the unfortunate happenings 
therein. 

More damage has been done in certain sections of the 
United States west of the Mississippi Kiver by the mouthing* 
and vaporings of cranks and demagogues, who assume 
to be farmers and farmers" guardians, than was ever done 
bv windstorms, grasshoppers, drouth, or by any pestilence 
whatsoever. In many instances, you show me a man who 
claims to be a practical farmer, who travels from place to 
place stirring up strife and discontent among his neighbors, 
criticising everything in the Government but himself ami 
those whom he seeks to use, and I will show you ¦ man 
who, if a farmer, does not know how to farm. 

tThe sum ami substance of the plea for State and national 
ftion is easy of comprehension: 

I desire the mills and spinneries to come to Nebraska. I 
contend that if protection has filled New England with mills 
and spinneries, has enriched her people in city and on farm, 
that the same legislation will make of Nebraska another and </seg>

greater Massachusetts. Our time in the West has arrived. 
New industries are springing up everywhere. They are welcome, 
thrice welcome. Encouragement they need, protection 
they must have. Stand up for Nebraska! 

Ei the subject of Missouri River improvement Mr. Mercer did 
forget the interests of Omaha and Council Bluffs, but his 
ague, Mr. Hainer. had so completely occupied the ground 
but little was left to be added. 

Erne time having elapsed since Mr. Mercer's last eulogy upon 
ha and Nebraska a suitable occasion offered during a dison 
upon irrigation, which was promptly embraced. 

Mr. Chairman — Some years ago it was my good fortune to 
visit the State of Oregon, and I there noticed some of the 
benefits of irrigation. On one side of a roadway the soil 
was pure sand, while ten feet away the same sand, through 
the merits of irrigation, was made rich in a most profusive 
production of vegetation. In Nebraska the same success has 
crowned the efforts of the enterprising farmers who have 
attempted irrigation. The sand lots of one year were made 
to produce a most remarkable yield of potatoes, while farm 
after farm emerged from the valueless to the valuable. 

Eastern Nebraska has been fortunately blessed in nature's 
gifts, and does not need irrigation or other artificial methods 
to insure crops. I venture the assertion that this part 
of Nebraska is the cream of the agricultural kingdom, no 
matter in what part of the world competition is sought. A 
failure of crops has not occurred since the first settlement, 
and year after year this qualification of the soil increases 
in its usefulness. 

It is the western part of Nebraska which seeks and needs 
irrigation, and if irrigation is given this part of Nebraska — 
a State which now stands second in the Union as a cornproducing 
State — it will soon take rank with the eastern 
part, and then will Nebraska be the greatest corn and wheat 
producing State in America. 

Leave being granted to print in the Record a speech «t ex 
Senator Warren. Omaha '•came up smiling." 

We remember, nearly all of us, when Omaha was a little, 
struggling hamlet, and it seemed to me then and it seems 
to me now. that scarcely a place above or below upon this 
river but what a city could have been as well built as here. 
It has been, however, the spirit of her people, the ambition. </seg>

the brain, and the will power of the citizens of Omaha that 
have made it what it is. 

Omaha, when but a small village, took advantage of opportunities 
and made her supreme effort at a time when tin- 
Nation declared that it would have a railroad constructed 
across the continent, connecting: the vital life of the great 
East with the mighty- possibilities of the boundless West. 
Omaha liecame the gateway of this transcontinental line. 
There has always l&gt;een in Nebraska and in Omaha supreme 
hospitality. In this State, especially in Omaha, a spirit has 
always existed which said to every man seeking a home. 
"We welcome you. Law-abiding citizens, all come to us ami 
make your home with us." 

EDUCATION, SUFFRAGE 

AND NATURALIZATION 

As tin* last (lavs of the .~&gt;:{rd Congress were beiag auaben 
Mr. Mercer placed upon record sentiments of jreneral nation 
import. 

Mr. Speaker — The public school in America is a necessity. 
and I rejoice that it steadily grows in favor. The American 
flair should decorate every school building in the land, and 
the pupils should l&gt;e taught to reverence as well as respect 
one equally with the other, for the moment our public 
school system is allowed to crumble and disappear that 
moment will the Stars and Stri|&gt;es cease to W emblematical 
of American patriotism, and the Constitution and the law 
will have gone the way of the dead. 

If we will carefully keep church and state separate in all 
legislative matters, and continue to throw around our public 
school system walls of protection, sift the suffrage of the 
country so a man will not be allowed to vote until he 
realizes the full responsibility of the act. cure our natural 
ization laws so a man will not lie allowed to become an 

American citizen until he is properly qualified to wear the 
dignity which that honor and title bear, to so remedy our 
immigration laws that only the best elements of foreign 
society will be allowed an opportunity to mingle with and 
lieoonip a part and parcel of American civilization and make 
it impossible for the anarchy and pauperism of the Old 
World to find a lodgment here, we will have done much to 
uplift American institutions. 

I am glad to note that in educational matters great steps 
of progreRs have been made, especially in the western part 
Stanford illuminate educational circles to-dav. while the </seg>



            <seg id="p165">
great universities of several western states, notably Nebraska, 
Iowa, and Kansiis. occupy an enviable position in 
the educational world. Their instructors and their students 
are gradually achieving- a prominence which cannot do 
otherwise than reflect the greatest of credit upon them and 
upon the institutions they respectively represent. It is ¦ 
jrood sign of civilization when education is pushed into the 
frontier of this, as well as other countries, because education 
always civilizes, but public money should be expended 
in a nonsectarian direction. Such a course will insure less 
division, less trouble, and more efficiency than any other 
method which might be pursued. </seg>

HON. GEORGE 1). MEIKLEJOHN 

March 4th. H'.w— March 4th. l-^'.iT. 

Hon. George D. Meiklejohn was born at Weyauwega, Wan 
paca Couuty, Wisconsin, August 2G. 1857. and brought up n 
a farm. Be was educated at the State Normal. Oshkosh. and 
Michigan Iniversity. Ann Arbor: and graduated from the Law 
Department of Michigan 1'niversity in 1880; prior to which 
time he was principal of the High School at Weyauwega and 
Lisconib. Iowa. He was a lawyer at 2.'$ years of age, the same 
\ear in which he came to Nebraska, at 27 he was in the Mate 
Senate, at :'.»i was chairman of the Republican State Central 
Committee, at .".1 was elected Lieutenant Governor: and at :'.." 
years of age elected to Congress, as a Republican, receiving 
13,638 votes against 19,(98 for George F. Keiper. Democrat, and 
!t. r,:;t; for William A. l'oynter. Independent. In 1894 he was 
re-elected to the .'-lili Congress. 

H&lt;- was fortunate in ihe circumstances of life upon the farm — 
early education — self support — settlement in a new and progressive 
community — ability to acquire and integrity to hold the 
confidence of a constituency till landed in Congress with a I 
lator'l resources and a presiding officer's experience, acquired 
in presiding over the Stale Senate, by election, and ex-onVio. 
as Lieutenant Governor. 

The gentleman had also acquired a terse and comprehensive 
use of language, as evidenced by the introductory sentences of 
his first speech in the 53rd Congress .lanuary 12. 1S94. Mr. 
Meiklejohn said: 

One year airn ihi» prayer for "a chanjre of party" was.

more than a third of a century the executive and both 
branches of the legislative departments of the Government 
were placed in the alwolute control of the Democratic party. 
The American people prior to this "change of party" were </seg>

enjoying 1 the blessings guaranteed to them by the Constitution. 
Industry, the great heart of the arterial system of 
trade, was beating: normally and regularly; her pulsations 
filled the conduits of commerce with the products of American 
labor. American capital, and American genius. She 
blessed with wealth and prosperity the most remote part 
&lt;&gt;f the Nation; she fed the bread-winners of the land with 
the produce of American soil and made a home market for 
Um American farmer: capital had a field for investment: 
labor, employment; transportation, trade and commerce: 
manufactures, a demand for their products. 

The Nation was blessed with universal prosperity, and happiness 
and contentment beamed from the home. The 
maxim of Daniel Webster, that "Where there is work for 
the hands there is work for the teeth." was never more 
fully verified. This was the condition of our Republic before 
the transformation scene of a year ago. 

A CHANGS OF PARTY 

was the verdict of the ballots; the '"change of administration" 
had not yet come. Its realization was four months in 
the future. The prospect of Democratic experimentation 
and platform translation began its work of industrial prostration 
and commercial depression. Capital took fright; 
industry moved sluggishly: products of manufactures decrrased 
to the current demand: labor saw her wages decline 
and the doors of employment slowly •¦!¦ 

Doubt and uncertainty drove our medium of exchange 
into hiding; banks were forced to realize on securities to

warehouses increased. The Nation for the first time since

world. Who could predict what was in store when a "change

RESII.T 

Where\er I Ix-et-sugar factory is located and within a 
radius of many mile* the agricultural country MfH 
touched as with a new life. There is a rise in the value of 
land and labor is in demand, towns and villages take on 
\igor and growth, and every man. laborer, banker, merchant, 
and farmer, feels the touch of a new industry. 
Thousands of dollars are annually expended by the factory 
in every direction, giving business a steady impetus and a 
demand for the products of &lt;tther industries. 

No man. of whatever political faith, who is not n demagogue 
can go through a beet field and visit a sugar factory 
without feeling that God's sunshine is indeed ¦ partner with 
labor and capital in one of the great agricultural industries. 

Arc the energy and capital invested in this enterprise, 
the hopes of the farmers and planter in this great sugar industry, 
to l&gt;e paralyzed? At whose behest? Is it possible 
that (laus Spreckels has found favor in the eyes of a Democracy 
which only fourteen months ago was yelling itself 
hoarse in denunciation of trusts? 

Mr. Hrigham. in l£90. Master of the National Grange, composed 
of one a»d one-quarter millions of farmers, said: 

"I think our people would not favor a bounty on any commodity 
that we now produce in sufficient quantities to supply 
our people. There are many of them in favor of bounties. 
Take, for instance, sugar." 

At the transmississippi convention, held at Ogden last 
spring, a convention composed of over 600 delegates from 

IS States, a resolution passed without opposition against 
repeal of the bounty from or protection for sugar. 

Let no one suppose for a moment that but two or three 
states growing sugar are the only ones interested in this 
industry. On the contrary, the mechanic, the laborer, the 
merchant, and the farmer in many states, aside from the 
cane. beet, and sorghum belt are deeply interested in this 
struggle. Prior to 1S"&gt;7 Louisiana had paid to Eastern 
foundries and machine shops over $10,000,000 for engines, 
sugar mills, kettles, furnaces, doors, grates, bars, vacuum 
pans, pumps, water pipes, wagons, and harness. She had 
paid to Tennessee, Ohio. Kentuckv, Illinois, and Indiana </seg>

She had purchased every year over $1,500,000 of pork. $65,000 
of flour. $275,000 of shoes. $1,250,000 of clothing, half a million 
dollars of blankets, and $1,250,000 of horses and mules, 
or a total of nearly $4,700,000 annually. When she had with 
a capital in this industry increased fourfold and now reaching 
$150,000,1)00. her calls on the North and border states for 
machinery, animals, wagons, harness, provisions, and clothing 
makes an interstate commerce of $50,000,000 annually.

lie entered a protest, also, because binding twine was placed 
i the free lint: and playfully alluded to Mr. Bryan: 

My colleague (Mr. Bryan) will remember. In the Fifty- 

second Congress, in speaking of the election of 1S90, he said 
that he would not find fault with Mr. Reed if he consumed 
his time in recalling those words of Thomas Moore, "The 
last rose of summer." 

You will remember that you predicted that the "revolution" 
might reach the shores of Maine. Little you then 
thought that it would reach the prairies ef Nebraska before 
the shores of Maine. With the victory of the Administration 
in the last Democratic convention in Nebraska and the Republication 
victory in the Nation I know my colleague will 
find no fault with me if I consume sufficient time to recall 
the words in the last stanza of that beautiful anapest: 

So. soon may I follow, 
When friendships decay. 

And from love's shining circle 
The gems drop away. 

When true hearts lie withered 
And fond ones are flown. 

Oh. who would inhabit 

This cold world alone.

"What humiliating contrast, gentlemen of the majority,

country present to that patriotic utterance of Thoreau 
which made him immortal — 

"There is no hope for him who does not think that th«&gt;

You propose to sacrifice this industry, destroy this new 
field for agriculture, and place this necessity of the American 
farmer under the control of foreign manufacturers. 

You propose to give preference and priority to foreign 
lands and foreign productions. In this you hare succeeded 
in securing the support and indorsement of the Canadian 
and English press. 

Sirs, pass this bill and you will lock the vaults of Amer

Pass this bill and you sign the death-warrant for Amer

IVi^-K this bill and you issue a proclamation for the en

Pass this bill and you will declare for the destruction

to foreign shores. [Prolonged applause on the Republican

ECOKD TARIFF SPEECH 

iii the last hours of the 53rd Congress, second session, after 
hundreds of speeches had been delivered upon the subject of a 
tariff for revenue or protection, Mr. Meiklejohn, under leave to 
prim, wrote and filed a speech, as a political attack upon the 
I democratic party. 

In the first sentence he charged "a lowering of the fla:: "f 
iff reform'" — "a surrender without terms." To stigmatize the 
Mte amendments to the House bill (CM in number), he pub 
ied the celebrated letter of President Cleveland to Mr. Wfl. 
Chairman of the W*\a and Means Committee of the House. 
which the Senate bill was characterized as meaning ''party 
fitly and party dishonor." involving "outrageous discritninais 
and violation •«&lt; "principle. " </seg>


            <seg id="p171">

Easiniirli as Democrats had to conciliate the coal states, the 
ore states, and those having cotton, silk, tin. glass and 
r interests he found it convenient to put on record Senator 
, of Missouri, and Senator Mills, of Texas: 

Xo wonder the Senator from Missouri, in turning the calcium 
light on this tariff bill and exposing the tribulations 
of the Democracy in framing 1 it, was led to say: 

"Sir, were it not for this tariff I could now indulge in the 
ecstacy of that well-known hymn — 

There shall I bathe my wearied soul 
In seas of endless rest. 
And not a wave of trouble roll 

Across my peaceful breast." 

Xo wonder Mr. Mills, one of the present Democratic leaders 
in the Senate and the author of the famous Mills bill, 
speaking- of this Gorman compromise bill in a speech delivered 
in the Senate on the 15th of August. 1S94, was led to 
exclaim: 

"Mr. President, I have not risen either to attack or defend 
tlie bill which has recently passed ( ongress and is mm 
awaiting the signature of the President. 1 think perhaps

Tine— "The Old Oaken Bucket." 

"How dear to our hearts is our Democratic (ongres 
As hopeless inaction presents it to view; 

The bill of poor Wilson, the deep-tang-led tariff. 
And every mad pledge that their lunacy know: 

The widespread depression, the mills that closed by 
The rock of free silver where great Grover fell. 

They've busted our country, no use to deny it. 
And darn the old party, ifs busted as well. 

This (i. Cleveland's Congress. 
This Queen Lilly Conpv 
This wild free-trade Congress 

We all love so well. 

"Their moss-covered pledges we no longer treasure, 
For often at noon when out hunting a job. 

We find that instead of the corn they had promised 
They've given us nothing — not even a cob. 

How ardent we've cussed "em with lips overflowing 
With sulphurous blessings as great swear words f«

We all love so well. 

"How sweet from their elo&lt;|itet lips to receive it. 
Cursed tariff protection no longer uphold. 

We listened — and voted our dinner pails empty. 
The factories silent, the furnaces cold. 

And now far removed from our lost situations 
The tear of regret doth intrusively swell.
