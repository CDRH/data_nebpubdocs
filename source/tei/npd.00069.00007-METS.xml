            <seg id="p003">TO THE HONORABLE ARTHUR J. WEAVER GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA My dear Governor: I herewith transmit tor your consideration a report of the activities | of the Department of Public Welfare for tha present biennlum. Rased upon my experience during the two years just past, I am suggesting certain changes in the law which I think will add to the efficiency of the Department, and in addition thereto lessen the suffer - ing of the children of Nebraska on account of neglect, dependency, j and delinquency. I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to express my appre - ciation for the many courtesies you have shown me personally in the discharge of my duties and the sympathetic interest you have displayed in the many human problems with which this department deals dally. Respectfully Submitted, ERNEST M. POLLARD Secretary. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE BUREAU OF HEALTH, 1929—1930. Upon entering the present administrative biennium early in Jan - uary. 1329, the bureau raced the problem of formulating a program which would be constructive, in that it had a sound objective and at the same time attempt to '•cany on" the ever increasing routine with the facilities available. It may | )e of interest to recall that the state appropriaion from taxation for the bureau of health Is less than 2&gt;4c per capita per year. This is less than the outlay for postage and paper of a single first-class letter.. -' • Careful consideration was given to the well-known general indiffer - ence to public health so fur us the public is concerned— there should be no misconstruction of this statement. The general population be - lieves in public health in the abstract, but so far as being informed, initiating, or requiring that a definite program be adopted and con - ducted, the fact remains there is .indifference. The decision made, which met with Secretarial approval, was to foster the County Health Unit plan as a practical, local self-governing method of providing public health service as an aid in checking the economic LOSS from preventable disease sustained by Nebraska. For the United States according to a recent National Chamber of Commerce representative, such loss amounts to more than eight dollars per capita pur annum. This action is in accord with the well recognized fact that a stat? health organization cannot perform the needed work in the respective communities. It is encouraging to know that several state-wide groups now recognize the situation and are beginning a .study, of the Nebraska health problem. While the span of human life has lengthened as civilization pro - gressed, partly due tr&gt; decreased infant mortality, at present there is a decrease of about two years at the higher ages. This is a matter of concern. Heart disease and circulatory Involvements head the list of causes in our death rate, cancer, ranking second. Research has. not yet revealed the cause of cancer,- but early attention by a competent Physician helps check its ravages. With the ignoring of sound health rules in our high-tension existence, and large communicable, disease prevalence, the heart and circulatory mortality is explained at least ti a certain extent. An urgent need exists for a specific educational program estab - lished within this bureau for the purpose of supplying accurate infor - mation on health matters to the public through available and special channels. An indication of this need is found in the office of the chief of the bureau, which office alone in 1!)29 and the first eleven months of 1930 distributed letters and pamphlets which totaled more than 20S.000 and 224,000 respectively, many being upon direct re- </seg>
            <seg id="p005">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE finest, with numerous requests and inquiries that could not be cared for. The many addresses, lectures, and conferences the bureau lias been able to supply bave, with uniformity, revealed that those present wore intensely interested In securing health information and desirous of. ascertaining how it could be made more available to their re - sportive communities. C'OMMUMCARLE DISEASES exact their toll directly all too fre - quently, and indirectly more commonly than generally believed Tho bureau 1ms concentrated on the definitely preventable diseases—dip - theria, smallpox, and typhoid fever— with progress "in thai many sections ot the state initiated immunization campaigns, securing most favorable cooperation and results. During. 1930, Nebraska encountered the greatest epidemic of measles in her recorded morbidity history; also the highest poliomye - litis morbidity since 190!). The ' poliomyelitis morbidity was W - doWedly held down by the excellent cooperation of the medical profession, The tendency to, consider measles a light matter and necessary evil influenced the public in permitting what developed. Examples like these demonstrate the urgency of definite provision being made for modem application of known scientific methods to safeguard, public health and conserve human life. It is mt Me for a state health organization to attempt conduct of local health administration, as the chief function of the state in this respect is one of supervision, correlation, .and rendition or expert assistance'. .' . * The morbidity covering the principal communicable diseases in recent years, with the first eleven months of 1930. presents some ide.a as to trends: . • • 1!)3T, 11)2(1 11127 11)28 l»20 1930 (11 i,,os.)

            <seg id="p006">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE The above data were obtained through cooperation of the physi - cians and local authorities. These figures understate the actual mor - bidity, due to inadequate provision for determining prevalence and lack of training upon the part of those charged by law with the function. This condition has been recognized in each of the numerous instances where a bureau representative has been called into- com - munities to render assistance in checking or averting an epidemic. VENEREAL DISEASES. The situation in regard to prevalence of these diseases is identical with that existing for some years, in that there is an apparent numerical decline. Experience in this state, as elsewhere, has demonstrated morbidity greater than recorded in the routine manner, particularly so where continuous, specialized activity is lacking. Hardly a day passes that does not present a situation where the services of a specially trained worker are needed to assist in determin - ing and preventing sources of infection. The lack of this service is deplorable and should be corrected. The menace of these diseases continues while we asume an attitude of "it has to be." It is but fair to state that without the excellent cooperation of the medical profession, even beyond a point of duty, the situation would be far more serious. True, much valuable assistance is made available to our citizens in the form of many thousands of SOCIAL HYGIENE MANUALS sent directly to parents so that correct information regarding sex instruction and the nature of venereal diseases can be used. Nevertheless, such does not constitute the active measures essential to com bat these insidious diseases. The division has continued to render assistance in supervising and encouraging prompt and adequate treatment, many new cases being prevented thereby. This, however, is but one of the details comprising a real problem — a problem involving all ages and classes, without regard to social or other status, that exacts a heavy toll in loss of health and lives. The suffering, misery, and other effects not only of infected individuals but relatives is often beyond depiction. Society pays dearly for tolerating this menace to the extent it does. Following the initiation and development of an excellent plan for venereal disease control, the nation placed responsibility for its continued application upon the respective states. Some have assumed the same. Shall Nebraska shirk this responsibility? CHILD HYGIENE. Withdrawal of Federal support to this division June 30, 1929, necessitated an immediate cessation of activities then concentrated upon infant and maternal mortality. A complete revision and alteration of procedure was instituted with provision for as mucn personal contact as possible upon the part of a single field worker </seg>
            <seg id="p007">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE The bureau was able through this division to conduct both a gen - eral and somewhat detailed educational program during the first year of t!ie hlennium. The general phase was largely through the distribu - tion of many thousands' of pamphlets an.d circulars dealing with pre - natal, maternal, infant, and child care. (Actual number, distributed in 1929. 218,131; in 1330, to December 1st, 28,425). Supplementary to this a set of instructional prenatal letters was made use of in ef - fort* to lower infant mortality, with distribution of 8,829 in 1929. and f&gt;.(i:Mt during eleven months of 1930. Owing to the loss of the Field Nurse by resignation, the detailed, personal-contact work ceased. During the Field Nurse's incumbency, group and Individual instruction constituted the method of disseminat - iiiK information for the purpose of stimulating an interest in local public health activity. Considerable pioneer work was performed by the Field Nurse, which must await future developments for evaluation. In addition, encouragement nnd support were given to take ad - vantage of existing legal provision for utilizing the services of a public health nurse in local communities, as this service, while not comparable to the Unit, has demonstrated its value beyond question. • VITAL STATISTICS. The function of this division is to do the bookkeeping of humanity, In that it gathers, checks, classifies, records, tabulates, indexes, and files the births, . deaths, marriages, and di - vorces in Nebraska. These are permanent records, the value of which is becoming recognized markedly as time progresses. The tremendous increase in requests for certified copies of birth and death certificates in the past few years has been astonishing. Particularly is the call for birth certificates outstanding, such being required by some schools prior to admission of a pupil; certain civic activities require proof of age. ,as is true where the age question arises .in connection with em - ployment, etc. The many uses of both birth and death certificates make these records of importance, and the responsibility In handling, fillns. and care of same increases.' Certificates for war veterans and their children have been in great demand. Viewed In the nature of volume, this division, in addition to the "bookkeeping" mentioned, prepared and transmitted almost 114,000 items in the nature of transcripts, certified copies, permits, and other forms of communication. Two years ( 1912-lfll:!). of eight requiring card indexes of births have been Rallied on work that is in arrears, all this being performed with limited personnel. Revision of methods and procedure was in - strumental in making these accomplishments possible. Available statistical data covering a few items of principal Im - portance as determined by inquiries follows: </seg>

The (unction of the laboratory is to render technical aid (bacteriological) in the detection, prevention, and control of infectious, contagious, and communicable diseases. Path - ological and chemical examinations do not come within the above classification; hence such examinations as tissue for cancer, etc., blood counts, urinalyses, chemical analyses of water, and the like cannot be made. This service provided by the state without charge is avail - able to physicians and local health authorities through their medical adviser. Some of the principal Hems of service performed are: Wassermann tests on blood and spinal fluid to assist in the diagnosis and treatment! of .syphilis; microscopic examination of pus to assist in the diagnosis! of gonorrhea: microscopic examination of throat cultures to assist in the 1 diagmisis of -diphtheria; blood tests to assist in the diagnosis of typhoid] and stool examinations for detection of typhoid bacteria; cultures on; spinal fluid for meningitis; microscopic examination of sputum for, tuberculosis; specimen examinations for evidence of rabies; examin - ations to determine freedom from the infectious agents prior to. re-* lease rrom quarantine; and the bacteriological examination of water ti&gt; determine its fitness for drinking.

SCOTTSBLUFF BRANCH LABORATORY. This temporarily sus pended functioning because of the technician's resignation, which in - cluded a request that it become effective September 30, and failure to secure a competent successor prior to submission of this report. The specimens examined in this laboratory totaled 2,149 in 1929 and 681 in nine months of 1930. CONCLUSION. The achievements of the bureau of health have been rendered possible only because of the faithful cooperation of its personnel, some devoting considerable overtime not required by request or otherwise.

I respectfully recommend that permissive legislation be enacted by th&amp; Legislature permitting .the various counties of the state to create effective health units. Tln&lt; problem of preventing sickness and the ravages of death from preventable diseases is local ill its nature. It can he handled much more economically and effectively through the local medical resources. The county is the natural political unit in the state. I would recom - mend that thf law authorize tin- creation -of County Health Units in all counties having Ipsa than 50,000 population with full-time paid physicians as County Health ptricera and such personnel in the way of assistants as the si/.,- and the wealth of the county justifies..

It should also carry on an educational campaign looking towards the prevention of disease, especially those contagious and infectious maladies which are preventable through the use of anti-toxin and other known remedies. These County Hoards of Health should deal solely with health matters. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE ./THE BUREAU OF CHILD WELFARE APPROPRIATION AXI) STAFF The annual appropriation or the Bureau of Child Welfare is : $9,700 which provides for a Director, two field workers and an office secretary as' well as a maintenance item of a little over $200 per month. Since all office supplies, telephone and telegraph bills, repairs and new equipment must come out of this item, the total amount re-' malning for" traveling expenses averages about $150 a month. With distances as sreat as they are in Nebraska, the amount of traveling that can be done on such an amount is extremely limited and has prevented the Bureau from reaching out to the many problems con - fronting it even niore than has the inadequacy of staff, although for two field workers to attempt to carry out the many and varied functions of the Bureau is an absolute impossibility. Greater and greater emphasis. is being placed upon the value of (rained professional service in social work and since the Bureau ot Child Welfare is a social service division, every effort has been made to si,, that the staff should meet the highest possible standard. Con - sequently at the close of the biennium, all workers in the Bureau were graduates of standard colleges, having specialized in social work ami had had previous experience in social work agencies. '. ■ FUNCTION The chief function of the State Bureau of Child Welfare is to protect and to promote the welfare of the children of the state. Since most children are adequately provided for by parents or guardians, the responsibility of the Bureau naturally narrows to special concern for- the dependent, the delinquent. and the defective. The problems presented by these unfortunate children are many and varied and give rise to an assortment of Bureau activities. Some indication of the complex situations arising is given by the following extracts from actual letters received: "In our county is a family by the name of It- is reported that the mother is somewhat mentally de - ficient, .and the two boys, aged 9 and 11 years, are similarly deficient. These boys are In the first and second grades in school. Recently they have committed depredations such as house" entering, and otherwise have caused trouble. They have been before the authorities, but further misdemeanors will not be tolerated. The Superintendent has Just phoned me that he has "kicked them out of school" and has turned " them over to some authority for correction and control. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE "We have no organization in this county which makes special business of such cases, and we turn to you for advice. We have a health board but that body will not act on this matter as it is not properly under its jurisdiction. "Please advise promptly on the matter, or send a repre - sentative to loo"k after it." A mother interested in children reports the following: "I am writing you in regards to a woman at who ia running a house of ill fame and selling liquor. Also selling her little 15 year old girl to any and every old bum that comes along. I* there any law or practice that we mothers of girls must endure such' things? This little girl is (or was) just as nice as any one. I have called the atten - tion of the county sheriff to this case once but nothing of importance was done. There is- another sweet little girl in this family and two hoys. I cannot stand by and see such things done." Very often county attorneys write in' to the Bureau to ask for assist - ance and the following is only one of a great many b -uch letters received: "I am informed by the County Sheriff here that a woman living in the north part of this county died several days ago in a hospital at The sneri££ stales ttat sne left two small children and that they are being cared for by' some of the neighbors. He did not know the ages, of the childrpn and states that the local physician fears that the children also are ilL This woman, was divorced from her husband and it is not known where the husband is at this time. ■ • "I am wondering when you will have a welfare worker in this part of the state and if you will givw us some assistance ' in plating these- children in a proper home. 1 understand that relatives do not wish to take any hand i,, this matter:" So many such letters have been received by the Bureau that it i- , impossible to give anything like prompt service on them and cases of children In need have s.&gt;m.&lt;ltmes had to Ro as long as one or two months iietnro a state \v»rk.-r was available. However in the six month.-- period from January 1. ls-sri to July 1; 1330. workers from the Bureau visited 5!) counties working with officials and individuals on the solution of difficult rase problems. The nu...ti&lt;ui is Immedi - ately raised as to whether or not. every' county '.'In the state should not develop something In the way of local facilities In order that its unfortunate children be given adequate protection. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WELFARE It cannot lie stressed too otton that the first and natural placo for , every child is in his o\yu home. Yet frequently children from broken homes are sent away to orphanages without any attempt at rehabilita - tion,-and delinquent children are' sent off to reform schools with no effort. al scientific probation. The whole tendency in other fields is away from cure and toward prevention and surely it is equally true in (he Held. of. Child welfare that it is far more economical to ' prevent dependency, delinquency and defectiveness as we know it . can be prevented tli rough 'modern social service than to go on build - ing greal buildings to Mouse our unman wreckage at terrific state expense. Surely no child should be taken from his home if a county allow - ance can keep bis home together and the Bureau consistently urges such a plan. If it is broken beyond repair, relatives will often take the child if approached by a social worker pointing out their re - sponsibility. Children have been sent by the Bureau of Child Welfare to reliable relatives (under the supervision of- a social agency there) in states as remote as California, and Nebraska has been saved the cost of their cure. Also there are up and down our broad state hund - reds of men and women glad to give a needy child a home if it is brought to their attention and this also the Bureau has done. ■The delinquent child is the product of his environment and often Changes, completely when the factors causing his delinquency are changed. The natural thing is of course to catch his waywardness at its inception. Not infrequently his home is unfit but he then needs the guidance and training of a proper home far more than he needs institutional care. . N'o institution can give a child the individual attention and af - fection he craves and needs, the security that comes with being a part of a family and community group, the pride in being "like other children" which will make of him a well-rounded, self-reliant adult. Also it is a very expensive thing to keep a child In an Institution. The Hoard of Control estimates that it costs them at least $380 per year per child. Why should the state, assume this burden if parents, relatives, friends, or county commissioners can carry it at far less expense? Consequently the Bureau has bent all of its efforts toward pre - venting commitments of dependents and • delinquents to institutions and has tried always to bring about some adjustment so that the child would have the privilege of normal family and community life. During the six months following January 1, 1930 with a most un - settled staff and facing the terrific pressure of its many other re - sponsibilities the Bureau succeeded in averting the commitment of 35 </seg>

Even if these children had remained in the institution only one year (and they undoubtedly would have remained longer) this represents a saving to the state of $13,300— $3. GOO more than the total annual appropriation of the Children's Bureau. Also many problems were adjusted which might have caused institutional com - mitments, five. ten. or even fifteen years from now. Yet problems come to the Bureau far faster than they can be handled and often as many as 25 complaints were pending at one time, some of them weeks or even months old. And children Who might have been helped were "sent away." Attached is a chart (Chart A) representing the Institutional prob - lem in Nebraska on January 1, 1930. The total annual cost of these 2,700 children at the lowest possible estimate is $1,020,000. These institutions are subject to state inspection but not to state license. Since, however, there is a large nunVber of them, inspection alone becomes a heavy burden for the Bureau. Eight private institutions recognizing (hat whenever possible these children should go back into homes, maintain child placing departments are therefore sub - ject to state license under Section S265. Such agencies" are ex - pected to Inquire closely into the fitness of proposed homes and to select carefully tin. type or child who will best adjust to them.

Compiled Statutes of Nebraska provides that the 'Department ui I'ubliv Welfare shall inquire into the whole sys - teni in public charity in the state -and that" any officer for the dis - tribution of public outdoor relief shall at all" times furnish such in - formation and statistics as it may require." Nevertheless, ii took a terrific amount of effort to obtain from counties the report (See Chart C) on county relief. The Department recognizes that the re - port is not accurate in as much as some counties obviously indicated the budgeted amount rather than the expended amount and there was also reason to believe that in one or two. situations a complete report was not obtained. However, the statistics compiled are in - dicative of the tremendous amount of dependcy existing in Nebraska and raise in the minds of all clear-thinking people the question of whether or not this money is being administered so that the greatest benefits result from its expenditure. It is generally conceded that unless a careful inquiry is made to determine the asse'ts and liabilities of a family, the giving of poor relief is likely to be abused, the more aggressive and less deserving families getting a generous allowance because of their persistent begging, while high standard, deserving and reticent families are inadequately provided for. Also, a largo percentage of individuals making application lor various forms of relief are untrained in proper household management and a maximum in value is not received from the relief given, nnless there is super - vision of its expenditure. Also to' simply give relief without bring - ing about any adjustments within the family so that it can be ulti - mately self supporting is no longer in accord with the best social work thinking. Dependency has definite causes such as ill health, </seg>
            <seg id="p019">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE mental abnormality, unemployment, lack of vocational skill, poor management and so on and on. Unless these underlying causes are eliminated you cati give relief endlessly and the family is as badly off as ever. Commissioners over the state are very frank about their Inability to deal adequately with this problem in view of the many other responsibilities placed upon them and it is hoped that some day they will be assisted in this work by a trained social worker employed by the county to assume this and other functions. Counties employing a local social worker have found that the person so em - ployed lias saved her salary many times over. The Commissioners of Platte County have been completely convinced of the superiority of such a plan. POOR FARMS Tin' wjiole-attltude toward the care of the aged has altered mater - ially in the last few years and it has come to be recognized that it is far more economical to provide allowances for their care in their own homes, the homes of relatives or even the homes of friends in preference to providing care in county poor farms. Also the great distress occasioned by most old people who are moved to such farms and their delight when it is discovered that the county will make it possible, lor them to remain in the community has done much to abolish such' methods of care. The original theory of the poor farm was that the individuals ronld assist in the maintenance of the' farm and therefore be par - tially soil-supporting. It lias come to be recognized, however, that u large percentage of the people so committed are more in need of hospital than custodial care and are seldom .of any real assistance in working the farm. However, 4 2 counties still maintain poor farms, although statistics obtained from them thru questionaires recently submitted by the Bureau of Child Welfare indicate that they are costing on the average of $:!SG per year per inmate without any allowance being made fur interest on the capital invested. The figure docs not indicate that there is any economy in poor farm administra - tion. Also tiro fact thai nine counties (Cheyenne, Gosper, Sherman, Buffalo, 'C.reeley, Hall, I)oou ei Butler and Cedar) owning poor farms have discontinued their use -aa such and leased them to private in - dividuals in indicative of the fact thai counties launching such a pro - gram may; fimi ilirinsohvs with a hijary investment for which they have tio.ii.se. • '. ■ " ! ■■:.■'■'■:'■ </seg>

            <seg id="p023">"department ok public Welfare ot Child Welfare. -One hundred and fQity-one such hospitals, paying a total oi j 117 were licensed ou July 1, l'J3u. Since these bospitals are scattered over the entire state, the responsibility for anything like adequate inspection is a tremendous one. Minimum standards would require Inspection at least once a year. Present facilities liav'e-.uol even permitted this. Also, since' the' Bureau is not able to employ ;i worker qualified by nursing or medlc'al training for this particular service, the Inspections have been of necessity superficial. Hospitals so licensed must report monthly all births occurring at (he hospital, giving tlie names of parents, birth date and sex of- the child. attending physician and name and address of persons to whom the baby is discharged. All illegitimate births must be indicated by a 'large X. These records facilitate the Division of Vital Statistics in obtaining- complete birth registrations and permits the Bureau to make j .inquiry when Information recorded indicates that the rights of the illegitimate clilld may not be adequately protected. 510 such illegiti-, ■mate births occurred in Nebraska in 1029. Analysis of 199 such births to Nebraska mothers in Nebraska shows that 12 of these un - fortunate Kills were, under 15 years of age and 149 were under 21 years ol age. in view of the fact that Section 9551 provides that "whoever shall have carnal knowledge of any female child" under the ajie of 15 years with her consent or over 15 without her consent shall lie guilty of a felony, it is obvious that criminal action should have been taken in many of these cases. Also, paternity of the child .should have been established in accordance with Section 274. It is neither a fair nor a healthy thing to let the fathers of illegitimate children evade responsibility. Letters to attending physicians brought replies indicating that in most such cases an unwise plan is made lor both mother and child unless trained social service is available. ■ The maternity Act also provides that whoever "has in his or her custody, or control, at any one time, two or more infants under the age of two years, unattended by parents or guardians for the pur - post; of providing them with care, food and lodging, except infants related to him or her by blood or marriage shall be deemed to maintain a maternity boarding home" and is subject to state license. Often a well intcntioned-woman, unfamiliar with state laws, accepts &gt;bab|es for care without any knowledge that she is doing so illegally. A mother who has brought up- her own children sees in the ad - mission of a strange child into her home no problems other than those she has daily met with her own child. Actually many other problems exist. Not Infrequently the person who prefers the inde - pendent boarding home to organized social work service does so because he has a reason for not giving the facts which will be re - quired by any standard agency. Consequently many a boarding home mother has been made an unconscious party to most involved de - ceptions. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WELFARE Not infrequently children are abandoned In the home and the boarding mother is without any information which might afford a clue in locating the parents. Occasionally she is involved in a law suit over who actually has custody of the child. Even' kidnapped babies have occasionally been so secreted. Also the chance of in - fection among children admitted from strange homes In every typo of physical condition is tremendous but the boarding mother does not realize that far more careful medical oversight is necessary than in the case of her own children and the. boarding mother has been a party to the spread of disease which could have been avoided. Occasionally, also, women admit children for care not because they are fond of children but because they consider it a money mak - ing scheme. The welfare of the child is of secondary importance and if parents fail to meet their financial obligation, the child is given little consideration. Recently an unlicensed home came to. the attention of the De - partment only when the death of one of ten children kept under care occurred under most suspicious circumstances. Sometimes they are heard of when the irantic hoarding mother reports that the parents have deserted. Occasionally : neighbors and friends advise the Department that children in a boarding home are abused and neglected. The state law intended that state supervision should eliminate these abuses and should protect the Child that must he cared for out of its own home, ir the boarding mother cannot' give proper care, license should be withheld and when she' is licensed she should be advised regarding the number of children she can keep adequately and should be given the advantage or. the Bureau's experience with this type of problem in order that she may protect herself, her family and the children she lia-s under icarp. Yet ih all these situa - tions the Bureau's staff was able to jreach out to only a few of the more flagrant cases. TRANSIENT FAMILIES For many years social agencies have recognized tho problem of the transient family which went from city to cHy.ahd either did not find employment at all or .soon became ; unemployed and made appli - cation for assistance, often the family arrived in town completely destitute and made application within !&gt;■! hours of the time of ar - rival. They came in a delaptdated Porfl or on transportation which had been provided by some other city which was trying to get rid of them. It was perfectly obvious to anyone giving serious consider - ation to the problem that this was no solution. Some families traveled practically from coast to coast at the expense of local communities en </seg>
            <seg id="p025">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE route. ' The children dtd not attend school and were often dirty and unkempt. The family never remained in one community long enough for the attendance laws or the laws pertaining to neglected children to be enforced. If anyone ever raised a question as to the type of care they were given, the family moved on to another community where they were not so well known.- Also many sincere and well intentioned people for one reason or another became stranded in communities Very far removed from their own people and their own place of legal residence. In order to meet this type of problem the National Committee on Transportation was formed and the fol - lowing rules drawn up: Before any transportation shall be provided, the agency or in - dividual responsible for" making plans ! for the person in trouble shall he satisfied by adequate and reliable evidence that 1. The person in trouble is not going to be in a wofse situation if lie is sent to his proposed destination. 2. (a) 1 The person has relatives, friends or other resources that will keep him from becoming dependent upon some agency at that place or (b) He is a proper charge upon the agency there because ol some agreement into Which they have entered or some plan 'which they have made for the individual or (c) because he has legal resi - dence there. :!. That an effort has been made to obtain from some responsible person, agency or official a report as to the facts Included In rules 1 and 2. ■i. That he is given sufficient resources to take him to the place where he belongs instead of simply passing him on to the next town. Often a liian reports that he can get work in a certain community if he can just reach there. He certainly should not be sent on until there is a verification through the prospective employer of his oppor - tunity for employment. Often he Insists that a. certain relative can take him in it he can just get to a certaiu town. A responsible per - son should be asked to make a report not only as to the relativa's willingness to tako the individual but also his ability to care for him so I hat he will not become a public charge. Usually the best plan is to discover tho legal residence of the family, .verify it through reliable sources and give the family transportation there, notifying officials at the place of residence of their return. Often the procedure seems slow and cumbersome and the com - munity considers it easier to give the individual a small sum and send him on or even to order him to get out of town within a certain jxyiod. So long as any one city follows this procedure their neigh - boring cities will do the same and these unfortunate people will simply </seg>
            <seg id="p026">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE be dumped from town to town imposing . upon the good nature and generosity of committees and clubs when the city- or organization which is really responsible for him shirks that responsibility. It is also the only way in which these people can be prevailed upon to settle down and give their children a fair opportunity for schooling and com - munity adjustment. Upon request the Bureau of Child Welfare will be glad to be of assistance in the way of determining the community which has actual responsibility and persuading that community to assume it. It will also cooperate in getting reports from other com - munities either in or out of the state. The Bureau of Child Welfare has a list of the agencies and organizations throughout the country who have signed the transportation agreement and pledged them - selves to cooperate in the carrying out of this sort of a plan. It is impossible to appraise the number ot families thus touring our state but it is undoubtedly large. The Bureau has often cooper - ated with city and county officials in determining what community is really responsible for the family and has assisted in having it returned to its legal residence. Perhaps some day the development of a clear- Ing center in the Bureau of Child Welfare will make available for communities information regarding families thus traveling about. Often families wanted by other communities so impose upon the gener - ousity of gullible givers— which is one of the reasons they disappear so quickly when questions are asked. A sincere person really in need does not resent questioning if done wisely but appreciates its value. : Certainly something should be done to discourage this ever in - creasing group of transient families. LILLIAN" J. JOHNSON . Director In order to decrease the amount of suffering among the children of the state due to dependency, neglect, and delinquency, I recom - mend that the legislature enact a law permitting the more populous counties and two or more of the sparsely settled counties to create County Public Welfare Boards to serve without pay except necessary traveling expenses; the Public Welfare Board authorized to employ trained social workers with such assistants as the necessity of the county demands, to be paid by the County Board of Commissioners or Supervisors. Their chief duties shall be to act as juvenile probation officers when so requested by the juvenile judge, investigate cases of poor reliet and mother's pension for the County Board of Commis - sioners or Supervisors in the hope of rehabilitation of family and mak - ing the same self-supporting, investigate for the court all cases of divorce and legal separation where children are involved investigate prospective foster homes for possible placement of children see that all children needing medical services receive the same, arrange for </seg>

The whole problem is to prevent dependency, neglect and delin - quency. The County Welfare Board through their trained social workers should provide for the care and supervision of children in their own homes where possible and in foster homes where their own home is utterly unfit. The object being to remove the cause that leads to dependency and delinquency rather than to continue tha present practice of placing all dependent, neglected, and delinquent children in institutions, thus adding to the financial burdens of the state, without any effort to correct conditions that lead to delin - quency. Broken homes, lack of the . necessities of life in the home, and inadequate parental supervision of children are the chief causes of delinquency. It is much easier to prevent delinquency in children, than to reform the adult criminal. </seg>

This is particularly true of Veterinary complaints which consists of live stock remedy salesmen In only extreme cases are licenses revoked for unprofessional conluct, The usual practice is to put the violator on probation which wor &lt;s out best both for the individual and the community he serves. In April 1929, the Supreme Court of the state declared unconsti - tutional Section 122 of the General Licensure Law. Th 1 Supreme' Court's decision was based on the theory that the effect if the law was to create a monopoly in that it prevented the sale of n any harm - less articles by anyone excepting a registered pharmacist. This sec - tion should be rewritten to conform to the decision ot the court. The" Pharmacy Law is virtually worthless without defining these articles that can he sold only by registered pharmacists. At the time the General Licensure Law was enacted in 1927, there was included in the repealing clause Section 8,1 6S o the com - piled statutes for 1922. I do not believe that the Legislature in - tended to repeal this section as without it there is no provision of law - defining what constitutes the practice of medicine. The legislature should either restore this section or write a new one clearly defining what constitutes the practice of medicine. . ' MRS. CLARK PERKINS Director. </seg>
