            <seg id="p005">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL His Excellency, Adam MoMullen, Governor of Nebraska. Sir: In compliance with the law. I have the honor herewith to submit the report of the attorney general for the biennium end - ing January 6, 1927. In the interest of economy I propose to condense the contents of this report to a resume of the most important activities of the attorney general and the Department of Justice. For the convenience of examination and reference, I have added to the usual index, a supplemental index citing state statutes and constitutional provisions referred to, or con - strued by the legal department of the state during the last bienniuum. The report contains a list of cases handled by this department in the courts, including cases still pending and the disposition of the cases decided. I have also incorporated a list of cases and proceedings conducted by the state legal department in the several state district courts, state supreme court, federal (district court, circuit and supreme courts, state railway com - mission, interstate commerce commission. During the past biennium, the work of the department has materially increased. Economic conditions peculiar to our state, and the demand that the public be represented by the attorney general in trade disputes, has compelled this department to take increasing interest in the workings of such specialized depart- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ments as the state railway commission, the interstate commerce commission and the federal trade commission. The increased work, while it has taxed the limited membership of my depart - ment, has been effected without the expenditure of any addi - tional monies. BANKING This department has sought in every way possible to co - operate with and assist the banking department and the Guar - anty Fund Commission during the period of depression and the storm and stress which the guaranty fund has been obliged to meet during the period of readjustment. We have vigorously assisted in the prosecution of violation of banking laws, be - lieving such activities to be one of the main safeguards to the state banking system. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those of the banking fraternity who have co - operated with us and encouraged us in our prosecutions of viola - tions of the banking laws. ANTI-TRUST LAWS During the biennium we have given much time and effort to the enforcement of laws, curbing monopolies or combina - tions in restraint of trade. Time and again the legislative body of this state has been organized in its efforts to improve the laws designed to protect the public from conspiracies in restraint of trade and destructive competition. The people generally are anxious to meet this situation through the police power of the state and to eliminate such evils. A condition exists whereby price structures are raised across the country and maintained to the injury of the public. It clearly appears that only those who agree to sell articles including many of the necessities of life at this uniform or agreed price are able to pur - chase such goods or supplies from the large jobbers and manu - facturers. It seems that if any local dealer dares to deviate one iota from the uniform agreed price, his business is destroyed by </seg>
            <seg id="p007">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 7 destructive discrimination and other methods used by the trust. This department has been vigorous in its efforts to obtain suffi - cient evidence upon which to maintain an action against such practices under the law as we find it. It may be of interest to note that this department under my supervision was the first to bring action under the discrimination law of the state which was enacted in 1007. In the first action brought against the Standard Oil and a number of other com - panies, the court refused an injunction although some of the de - fendant companies were selling gasoline in certain localities for twice what they were selling it for in other localities where ,the very rates involved were the same or substantially the same. The defendants came into court, admitted the discrimination, but alleged that such discrimination was for the purpose of meeting competition and not for the purpose of eliminating a competitor. The trial court in denying even a temporary injunction appar - ently sustained the contention that the defendants had offered sufficient defense, when they asserted their intention in discrim - inating was merely to meet competition and not for the purpose of destroying the business of price cutters. The court seemed to hold that the presumption raised by Section 3432. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 19*22, was successfully rebutted by a denial of a wrongful intent. However it will be of interest to note that on the 24th day of June. 1926, we prevailed in a case against Standard Oil in the district court of Xemaha County, Nebraska, in an action brought under the discrimination sections of the law and in which we alleged that the Standard Oil Cem - pany was guilty of unfair discrimination. The evidence in this case was so clear and convincing that the purpose of the company was the destruction of at least two of its competitors, that there clearly was no other course for the court than to grant the decree in this particular case. The defendant company had depressed the tank wagon and service station pricos until they were losing two cents per gallon themselves on all the gasoline they sold in the town of Auburn. This is the first decree obtained under the law since its enactment, and while we were successful in obtaining this decree, I especially urge that the discrimination laws of the state are proving inadequate to meet the need of proper regulation </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL and control of various industries including the industry dealing in petroleum and its products. This same condition of discrim - ination exists in the creamery industry and any really inde - pendent concern or individual that fails to follow a price set by the combine is either whipped into line or eliminated by vicious discrimination in his locality. When competition is destroyed in such manner, then a monopoly exists and the public pays, and they have been paying the toll throughout Nebraska for many years by receiving several cents less per pound for their butterfat than is being paid for butterfat in other adjoining or nearby states that have discrim - ination laws capable of enforcement and which protect the inde - pendent who wants to live and let live and pay a reasonable figure for butterfat. Since it is apparent that fair prices naturally follow, and do follow competition, it has been the endeavor of this department to protect competition, and in our work in that direction we joined with the City of Lincoln in its efforts to protect the municipal oil station which had been provided for by the citizens of such city through their charter and by ordinance based on the charter. This department prepared and filed a brief on behalf of the state supporting the right of such station to exist and function, and I am pleased to report that in said action the city prevailed and such station is now running and constitutes a great protection to the people in this locality and will continue to protect them unless the efforts throughout the nation to control the gasoline business and to throttle competition and to subjugate the public completely to a system of price control succeeds in cut - ting off the supply to said station or in discriminating against such station. HIGHWAY BUILDING CONTRACTS During this biennium some very important questions with respect to road building contracts have been settled by our supreme court in the case of Peterson, Shirley &amp; Gunther v. The State of Nebraska. In this particular case this department was able to cut down a claim from $47,428.72, and interest, to $278.30. It has been stated by no less authority than the present state </seg>
            <seg id="p009">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 9 engineer that the decision in this case will save to the state in the future all the way from fifty thousand to one-half million dollars annually on its road building contracts. ESCHEATS During the past year this department prevailed on behalf of the state in the matter of the estate of John O'Connor, which finally determined the controversy between a number of sets of heirs and the state with respect to heirship and the claim of escheat. This matter has been in litigation since 1913. The court finally held that the property belongs to the state of Nebraska and it is of interest to note that the value of same will amount to more than $100,000. While there are other claimants seeking to prevent a closing of this estate by .the probate court of Adams county and making claims to the property, it is my opinion that the main battle has been won in this matter and that this money will in the near future come to the state. This department is endeavoring to locate estates, which under the law should escheat to the state and feels that it is justified in giving a substantial amount of time and attention to this subject. Laws should be passed requiring county judges to report escheat estates at once to the state legal department. PROHIBITION LAWS This department has been able to win for the state over ninety per cent of the liquor cases brought before the supreme court during the biennium. It has actively and vigorously en - forced this law as well as others, and has come to the aid of locali - ties where local government was weak and where the local en - forcement officers were unable to meet present conditions of law - lessness. The department generally has received kindly and efficient cooperation from the federal department of justice and the various county attorneys of the state. In conclusion I am pleased to express my deep appreciation of the splendid assistance and loyal support of my co-workers and assistants, Messrs. George W. Ayres, Lloyd Dort, Hugh La- </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Master, Lee Basye, T. J. McGuire and Harry Silverman. Their able co-operation has been of inestimable aid to me in the dis - charge of my official duties, and at all times they have manifested sincere desire to promote the public welfare and protect the in - terests of the state. I also acknowledge with gratitude the loyalty, efficiency and carefulness to detail of the stenographers in the department, Frieda C. Bayerlein and Caroline L. Ayer, ■who have done much to make possible the success of the depart - ment in its efforts on behalf of the public. Respectfully submitted, O. S. SPILLMAN, Attorney General. / </seg>

            <seg id="p061">OPINIONS 61 ALIENS— NATURALIZATION— 1922 AMENDMENT Relating: to naturalization and citizenship of women. February 1, 192H. Mr. C. O. Brown, Campbell, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Brown : Inquiry has reached this office concerning the status, as a citizen and voter, of an American born woman who married a Frenchman, who has since died. According to our understand - ing, she has continued to live in this country since his death, and claims it as her home, and claims to be a citizen of the United States. We are not advised of the date of her marriage. In 1907, by Chapter 2534 of the United States Statutes at Large of that date, it is provided that American citizens may become expatriated : 1. By being naturalized in a foreign state. 2. By taking an oath of allegiance thereto. 3. By residing two years in a foreign state from which the naturalized citizen came, or for five years in any other state. This residence raises a presumption that the person is an alien. This pre - sumption may be overcome by presentation of satisfactory evidence to a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States under the rules of the Department of State. 4. No person is allowed to expatriate himself during a time of war. By this Act of March 2nd, 1907, it is also provided as to women, as follows: Section 3, Chapter 2534, U. S. Statutes at large, 1907. "That any American woman who marries a foreigner shall take the nationality of her husband. At the termination of the marital relation she may re - sume her American citizenship, if abroad, by registering as an Ameri - can citizen within one year with a consul of the United States, or by returning to reside in the United States, or, if residing in the United States, at the termination of the marital relation by continuing to re - side therein." This Act of 1907 was amended September 22nd, 1922, by Chapter 411, United States Statutes at large, Volume 42, pages </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 fl and 1022. Section 2 of this Act requires the wives of aliens a have become naturalized since September 22nd, 1922, also be naturalized. The process, however, is simplified. This tion, however, does not apply to the case to which you refer, as the husband in that case was never naturalized. Section 3 of the Act of 1922 provides as follows: "That a woman citizen of the United States shall not cease to be a citizen of the United States by reason of her marriage after the passage of this Act, unless she makes a formal renunciation of her citizenship before a court having jurisdiction over naturalization of aliens: Provided: That any woman citizen who marries an alien in - eligible to citizenship shall cease to be a citizen of the United States. If at the termination of the marital status she is a citizen of the United States she shall retain her citizenship regardless of her resi - t:e. If during the continuance of the marital status she resides con - ously for two years in a foreign state of which her husband is a citizen or subject, or for five years continuously outside the United States, she shall thereafter be subject to the same presumption as is a naturalized citizen of the United States under the second paragraph of Section 2 of the Act, entitled: 'An Act in reference to the expatriation of citizens and their protection abroad.' " If the lady in question was married since September 22nd, 1922, she would not lose her citizenship unless she made a formal renunciation as prescribed by this Section. If, however, she made no such express renunciation, and since the death of her husband has continued to reside in this country, claiming to be a citizen of this country, in our opinion she would be a bona fide citizen of the United States entitled to the rights of suf - frage, as provided by law. A definite opinion on this proposi - tion doubtless could be obtained through the Department of State at Washington. LD BANKS— DEPOSITS OF PUBLIC FUNDS We are justified in assuming that deposits of public funds by county treasurers in a state bank in excess of 60 per cent of the paid up • capital stock of the bank is within the protection of the depositors' </seg>
            <seg id="p063">OPINIONS 63 guaranty fund under State ex rel Davis vs. Peoples State Bank of Anselmo, 198 N. W. 1018. November ltt, 1925. Hon. Dan V. Stephens, Fremont. Nebraska. Dear Mr. Stephens: In your letter of the 7th instant you state among other things that: "The question is in regard to the law affecting the deposits of public funds in State Banks. The ruling of the Supreme Court in the Custer County case took the limit off. the amount of funds that may be deposited in a State Bank without bonds and the practice has been uni - fotmly based on that ruling; in fact, the insurance companies have already returned to us all our premiums that we paid on bonds that we had covering the period following the Supreme Court decision. "We have written letters to a score of banks in Lincoln, Omaha, Grand Island, Hastings, and other Nebraska cities, making inquiry as to whether municipal or county authorities had required them to give bond, notwithstanding this court decision. There was not a single in - stance anywhere where any state bank has given a bond to cover the deposits of public funds since this decision was made, so far as I have been able to ascertain." You state that you desire an opinion on this subject. In reply, permit me to suggest the provisions of the latter part of Section 8027, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922: "No bank which has complied in full with all of the provisions of this article shall be required to give any further security or bond for the purpose of becoming a depository for any public funds, but deposi - tory funds shall be secured in the same manner that private funds are secured." The decision of the court in State ex rel Davis Atty. Gen. v. People's State Bank of Anselmo, on the rehearing of this case, reported in 198 N. W. 1018, and which holds: "Where a county treasurer deposits public funds in a state bank in excess of 50 per cent of the paid-up capital stock of said bank, the en - tire deposit is within the protection of the depositors' guaranty fund" is the law on that subject and we are justified in following it unless and until the court holds otherwise. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 The court in this case further stated : "For some years prior to the enactment of this section, no bank could lawfully become a depository of public funds unless it crave a bond for the safekeeping and return of such funds. See sections 6191, 6193, Comp. St. 1922. One of the aims and purposes of the legislature in enacting section 8027, supra, was to relieve state banks from the necessity of giving bond for the safekeeping and return of public funds therein deposited. "We think there is little or no doubt that the main purpose of the legislature in limiting the amount of public funds a county treasurer might deposit in any bank to 50 per cent of its capital stock was to secure the greater safety and protection of public funds. By the en - actment of the depositors' guaranty fund law, pursuant to the pro - visions of which all banks, organized under the laws of the state, be - come liable for assessments to create and maintain the depositors' guaranty fund, the legislature no doubt believed that ample protection and security would be furnished for any public funds deposited in state banks." The court intimates that by implication Section 4151, Com - piled Statutes of 1922 had been repealed, although they do not say so in so many words. In view of this decision it is the opinion of this Department that Section 4151, Compiled Statutes of 1922, is modified by Sec - tion 8027. Compiled Statutes of 1922, which was enacted several years later than the former section and that no bond by a state bank is necessary in order to become a depository for public funds under the Bank Guaranty Law. OSS BANKS— DEPOSITORY OF COUNTY FUNDS A state bank which is under the state bank guarantee law is not re - quired to give a bond to entitle it to be a depository of county funds. May 7, 1925. Mr. C. H. Denney, Fairbury, Nebr. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">OPINIONS 65 Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 5th instant. I will say that Section 80*27, Compiled Statutes, provides among other things: "No bank which has complied in full with all the provisions of this article (the bank guarantee act) shall be required to give any further security or bond for the purpose of becoming a depository for any public funds." This provision of statute was enacted, as I recall it. in 1911. ten years after the enactment of Section 4151. Compiled Statutes. This department is of the opinion that the later enactment modified the prior one. and that it is not necessary for a Nebraska state bank to give a bond in order to Income a de - pository of public funds. In this connection we call your atten - tion to the opinion written by Judge Good in the case of State ex rel Davis v. People's State Bank of Anselmo. 108 X. W. 1018. in which he said: "One cf the aims and purposes of the legislature in enacting Sec - tion 8027 * » * W as to relieve state banks from the necessity of giving bond for the safekeeping and return of public funds therein de - posited." GWA BANKS— GUARANTY FUND COMMISSION HAS NO AUTHORITY TO TRADE PROPERTY While the law provides for sale of the property assets of a failed bank by the Guaranty Fund Commission, there is no authority for the trade or exchange of such property for other property. November 16, 1925. Mr. G. A. Bryant, Guarantee Fund Commisxion, Lincoln, Xehraxka. Dear Mr. Bryant: </seg>
            <seg id="p066">66 In your letter of recent date you inquire : "If exchanges of real estate can be made by the Guarantee Fund Commission providing the transaction can be shown to be of advantage in the liquidation of the assets of failed banks. In other words, is there anything to prevent the exchange of properties in the above matter providing such exchange is approved by the court, or has the court a right under the law to approve such an exchange?" In answer to your inquiry I would suggest that while this question is somewhat in doubt there seems to be no provision in the Guarantee Fund Law or elsewhere for such exchange by the Commission. While there seems to be authority for sale of lands and for the doing of the usual things necessary to convert same into cash for the purpose of liquidation of the assets of a failed bank, yet the law seems to draw a distinction between sale and barter, and trading of property under such circum - stances could hardly be classed as a sale. Whether the Supreme Court would sustain the action of the District Court in approv - ing such exchange can not be determined in the absence of a decision. However, it is my opinion that unless and until the Guarantee Fund Commission law is amended providing for such exchange or trade of properties, the Commission would not be justified in making such exchange. BOUNTIES— PAYMENT MANDATORY There is a mandatory duty upon counties to pay a bounty of $2.00 each on coyotes killed within the county. July 3, 1925. fr. Myron R. Williams, nun eta, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask whether or not there is a bounty on coyotes. House Roll Number 70, passed by the last Legislature pro - vides for a bounty of $2.00 on coyotes, to be paid out of the general fund. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">OPINIONS 67 You state that these coyotes were caught prior to July 1st, and you ask whether or not you would be entitled to the bounty. The law applicable to the situation prior to July 1st is con - tained in Sections 395 to 401, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1022. This law provides for a bounty of $3.00 on coyotes. As the law formerly existed the county was required to pass upon the question of whether or not they would pay the bounty. If at the time you killed the coyotes your county was paying boun - ties, it would be our opinion that you would be entitled to the bounty they were authorized to pay at the time you presented the scalps. If your county was not paying bounties at the time the coyotes were killed, we do not believe you would be entitled to the bounty. If the county was paying a bounty and you failed to present the scalps before July 2nd we believe that you would be entitled to the bounty which they were authorized to pay, which would be $2.00 per head. LD CHARITABLE SOCIETY— LENDING ASSETS One eleemosynary institution may not gratuitously transfer its funds to another and should lend only when proper security and when its charter authorizes such action. October 22. 192(5. J. M. Wingett, Secretary, Went Xehranka M. E. Hospital. Scottsblufl, Nebraska. Dear Sir: &gt; You do not state in your letter of October 19th. but we pre - sume that the hospital and institution to which you refer are societies organized under the provisions of Chapter 12, Article 6, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. which pertains to charitable and fraternal societies. The law requires that the Articles of Incorporation recite the powers of the corporation and provides what things shall be included in the articles of in - corporation. Your question is whether or not one of such insti- </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 tutions may transfer its funds or a portion thereof to another needy institution or may make a loan of funds to such needy in - stitution. In our opinion it is not contemplated that one of these institutions should lend its funds except on reasonably good security. In case it is provided in the articles of incorporation that the funds of the institution may loan to other institutions, it is possible that this might be done providing the securities are such as to protect the funds of the lending institution. Ordinarily, however, this is not contemplated. In support of our conclusion, we call your attention to Section 502, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 19*22. wherein it is provided as follows: "All the funds received by any such corporation shall be used in the first instance, or shall be invested, and the income thereof used, (after paying the necessary expenses), for the exclusive purpose set forth in the articles of association, and no portion thereof shall be used for any such purpose, except within this state, and no portion of the funds of any such corporation shall be used or contributed towards the erection, completion, or furnishing of any building not owned or used by such corporation. Such corporation may take property by gift, pur - chase, bequest, or devise, and it shall be lawful to invest the same upon mortgage or in or by loan on railroad stocks or bonds, or any city, county, state, or government securities; but no loan shall be made to any trustee or officer of such corporation: Provided, any such cor - poration may, in its articles of agreement, specify the kind of securi - ties in which its funds shall be invested, and that no part of its funds shall be invested in any other securities than those named in its arti - cles, or where the securities shall not be specified in the articles of agreement, then such funds shall only be invested in such securities as are specified in this article." AVe think that if you will study the foregoing section you will see that it fully answers your inquiry. LD CIVIL ADMINISTRATIVE CODE— EMPLOYEES Secretary, deputy secretary or employee under the code prohibited from holding other office or position of profit. August 13, 1925. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">OPINIONS 69 Honorable Kirk Griggs, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire if a secretary of a department under the code, or a deputy secretary or employee, has authority to hold any other position of profit or for which he receives remuneration during his incumbency as secretary or deputy secretary, etc. In reply, permit me to call your attention to Section 7247, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which provides as follows: "Each secretary, and each appointee in each department, shall de - vote his entire time to the duties of his office and shall hold no other office or position of profit. No appointee in any of the departments shall be a relative of any of the secretaries of departments created by this act." The provisions of this Section are plain and prohibit any secretary, deputy secretary or any other appointee in any de - partment under the code from holding any other office or posi - tion of profit, and this Section requires such secretary or ap - pointee to give his entire time to the duties of the office. OSS CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES— AMEND- MENT— LEGISLATIVE ACTION An amendment to the Constitution of the United States once adopted by a state cannot lawfully be a subject of legislation by a subse- quent legislature. The rule is otherwise as to previous rejection. February 7, 1925. Honorable Thorn an Axtell, Represen tative, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This department has been consulted and its opinion asked </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL as to whether or not a vote of rejection upon the part of the present Legislature would bar a subsequent Legislature from re - considering and voting upon the proposed child labor amend - ment to the Constitution of the United States. "Whether proposed by Congress or by a convention, an amend - ment does not become a part of the Constitution unless it is 'ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress.' " 12 Corpus Juris, 681, U. S. Const. Art. 5. "Ratification of a proposed amendment, when once acceded to by a state legislature, would seem to exhaust its authority to act and pre - clude a reconsideration." 12 Corpus Juris, 681-682. The states of New Jersey and Ohio first adopted and then rejected the fourteenth amendment. In each case the act of ratification was disregarded, and Congress by a concurrent reso - ton pronounced the ratification valid and sufficient. 15 U. S. tutes, at large, 706. This proposition seems to be well settled. It has been held, however, that one vote of rejection is no bar to a subsequent reconsideration and adoption of the amend - ment. (12 Corpus Juris, 682.) The Legislature of the State of New Jersey first rejected the thirteenth amendment in 1865, and then adopted it the following year. The fourteenth amendment was rejected by the legislatures of North Carolina, South Caro - lina and Georgia when first considered, but was subsequently ratified by these states.

In 1873 the Senate of Ohio adopted a joint resolution ratifying an amendment relating to the compensation of mem - bers of Congress, which was submitted by Congress in 1789. The latter proposition is one upon which we cannot give you a definite opinion, but speaking generally we would be of the opinion that the amendment might be acted upon by the Legislature at various times until such time as it shall be rati - fied. After ratification any further action would be unavailing, but after one rejection the Legislature may again pass upon the subject until such time as it may be ratified, but withdrawn from consideration by congressional action. In the event that Congress should have placed a time limitation for ratification, of course, the state would have to act within the limitation pro - vided. This was done in the case of the eighteenth amendment, but does not seem to have been done in the case of the amend - ment under consideration. LD CONSTITUTIONAL LAW Chapter 106, Session Laws of 1925 is a constitutional enactment. April 28, 1926. Mr. Walter R. Raecke, County Attorney, Central City, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Raecke: You ask for an opinion from this department as to whether Chapter 106. Session Laws of 1925, which amends Section 3239, Compiled Statutes, is a constitutional enactment and you say its constitutionality has been challenged upon the ground that it contains more than one subject. In answer to your question I will say that in the opinion of this department the act in question is constitutional. The </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL amendment is germane to the subject of the original bill of ■which Section 3239 as it was originally passed, formed a part and the title is sufficiently explicit to show that it was proposed by the amendment to provide penalties for bootlegging. If the title of the amendatory act is comprehensive enough anything that is germane to the original act may be included in a bill to amend a section of the original act. The act would not have been vulnerable to the objection that it contained two sub - jects if it had amended not only Section 3239 but also Section 3238 and several other sections of the original act, provided the purpose of the amendment was clearly expressed in its title. Thus, in the case of State v. Ryan, 92 Neb. 636, an amend - ment to a bill to amend certain sections of the charter of the city of South Omaha so as to include the amendment of certain fr sections of the city charter was permitted even after the » for the introduction of bills had expired. You will note section in question does not conflict with Section 3238, Com - piled Statutes, for that section contains no provision for the punishment of sales of intoxicating liquors. It merely de - clares such sales unlawful, hence it was not necessary to repeal Section 3238, Compiled Statutes, when Chapter 106, Session Laws of 1925, was passed. It is to be borne in mind in the consideration of this ques tion that "A statute -"ill be upheld unless it is clearly forbidden by a para - mount law." Pleuler v. State, 11 Neb. 547. GWA CONSTITUTIONAL LAW— AUTHORITY OF POLICE Police magistrates have power to pass upon the question of the consti - tutionality of an ordinance or law but should act cautiously and ordinarily leave that question for higher courts. September 20, 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">OPINIONS 73 Mr. Bruce D. Oldham, Police Magistrate, Kearney, Nebraska. Dear Sir You inquire whether or not you, as a police magistrate, have jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutionality of an ordi - nance in the city of Kearney. The constitution provides that your court shall have juris - diction as may l&gt;e provided by law. The law has given certain jurisdiction to police magistrates, which includes the enforce - ment of the ordinances of a city. Necessarily, therefore, the jurisdiction of the police magistrate depends upon the validity of the ordinance which may be called into question or which the accused ma\ r be charged with violating. Therefore, it seems to be an inherent power in this court to pass upon this question when properly raised as a part of the jurisdictional features of the court. We are, therefore, inclined to the belief that you have the power to pass upon the constitutionality of the ordinance. How - ever, in accord with the decisions of other courts referred to in 12 C. J. 779. we believe that police magistrates and justices of the peace should act very cautiously in connection with the con - stitutional questions, and should very reluctantly hold ordi - nances or laws unconstitutional, leaving these questions for the courts of higher jurisdiction. LD CRIMES— DISTINCT UNDER LIQUOR LAWS Possession of liquor and sale thereof constitute distinct offenses. Chapter 106, Session Laws of Nebraska 1925, however, provides a specific offense known commonly as bootlegging. August 11, 19*25. Mr. W. C. Coiidit, State Sheriff, </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Condit : You ask our opinion as to whether or not possession and sale of intoxicating liquor constitute one offense. We presume that you are referring to Chapter 106, page W. Session Laws of Nebraska, 1925, commonly known as the Kb of liquor" law, which includes in its provisions the carry - or transporting of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of - &gt;sition of the same. Our interpretation of this would be that any person found in possession of intoxicating liquor where it can be shown that his intent was to dispose of it to another, is guilty of the crime provided by this chapter, whether it be termed transportation or possession with intent to sell or other - wise dispose of it. In this connection the legislature has pro - vided that possession of more than one pint of such liquor shall be prima facie evidence that it was being carried or transported for the purpose of sale. In other words, this statute provides that violation of the same shall be a specific offense. This sec - tion merely amends Section 3239, Compiled Statutes of 1922, commonly known as the "bootlegging law''. It does not in any manner, so far as we can seo, amend or repeal Section 3241 pertaining to intoxication, nor Section 3247, as amended by Chapter 94, page 239, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1923, re - ferring to possession of liquor. A person might be in possession of liquor without being guilty of the crime of intent to sell by transportation as provided by Chapter 106, Session Laws of 1925. While it is true that possession of the liquor is necessary for conviction under Chapter 106, such possession constitutes merely one of the elements of the offense. In other words, the matter might narrow down to a ques - tion of fact, in the event that the accused has more than one pint of liquor, he probably would be charged with violation of Chapter 106, Laws of 1925. If he had less than one pint of liquor and the intent to unlawfully dispose of same could not be shown, he would still be liable to prosecution for possession if he possessed same in violation of the law. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">OPINIONS 75 Whether or not he could be charged with violating Chapter 106 and then be found guilty of mere possession, would be an - other question. Our courts have held in some cases, where a person is charged with an offense which includes a lesser offense, the accused may be found guilty of the lesser offense and the conviction stand. This is onlv, however, in cases where the lesser offense is necessarily included in the greater. Possession of the liquor is necessarily included in possession with intent to sell and it is probable that the courts would take that view of the situation. This, however, would require a court decision. We conclude, however, that the offenses mentioned are distinct offenses.

You will note that under Section 3273, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, it refers to vehicles which have been used in the transportation of liquors illegally. This section does not seem to expressly authorize the confiscation of an automobile where it merely has mash or other materials. We, therefore, </seg>

U)±2. We think that it would be proper to have the complaint run both against the defendant and the automobile. Some years ago the writer went through the courts on this proposi - tion of confiscation. You will find the case, which appears to be the leading case in this state, reported as Robinson Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Katekin. 104 Neb. 30!). It U mv ivcol lection that the complaint in that case did not run against the car. and still the court held that it could be held and sold as the for - feiture of the automobile was an incident to the conviction of the automobile and the owner in charge of the car. It sei&gt;ni&lt; to us to be best to let the case run also against the car.

December (&gt;, 19*2C». Mr. Wilbur F. Bryant, County Jn(h/(\ Haithif/toii , Nebraska. Dear Judge Bryant: You inquire whether or not costs of a search warrant are taxable against the defendant where liquor is found and prose - cution follows with a plea of guilty. As you know, our statutes provide that in the event of conviction the costs of a criminal </seg>
            <seg id="p078">78 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL prosecution are assessed against the defendant. Section 10168, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, uses the words "costs of prosecution." We also call your attention to the fact that Section 3288, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, in connection with Kor ca;-es uses the same language. The same article pertain - to intoxicating liquor provides for the issuance of a search warrant as a part of the procedure for prosecution of certain offenses connected with intoxicating liquor. The matter of assessment of costs is, of course, a matter of statutory interpretation, as the assessment of costs is lawful only as prescribed by statute. Under the heading of "Searches and Seizures", 35 Cyc. 12(55, the rule is as follows: "Proceeding for the search and seizure of property stolen or il - legally withheld vary according to the statutes of the several states. They are in most instances of a criminal nature and are usually an - cillary to the prosecution of some particular offense, but may or may not be accompanied by a criminal prosecution, depending upon the nature of the facts disclosed, if any." 33 C. J. (589, pertaining to the subject of costs in prosecu - tions under the statutes pertaining to violations of the laws in regard to intoxicating liquor states: "The right to costs, the liability therefor, and the account thereof, depend upon the provisions of the statute under which such a proceed - ings is brought." You will note that Section 3273. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. pertaining to the issuance of search war - rants, provides for the search and prosecution to immediately follow in the event the search is successful. This section also provides that final judgment of conviction in such proceedings shall be in all cases a bar, etc. This indicates to us that pro - cedure by search warrant is ancillary to the prosecution and the costs incurred are probably a part of tire costs in prosecu - tion in the event that the court shall find that the search war - rant was properly issued. In this connection, we believe the court is vested with sonre discretion. In support of the last </seg>
            <seg id="p079">OPINIONS 79 statement we call to your attention the case of Blester v. State, 65 Neb. 277, in which case it was held that the costs of prose - cution which may be taxed against the defendant are costs in - curred in establishing guilt. This case also holds that : "Costs probably taxable to a defendant in a criminal case are not all the costs which the person having charge of the prosecution may see fit to make but only such as there was actual, apparent or probable necessity for incurring." In determining what costs were actual, apparent or prob - ably necessary, the district court is vested with much discretion which will not be interfered with if fairly exercised. In view of the foregoing we therefore conclude that if the court in its discretion determined that the costs of the search warrant were incurred in the reasonable necessary prosecution of the case, and that the .search warrant was ancillary thereto, that such costs are taxable against the convicted defendant. LD *' CRIMINAL PROCEDURE— FEES DEPENDENT UPON CONVICTION Magistrates in misdemeanor cases receive no fees except defendant be convicted.

Dear Sir We are in receipt of your letter of January 23rd, in which you ask whether there is not some relief for the situation which requires conviction of the defendants in police courts or justice of the peace courts in order for the justice or police magistrate to receive fees. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">80 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL This situation is one of long standing and is one which should have been corrected long ago. It is not right that the court .should in any way lie thinking about the recovery of fees from the person charged with an offense, neither is it right that the justice or police magistrate should hold court and not be paid for his service, but this seems to be the situation. The writer has in mind a suggestion to the legislative reference bureau the preparation of a bill to correct this evil, and in substance to provide that all complaints before justices of the peace and police magistrates shall be signed by the complain - ing party or by the county attorney or city attorney, as the case may be. It should also provide that in ca*es where the county attorney or city attorney is convinced that a conviction may be secured that the attorney should sign the complaint in behalf of the political subdivision. In other cases where the conviction appears doubtful, that the complaining parties should sign the complaint, and in the event of the discharge of the defendant, complaining party signing the complaint should be held for costs. If this matter is taken care of it will correct the evil we believe. Answering the second part of your letter we will say that Chapter 1ST. Session Laws. HUT. was the act pertaining to in - toxicating liquors, and Section 8287. Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska. 1022, requiring city councils and village boards to enact ordinances, refers to Chapter 187, Session Laws. 1917. We believe that your city should enact an ordinance as instructed by the legislature pertaining to the subject of intoxicating liquor, as set forth in Chapter 187, Session Laws, 1917, except those parts of it which may have been repealed of which at this time we have no special recollection.

            <seg id="p081">OPINIONS 81 Mr. Wayne B. Wheeler, SO Blixs Building, Washington, D. C. Dear Sir: We are in receipt of your letter of Decemlier 1st. Your first inquiry is as follows: "Do magistrates or mayors of towns and villages, under the laws of your state, receive any compensation or fees in state misdemeanor cases, where a defendant is acquitted; if so, how is it paid and by whom ? " Answering this inquiry we will say that courts trying mis - demeanor cases which constitute violations of state laws in the event the same are courts inferior to the district court are paid by fees which are chargeable as costs. In the event the defend - ant is acquitted there is no way to collect the costs, hence there is considerable reason for a justice or other magistrate to con - vict the defendant in the event there is any evidence tending to prove guilt. In this connection we call your attention to Section 102(58 and Section 10274, also Sections 9!&gt;07 and 2400. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for IMS. We recently wrote a letter of Messrs.

LD CRIMINAL PROCEDURE— JURY WHEN ENTITLED TO In bootlegging cases for violation of Chapter 106, Session Laws, 1925, the defendant is entitled to a jury particularly upon his request. Magistrates have not jurisdiction in such cases to pronounce sen - tence except in first offenses where the sentence does not exceed their jurisdiction, and county courts where there is a plea of guilty, where the punishment does not exceed six months' im - prisonment, or $500 fine, or both. December 24, 1925 Mr. Julius D. Cronin, County Attorney. O'Neill, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In connection with prosecution under the provisions of Chapter 10G, Session Laws of 1925, commonly known as "the pint of liquor law'', which pertains to bootlegging, you ask the following questions : 1. Is the defendant entitled to a jury trial? Section 3287, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that for the violations of the liquor act there may be a trial without a jury in cases where the penalty does not exceed a fine of $100 or imprisonment for a period of three months. This provision was in force before the enactment of the present boot - legging law. The old bootlegging law was Section 3239, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. That section did not carry any specific penalty, and penalties were inflicted under the gen - eral provision, so under the old law it was possible to try a </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OPINIONS 83 person for bootlegging because the punishment for a first offense was a fine of $100 or imprisonment not less than thirty and not more than sixty days. This penalty was within the provisions of Section 3287. where a case may l)e tried without a jury. Section 3287 was held constitutional in the case of Bell v. State, 104 Neb. 203, cited in 108 Neb. 241-288. It is to be noted in the opinion in Bell v. State that the law was held constitu - tional upon the theory that the offense against the liquor laws, tryable without a jury, was not an offense which existed under the common law or the statutes at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and therefore new misdemeanors and procedure relating thereto were proper subjects of legislation. It is to be noted that since the adoption of Sections 3287, 3239, and other sections of the Statutes pertaining to the subject of intoxicating liquors, that the Constitutional Convention met and a new Constitution was formulated. Many of the former provisions remained unchanged. That provision relating to right of trial by jury remained as it was prior to l!&gt;"20 at the time of the adoption of the new Constitution. We are thus con - fronted with the situation that indicates that at the time of the adoption of the new Constitution that the Legislature had enacted the provisions relating to intoxicating liquor and pro - vided punishment for violation thereof. Thus it may be argued that violations of the laws |&gt;ertaining to intoxicating liquors were misdemeanors provided for at the time of the adoption of the new Constitution, so that the reasoning in Bell v. State may not now be applicable to misdemeanors existing under the stat - utes at the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1920. This matter, of cour-e. is not free from doubt until our Supreme Court shall have passed upon this phase of the ques - tion. Applying the above reasoning to your particular inquiry as to a prosecution under the bootlegging law. Chapter 10(5, Session Laws, IMS, we call to your attention the fact that Chapter 106 for the first penalty provides a fine of $100 and </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL imprisonment in the county jail not less than sixty nor more than ninety days. This punishment takes the case out of the express provision of Section 3287. On account of this situation of the readoption of that clause of the Constitution providing for a jury trial, we believe that it is the safest plan to afford a jury trial in misdemeanor cases upon request of the defendant. Of course, in cases in the juvenile court law, such as are men - tioned in Laurie v. State. 108 Neb. 241, where no crime is charged, it is still unnecessary to have a jury. 2. You next inquire if convicted can the magistrate impose the penalty provided by Chapter 10(5 above referred to? Chapter 57, Session Laws of 1925, provides that magis - trates shall have jurisdiction concurrent with the district court and co-extensive with their respective counties in all criminal cases where the punishment can not exceed three months' im - prisonment, and a fine of $100. or both, except as otherwise provided by law. Construing the above provision in connection with Chapter 106 it is very evident that the magistrate has not jurisdiction to pronounce sentence except in cases where the defendant has been found guilty of a first offense where the fine is the sum of $100 and imprisonment in. the county jail not less than sixty nor more than ninety days. In addition to the foregoing jurisdiction it is provided that in county courts and upon a plea of guilty the defendant may be sentenced by the county judge in cases for prosecution of a misdemeanor where the imprisonment does not exceed six months or a fine not to exceed $500, or both, according to the law of the case. This provision is found in Chapter 102. Ses - sion Laws of 1925. Your inquiries 3 and 4 are answered by our answers to your inquiries 1 and 2. 5. You inquire whether or not Chapter 57 of the Laws of 1925 amend Section 3287. Compiled Statutes, 1922. Chapter 57, aforesaid, amends Section 3287, only so far as it is inconsistent therewith. It really does not amend it at all </seg>
            <seg id="p085">OPINIONS 85 but takes without the operation of Section 3287 those cases where the punishment is both fine and imprisonment as dis - tinguished from the cases where the punishment has a fine or imprisonment, as provided by Section 3287. Section 3287 re - mains in force so far as any express repeal is concerned. The only question of its application is that which we have discussed in answering your inquiry No. 1, pertaining to the readoption of the Constitution, and its application to misdemeanors known at the time the Constitution was readopted. As we have said before, this question can not be definitely answered until our Supreme Court has passed upon it. LD CRIMINAL PROCEDURE— LIQUOR— SENTENCE IN COUNTY COURT Wherein liquor cases carrying a punishment of $500 fine, or six months' imprisonment, or both, the county court has jurisdiction to pronounce sentence only upon a plea of guilty and upon a plea of not guilty sets only as examining magistrate. Mr. Wdbur F. Bryant, Comity Juih/e. Ilnrtington, Nebratika. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not a county judge has jurisdiction to punish a violation of Section 9G65, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. You will note by the provisions of Section 16, Article V, of the Constitution of Nebraska, it provides, refer - ring to county courts: "but they shall not have jurisdiction in criminal cases in which the pun - ishment may exceed six months in jail or a fine of $600 or both." This indicates that in no event may the jurisdiction in criminal matters exceed that provided by the Constitution. However, in April 2&lt;». 1996. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL our opinion it leaves to the legislature the duty of stating in what criminal cases the county court shall have jurisdiction. You will note that the constitutional provision does not state that the court shall have jurisdiction, but is stated in the nega - tive so that the place of the jurisdiction of the court in criminal matters is left for the action of the legislature. With these things in mind we wrote the following letter to Mr. Hardenbrook, county attorney at Ord, Nebraska, as follows: "Answering ycur letter of recent date pertaining to the jurisdic - tion of the ccunty court in criminal cases, particularly referring to Section 9988, and Section 3252, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. "While it is true a punishment within the jurisdiction of the county court might be assessed under the provisions of these sections, nevertheless a greater punishment not within the jurisdiction of the county court might be imposed. We are therefore of the opinion that the county court does not have jurisdiction in cases where the punish - ment may exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine exceeding $500, or both. Our reason for this conclusion is that Section 16, Article V, of the Constitution, limits the jurisdiction of the county court in crim - inal cases, and states that said court shall not have jurisdiction where the punishment may exceed six months' imprisonment or a fine of over $500, or both." Under the provisions of Section 0988, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, as amended by Chapter 102, page 291, Session Laws of 1925, you will note that the county judge has jurisdic - tion to render judgment upon a plea of guilty in misdemeanors where the imprisdnment does not exceed six months or the fine does not exceed $500, or both. This limits the jurisdiction of the county judge, however, to cases where a plea of guilty is entered. It is an indication, therefore, that in the event the defendant does not plead guilty that he shall be tried as in a preliminary for the purpose of binding over, if the court be - lieves there is reason so to do where the punishment may exceed the justice of the peace jurisdiction or express jurisdiction of the eountv court. </seg>

June 18, 1925. Mr. M. L. Crossley, Police Judge, Superior, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have read your letter of June 10th, and will say that we believe you should not assess a fine against any person unless a complaint has been filed. If complaint has been filed, and the person has given bond for his appearance and fails to appear, the bond may be forfeited. Section 10129. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 19-22. pro - vides that persons charged with misdemeanor may be put on trial in their absence at their own request, which shall be in writing, and entered on the journal of the court. Unless this was done we believe that you would have to have a complaint, and the defendant would have to appear in person for trial, or waive appearance in writing, in misdemeanor cases before you could assess a fine and costs against him. . Sections 10206 to 10274, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, indicate that moneys due on forfeited recognizance should be paid in the first instance to the clerk of the court or magis - trate, who shall pay the same to the treasurer of the proper count}', and in case of the police magistrate, it seems this must be paid to the treasurer of the city for violation of a city ordi - nance, otherwise to county treasurer.

May 13, 1925. Mr. F. N. Prout, County Attorney, Falls City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In compliance with your request for an opinion as to whether in a prosecution for selling corporate stock in Nebraska without a permit or license so to do from the Department of Trade and Commerce, several alleged sales may properly be joined in a single count in the information, permit me to say that in my opinion the better way is to allege sale of stock in a separate count. The matter seems to me to lie analogous in principle to the sale of intoxicating, liquors without a license in the days when the sale of intoxicating liquor was licensed in Nebraska, and in the case of Smith v. State, 32 Neb. 105, the Supreme Court said : "Each act of selling any of the liquors * * * as well as the act of giving away any of them without a license so to do, is a crime." Similarly, in the case of State v. Piaehel, reported in 16 Neb. at page 490, thereof, it is said : "An indictment which charges the selling and giving away of ail the liquors named * * • with a continuendo. Held bad. See also 8tate v.

June 0. 1925. Mr. W. C. Uondit, State Sheriff, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: You inquire: "Whether or not deputy state sheriffs can sign complaints on which search warrants are issued in the various counties of the state." Permit me to say in answer to your question that in my opinion they may. It is provided by statute that "If any officer of the county or state or any creditable resident </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL freeholder of the county makes complaint before any police, municipal, or county judge, or justice of the peace, in writing and on oath, that he has reason to believe and does believe, that any intoxicating liquor, de - scribing it as particularly as may be in the complaint, is in the county in any place described, unlawfully owned or kept by any person named or described, or is intended to be or is being by the person named or described in the complaint manufactured, sold or kept for sale or dis - position in violation of this act, said magistrate shall, upon the filing of such complaint, and believing there is probable cause therefor, issue his warrant for a search of the premises described," • • *. The statute further provides in defining the powers of the governor with reference to the enforcement of the so-called Liquor Law. that "He may call to his assistance any number of persons necessary to see that said law is enforced, including such special attorneys, assistants and clerks and provide quarters for them, as he may deem necessary, and may authorize any of them to perform any and all duties in the enforcement of this act and any person so authorized is hereby vested with all of the powers possessed by prosecuting and peace officers." I assume that the officers in question have been authorized by the governor either expressly or in general terms, to do what - ever may lawfully be done by the local officers in the enforce - ment of the liquor laws. Of course the duty of making complaints for search war - rants does not devolve altogether upon the persons appointed by the governor. In A r ery many cases it will doubtless be found expedient to have them made either by a creditable resident freeholder or by some local officer.

            <seg id="p091">OPINIONS 91 Mr. E. J. Hainer, Attorney at Law, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In response to your request for an opinion from this de - partment as to the method to be pursued in incorporating a Congregational Church or Society in the State of Nebraska, I will say, Section 546, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides among other things that "It shall be lawful for any religious sect or denomination • * • within this state to elect, at a meeting of the majority of the members of any organized church • • * called for that purpose, any number of their members not less than three to serve as trustees or directors and one member as clerk, who shall hold their offices during the pleasure of the society or association." And Section 547, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides among other things that "The clerk so elected shall make a true record of the proceedings of such meeting * * * so far as the same pertains to the organization of the body and election of such trustees or directors, and certify and de - liver a true copy of the same to the clerk of the county where such meetings shall be held * * * and it shall be the duty of such county clerk, immediately upon receipt of such certified statement, to record the same in a book of record to be kept by him * * • and from and after the making of such record by the county clerk • • * the said trustees * * ♦ and their associate members as such • * * church • • * and their successors shall be invested with the powers, privileges and immunities incident to aggregate corporations and a certified transcript of the record herein authorized to be made by county clerk • * * shall be deemed and taken in all courts and places whatsoever, in this state as prima facie evidence of the existence of such corporation." I am of the opinion that a local church which is inde - pendent in its organization and is not controlled by a central governing body may be lawfully organized as a corporation in cortformity with the provisions of statute above quoted. I may add that I see no reason why such a church may not also incorporate under the provisions of Section 458, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and its cognate sections. GWA </seg>

February 28, 1925. Hon. J. E. Egger, Chairman, Claims and Deficiency Committee, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Under date of February 27th you make inquiry as to whether or not your committee should deduct from the claim of Peterson, Shirley &amp; Gunther, a co-partnership, the overpayment made to Carlson and Miller, contractors on Project 82-A of $5,611.80, and interest thereon, amounting to $1,173.02 as the result of Edward Peterson, an individual being surety for Carl - son and Miller. Also whether the committee should deduct the amount of an overpayment on Project 125-A in the amount of $2,559.15 with interest thereon amounting to $522.49, this over - payment being to Edward Peterson, contractor, previous to the time that the said Edward Peterson entered into co-partnership with the firm of Peterson, Shirley &amp; Gunther. In answer to your inquirj', we desire to state that if Edward Peterson owes the state anything by virtue of over - payments to him or on other liabilities, that any moneys in the possession of the state which may be owing to said Edward Peterson personally, should be first deducted before paying any - thing to him upon the personal account. We will also say that in our opinion any sums that may be owing the state of Ne - braska or any of its departments by the firm of Peterson, Shir - ley &amp; Gunther should be first deducted before paying to that firm anything that may be coming to it from the state of </seg>
            <seg id="p093">OPINIONS 93 With these things in mind we call your attention to the following cases : Clay-Robinson d- Co. v. Douglax Co.. 88 Neb. 303, in which case the court has sustained the partnership entity theory in Nebraska and has held that the partnership is an entity entirely distinct from the individual partners. We call your attention to Bullock v. Power-Heafey Coal Co., 1)8 Neb. -221 : Columbia National Bank v. Rice. 48 Neb. 428. and Spies v. Stein, 70 Neb. 641. These three cases hold that the individual debt of one of the partners of a co-partnership cannot be charged against nor col - lected from the assets of a co-partnership without the consent of the meml)ers of the co-partnership, unless they shall have been guilty of some act or acts which amount to an estoppel, that would make it unjust and inequitable for the co-partnership not to be held for the individual debt. Under the conditions stated, and in the light of the au - thorities we have cited it would therefore be our opinion that no moneys owing to the firm of Peterson, Shirley &amp; Gunther can be retained to pay the individual liability of Edward Peterson, unless you may have knowledge of such facts as would indicate that the firm of Peterson, Shirley &amp; Gunther has been interested in the said individual operations of Edward Peterson to the extent that the firm has benefited therefrom and has now Income estopped to deny its firm liabilities. By estoppel we refer either to financial benefits or to the succession by the firm to those benefits which were involved in the matters under consideration.

Madam : In answer to your inquiry of September 9th as to the au - thority of a company to use the word "co-operative" as a part of its name, would suggest that Section 646, Compiled Statutes for 1922, provides: "No corporation, company, firm or association which shall not be incorporated as a co-operative corporation shall adopt or use the words 'co-operative' or any abbreviation thereof as a part of its name. Any person or company violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and for each day's continuance of the offense fined in a sum not to exceed one hundred dollars." If there is any violation of this statute it is within the juris - diction of the county attorney, to whom you are referred. With respect to your question as to the right of local busi - ness men joining in the movement to organize the creamery, would .suggest that frequently business men join with the fann - ers in such an enterprise or take stock in such corporation. I do not know the facts in regard to the organization of this com - pany, but hope that it is properly organized, and that it will be a benefit to the community. OSS CORPORATIONS— INVESTMENT— TAXATION The stock of a corporation incorporated for the purpose of buying and selling stocks, mortgages and bonds, and actually engaged ir such business, should be taxed in the same way and manner that bank stock is taxed. April 26, 1926. Mr. T. E. Williams, Tax Cont?nis*ioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">OPINIONS 95 Dear Mr. Williams: You submit to this department a letter received by you from Mr. Guy C. Kiddo, vice-president of the Omaha National Bank, in which he says: "In connection with plans for the incorporation of a private com - pany to buy and sell stocks, bonds, mortgages, real estate, etc., and in connection with the selection of a name for this company, the question has arisen whether or not such a company, particularly if the word 'investment' appears in its name, would be subject to taxation under the intangible tax law in the same way that banks, trust companies and similar institutions are taxed," and in which he calls attention to the fact that in the revenue law investment companies are classed with banks and trust com - panies for taxation purposes, and inquires what interpretation you place upon the word "investment" as used in the section of statute which classes such companies with banks for taxation purposes. In answer to your question I will r-ay that I know of no statutory definition of the term "investment company" but a reasonable definition of the term as used in the revenue law is given in the case of Bressler v. Wayne County, 84 Neb. 776. In that case Judge Letton, who wrote the opinion, said: "The 'investment company' mentioned in the section evidently be - longs to a class of financial institutions dealing in bonds, stocks, notes, mortgages, and other instruments, or evidences of value representing in - vested capital. It properly belongs and is classed with banks, banking associations, and loan and trust companies having a 'cashier' or 'account - ing officer.' Its purpose is not to deal with actual and tangible property itself so much as with the representatives of property or mediums of ex - change such as money, notes, obligations and securities." In view of the above quoted judicial definition of the term "investment company" as well as the common understanding of the meaning of that term, I am of the opinion that the stock of a corporation incorporated for the primary purpose of buying and selling stocks, mortgages and bonds should be taxed in the same way and manner that the capital stock of banks is taxed, whether the word "investment" is included in its name or not.

September 24, 1925. Honorable Charles W. Pool, Secretary of State, Lincoln. Nebraska Dear Sir: You submit to this department for answer a letter received by you in which the writer, speaking for an Iowa corporation, save- "From now on the company proposes to ship into your state several car loads of merchandise, which, in the course of a year, would amount to three to six car loads of a value under $10,000 in all. This repre - sents a very minor fractional percentage of the company's total business. "The procedure would be that a car of goods would be shipped from some distant state into some city in Nebraska, and on arrival would directly from the car promptly be distributed by the company's traveling salesman on orders taken by him and approved by the office of the com - pany in Iowa. This distribution would be made among the Nebraska merchants, the sole purpose being to effect a saving of transportation charges to those merchants. There would be no warehousing at all in your state," and inquire whether in view of the facts above stated the cor - poration is required to file a certificate under the "Foreign Cor - poration Laws" of this state. I assume the certificate referred to in the letter is the certificate mentioned in Section G34, Com - piled Statutes, 1922, by which the corporation, a foreign corpo - ration doing business in this state, designates its principal place of business in the state and appoints an agent or agents upon whom service of process against it may be served. If this assumption be correct I will say in answer to the question above propounded that in my opinion if the only busi - ness transacted by the company in this state is transacted in the </seg>

April 27, 19-25. Mr. P. L. Harper, Wallace, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your favor of recent date in reply to our favor of the Uth instant and we note your inquiry concerning the lia - bility of a stockholder in a co-operative association for the fail - ure of such association to publish an annual statement of its indebtedness. In reply we direct your attention to Section 470, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides: "Every corporation hereafter created shall give notice annually in some newspaper printed in the county or counties in which the business is transacted, and in case there is no newspaper printed therein, then in the nearest paper in the state, of the amount of all existing debts of the corporation, which notice shall be signed by the president and a majority of the directors, and if any corporation shall fail to do so, after the assets of the corporation are first exhausted, then all the stockholders of </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the corporation, shall be jointly and severally liable for all the debts of the corporation then existing, and for all that shall be contracted before such notice is given, to the extent of the unpaid subscription of any stockholder to the capital stock of such corporation, and in addition thereto the amount of capital stock of such corporation, and in addition thereto the amount of capital stock owned by such individuals." In the case of Singhaus v. Piper, 103 Neb. 493, 172 N. W. 523, the supreme court held: "The statute makes all the stockholders responsible for the failure to publish the statutory notice. They may compel the directors, by mandamus, to comply with the statutes in that respect, and so protect themselves from liability. Smith v. Steele, 8 Neb. 115. If they fail to see that the notice is published they become liable for debts of the cor - poration as specified in the statute. This amounts to a forfeiture for failure to perform a duty, as stated by Chief Justice Maxwell in Porter y. 8herman County Banking Co., 36 Neb. 271, 54 N. W. 424: "The for - feiture is not favored in law because it tends to rob a party of his just rights; and the same rule applies where it is sought to charge a party personally with a debt which he did not assume; it is imposed because of some alleged wrongdoing on his part. In such case the acts of omis - sion or commission must clearly bring the case within the penal pro - visions of the statute'." 89 Neb. 629. In the case of First National Bank of Omaha v. Cooper, 89 Neb. 033, 131 N. TV. 958, it was held : "By the act of 1891 (Laws 1891, Ch. 13) the liability so created was limited, 'to the extent of the unpaid subscription of any stockholder and the capital stock of such corporation, and in addition thereto the amount of capital stock owned by such individual'." We are therefore of the opinion that the liability of a stock - holder in a corporation for failure of such corporation to pub - lish a statement of its indebtedness as provided for by Section 470, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is limited to an assessment equal to the subscription of such individual to the capital stock plus the amount of capital stock owned by such individual.

Dear Mr. Lee: I have your kind favor of the 21st instant citing Fletcher Cyclopedia of Corporations, Volume 11, 1924 supplement, Sec - tion 5740, wherein the author said: "A foreign corporation which has issued stock without par value, as authorized by the statutes of the state of its domicile, may be permitted to do business in a state where the issuance of stock of that character is not allowed." You also note the Missouri, Kansas and Texas citations. This undoubtedly is the correct rule where there is no statute or constitutional prohibition to the contrary. In this state, how - ever, Section 1 of Article XII of the Constitution provides that the legislature shall provide for the control and regulation of corporations, and further provides that foreign corporations transacting, or seeking to transact business in this state, shall not be granted a greater privilege than was granted domestic corporations of a similar character. Section 8120, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, com - monly known as the "blue sky law", prohibits the granting of authority to foreign corporations to sell stock unless such stock shall have a par value, and also provides that foreign corpora - tions shall not be granted greater rights or privileges than domestic corporations.

COUNTY BOARD— EMPLOYMENT OF DETECTIVES Whether or not a county board has authority to employ and pay persons for services in assisting in the detection of violations of the liquor laws is not free from doubt until decided by the supreme court or the legislature directly authorizes it. Until then such expeditures cannot be approved. October 5, 1925. Mr. II. P. Armitage, County Attorney. Trenton. Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask whether or not the county board, at your request, has authority to employ persons to assist in the detection of violations of the liquor laws, as well as other crimes. We find no express statutory authority for such employment or the payment of such claims. In the case of Berrymcm v. Schalander, 85 Neb. 281, 122 N. W. 990, it was held that the county attorney might be recompensed for certain expenses within the discretion of the county board. It is difficult to say tw far our supreme court might find that the implied powers the county board will extend in such matters. Section 3281, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which imposes upon the governor the duties of enforcing the liquor laws does not release other officers from enforcing the liquor laws, and Section 3281 is expressly stated to be cumulative. Section 3285, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, in re - ferring to the duty of enforcing the liquor laws makes the county attorney and county board liable under certain stated conditions for failure to enforce the liquor laws where they have </seg>

This section seems to recognize the official capacity of these persons, and provides liability on their part on account of misfeasance or malfeasance in office. Possibly this section could be construed to grant the implied power to the county board to incur such reasonable expense as in their discretion might be necessary to enforce the liquor laws. This matter is not one that is free from doubt and until the legislature passes a statute directly upon the question, or until our supreme court has made further construction, we would not say that this expense could be lawfully incurred. It might lie advisable for your board to exercise its discretion by allowing some of the claims upon this theory, and to let a test case follow.

Whithnui. Sevretury. Xehriixkn State Poultry Axsn Uiiirohi. Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 2&lt;&gt;th of I)eeeml&gt;ei'. addressed to the attorney general, I will say : First : In my opinion your stockholders are permitted to vote their stock by proxy at all elections held to elect managers or officers of the corporation. The Constitution provides: "The legislature shall provide by law that in all elections for di - rectors or managers of incorporated companies- their stockholders shall have the right to vote in person or by proxy for the number of shares owned by him for as many persons as there are directors or managers to be elected, or to cumulate said shares and give one candidate as many </seg>

Section 5, Article XII, Constitution. There is an exception from the above stated rule in the case of co-operative companies. Second : Unless your articles of incorporation provide that the proxies shall be filed at a specified time previous to the meeting at which they are to be voted, I do not believe such prior filing is necessary. I do not recall any statutory provision which requires it. GWA COUNTY BOARD— MUST APPOINT HIGHWAY COMMISSIONER It is the mandatory duty of a county board to appoint a county highway commissioner. May 5, 1926. Mr. Walter M. t'rcnv, County Attorney. Hasthif/H, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not it is the mandatory duty of the county board to appoint a county highway commissioner. Interpreting the provisions of Chapter 48, page 167, Session Laws, 1923, we conclude that it is the mandatory duty of the county board to appoint some one of the qualified persons men - tioned in the statute as the county highway commissioner. Un - doubtedly the . purpose of the legislature was to see that each count}' had some person who for the salary provided would give adequate attention to this part of the county affairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p103">OPINIONS 103 We do not believe that the legislature intended that the duties of the county highway commissioner and the salary per - taining to that office should be divided among the members of the county board. Such division would doubtless result in little or nothing being accomplished so far as the duties of the office of highway commissioner are concerned. What we have heretofore stated in a measure answers an - other inquiry in your letter as to the salary, if any, to be paid each member of the board acting as highway commissioner in their respective districts without first having been appointed highway commissioner. The statute does not contemplate the appointing of a highway commissioner in each district, but only one for the county as a whole, whose duties and salary are fixed by law. Any compensation to be paid the members of the county board is provided by the provisions of Section 2380, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1922. and it is not contemplated and not lawful, in our opinion for the members of the county board to receive any other compensation than that fixed in con - nection with their duties as members of the board, as recited in the last section quoted. There is, of course, this one exception, where one member is found competent and has been appointed highway commissioner, as provided by Chapter 48, Session Laws, 1023. This appointment should have been made at the first regular meeting of the board. Inasmuch as the county board is given the power of appointment from year to year, we are inclined to believe that if they make such appointment now it would be lawful, particularly if the person qualified and assumed the duties of the office under the appointment.

Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 5th stating that your county is under township organization and you inquire if a member of your county board may receive compensation from the county for any services in excess of the $800.00 allowed and authorized by Section 2389, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. In reply you are informed that Section 2389. supra, provides as follows in part : "Members of the county boards shall each be allowed for the time they shall be necessarily employed in the duties of that office the sum of five dollars per day and ten cents per mile to be paid out of the general fund: provided further, the total maximum amount of com - pensation including mileage and per diem to be paid or drawn by any member of the board, except as hereinafter provided, shall not exceed the following amounts per annum: in counties under township organiza - tion having 25,000 inhabitants and less than 60,000 inhabitants, eight hundred dollars; * * * Provided further, that for each day actually em - ployed in directing road work in his district each member of the county board shall be paid the sum of five dollars per day to be paid out of the road fund of his district." You will note that this section provides a salary of $800.00 for services as county commissioner. There is in addition to this $800.00 the sum of $5.00 per day for services rendered by such commissioner upon the roads in his district. The question now arises where a county commissioner performs services for the county which are necessary in managing the affairs of the county wherein he incurs expenses and railroad fare in going outside of the county, is such official entitled to any additional compensa - tion. Our supreme court has held that where a public official renders services which are neces-sary to such office and which </seg>
            <seg id="p105">OPINIONS 105 services are necessary for the governmental division which selects such officer, that he is entitled to receive all necessary expenses connected in performing such services.

In the last above case it was held : "County commissioners are clothed not only with the powers ex - pressly conferred upon them by statute but they also possess such powers as are requisite to enable them to discharge the official duties devolved upon them by law." Tn conclusion. I would say that from the statement of facts set forth in your favor of the 5th instant your county supervisor would be entitled to $800 salary drawn upon the general fund of the county for his services as such supervisor. In addition he would be entitled to the sum of $5.00 per day and per diem to l)e paid out of the road fund for each day actually employed in directing road work in his district and where such supervisor made trips to Lincoln or other places in connection with the duties of the office he is entitled to l)e fully compensated for all of the traveling expenses connected with such work to be paid out of the general funds of the county.

            <seg id="p106">106 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In your letter of January 27th you state facts which appar - ently indicate that your county fair association would be en - titled to aid from the county. You state that your county board refused to allow you the amount of money provided for by statute and they are trying to cut you off with less, and you ask whether or not they cannot be compelled to pay the full $2,000. Your inquiry is answered by the provisions of Section 6, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. This department has held that it is a mandatory duty of the county board to provide the amounts provided by Section 6, provided the fair association ts fully complied with the conditions precedent to the allow - ce of the county agent. Of course if your board fails or refuses to make an allow - ance and you have complied with the conditions an appeal would lie from an action of the board.

LD COl'XTY FAIR— MORTGAGE OF PROPERTY County agricultural association has no power to mortgage the real estate of the association without sanction of the county board. December 8, 1926.

            <seg id="p107">OPINIONS 107 a 40-acre tract of land. It is desired to borrow moiiey on this land. Can this be done, or must the county board of supervisors be consulted, and whatever they do control?" You do not state whether your county fair association is one organized under the provisions of Section 6, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 10, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1925, or whether it is a county fair organiza - tion under the provisions of Article 10, Chapter 1, beginning with Section .57, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. In the latter event, we believe that it would be absolutely necessary to get favorable action of the county board before a mortgage could be placed upon the tract of land owned by the county fair association. In the event that it is an association organized under the provisions of Section 6 aforesaid, we can find no ex - press authority permitting the association to mortgage the prop - ertv. Section 9 provides that the society shall have power to ac - quire, take, hold and appropriate real estate for the purpose of the fair. It does not expressly provide that the property may be mortgaged. Section 11 provides that in the event of dissolution of the society, the real estate shall go to the county in the event the county has given aid such as is provided for by Section 10. You will note by the provisions of Section 11 that only under certain conditions may the society exchange or dispose of its real estate and then only in the manner provided by Section 11. by appli - cation to the district court and upon due notice.

            <seg id="p108">108 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL COUNTY JUDGES— COMPENSATION County judges are elected for a term of four years and are entitled to the statutory salary for the full term beginning January, 1921. May 19, 192(5. Honorable Vin/il Falloon, County Judge, Fall* City. Xebraska. Dear Sir: Your inquiry relative to the compensation of the county judges beginning in 1920 has received our consideration. The Constitution of Nebraska was amended to provide by Section IS of Article V that in the year 1920, and every four years thereafter, there shall be elected in and for each county one judge who shall be judge of the county court of such county, whose term of office shall be four years, and whose salary shall be fixed by law. The Constitution previously provided only that the county judge should be elected in each count}', and that «* term of office should be two years. Hence the amendment anges the term of office to a term of four years beginning in 1920. and provides that the salary shall l)e fixed by law, that is, by the legislature. The Constitution, therefore, contemplated that the oflice no longer should be a fee office at the expiration of the term of county judges in 1920, but should thereafter be a salaried -office. The Constitution provides, therefore, that the judge of the county court shall receive a salary during that term of office beginning in 1921, and leaves only the amount of the salary to lie fixed. The situation is considerably like that if one employs an - other for a fixed time, the contract to begin at a fixed time and th&lt;" salary to be fixed later. This was the agreement made by the counties under the constitutional authority and those candi - dates who became candidates for county judge in 1920. It is not a question of deciding whether or not the legislature has </seg>
            <seg id="p109">OPINIONS 109 violated any provision of this constitution. Section 6, Article XVII, thus directly required the legislature to fix the salary for the county judges for the full term of four years beginning in 1920. There would then remain only the question whether the act of the legislature, if it attempted to fix a salary relating back to 11)20 would then be a retroactive law. Ordinarily the legislature would not be empowered to pass a retroactive law which would have the effect of increasing the compensation to be paid to an officer. However, such a law in this case would not increase the compensation but would merely be fixing the rate of compensation so that it might be determined how much compensation had been earned by the judges, and would provide the basis of payment for the term of office. Being directly au - thorized by the Constitution and not increasing the compensa - tion or changing the compensation in violation of Section 19 of Article III of the Constitution, it appears that the legislature would have had the right to fix the salary for the full term of office. Indeed having fixed the salaries for a portion of the term it might l&gt;e logically concluded that such salary was the salary for the full term of office inasmuch as the Constitution provides that there shall be no change during the term, the compensation once having been determined by law. Your inquiry is not a new one entirely. May 9, 1921, Clarence A. Davis. Attorney General, wrote the next quoted opinion : "Honorable L. B. Fenner, County Judge. Bvrtcen, Nebraska. Dear Sir: A careful examination of the law relating to county judges has caused this department no little difficulty. In the first place, we are confronted with the strict provision of the Constitution. 'Nor shall the compensation of any public officer, including any officer whose compensation is fixed by the legislature, subsequent to the adoption hereof, be increased or diminished during his term of office.' which provision would seem to be a bar to our present county judges receiving any salary increase whatever. On the other hand, our county </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 judges, under the preceding Constitution, were not paid a salary; in fact the receipt of a salary was specifically prohibited, and they were paid upon the oasis of the fees which they collected. "The present Constitution prohibits them from collecting fees and says they shall receive a salary, so that if they cannot receive the sal - aries designated by House Roll 70, it appears to me they are to be en - tirely without compensation during the term, a condition which the Constitutional Convention could hardly be supposed to have intended in their language. "It therefore has seemed to be advisable to reason it in this manner, that the county judges were without salary prior to January 1, 1921, and that the salary bill passed at the present session is simply a fixing of their compensation; that since their previous compensation was based on fees collected, it cannot be said to have been fixed at all except as to maximum, and therefore the present salary bill fixing a definite amount of salary does not either increase or diminish, but simply fixes a salary; t method of reasoning the soundness of which I personally question, but lich was the method used to convince the Judiciary Committee of both iuses, as well as a good many members of the Constitutional Convention, and knowing full well what was intended by both bodies, and realizing the difficulties that would confront the state if the judges were entitled to no salary at all for the next two years, I am constrained to the opinion that you are entitled to collect the salaries set forth in House Roll 70, beginning as of the date of January 1, 1921." You will note from what the writer has said in this opinion that his conclusions are even more pronounced than those of the former attorney general, in that the writer of this opinion be - lieves that the salary fixed by the term should be salary for the tire term of four years, and the county judges would be en - ed to draw the salary for their term when it was once fixed by the legislature, as the legislature was authorized by the con - stitution to fix the amount of the salary and not the term of the office, and the salary applies during the entire term of the office. The former attorney general in his opinion definitely concluded that the county judges were entitled to be compensated, and concerning this we think there will be no difference of opinion. The abolishing of the payment of fees to the county judge, which in a majority of cases determined the amount of his com - pensation, left the exact compensation of the county judge inde - terminable until the salary was fixed by the legislature after the </seg>
            <seg id="p111">OPINIONS 111 adoption of the Constitution as amended in 1920. The writer of this opinion touched partially upon the matter herein discussed in an opinion written January 26, 1923, to Mr. Julius D. Cronin, county attorney, O'Neill, Nebraska. The portion of the opinion pertinent to this discussion being quoted as follows: "By the provisions of Section 15, Article V, of the Constitution, it is provided that the county judge shall have a term of office for four years, and his salary shall be fixed by law. This changed the former manner of paying the county judge out of the fees of the office: Pursuant to this constitutional provision, the legislature enacted Section 2394 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes, fixing the salary of county judge, which is payable in monthly installments." Of course there may be some question raised inasmuch as Section 2394 recited that the county judges of the several coun - ties should receive the salaries designated for the year 1921 and subsequent thereto, payable monthly. In other words the legis - lature did not make the law retroactive or in force prior to the date of its passage with an emergency clause which made the act in force and effect as of April 14, 1921. Inasmuch as the act provides that the salaries shall be for the full year 1921, it is evident that the legislature made it retroactive for that portion of the year 1021 prior to April 14, so we are of the opinion that the act was valid in H far as it fixed the salaries. That part of the act which attempts to limit the salaries to only the por - tion of the term fixed by the constitution probably will be con - strued as surplusage. In any event it does not seem to us that the legislature would have any right to do more than fix the salary for the term of office and that for the term of office as prescribed by the constitution, and the salary payable to the county judge would be that salary fixed by the legislature and would be payable for the term of office as fixed by the constitu - tion. In view of the foregoing of course the county judges must account for and pay over to the county all fees collected during their term of office. LD </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 COUNTY JUDGE— VACANCIES A vacancy in the office of county judge should be filled at the next gen - eral election. December 11, 1925. Mr. A. J. Bracken, County Judge, C'happell, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to the question you ask in your letter of the 7th instant I will say the statutes provide : "Vacancies occurring in the office of county judge * * * shall be filled by election, but when the unexpired term does not exceed one year the vacancy shall be filled by appointment." Section 2245, Comp. St. 1922. That section was passed when we had annual general elec - tions in Nebraska. I do not think it was the intent of the law - rers that a special election should be held to fill such vacancy, when there is a general election after the vacancy occurs, and before the expiration of the regular term, I take it that the vacancy in strict law should be filled at that election, and that the appointment by the supervisors only holds until it is so filled, and the party elected has qualified. Permit me to add, however, that if none is elected at that time the party appointed holds over, and in any event so long as he is holding under color of title his acts are valid as an officer de facto.

August 13, 192o. Mr. Da rid F. Meeker. Se&lt;rretary to Governor M (Mullen. State Hmtse, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: In your letter of this date you inquire as to the powers of the governor with respect to removal of county judges, county attorneys and county sheriffs. Replying to your communication, permit me to suggest that the governor does not have the power to suspend a county judge, neither do the courts seem to have the power to remove him from office. In the case of Convoy, et ah v. Hallo-well, 94 Neb. 704. 144 X. W. 89;"), our court held that the only method of removing a county judge from office in this state is by im - peachment under the Constitution. The method of impeach - ment is set forth in Section 17. Article III, of the Constitution, which provides as follows: "The Senate and House of Representatives in joint convention shall have the sole power of impeachment, but a majority of the members elected must concur therein. Upon the entertainment of a resolution to impeach by either House, the other House shall at once be notified thereof and the two Houses shall meet in joint convention for the pur - pose of acting upon such resolution within three days of such notifica - tion. A notice of an impeachment of any official other than a Justice of the Supreme Court, shall be forthwith served upon the Chief Justice, by the Secretary of the Senate, who shall thereupon call a session of the Supreme Court to meet at the Capital within ten days after such notice to try the impeachment. A notice of an impeachment of a Justice of the Supreme Court shall be served by the Secretary of the Senate, upon the Judge of the Judicial District within which the Capital is located, and he thereupon shall notify all the judges of the District Court in the state to meet with him within thirty days at the Capital, to sit as a court to try such impeachment, which court shall organize by electing one of its number to preside. No person shall be convicted without the concur- </seg>

No officer shall exercise his official duties after he shall have been impeached and notified thereof until he shall have been acquitted." Authority and provision for the removal of county attor - neys and county sheriffs is found in House Roll No. 451, Chap - ter 116, Laws of Nebraska, 1923, which provides as follows: "The attorney general of the state or a special attorney designated by the governor under the provisions of Sections 3281 and 4832 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, when directed by the governor, shall institute and prosecute quo warranto proceedings in the supreme court against any such county attorney or prosecuting officer, sheriff, police judge, police officer, or police commissioner, mayor or other officer, who holds his office by a vote of the people and during the pendency of such proceedings such officer may by the governor be suspended from performing the duties of his office, and temporary appointment may be made by the governor for the performance of the duties of such office, and if the court shall find that such suspended officer has wilfully failed or refused to enforce any law which it is his duty as such officer to perform, then the court shall render judgment of ouster against such officer and the office shall thereby become vacant." Section 3281, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, among other things, also provides : "He (the governor) shall have the power to suspend any prosecuting or peace officer who shall fail, neglect or refuse to enforce the provisions of this act, and may direct the attorney general or any other prosecuting officer to bring proceedings for the removal from office of any such officer who fails, neglects or refuses to do his duty. And he shall prepare and furnish any and all forms, blanks, blank affidavits, blank statements that are provided for, or are necessary, to properly carry out the provisions of this act."

Roe, Beatrice, Nebraska. Dear Doctor: You ask for an opinion as to whether or not it is the duty of the county physicion to treat the indigent poor in a city the size of Beatrice as well as the indigent poor residing in the county but outside the corporate limits of any city. In answer to your question permit me to say that poor, sick and needy persons residing in the city of Beatrice are as much entitled to the services of the county physician as are persons of the same class residing in other parts of the county. Section 5143, Compiled Statutes, provides among other things, that "The county board may employ a physician by the year to furnish such medical services as may be required by the poor of their county." Prior to its amendment in 1919 the above quoted provisions of statute contained the words "excepting in corporate towns or cities as herein provided." The fact that the words last above quoted were omitted when the section of statute under considera - tion was last amended was significant, I think, of the legislative intention that the poor and needy of cities in the county should not be barred from being attended when in need by the county physicians. . .

You also inquire whether the sheriff is entitled to retain the commission allowed him for judicial sales, or whether he is required to turn them into the county treasury. I will answer the alx&gt;ve questions in the order in which they are asked. (1) I am of the opinion the sheriff when he brings back from another state a party, who has been extradited, is not act - ing necessarily as the sheriff, but merely as the agent of the state; although the sheriff is usually appointed, any one else might be. This being true. I do not think he is paid mileage, but is paid his expenses in conformity with the provisions of Section 10015, Compiled Statutes. This may be either inure or less than mileage would be. (2) I am of the opinion the commissions earned by sheriffs for conducting such sales, as it is their duty under the law, should be turned over to the county treasurer.

            <seg id="p118">118 this department as to whether one who was appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of sheriff of your county a year ago last spring can serve for the full unexpired term of his predecessor or whether he must yield the office to the one who was elected at the last general election to hold the office for the term begin - ning Thursday, January 6, 1927, as soon as the party so elected has filed his official bond and taken the oath of office. Complying with your request I will say that in my opinion the present incumbent can hold the office for the full unexpired term of his predecessor. In making this statement I am assuming the party elected at the last general election was running as a candidate for elec - tion to a full term as sheriff and not as a candidate for election to fill a vacancy. I have in mind, too, the concluding sentence of Section 2245, Compiled Statutes, which reads as follows: "Any person so appointed or elected under the provisions of this section shall hold his office for the unexpired term." GWA COUNTY SUPERVISORS— FILLING VACANCY Vacancy in board of supervisors filled by that body except where the length of the unexpired term requires submission to special election. July 12, 1926. Mr. Edw. J. Lenger, County Clerk, Center, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of July 3rd, asking for an opinion of this de - partment relative to the filling of a vacancy on the board of supervisors, has been received. A member of your board of county supervisors, shortly after his election, resigned, and the remaining members of the </seg>
            <seg id="p119">OPINIONS 119 board appointed a person to fill the vacancy. The third person has filed or attempted to file for the nomination for this office in the ensuing election. This supervisor district is an even numbered district and the ordinary and regular election for that district would be held in 1928. The question, therefore, is whether or not where a member has been appointed more than thirty days prior to the general election, and whose appointment reads "for the unexpired term", actually holds for the full period of the unexpired term, or whether a new supervisor is elected at the next general election. We call your attention to Section 893, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which pertains to the first members of the board after township organization has been effected. This same sec - tion provides: "Any vacancy shall be filled by appointment by the remaining supervisors." In this connection we also call to your attention Section 5834, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 19-22. which provides as follows : "In case the office of county assessor in any county shall become vacant the county board shall appoint a person to fill such vacancy." We call to your attention that the powers of the county board in the above instances appears to be the same, that is, the county board fills the vacancy. Under Section 893. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 192'i, the first question naturally arising is whether or not the legis - lature referred to vacancies in the first or organizing board under township organization. Any doubt in this connection is disposed of by the case of State, ex rel v. Went, 62 Neb. 461, wherein it was held that the power of appointment was vested in the board. This case cites the case of State v. Rankin, 33 Neb. 266. In the latter case it was held that where a vacancy occurs in the office of county attorney it is the duty of the county board to fill the same by appointment, and the appointee shall hold the office until a successor is elected and qualified. This same case held that where a law creating an office specifi- </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 ±^Iz+iKsX\ X \JP ** X X v«*N £j X vjij* ' i-il*Alj cally provides how vacancies occurring in such office shall be filled, such provision, and not the general law on vacancies, Kerns and controls the method of filling vacancies in such •e. It is to be noted, however, in this case that there was a special provision pertaining to county attorneys, providing that the county board should appoint and that said appointee should perform the same duties as the regular county attorneys, and shall hold said office until his successor is elected and qualified. In this same case, in referring to the general statute, filling vacancies, the court said : "This being a general provision applies to all vacancies in public offices, except where the legislature has otherwise specifically provided." We, therefore, do not believe that you should rely too much upon the holding in State v. Rankin, nor the case of State v. West, as those cases do not entirely settle the question before you. State v. Rankin related to the office of county attorney, concerning which there was a special statute designating that the county attorney should be appointed and hold the office until his successor should be elected and qualified. You will note that this language does not appear in Sections 893 nor 5834. refer - ring respectively to supervisors and county assessors. This matter has not been settled to the satisfaction of our- E r es by the decisions of the supreme court but the supreme rt has indicated in the later decisions that it was not en - ily satisfied with the decisions in the case of State v. Rankin. In State v. Fume. 89 Xeb. at page 657, the court saj T s: "vVhile we do not think that, were the questions decided in the latter case (8tate vh Rankin, 33 Neb. 266) before us in the first instance, we would have agreed to all said in the opinion, yet it seems to us that this case is to be distinguished from that one. However, it is our opinion that the general law providing for the filling of vacancies was intended for a regulation for all vacancies, • • • unless full provi - sions were contained in the law creating the office." The statute relating to the office of supervisor does not make full provision and we are inclined to believe that the courts would say that the general laws pertaining to filling of vacan - cies would apply and that the board of supervisors would fill the </seg>
            <seg id="p121">OPINIONS 121 vacancies only until the next general election at which a person might be elected to fill out the unexpired term of two years. In further support of this conclusion we call your attention to the case of State v. Coleman, 91 Nebr. 167, which involved the appointment of a county assessor, and wherein it was held that where a vacancy occurs in the office of county assessor more than thirty days prior to a general election the board of com - missioners is required to fill the vacancy by appointment. In such case the person appointed holds the office until the next general election, at which time his successor should be elected for the remainder of the unexpired term. In this case the court again referred to the case of State v. Raidin, 33 Neb. 2(50. and in considering that case stated : "We are of the opinion that this question should not be ruled by that case. The law relating to county assessors simply provides that in case of a vacancy in that office the county board shall fill such vacancy by appointment. Nothing whatever is said how long the appointee shall hold the office and nothing is contained therein which in any manner conflicts wtth the general provisions of the statutes upon that subject. It therefore follows that this case must be ruled by such general pro - vision." It is apparent that the law pertaining to the filling of vacancies in the office of county supervisor does not state how long he shall hold the office, and in the light of the latter de - cisions heretofore cited we are impelled to the view that the general statute pertaining to the filling of vacancies apply to the office of county supervisor, and that the board would ap - point only until the next general election, at which the vacancy could be filled by election. It is the general policy of the law to permit the people to make their selection of public officials when it can be done and unless the law unmistakably and otherwise provides we think the legislature intended that vacancies should be filled at the next general election, as provided by the general statutes upon the subject. Nor do we believe that it makes any difference that the board in making the appointment recited that it should be for the unexpired term, because the board could act only so far as they were empowered to act. and the statute does not seem to give them the power to fix the term of </seg>
            <seg id="p122">122 the appointee. Wherefore we conclude that a county supervisor should be elected at the next general election to complete the unexpired term, which expires in 1928. LD COUNTY SURVEYOR County surveyors in counties of less than 50,000 are not ex-officio county engineers and are entitled to compensation accordingly. May 15, 1926. Mr. Harcey A. Collins, C aunty Attorney, Pa pillion, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask for an interpretation of Section 5015, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, relative to the question of whether or not it is a mandatory duty of the county to employ the county surveyor in counties of less than 50,000 population to prepare plans and specifications and supervise the construction of all highway improvements. Section 5015 provides that it shall be the duty of the county surveyor to make all surveys within his county that he may be called upon to make. This does not specifically provide that the county surveyor shall make all surveys in the county. This is followed by the proviso that in counties having a population of 50,000 the county surveyor shall be ex-officio county engineer, and it shall be his duty to prepare all plans, specifications, etc. The remainder of this section applies to the duties of the ex - officio engineers in counties having a population of 50,000. Patently this does not refer to or make the surveyor ex-officio engineer in counties having a population less than 50,000. Hence, in counties of the size of yours it would follow the county surveyor is not the ex-officio county engineer and is not the county highway commissioner appointed under the provis- </seg>
            <seg id="p123">OPINIONS 123 ions of Chapter 48, page 167, Session Laws, 1923, amending Section 2802, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. The law last mentioned further sustains our interpretation of Section 5015 in that said Chapter 48 provides for the appointment of a county highway commissioner and provides that in counties having less than 50,000 population that the board shall appoint the county surveyor or member of the county board or other competent person who shall be a practical road builder to act as county highway commissioner; and in selecting said appointee, the county board shall not be restricted to the residents of their county. This section also provides that the county surveyor shall perform all the duties and possess all the powers of a county highway commissioner in counties having a population of 50,000. Thus again confirming our conclusion in the inter - pretation of Section 5015. Section 2808, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that the county highway commissioner shall be the superin - tendent of construction of all roads, bridges, culverts, road ditch improvements and their maintenance, and make plans and specifications, when requested by the county board for all road improvements, bridges and culverts. Under the provisions of the sections heretofore cited we are of the opinion that the county board could hire an engineer not necessarily a resident of the county to act as county highway commissioner and to per - form the duties referred to in your letter. We, therefore, conclude that your county surveyor is not entitled to any per diem or other compensation for services which he has not performed, and not been called upon to per - form, and which are not connected with the office of county surveyor.

He served one year and committed suicide. Miss Emma Bengston was appointed to serve until the next election. I filed in 1920 to served the two year balance of Avery's term. I was elected in 1922 for my first four year term. Is not this case similar to the Dawson county case? An answer by return mail will be appreciated." and 3 r ou inquire whether or not you are eligible to file again. In reply will state that the question is not entirely free from doubt, but in view of the fact that your first election was for the pur - pose of finishing a term or to fill a vacancy in the office and your next election was for the regular term. I am inclined to 1m&gt; - lieve that you would be eligible to file for another term in view of the holding of the court in the case of Dodtton v. Bowlby. 78 Neb. 190. 110 N. W. 698. in which case the court said: "We fully appreciate the difficulty of determining the real intention of the legislature, but believe, on the whole, the conclusion which we have reached is better supported than is the opposite conclusion. As the respondent has not been elected to the office of county treasurer for more consecutive terms than two, the statute in question has not been vio - lated, and he is entitled to hold the office for the present term." I realize that in your instance there was an election instead of an appointment to fill a vacancy for the latter part of a term. However, it is likely the court would hold that the same rule would apply since it was not an election for a complete term. This case is different from another case inquired tibout and in which this office held that where a candidate was elected for a com Diet £ term served m m 1 1 &gt;st *i 1 1 1 i*i 1 ivi rt of t liut term *i ml n*~ </seg>

You merely filled a vacancy for a part of a term and then were elected for a full term, and while as suggested the question is not entirely free from doubt, in view of the decision cited we are of the opinion a court would sustain your filing for another regular term.

Dear Madam : In answer to your letter of inquiry of the "24th instant per - mit me to say that I find nothing in Section 8389, Compiled Statutes, as amended by Chapter 159, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1925, to indicate that County Treasurers may retain the automobile registration fees received by them. You will observe said amended Section 8389 contains among other things the following: "As provided in Section 8337, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended, shall receive five (5c) cents for each original regis - tration as such agent." And as has been pointed out in my former letter, said Sec - tion 8337, as amended, contains the express provision that "Said five cents shall be accounted for as other fees passing through their hands." I mav add that even if Section 8389 contained no reference </seg>
            <seg id="p126">126 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL whatever to Section 8337, I would still be of the opinion these fees should be accounted for in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary. Thus the courts have held that the county clerk must account for his salary earned as clerk of the county board (Mitchell v. Clay County, 69 Neb. 796), although the section of statute providing for such salary does not pro - vide that it shall be accounted for as fees. GWA COUNTY WARRANTS— LIMIT County warrants should not be drawn for any amount exceeding the aggregate of 85 per cent of the amount levied unless there is money in the county treasury to the credit of the proper fund from which they may be paid. April 14, 1926. Mr. W. H. Line, Attorney at Law, Loup City, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Line : You say: "I would appreciate your opinion as to whether the county board may issue warrants in excess of 85 per cent of the levy for the current year there is no money in the treasury to the credit of the fund on which the warrant is drawn, but where during the current year $11,000.00 has been paid into the general fund of the county from miscellaneous fees from the offices of the county clerk, judge and sheriff which $11,000.00 has been used to meet registered warrants constituting a part of the warrants written on the 85 per cent." In answer to your question I will say that Section 862, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides among other things that "It shall be unlawful for the county board of any county in this state to issue any warrants for any amount exceeding the aggregate of eighty-five per cent of the amount levied by tax for the current year, except there, be money in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund </seg>
            <seg id="p127">OPINIONS 127 for the payment of the same." Section 864, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, pro - vides : "Any warrant drawn after eighty-five per cent of the amount levied for the year is exhausted, and where there are no funds in the treasury for the payment of the same, shall not be chargeable as against the county, but may be collected by civil action from the county board making the same, or any member thereof." Construing these two provisions of statute together I am of the opinion that the safe plan to pursue is to not draw war - rants in excess of 85 per cent of the amount levied unless there is money in the treasury with which to pay them. I am not unmindful that these provisions of statute were passed when other conditions obtained regarding the raising of money to pay county expenses and modification of Section 862 may well be made in view of the conditions as they exist at the present time, but the prudent course to pursue, I think, is to have the legislature make the modification. GWA DISTRICT JUDGE— COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE The district judge, who has sentenced a man to jail for a high grade misdemeanor, is not clothed with power to commute such sentence after the man has been committed to jail. Mr. M. F. Stanley, County Attorney, Aurora, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether a district judge who has sentenced a man to jail for a period of one year for a high grade misde - meanor, may after the man has been committed to jail and after the expiration of the term of court at which he was sentenced, October 24, 1925. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL commute the sentence. The question you ask is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court decision upon that point. I am in - clined to the opinion, however, that the law as it now exists does not clothe a district judge with power to commute a sentence under such circumstances. Section 10233, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, reads as follows: "The board of pardons shall have jurisdiction to grant or deny pardons, paroles, commutations, reprieves and the remission of fines or forfeitures. No person shall be released nor shall any fines or forfeitures be remitted under the guise of any other procedure or on the purport of any other document except such as are specifically prescribed in this act." This section was passed in 1921 as a part of an Act, com - plete in itself, which established a state board of pardons. It does not in express terms repeal Section 1001, Compiled Stat - utes, passed in 1917, which reads as follows: "The judges of the district court of the county shall make rules and regulations for the government of said workhouse as they are now re - quired to do for jails, and shall make rules for rewarding prisoners for good behavior, and willingness, and industry, by deduction of time from the sentence, and they shall establish rules for treatment of prisoners who refuse to work diligently, and such other rules as they may deem wise for the general welfare of the prisoners; including the segregation of hardened criminals from others." This section considered alone may be construed to vest au - thority in district judges to commute the sentences of persons serving jail sentences in the counties of their respective districts and it is possible the courts will so hold, but as has been stated before this department is inclined to the opinion that Section 10233, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, controls in such cases. </seg>

May 2f&gt;, 19-26. Mr. Frank P. Corrirk. Lincoln^ Nebraska. Dear Mr. Corrick: You inquire if it be legal to conduct ball games on Me - morial Day, and if such games be prohibited whether such pro - hibition would apply to the day following May 30th in the event May 30th fall on Sunday. In reply to your communication, may I suggest that Section 5)790, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides as fol - lows : "Whoever shall on the thirtieth day of May, commonly known as Decoration Day, engage in horse racing, ball playing, or in any game of sport, which may tend to disturb the public peace, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days or both." I would further suggest that Section 4805. Compiled Stat - utes of Nebraska for 1922, enumerates the various holidays and names among them "The thirtieth day of May, known as Decoration or Memorial Day"; and further provides: "Rut if said days herein be the first day of the week known as Sunday, the next succeeding secular or business day shall be a holiday." While the statute provides that if Memorial Day fall on Sunday the next day "shall be a holiday" it is probable that a court might hold that while ball playing Monday, the 31st, might be contrary to the spirit, it would not be contrary to the letter of the law. It is likely that an amendment should l)e made to the statute so there would be no question about the law </seg>

OSS DENTAL EXAMINERS— PAYMENT OF EXPENSES A member of the Board of Dental Examiners, who in the discharge of the duties of his office is attending a meeting of the National Dental Association, may lawfully be paid his expenses incurred in attend- ing such meeting out of fees received for licenses to practice dentistry. Hon. Lincoln Front, Sen-etary. Department of Public Lincoln, Nebraska. Welfare, Dear Judge : In repayment of per diem and expenses of a member of the State Board of Dental Examiners selected by the said board to attend the annual meeting of the National Dentists' Association, permit me to say that in my opinion such expenses may lawfully be paid out of the fees received for licenses to practice dentistry if in the opinion of the said board of examiners the member selected to attend said meeting is in the discharge of the duties of his office, while so attending. Section 8189, Compiled Stat - utes of Nebraska for 1922, provides among other things that "Out of the funds coming into the hands of said board of dental examiners, as hereinafter provided, each member of said board of dental examiners may receive, as compensation, ten dollars for each day ac - tually spent in attending meetings in the discharge of the duties of his office, and the actual expense of each member of said board of dental examiners in traveling to and from the place of meeting and while at - tending such meeting of said board of dental examiners." And I am informed that for many years the administrative officers charged with the duty ai supervising the execution of the August 10, 192C). </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OPINIONS 131 law providing for the licensing of dentists have construed the phrase "meetings in discharge of the duties of the office" to in - clude meetings of the National Association which a member of the Board of Dental Examiners attends at the request of his fellow members. This fact has some weight in determining the construction to be given at this time to the provision of statute in question for the rule as laid down by the supreme court is that "Long continued practical construction of a statute by the officers charged by law with its enforcement is entitled to considerable weight in interpreting that law." GWA DENTAL SURGEON— PRACTICE OF DENTISTRY DEFINED Where a person performs operations of any kind or treats diseases or lesions of the human teeth or jaw, or attempts to correct irregu - larities thereof, is engaged in the practice of dentistry as defined by our statutes, such person must be regularly licensed by the Depart - ment of Public Welfare. Han. Lincoln Froxt, Secretary, Department of Public Welfare, Lincoln, Xehraxka. Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 12th instant requesting the opinion of the attorney general as to whether or not the fol - lowing statement of facts constitutes a violation of Title VI, Division 4, Sections 8185 et seq.. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922: "Mr. Maxfleld has in his employ a clerk who cleans teeth, using the usual electrical appliances therefor; also instruments for scraping and Rohrer v.

She works on the patient in a room by herself although she is in the employ of Mr. Maxfleld and in a very general way is under his supervision. However, Mr. Anderson tells me that he has witnesses upon whom this clerk worked while her em - ployer was out of the city." In reply, we direct your attention to the following au thorities : Section 8199, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, de - fines the practice of dentistry as follows: "Any and all persons shall be understood to be 'practicing' dentistry, within the meaning of this article, who shall for a fee, salary or reward, paid directly or indirectly, either to himself or to some other person, perform operations of any kind upon, or treat diseases or lesions of the human teeth or jaw, or correct irregularities thereof, or display a sign, or in any other way advertise himself as a dentist; but nothing in this article shall prohibit bona fide students of dentistry from operating in the clinical department of a reputable dental college, or an unlicensed person performing merely mechanical work on inert matter in a dental office or laboratory, or a duly licensed physician from treating diseases I the mouth, or performing operations in oral surgery. But nothing in i provisions of this article shall be construed to permit the perform - :e of dental operations by any unlicensed persons under cover of the name of a regular practitioner of dentistry." That part of the foregoing section which provides "nothing in this article shall prohibit * * * an unlicensed person per - forming merely mechanical work on inert matter in a dental office or laboratory * • * , " is somewhat indefinite. The last sentence of this section, how - ever, seems to prohibit any act which would constitute the prac - tice of dentistry. In the case of State v. Sexton, 37 Wash. 110, 79 Pac. 634, the court held : "Evidence that one who had no license to practice dentistry, clean teeth, examine them, give an estimate of the cost of repairs and sounded and priced them, was sufficient to justify a conviction for 'practicing dentistry without a license."' In the case of State v. McMinn, 118 N. C. 1259 (1261), 24 S. E. 523, the court defined a dentist as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OPINIONS 133 "A dentist is a dental surgeon, one who performs manual or me - chanical operations to preserve teeth, to cleanse, extract, insert or repair them." See also 30 Cyc. 1545. Again, in the case of People v. DeF ranee. 104 Mich. 563, 28 L. R. A. 193, 62 N. W. 709, (712), the court said: "A dentist is one whose profession it is to clean and extract teeth, repair them when diseased, and replace them when necessary, by arti - ficial ones." In the case of State v. Vandershiis, 42 Minn. 129. 6 L. R. A. 115, 43 X. W. 789 (791), the supreme court of Minnesota, in construing a similar statute said : "It is claimed, also, that it discriminates between students of den - tistry, by allowing them to operate upon the teeth and jaws during the period of their enrollment in a dental college and attendance upon a regular, uninterrupted course in such college, and excluding others. The purpose of this provision of the law is apparent. It is to permit to actual, bona fide students the benefits of practical work under an in - structor. But, to prevent evasions of the law by persons practicing the profession under the pretense of being students, the act very properly defines who shall be regarded as students within the clause allowing them to perform operations, or parts of operations. It is open to every student to bring himself within the definition." In Webster's New International Dictionary the author de - fines surgical operation as follows: "Any methodical action of the hand or of the hand with instru - ments on the living body to produce a curative or remedial effect, as in amputation, etc " It is therefore the opinion of the attorney general that any person violates the provisions of Title VI, Division 4, Sections 8185, et seq., Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, who per - forms operations of any kind or treats diseases or lesions of the human teeth or jaw or attempts to correct irregularities thereof unless such person shall have first been duly licensed to practice dentistry or is a bona fide student of dentistry employed in the clinical department of some reputable dental college. It is further the opinion of the attorney general that where </seg>

To the Honorable The Houxe of Representative*, Lincoh), Xehraska. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House Your attorney general has the honor to acknowledge re - ceipt of the O'Malley resolution calling for an investigation of alleged creamery price discriminations. As your honorable body knows this department has been engaged in the struggle against monopoly for nearly two years and it welcomes the expression of your interest in the subject as shown by your resolution. I trust that I may have the hearty co-operation of this House in the collection of competent evidence in the premises. In collecting this evidence it should be borne in mind that before conviction of violators can be secured, the courts require that price discrimination must be accompanied by an intent and purpose to destroy the business of a competitor or competitors. The presumption of guilt raised by the naked difference in price, as provided by Section 3432, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1988, is held to be rebutted in the Omaha oil case by the denial of intent to destroy the business of a competitor, and </seg>

You will note that this law has been so written that parties discriminating may use the very words of the statute to defend themselves with because it says "if they discriminate 'intention - (illij for the purpose of destroying the business of a com pet it or" in any locality, etc." while the bare discrimination in prices be - tween localities is prima facie evidence that they are guilty of unfair discrimination, still the court seemed to hold in the oil case in Omaha that if they come in and swear that they were not discriminating "for the purpose of destroying the business of a competitor." but were merely discriminating "to meet com - petition" that that was sufficient answer and rebutted the pre - sumption and then the burden is upon the state to prove to the hjitisfaction of the court that they intended to destroy the busi - ness of competitors.

One of counsel for the defendants arose and said: "Your Honor. I wrote the amendment to this law and it doesn't mean a thing." Personally, the writer believes the law does mean something and I hope some time to get a decree in one of these matters which will clearly emphasize the intention, or what I believe was the intention of the legislature.

ELECTIONS— DIVISION OF COUNTY Relating to elections held for division of a county. April 23, 1926. Hon. V. T. Heckt, Senator, 10th District, Bloom-field, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You advise that Knox County is contemplating dividing into two counties, that is, a new county is to be organized or erected. Your inquiries are as follows: 1. Is the matter to be submitted upon the ballot of the gen - eral election or is a separate ballot to be used? 2. Does it require a majority of all votes cast at the gen - eral election or a majority of the votes cast on the particular question to carry same? 3. Can a particular community offer to the proposed new county a building for temporary offices for a period of years free of cost, providing the new county is formed as provided by law? Answering your first inquiry will state we have made con - siderable research of the statutes and authorities. Consideration of Section 1940, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, might lead one to believe that the proposition should be submitted </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OPINIONS 145 upon a separate ballot, if it be construed to be an initiative measure. After consideration of the provisions pertaining to the intiative and referendum, and after looking up the defini - tion in Corpus Juris and other works, we have concluded that this is not an initiative measure within the purview of Section 1940 such as to require the use of the separate ballot. It seems to us it is a proposition for the division of the county and the formation of a new county and not the initiative measure con - templated by the statute, such as the enactment of a new law. You will note also that by the provisions of Section 818, it is provided: notice shall be given, the votes canvassed and the returns made as in the case of election of county officers, and the form of the ballot to be used in the determination of such question shall be as fol - lows: 'For new county,' and 'Against new county'." This is an indication that the measure is to be voted upon at the general election in the same manner as the electors vote for the county officers. We therefore conclude that it would be quite proper to place the measure upon the general ballot, for the matter is to be submitted at the general election. (24 Neb. 40.) Answering your second inquiry we will say that the pro - visions of Section 819 are that the proposition shall carry by **♦ * * a mainritv nf all thp vrrfpR past at anv snrh pleotinn in the "♦ » • a majority of all the votes cast at any such election in the county interested. • * *" This does not restrict the consideration to the votes cast upon the measure. Section 2 of Article IX of the Constitution also provides: "No county shall be divided unless approved by a majority of the qualified electors of each county voting thereon." While this provision seems to apply to the division of a county where two counties are involved, nevertheless it is an indication that the territory of the county shall not be changed unless approved by a majority of the electors voting at the election.

ELECTIONS— NON-POLITICAL BALLOT— REGENTS' FILING FEE It is necessary for a person to become a candidate for regent of the State University upon the non-political ballot that such person shall pay a filing fee of $10 and obtain the receipt of the county treasurer of the county in which such person resides before he can become a candi - date for such office. February 26, 192G. t William H. Hews, nty Attorney. Gering, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Heiss: We have your favor of the 18th instant directing our at - tention to Sections 2113 and 2116, Compiled Statutes of 1922, and requesting the opinion of the Attorney General as to whether or not a filing fee is required of candidates for regents of the state university. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">OPINIONS 147 In reply we direct your attention to that part of Section 2113. Compiled Statutes of 1922, which reads: "No filing fee shall be required from candidates for regents of the state university or presidential electors." This statute was passed by the legislature at the 1907 ses - sion. Section 2106 provides for the election of judges of the supreme court, judges of the district court, superintendent of public instruction and regents of the university upon a non - political separate ballot, and in part reads: "All persons who are candidates for such position shall also file with said affidavits a receipt for the sum of $10.00 signed by the county treas - urer of the county in which such person resides, said amount to be used to help defray the expense of said primary." This section of the statute was first enacted at the 1913 ses - sion of the legislature and has been subsequently amended. The original act was Senate File No. 352, Chapter 96, page 247, Session Laws of 1913, and only provided for the election of judges of the supreme court, judges of the district court and county judges on a non-political ballot. The title of the act provided : "An Act providing for the non-partisan nomination election, of ju - dicial officers and to repeal all acts and parts of acts in conflict with the provisions of this act." Section 1 of the act as it has been subsequently amended now appears as Section 2166, Compiled Statutes of 1922. Section 2 of the act as amended now appears as Section 2107, Compiled Statutes of 1922. Section 3 of the act as it has been subsequently amended now appears as Section 2168, Compiled Statutes of 1922. Section 1 of the act was the repealing clause which provides : "That all acts, and parts of acts, in conflict with the provisions of this act, be and the same are hereby repealed." At the 1917 session of the legislature the original act was amended by House Roll 23 to extend the non-political ballot to the election of state superintendent, county superintendents and </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL regents of the state university, and Section 1 of the original act was further amended to provide: "All persons who are candidates for such positions shall also file with said petitions and affidavits a receipt for the sum of ten dollars signed by the county treasurer of the county in which such person re - sides, said amount to be used to help defray the expense of said pri - mary." The title of this act provided that the original sections were to be amended and to repeal the original sections. Section 2 of this act repealed the original section. The question arises as to whether or not that part of Section 2112, Compiled Statutes of 1922, providing that no fee should be re - quired for candidates for regents of the state university, has been repealed by implication. In the case of State v. Herelone, 92 Neb. 748, 139 X. W. 639, the supreme court in stating the law applicable to the repeal of statutes by implication held : "It is firmly established in this jurisdiction, by a long line of deci - sions, that where an act complete in itself is repugnant to, or in conflict with, a prior law, which is not referred to nor in express terms repealed by the later act, the earlier statute will be construed to be repealed by implication. Emails v. White. 4 Neb. 353; Jones v. Davis, 6 Neb. 33; State v. Whittenmore. 12 Neb. 252; Zimmerman v. Trude. 80 Neb. "503; Allan v. Kennard. 81 Neb. 289." It is therefore the opinion of the attorney general that Section 210(5 as enacted by the legislature has by implication repealed that part of Section 2113, Compiled Statutes of 1922, which provides that no fee shall be required of candidates for regents of the university, and it is necessary that such candidate for regent of the state university shall also file with the officer whose duty it is to issue the certificate of election, a receipt for the sum of $10.00 signed by the county treasurer of the county in which said person resides, before the name of such person as a candidate for such office shall be placed upon the non-political ballot at the primary election. </seg>

February 19, 1926. Mr. C. B. Wooteey, Beatrice, Nebraska. Dear Sir You inquire as to the election and qualification of a police magistrate in Beatrice where the city election is held on the even instead of the odd numbered years, especially in view, of the 1025 law which provides that police magistrates in cities the class of Beatrice should be elected at the spring election in 192") iind every odd numbered year thereafter. In reply will state that the difficulty of applying the statute, when you have no city election during the odd numbered years is apparent. You cannot comply with this statute unless the date of your city election be changed to the odd numbered years, or unless the statute be modified. However, the public welfare demands such officer, and in view of the fact that the plain intent of the legislature was to have a police magistrate elected at the general city election when the other municipal officers are elected, and while this question is not free from doubt in the absence of a court decision, it is my opinion that a broad in - terpretation of the statute would justify the election of a police magistrate at the general city election this year. I would sug - gest, however, that the notice of election call for the election of a police magistrate, and that nominations l)e made and an elec - tion be held for the office of such magistrate in the same form and manner that the other officers are elected. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 If a police magistrate be elected in such manner at such election in my opinion he would be at least a de facto if not a de jure officer, and would be justified in qualifying as such officer and performing the duties of the office during the term or unless or until a court of competent jurisdiction holds to the contrary. ELECTIONS— PRIVATE PERSONS NOT TO PAY EXPENSE OF Private corporations should not pay or agree to pay expenses of munici - pal elections held for the purpose of disposition of public utilities. November 30, 1920. Mr. William Madgett, IlaxthKjx, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask the opinion of this department as to whether or not it is lawful for a corporation to send their agents into municipalities owning their own water, light, heating and ice plants and for such agents to deposit with the public officials from $500 to $5,000 for election expenses, and that thereupon me public officials agree to sell the public utilities aforesaid to the corporation for a specific amount agreed upon between the agent and the said officials and providing the election carries and that no other bid is to be considered. In response will say that this department could not approve such procedure. Section 2321, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska while not exactly covering this situation, nevertheless s prohibit corporations from contributing to the election officials, etc., at least in spirit, it is in point.

Neither do we believe that the public officials and the corporation can dispose of the property of the city by any means which prevents the city from obtaining the l&gt;est price obtainable. LI) ELECTION— PUBLICATION OF NOTICE Where the question of raising money is submitted to a vote of the elec - tors of a county, the notice of the election should be published for four full weeks. October 4. 192ti. Mr. M. F. Stanley, ( ovn ty A ttovney. Aurora, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Section 85(5. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. provides that where it becomes necessary to submit to a vote of the electors of a county the question of raising money for some county purpose the notice of the election shall be published "for four weeks in some newspaper published in the county." </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the case of State v. Cherry County, 58 Neb. 734, the supreme court in construing the above quoted provision of statute held : "the word 'for,' as employed in said section, means 'during,' and the no - tice must be published for, or during, four weeks before the day of elec - tion. Four full weeks must elapse between the date of the first publica - tion and the day fixed for the election." As to the force and effect of the word "for'' in such a con - nection see also State v. Hanson. 80 Neb. 737. I am of the opinion, therefore, that the statute requires such a notice to be published for four full weeks before the election, and that a notice for a shorter period of time does not comply with the statute. Where, however, there is a full vote on the question it has been held that a failure to publish notice for the required time Kan irregularity that will not invalidate the election. Thus it s been said : "In ordering an election on the question of the re-location of a county seat, thirty days notice is required. But even if the notice be for a less time than this, a court of equity will not, for this reason alone, declare the election void at the suit of a party who participated therein, especially where it is not shown that a different result would probably have been obtained if the full statutory notice had been given." Ellis v. Karl, 7 Neb. 382. Similarly in a comparatively recent case the supreme court of this state held : "Where it appears that the election, held for the purpose of authoriz - ing the issuance of bonds to raise money for the construction and equip - tt of a school building, was generally attended by the voters in the 'let, and that considerably more than a majority of all the voters in the district voted in favor of the bonds, held that a posting of notices, though not in compliance with a statutory provision requiring publica - tion, would not invalidate the election, it being manifest that, had all the electors in the district voted, the result of the election could not possibly have been changed." </seg>

W. 121, in which it said : "The fact that the county clerk published the first notice of a local option election four days short of the period prescribed by Comp. Laws 1897, par. 5417, did not invalidate the election, where it appeared that few, if any, electors did not vote the proposition, that the issue was dis - cussed throughout the territory, and that a majority of all the voters voted for prohibition."

HomermUe •/. W. Keifer, Jr. Bogtwick, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to the question you ask in your letter of the 27th instant. I will say that in counties having an election commis - sioner, that is to say in counties having n population of 150.000 or more, the law provides: "No person shall be appointed a judge or clerk of election who is a candidate for office at such election, or who is in the public employ in any capacity." Section 2257. Compiled Statutes. 1922 I know of no such provision that is applicable to counties with less than 150.000 population, and in the absence of any such provision a candidate for office may legally serve as a member of the election board in my opinion. </seg>

GWA ELECTIONS— SAMPLE BALLOTS Sample ballots should not be indiscriminately distributed. I.V. Frasier, Editor and Publisher, Frasier Publishing Company, uneta, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Chapter 74. page '212. Session Laws of Nebraska for 1923, provides that no person other than the county or municipal clerk or election commissioner shall print or cause to be printed or distributed any ballot or ballots marked "'official ballot" nor shall any person except said officers pjjjnt or cause to be printed or distributed, any ballot or ballots upon white paper. A pen - alty is provided for violation of this section. This section prohibits the printing and distributing of any ballot or ballots upon white paper which would seem to include tnple ballots, except by the officers aforesaid. Therefore, you ve no right to print any sample ballot upon white paper for any other persons than those heretofore named. Section 1948, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. provides that at the top of the ballot printed by the municipal or county clerk, shall appear the words "official ballot" and "sample ballot" as the case may be. Section 1953, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, pro - vides that where no newspaper is published in the county or October 25, 1926. </seg>

The foregoing sections indicate to us that no persons other than those authorized by law are entitled to have published or distribute sample ballots, and then only upon the red or green paper and in limited number as specified by the statute except as heretofore stated as to the county or municipal clerk. Inas - much as the number of sample ballots which may l&gt;e published and distributed is limited. I do not believe that any person would have the right to have printed and promiscuously dis - tributed sample ballots. While this question lias not been definitely decided by the courts, we feel that we cannot approve the printing and distribution of sample ballots except by those expressly authorized so to do. The foregoing is the personal opinion of the writer and of course the matter is not entirely free from doubt until decided by the courts inasmuch as the statute does not expressly carry a prohibition. LI) VACANCY IX NOMINATION FOR A NON-PARTISAN OFFICE The non-partisan ballot law does not provide for nomination of candi - dates by petition for the office of county judge, except where such vacancy occurs as to some person duly nominated on a non-political county ticket. September 30, 1926. Mr. K. E. Stan ton. County Attorney, Stromsbury. Xebravka. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 Dear Sir: You said the late Judge Ball died in your county after the primary election; that his death left a vacancy in the office of county judge, and that the vacancy has been filled by appoint - ment. You inquire whether a successor to Judge Ball should be elected at the ensuing November election or whether the present incumbent of the office by appointment holds office until his suc - cessor is elected at the November election in 1928. The correct answer to your question is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court opinion upon the point involved. I am inclined to the opinion, however, that the appointee is entitled to hold the office until his successor is elected in 1928, and that the county clerk will be justified in declining to put flie names of candidates for that office upon the official ballot to be voted for at the ensuing November election. I base this opinion largely upon the case of State ex rel Olenon v. Minor, reported in 105 Neb., at page 228 thereof. In that case the question of filling a vacancy in the office of judge of the supreme court was involved. The vacancy occurred April 18, 1920, and it was filled by appointment on April 21, 1920. The official term of the judge whose death created the vacancy would not have expired until January, 1923. The Constitution at that time provided that in case of a vacancy in the office of supreme judge, a successor shall be elected for the unexpired term at the first general election that occurs more than thirty days after the vacancy shall have hap - pened. The legislature held, however, that this provision was not self -executing and that "When a vacancy is created in the supreme court by death, resigna - tion, or otherwise, so recently before the primary election that sufficient time does not remain to nominate candidates to be voted for at the gen - eral election to fill the vacancy, the appointee named by the governor to fill the vacancy is entitled to hold the office until a successor is regularly nominated and elected pursuant to the provisions of the non-partisan judiciary law." </seg>
            <seg id="p157">OPINIONS 157 In the instant case the non-partisan ballot law does not provide for the nomination of candidates by petition for the office of county judge to be voted for at the general election in November except in cases where "A vacancy shall occur as to any person duly nominated on a non - political county ticket," and that is not this case. If there had been a person duly nominated at the primary election for the office of county judge and a vacancy had occurred as to that nomination, a different question would be presented. In such a case the vacancy could be filled by petition in conformity with the provisions of Section 21(58, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. (JAVA GAME AND FISH— .JURISDICTION OF GAME WARDEN The jurisdiction of a deputy game warden on a border stream extends to the middle of the tread of the stream. Mr. Frank B.

GAME AND FISH— LICENSES There is lawful authority for issuing hunting and fishing licenses. January +. 1926, Mr. L. H. McKUMp, County Attorney, Seward, Nebraska. You request our opinion as to whether or not there is any authority for issuing hunting and fishing licenses under the present law, and if so what department or persons issue the licenses. The question is raised because of the repeal of Chap - ter 96, Session Laws, 1919. We call your attention to Section 7337, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, defining "department". In places where the word "department" is used in connection with licenses, it means the Department of Agriculture, its deputies, assistants or em - ployees. Section 7370, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides : "Any person, firm or corporation, authorized by the Department of Agriculture to sell hunting, fishing or trapping licenses shall be entitled to collect a fee of ten cents." </seg>
            <seg id="p159">OPINIONS 159 Section 7381, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 19±2. provides that licenses may be revoked by the department. Consideration of these three sections we believe justifies our conclusion that the Department of Agriculture and those per - sons duly appointed by it may sell the licenses. LD GAME AND FISH— LICENSE TO ALIEN A license for hunting and fishing may be issued to an alien under Sec - tion 7374 (b), Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, but Section 9836 prohibits his use of firearms while operating under such license. February 24. 1925. Hon. •/. C. Jenkins, Chief Game Warden Lincoln. Xehr. Dear Sir: In answer to your oral inquiry as to whether a license for hunting and fishing may be issued to an alien will state that in my opinion there is authority for same. Permit me to call your attention to Sections 7372 to 7374, inclusive, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1022, which provide among other things, as follows: "The price of such license shall be * • * 7374 (b) To any person over 16 years of age, who is not a citizen of the United States. $15.00, provided that no alien be permitted to hunt or fish for game protected or unprotected without first procuring the proper license." I am mindful of Section 9836 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1022, passed by the same session of the legislature that enacted the above mentioned sections, and which reads, as follows : "ALIENS, FIREARMS FORBIDDEN. It shall be unlawful for any alien to own, keep or have in his possession firearms of any character or for any purpose whatsoever." </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 jvil* rUri i. Ur Al 1 Urt^ ti i LiCjrSiliiVAlj The latter section, however, in no way prohibits the issu - ance of a license to an alien for the purpose of hunting and fishing. The statute prevents him from having in his possession a firearm of any character at any time, and would prevent him from the use of such firearm while hunting. The use of imple - ments other than firearms by aliens while hunting would not be prohibited by this section. In fairness to the alien applicant for license, it might be well to call his attention to the pro - visions of the last named section. GAME AND FISH— LICENSE NOT NEEDED FOR MINORS A resident of Nebraska, who is under sixteen years of age, is not re - quired to have a license to trap game animals during the open season. Mr. J. C. Jenkins, State Game Warden Lincoln, Nebraska.

I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. I am of the opinion that a resident of Nebraska who is under sixteen years of age does not need a license to trap game animals during the open season for such animals. 2.

You will note that the package containing such green hides when same are received for shipment should bear the name of the consignee. It is possible that when the consignee is under sixteen years of age and has no license, an affidavit to that effect will be held by the courts to be equivalent to the number of the license, but the safe way in such a case so far as the carrier is concerned is to have the hides shipped in the name of some one who has a license. GWA GAME AND FISH— DISPOSAL OF LICENSE MONEYS Memorandum opinion relative to disposition of hunting and fishing licenses imposed by State authority and collected by authority of the State Treasurer delegated to County Treasurers. The question involved is whether or not license moneys re - ceived for the issuance of licenses to hunt and fish under a state law may l)e applied to the G«M and Fish Commission, or whether such license moneys must be paid into the school fund. Section 5 of Article 7 of the New Constitution of the State of Nebraska provides as follows: "All fines, penalties, and license moneys, arising under the general laws of the state, shall belong and be paid over to the counties respec - tively, where the same may be levied or imposed, and all fines, penalties and license moneys arising under the rules, by-laws, or ordinances of cities, villages, towns, precincts, or other municipal subdivision less than a county, shall belong and be paid over to the same respectively. All such fines, penalties and license moneys shall be appropriated exclusively to the use and support of the common schools in the respective subdivi - sions where the same may accrue." </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 Section 41 of Chapter 190, Article 4. at page 485 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919 provides that it is unlawful for any resident of the state to hunt or fish without having first pro - cured a license as provided in that section. The following snc - tion provides for the payment of the license fee. Section 4&lt;&gt; following provides that the state treasurer shall charge for and collect in advance for services required by this article, which shall be disposed of as hereinafter provided. For license to hunt and fish in this state issued to non-residents, $10.00; for each license issued to a resident of this state, $1.00; fishing license only to non-residents, $2.00. Section 40 next following provides that all moneys derived from licenses and permits issued pursuant to this article, shall by the state treasurer be paid over for the use of the school fund of the state. Section "&gt; of Article VII of the New Constitution specifi - cally refers to fines, penalties and license moneys arising under the rules, by-laws or ordinances of cities or other municipal sub- Eisions less than a county and provides that gtirh fines, pen - es and license moneys shall be appropriated exclusively to use and support of the common schools in the respective sub-division where the same may accrue. This is a direct pro - «&gt;ion for the use of funds collected in such subdivision less an counties. Nothing is said in this section concerning the collection of licenses imposed by state law and covering sub - divisions of a county or more. In the case of State ex rel Steven* v. Niekernon, 97 Nebr. 837, it was argued that the license moneys arising from the state law shall l)e distributed in the respective counties where the licenses were collected. In that case at page 839, it is stated that the license tax is imposed by the state without reference to any county, and following this statement it states that the Constitution does not specifically forbid the imposition of a license by the state at large. The legislature was constitutionally free to provide by what authority the licenses in question should be imposed upon those desiring to hunt and fish. The constitu- </seg>

It does not forbid the state itself to impose a license and direct how such money shall l&gt;e used for the l&gt;enetit of the schools. The legislature can ettlUM such general powers as are not for - bidden by the Constitution: The fines, penalties and license Money arising under the general laws of the state, mentioned in the first part of Section 5 of Article VII of the Constitution, refers to fines, penalties and license moneys which shall !*■ paid over to the counties where the same may be levied or imposed. There is no levy or imposition by the counties in the question at issue. It is the general law of the state that it is a collection of state funds for state purposes, and we take it that the legislature having general powers in the premises with no specific conflict of authority contained in the Constitution, would have the right and power to fix the license and designate the disposition of the funds arising from such collection, as the Constitution does not con - template that all licenses levied otherwise than by the sub - divisions of the state should l&gt;e segregated for any particular purpose.

LB GAME AM) FISH— PRESERVATION— CARTER LAKE The State may, in the discretion of the Department of Agriculture, take necessary action to preserve the fish in state stocked waters of the state. July 3, 1926. To 11 ix Excellency, Adam M (Mullen, Governor of the State of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Sir: Some days ago the writer met with you, the secretary of the Department of Agriculture, the city attorneys of the City of Omaha, and a delegation of the citizens of the City of Omaha, </seg>
            <seg id="p165">OPINIONS 165 in a conference, wherein was considered the question of the right of the state, as a matter of law, to replenish the diminishing waters in Carter Lake. Carter Lake is a lake greater than ten acres in extent, con - sisting of about four hundred and eighty acres according to our information, and that part of the shore line lying within the State of Nebraska is entirely within the city limits of Omaha and constitutes a part of a public park. According to the facts presented it appears that the waters of the lake have fallen a number of feet and to such an extent that the citizens of Omaha are of the opinion that the lake will go dry unless the waters are replenished. In order to replenish the waters it was suggested that a conduit be built, extending from the Missouri River to Carter Lake. The principal question presented to the attorney general's department for consideration was whether or not the State of Nebraska, through its Department of Agriculture and the ap - propriations for the propagation, conservation and preservation of fish, could take any steps relative to Carter Lake. The legislature has delegated broad powers to the Depart - ment of Agriculture relative to the propagation, distribution, conservation and preservation of fish, in public waters of the state. During the conference, and because of the facts pre - sented, and the statements of the city attorney, together with our own ideas of the law upon the subject, we became convinced that the public at present have the right to fish in Carter Lake and that the waters of Carter Lake constitute public waters sufficiently under the control of the state to permit the state to exercise those powers which have been delegated by the legisla - ture to the Department of Agriculture relative to fish. "The public property of a municipal corporation, real and personal, or in other words, such property as is held in trust for the public gen - erally, is subject to the control of the legislature. It has been so held, for example, of public streets, squares, parks and promenades, public buildings." 28 Cyc. 298-299. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 REPORT OP .'-"AVX0RXEY GENERAL "Property dedicated to the municipality for public parks and squares is not subject to sale or conveyance by it, but property, pur - chased by a city for such purpose may be converted, to other uses or sold or conveyed by the city under a general power of alienation." 28 Cyc. 624. "When duly authorized by the state a municipality may irrevocably dedicate any of its general property to a particular public use." 28 Cyc. 625. Conditions might change as to the public rights in and about the Nebraska shore line of Carter Lake by reason of sale of the property by the city. To preserve the public rights, therefore, there should be made by the City of Omaha an ex - press irrevocable dedication to the public of the right of fishing in Carter Lake together with freedom of access across the land bordering the shore of the lake belonging to the city. Such action as to Carter Lake, and like dedications as to other lakes, would lay a foundation for legislative action looking toward improvements of the lakes of the state, if the legislature deems it wise to take such action. Carter Lake was originally a part of the Missouri River, and became a lake by reason of the sudden change in the course of the river. Question has arisen as to the extent of the juris - diction of the Federal government over its waters. The inter - ests of the United States largely depend upon whether or not the lake constitutes navigable waters used or usable in com - merce. We see no conflict with the state's exercise of its au - thority over fishing and the exercise of federal powers even if the lake is navigable. "In so far as navigable waters are within the territorial limits of a State without regard to whether they do or do not connect with waters outside such limits, it has exclusive jurisdiction, subject to the para - mount right of Congress to regulate commerce, to legislate concerning the use thereof."

It is our opinion that the state, through its proper depart - ment and officers, acting under delegated power, may take such means, acting reasonably in the premises, as may be necessary for the propagation, conservation, distribution and preservation of fish. The matter of preservation of the fish presents for determination of the officers charged with the duty the question of whether or not an emergency has arisen such as to require the expenditure of such funds for the purpose designated by the state. The determination of the necessity for the expenditure is therefore a matter for the exercise of reasonable discretion by those charged with the duty of carrying into effect the provis - ions of the statute.

LD GAME AND FISH— PROTECTION OF BLACKBIRDS Conviction of any person, protecting his life or health or property by shooting or destroying black birds, is doubtful. September 25, 1926. Mr. Frank B. O'Connell, State Game Warden, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. O'Connell: In your letter of inquiry of September 22nd you say : "Several appeals have been made to this office to issue permits to kill blackbirds which gather in large flocks at certain points. It is claimed that these birds litter the premises to the extent that it is damaging to property and detrimental to health. A typical case is cited in the attached correspondence. "The state law protects all song and insectiverous birds in the fol - lowing section: "It shall be unlawful: For any person to shoot, kill, destroy or catch, or attempt to shoot, or kill, destroy or catch, or have in posses - sion, living or dead, any song insectiverous or non-game seed eating bird, or part of such bird, other than an English sparrow, crow, Cooper's hawk, sharp shinned hawk or pigeon hawk." "An opinion is requested as to whether or not under the general law this officer would have the right to issue a permit and allow these birds to be destroyed, where in the opinion of the Department these birds were actually a menace to health and damaging property." </seg>
            <seg id="p169">OPINIONS 169 In reply may I suggest that blackbirds, while not spe - cifically named in the section quoted, which is a part of House Roll 48, Chapter 6, page 96, of the Laws of Nebraska for 1923, would seem to come under the head of "insectiverous or non - game, seed eating birds," and therefore protected by said statute. Since they are so protected I doubt the authority of an officer to issue a permit to destroy these birds. I doubt, how - ever, the possibility of convicting any one of the offense of kill - ing blackbirds if they were able to prove that the birds when so killed were seriously endangering the health or the life of the person or persons killing same.

LD TRADING STAMPS Section 9821, Compiled Statutes, has been held unconstitutional insofar as it forbids the giving of trading stamps. September 17, 1925. Hon. Henry J. Beal, County Attorney, Omaha. Nehraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the lGth instant, permit me to say that Section 9821 does in terms forbid the giv - ing of prizes for the purpose of making a sale of any article. Said section, however, has been held unconstitutional so far as the forbidding of giving trading stamps is concerned. (See State ex rel v. 8pei-ry d' Hvtchinson Company. 94 Neb. 785.) I am of the opinion that by a parity of reason the court would hold that sales made in conformity with the plan out - lined in the advertisement furnished by you would not be held illegal. In other words, I am of the opinion that a seller of goods may give other articles as prizes for the purpose of mak - ing the sale so long as there is no element of chance involved in the giving.

Spirt,; Neligh, Nebraska Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 1st instant I will say that if you are running a grain elevator or grain warehouse I am of the opinion that you are required to obtain a license each year to carry on your business. Section 7225. Compiled Statutes. 11)22 Ed., provides among other things: "Every public warehouseman handling grain shall each year file application with the state railway commission for license to do business under the terms of this act. Said application shall set forth the location of the grain elevator or grain warehouse, its relation to railroad track - age, its capacity, its general plan and equipment, its ownership, the amount of grain handled through it during the previous year and to what extent the same was used for storage purposes. The application shall be accompanied both by a bond running to the State of Nebraska for an amount equal to the full value of all grain likely to be held in storage at any one time, and by a receipt from the state treasurer show - ing payment of the annual license fee of two dollars for each warehouse to be operated. The warehouseman shall be liable on his bond for all loss and damage, of whatever nature, except loss due to changes in mar - ket value or acts of God, to all grain held in storage in his public ware - house." Section 7224. Compiled Statutes. 1922, provides among other things : •. ; . "Any grain elevator or grain warehouse (other than at terminal points — which terminal points shall be designated by the state railway commission) in which grain is held in storage for a period longer than ten days is hereby declared a public warehouse within the meaning of this act, and any grain which has been received at any grain elevator or grain warehouse for which payment has not been made within ten days after the receipt of the same is hereby deemed to be held in storage." </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL And Section 7231, Compiled Statutes, provides among other things: "The owner or operator of any grain elevator or warehouse in the state violating the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a mis - demeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not less than fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars and in addition thereto shall be liable for any damages arising to any person from said violation. It is hereby made the duty of the attorney general, or of any county attorney, upon request of the state railway commission to assist in the prosecution of any such violations." It seems reasonably clear then that if your company is functioning as a grain elevator or grain warehouse it is re - quired to have a license to carry on such business. On the other hand, if it is engaged in the milling business exclusively and all grain stored by you is purchased and stored for the purpose of being ground in your mill, I am of the opinion that a purchase on the terms outlined in your letter, to-wit: payment to be made in the future and at the current price on a day to be named in the future by the seller, is valid and that you may lawfully issue a receipt for grain so pur - chased in the following form: "CONTRACT FOR RECEIPT AND PURCHASE OF GRAIN "We hereby acknowledge receipt of the following grain from , which grain we have purchased from you and for which we agree to settle with you at the market price of this grade of grain on the day you want to settle."

The first question is: At whose option is grain stored in a public warehouse deliverable at a terminal market? The form of receipt is somewhat ambiguous. The matter is, of course, governed by the terms of the statute. Section 7229, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. provides in part as follows : "In case terminal delivery of grain is demanded, the warehouseman shall forthwith issue and deliver to the owner or his order a surrender receipt, which shall conform to the receipt issued for the grain under section 5 of this act (7228), making such grain deliverable in its net amount at any terminal market in the state designated by the owner of said receipt on the same line of railroad." Under the section quoted, the owner of the grain has the option and not the warehouseman. The second question is: Would the modification of the re - ceipt be legal if it be stamped or written upon the receipt that the grain will be delivered either at the warehouse to which the grain was hauled or at, say, Omaha or Kansas City, at the option of the elevator operator who was storing the grain for the owner? It is the opinion of this department that such an attempted modification would be without legal effect. The statute provides for the delivery of the grain and an agreement contrary thereto would not he valid. HL </seg>

Your inquiry is whether or not the assessor may legally demand the names of all parties storing grain with you and the amount stored by each.

May Id, 19-25. Mr. L. E. Adams, Highway t'ommixirioner, Douglas County, Omaha. Nebraska. Dear Sir: Answering your letter of May 7th, pertaining to the re - spective duties of a county highway commissioner and the county board, we will say : 1. That we believe it is the duty of the county board to purchase road equipment for the county. The county board may request the recommendation of the highway commissioner, but we believe that the duty is incumbent upon the county board acting as a board, and not as individuals. . (See Sections 2714, 2656» Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1!&gt;22.) We think the bills should be paid in the ordinary routine prescribed for payment of claims against the county. 2. We believe that the county board should leave to the county highway commissioner the matter of directing the work on the highways, as it is the duty of the highway commissioner </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 to oversee such work. The general Control, government and supervision of the public roads and bridges is in the county highway commissioner, under the direttion of the county board. (See Sections 2802. 2803, 2804 and 2&amp;)8, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922.) 3. We believe that the county highway commissioner should act under the authority and direction of the county board, and that they may delegate to him the right to hire or discharge men, but that his actions are at all times subject to the direction and approval of the county board. 4. We do not believe that there is any difference as to what road is involved, as we think all roads of the county are rer the direction of the county board and as they may direct county highway commissioners.

Legislature should enact a law per - taining to this subject. Mr. ('. H. Ommen, Lodge Pole, Xebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter directed to Governor McMullen has been re - ferred to this department for response. Our statutes do not contain any penalty for permitting live stock to graze along the public highways. However, we do have laws upon the subject of estrays and trespassing animals. Male animals in any event are not permitted to run at large and may May 14, li)2(&gt;. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OPINIONS 177 be taken up as provided by Section 107, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. Of course the owner of live stock, permitting the stock to graze along the highway, must do so at his own risk as to the injury of the live stock and also he might be liable for damages if some person should be injured on account of damage done by the live stock either to property or person. This, of course, would depend upon the circumstances. It would not be surprising if the legislature passed a law prohibiting live stock from being upon the public highway ex - cept when being driven to and from a specific destination. The section which we cited, and other sections in the same chapter, pertain to the subject of taking up estrays and tresspassing live stock. These sections are too many to permit copying.

Dear Sir: You inquire as to the liability of the counties for accidents which might occur on highways since the maintenance of the federal aid highways has been taken over by the state under the provisions of Chapter 158, Session Laws of Nebraska, lt&gt;2;"&gt;. You will note that the Act last mentioned makes it the duty of the department of public works to maintain the whole </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 of the state highway system; including bridges, and in carrying out such work of maintenance, the department of public work* is authorized to contract with the county boards and supervisor* for the maintenance^ Upon the face of the statute it would appear that the legis - lature intended to take from the county the burden of main - taining federal aid highways. However, there are many other sections of the statutes pertaining to the duty of the counties and their officials and the maintaining of the highways of the county, and. inasmuch as these sections are not expressly re - pealed, and the duty of the county and the department of public works might be construed as being a matter of cooperation, it is possible, and in fact probable, that the courts would hold that the sections not expressly repealed are not repealed by implicn - t&gt;n. This would indicate that all the sections still in force and ect are cumulative in their effect, and that the counties still ve some duties to perform in connection with the federal aid highways. For instance, if for some reason the department of public works did not properly maintain a federal aid highway, and the county authorities should have notice and knowledge of a seri - ous defect therein, and some person be injured, it does not seem probable that the courts would excuse the county and its offi - cials from the duty of keeping the highways in a reasonably safe condition. Until the courts otherwise determine, therefore, we are of the opinion that the counties are not entirely relieved from the duty of maintaining all the roads in the county in a reasonably safe condition for travel. We do not believe that the case of King v. Douglas County, 208 N. W. (Neb.) 120, can be relied upon as a final authority since the passage of Chapter 158. Session Laws of Nebraska. 1925. You will note that the King case involved an accident which occurred in October. 15)20. long prior to the passage of the chapter last cited.

LD HIGHWAY— LOCATION OF TELEPHONE POLES Should be set outside of portion actually used and six feet within boundary line. Public authorities may require company to move such poles without reimbursement for expense. September 7, li)-2«&gt;. Mr. Geo. M. h'louh/. Lincoln. Nebratka. Dear Sir : I have taken time to examine carefully the questions asked by you sometime since, the answers to which were delayed by the work in the railroad tax cases. The first question does not appear to have been before the courts. I find no direct reference to our statute or to any simi - lar statute in any other &gt;tate. The questions will now Ih&gt; taken up in their order. "1. What portion of a rural highway may a telephone company occupy with its poles and fixtures under Section 7097 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922?" The statute gives only the minimum distance from the margin of the road ; it says "at least six feet within the boun - dary line" of the road. Poles must not be set so as to interfere with the working of the road as provided by Section 3630, Compiled Statutes. 1922. There is inconsistency between Section 701)7 and Section •2780 which authorizes land owners whose lands adjoin highways to plant shade trees "one-tenth of the legal width of the road from its margin." When a road has the usual width of sixty - t/fff feet, the land owner may thus occupy 6.6 feet thereof. It </seg>
            <seg id="p180">180 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL does not appear that Section 3639, the later act, was intended to repeal Section 2780 so that where the land owner has actually occupied the ground it seems that the poles should be set far enough within the boundary line not to interfere with his occupancy. The only direct answer that can be given to the question Ens to be that the poles should be set outside of the portion the highway actually used for travel and at least six feet hin the boundary line. "2. In case a telephone company has properly occupied a highway under the above mentioned statute, may the Department of Public Works or any governmental subdivision of the state compel it to move its rctures to a new location upon the highway without reimbursing it the expense incurred in so doing?" The proper governmental authorities have the right, when public necessity or convenience so demands, to require a tele - phone company to move its line. City of Plattsmouth v. Nebraska Telephone Company, 80 Neb. 460. Oirensboro v. Cumberland Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.. 230 U. S. 58, 57 L. ed. 1380. In such an instance, being an exercise of the police power, there is no reimbursement of the company for the expense in - curred. C. B. d&gt; Q. Ry. Co. v. III.. 200 U. S. 561, 50 L. ed. 596. A telephone company having constructed a line on a high - way by virtue of Section 7007 is more than a mere licensee, there is a contractual relation between the public and the com - pany which cannot be arbitrarily disregarded. There must be reasonable ground for requiring the line to be moved. City of Pl-attsmouth v. Nebraska Tel. Co., supra. Owensboro v. Cumberland, supra. The company is entitled to reasonable notice to move its line. </seg>
            <seg id="p181">OPINIONS 181 Of course there is a presumption of law in favor of the exercise of the police power by public authorities and ordinarily a court would not interfere unless the arbitrary character of the action of the public officers clearly appeared. "3. Can the Department of Public Works or any governmental sub - division of the state compel a telephone company to so place its struc - ture* upon a rural highway as to create a trespass upon the property of abutting owners by way of cross-arm overhang or otherwise?" A telephone company cannot be compelled to place a line so that it will trespass upon the land of adjoining owners, but that restriction does not prevent the public authorities from using the whole road if necessary for public travel.

Gentlemen : You call our attention to Chapter 158, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1925, pertaining to the duty of the Department of Public Works to maintain the state highway system, including, however, that portion of the highway lying within incorporated cities and villages, having a population of more than fourteen hundred inhabitants. We believe this exception is exclusive only of villages and cities containing more than fourteen hundred inhabitants, just as stated in the statute, and the duty is upon the city or village </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 having that population to maintain their highways within the corporation. ... .: •• Patently this excludes villages and cities of less than that population from maintaining the state highways within the corporation. You also inquire whether or not it is the duty of the De - partment of Public Works to gravel the state highways within the corporate limits of a city or village having more than four - teen hundred inhabitants. We do not so interpret the law. The law merely requires the department to maintain the highways which have been established and constructed. Graveling is a distinct improvement and is provided for by statute. The Ejte uses the word "shall" in referring to the word main - nce. Until the courts hold to the contrary we would be in - *d to believe that thix makes it mandatory of the depart - ment to follow the provisions of the statute. HIGHWAYS— REPLACING BRIDGES AND CULVERTS Ordinarily it is the duty of the county to replace culverts and bridges taken out during construction work on the public highway. June 21, 1926. Mr. S. G. T&amp;rgenon, County Attorney, Kimbatt, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your telegram relative to the liability of the county to re - place culverts or bridges taken out during construction work on the public highway has been received. It seems these culverts or bridges were constructed by an irrigation district crossing the highway. We presume they were </seg>
            <seg id="p183">OPINIONS 183 constructed by agreement with the cotinty, or in case the county and the district could not agree, they were constructed by the irrigation district under the supervision of the county. If the situation is as above expressed we believe that the irrigation district could not be held for additional or new con - struction inasmuch as the agreement was once made and would be binding. Our authority for this conclusion is Section 2734, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. In the event there was no agreement with the county which is now binding, and the district constructed the bridge as pro - vided by Section* 2734, then it appears that it is the duty of the county to maintain said bridge and bridges if the same have been built by the drainage or irrigation district. However, the bridge must have been built under the supervision of the county board and in accord with the established plans and specifica - tions of the county board. In this connection we call your at - tention to State v. Drainage Distinct, 103 Neb. 763, 174 W. W. 316, in which it was held that it was the duty of the drainage district to construct the bridge under the supervision of the county board when no agreement was made with the county. There was an element of estoppel in the case cited as against the county where the county did not in fact supervise the con - struction of the bridge, but it was found that the county board had been notified. Under this case it seems sufficient to consti - tute an estoppel if the county board became aware of the fact of the construction or desire of construction and failed to take steps to undertake the supervision of construction. LD HIGHWAYS— RIGHT TO CHANGE There is no lack of authority in the laws pertaining to establishment of county highway system and the County Board has authority to change same. .

            <seg id="p184">184 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Mr. L. H. McKittip, County Attorney, Seward, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask the advice of this department upon the following state of facts: "Tour county complied with the law passed in 1917 and established a county highway system under the procedure provided by statute, re - ferred to as Section 2650, and following sections, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922." Inasmuch as the Act so providing for the "county highway system did not expressly provide for procedure for vacating or altering the established county highway system, you inquire whether or not the established highways constituting the county highway system may now be vacated or altered under the ex - isting law. The establishment and supervision of the public roads of the county is under the control of the county and its board of commissioners. It can hardly be supposed that the legislature intended that the right to vacate or alter the county roads as established by sections of the law which have not been repealed, should by implication be taken away from the county and its board of commissioners. We believe that the legislature con - templated that each county .should establish a county highway system which should be composed of the principal highways of the county, adequately improved in order to give efficient service for the general county use. The Act of 1917 undoubtedly intended the establishment of the system as a system as distinguished from the establishment of a single road or highway. We cannot believe that the legis - lature intended that the county should not have a right to change its county highway system to meet the public needs and to afford more efficient service to the county. Since the statutes, which gave the right to vacate and alter public roads of the county, have not been expressly repealed, we see nothing incon - sistent with those sections and the Act establishing the county </seg>
            <seg id="p185">OPINIONS 185 highway system. We believe that the roads constituting the county highway system may be vacated or altered as may be necessary for the public good. Provisions of Sections 25(55, 2582, 2597 and 2652, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, pertaining to the subject of vacation and alteration of roads may be invoked for the purpose of im - proving the county highway system. It is further possible that Section 2675, and following sections, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1922, which provides for the organization of an im - provement district for the purpose of straightening roads, and other purposes, might be invoked if the purpose is merely to straighten the highway. Since the statutes pertaining to the vacation and alteration of highways, as well as the establishment of highways, provide for the filing of remonstrances, objections and claims for dam - ages, it seems evident that any person objecting are afforded an opportunity to be heard upon their objections, or make claims for compensation, and therefore jurisdiction would be vested for the vacation and alteration of such highways, as provided by the sections of the statutes cited. Since the legislature has neglected to make express pro - vision in the Act providing for the establishing of the county highway system there may be some slight doubt, but this de - partment believes that the court would sustain the action indi - cated in the cited sections of the statutes. LD HIGHWAYS— SIGNS In a statute prohibiting the placing of signs "along or upon" any public road or highway, except by permission of proper authority, the word "along" should be construed as synonymous with the word "upon". November 13, 1925. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 Honorable L. W. Weaver, Deputy County Engineer,. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Weaver: Answering your inquiry as to whether or not the statute provides for the removal of signs placed near railroad crossings or intersections, and penalty for the erecting of such signs, permit me to suggest that Chapter 159, Page 385, Laws of 1923, lepeals Section 8349 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, and provides as follows: "Section 1. State Permits for Advertising Signs. — No advertising signs shall be placed along or upon any public road or highway within three hundred (300) feet of a railroad crossing or within three hundred (300) feet of the intersection of any two crossroads of the public high - way at grade, nor shall any such signs be placed along or upon any state highway at any other point without a written permit from the Depart - ment of Public Works. Permits to be issued shall be numbered serially and each sign shall bear upon it the permit number thus: 'State Permit No. .' The Department of Public Works is authorized to remove all advertising signs for which permits have not been duly obtained, and is authorized to charge a fee for such permits, such fee to be not less than twenty-five (25c) cents, not to exceed five ($5.00) dollars for each individual sign. The Department of Public Works may, without stating t cause, revoke the permit for any sign along a state highway and Dve the same, provided if the sign so removed shall have been erected than three (3) months at the time of such removal, the amount of permit fee shall be returned to the owner of the sign. Provided, no permit shall be issued for any sign of more than ten (10) square feet surface. Provided, further, printed sale bills shall not be deemed a sign within the meaning of this section, and provided further, nothing in this act shall apply to any incorporated city, town, village or municipality. Section 2. Violation — Penalty. — Any person, firm, company or cor poration violating any of the provisions of this Act shall be deemed guilty of any misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not less than ten ($10.00) dollars nor more than one hundred ($100.00) dollars." With respect to the construction which should be placed i)on the words "along or upon any public road or highway" auld suggest that the word "along" in this statute should be nstrued as synonymous with the word "upon." Neither the </seg>

The title of the Act reads as follows: "AN ACT relating to the placing, building, installing and maintain - ing of bill boards and signs upon the public roads and highways of the state, to provide penalties for the violation of this act and to repeal Sec - tion 8349, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922." The law. in view of the above title, would require the signs to lie upon the highway in order to come within the prohibition of the Act. .especially in view of the holding in Ryan v. Prexton. ()fi X. Y. Supp. 1(&gt;23, in which the court said in construing a similar provision : "Section 2 declares that no side paths shall be constructed upon or along any regularly constructed or maintained sidewalk, except upon the consent of the persons owning the abutting lands. Held, that the word 'along' should be construed as synonymous with 'upon', and hence the section does not forbid the construction of a bicycle path beside or ad - joining any regularly constructed or maintained sidewalk."

            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 188 1925 dealing with appropriations, which reads, as follows: "All funds derired from a 2c per gallon gasoline tax, for road pur - poses, to be distributed as provided by law, estimated $4,000,000.00. Provided: That the Department of Public Works is authorized and em - powered to gravel highways connecting state institutions with state high - ways when such state institutions are not on State highways and where the distance does not exceed eight miles, such expenditure not to exceed $25,000 for any one year," and inquire whether or not the state may gravel the highway connecting the state fisheries near Gretna with the state high - way about five miles distant. In order to answer your inquiry it is necessary to determine whether or not the fishery at Gretna is a "state institution" within the meaning and intent of the legislature, as set forth in the above quoted section of the law. In reply would suggest that this matter is not free from doubt in the absence of a de - cision of our court, but since the property in question has been erected, maintained, supervised and handled entirely by the state, it is my opinion that a broad interpretation of the term "state institutions" would include this plant at Gretna, espe - cially in view of the case of C half ant v. State, 37 Ohio St. BO, 61. in which the court said : " 'State institutions,' as used in Const. Art. 7, Sec. 2, means institutions belonging to and owned by the state." * It was also held in Burn* v.

            <seg id="p189">OPINIONS 189 Honorable John R. Dumont, Insurance Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 9th instant in re plan of the Chrysler Motor Car Company to insure each car sold by it in the name of the purchaser in a company which has no cer - tificate of authority to transact business in Nebraska and through an agent who is not licensed to do business in this state, I will say: 1. The law provides that "No insurance company shall transact any insurance business in this state unless it has received a certificate of authority from the de - partment of trade and commerce so to do." Section 7767, Compiled Statutes, 1922. 2. An unlicensed agent cannot lawfully engage in the busi - ness of soliciting or writing insurance in this state. The law provides that "Every insurance soliciting agent or broker shall annually procure a license from the department of trade and commerce. * • « Only a natural person shall be licensed as an agent or broker." Section 7792. Compiled Statutes. 1922. The law further provides that "No insurance company admitted to do business in this state shall write, place or cause to be written or placed, any policy of insurance covering risks located or residing in this state, except through or by a duly licensed agent of such company resident within or licensed by the department of trade and commerce, except that any officer of a domestic company may write or place a policy of insurance if done at the home office of such company." Section 7788. Compiled Statutes. 1922. 9. I note the plan of business outlined by the company contains among other things the following provisions: INSURANCE "Effective July first, 1925, all Chrysler cars sold will include fire </seg>

"The actual 'Delivery Charge' made by us against distributors and dealers will be recovered by them from retail purchaser when making delivery of the new car purchased and must be included by the dis - tributor or dealer in the delivery price, to the purchaser." Whether th« retail dealer selling the Chrysler car and col - lecting: from the retail purchaser a "delivery charge" as above outlined to pay the cost of insurance upon the car for a year is an insurance agent within the meaning of the insurance law of this state is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court decision upon that point. An agent is defined in the insurance law of this state as: "Any person, firm or corporation in this state who shall with auth - ity receive or receipt for any money on account of, or for any contract of insurance made by him or them, or for any such insurance company or individual aforesaid, or who shall with authority receive or receipt for money from other persons to be transmitted to any such company or individual aforesaid, or a policy or policies of insurance, or any renewal thereof, although such policy or policies of insurance may not be signed by him or them as agent or agents of such company, or who shall in any wise make or cause to be made any contract or contracts of insurance, Eot on account of such company aforesaid, shall be deemed to all in - ts and purposes an 'agent' or 'agents' of such company." </seg>
            <seg id="p191">OPINIONS 191 Section 7772, Compiled Statutes. 1922. It occurs to me that when a retail agent of the Chrysler Motor Car Company collects from the retail purchaser of a car money to be transmitted to some insurance company in payment for a policy of insurance on such car. he may fairly be said to come within the definition of an agent if the words of Section 7772, Compiled Statutes, are given a literal construction. In the case of Tomnon v. lo-wa State Trtn'cliinj Men's Asso - ciation, 88 Neb. 399, one Latshaw was held to be an insurance agent to the extent that service of summons u|)on him was service upon the company even though his services were in - formed gratuitously. Judge Fawcett who wrote the opinion in that case said: "The fact that he received no compensation from defendant (The Association) for soliciting business for it is immaterial." By a parity of reason it is immaterial that the agents of the Chrysler Motor Car Company receive no compensation di - rectly from the insurance company for the insurance business they solicit incidentally in making sales of automobiles. GWA INSURANCE— OFFICERS— AGENTS An officer of a domestic insurance company may be employed as a so - liciting agent for the company, but the contract of employment should be made by a majority of the board of directors of the com - pany and the officer himself, if he is a director, should not vote upon the question of making such a contract.

"• and you inquire whether an officer of the company may act as a soliciting agent, and if so whether a valid contract may be made with such an one entitling him to renewal commissions on busi - ness renewed after the expiration of five years. In answer to your question I will say that in my opinion an officer of such an insurance company may be employed as a soliciting agent for the company, and that the contract of em - ployment may provide that he shall receive renewal commissions on business renewed after the expiration of five years. Such contracts should be made on behalf of the company in my opinion by a majority of the board of directors. The officer himself, if a director, should not vote upon the question of making such a contract where he is personally one of the parties thereto. GWA IRRIGATION— DIVISION OF WATER The duty of seeing that each tract of land in an irrigation district re - ceive its fair share of water devolves upon the district officials. November 20, 1925. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">OPINIONS 193 Hon. R. U. Willis, Chief of Bureau, Irrigation, Water Power &lt;nu] Itminnge, Lincoln, Nebraaka. Dear Sir: You inquire: "1. Is it the duty of our Department to proceed with the adjudica - tion of the right to the use of public water of the State on individual tracts of land which is a part of an irrigation district? The Mitchell Irrigation District was organized in the State of Nebraska and has con - trol of the distribution of water for 14,000 acres of land. A few years ago the Board of Directors of this district mandamused the Board of Control in Wyoming to take action on the adjudication of their appro - priation of water. The Mitchell Irrigation District does not irrigate any land in Wyoming, — the entire 14,000 acres are in Nebraska. The Board of Control of Wyoming adjudicated their rights and issued cer - tificates. There is nothing on record in our department concerning the appropriation of water to these lands. The individual land owner de - sires to file a claim under Section 8426, Compiled Statutes, 1922. for the purpose of determining the right to use the public water of the state on certain tracts of land. I do not believe the claimant intends to come under the jurisdiction of Nebraska, but desires to place his right to the use of water on record so that he may procure a loan from the Federal Land Bank. "2. Is it advisable for our department to proceed under the above section of the law to determine the right to use the public water on indi - vidual tracts of land in this particular case?" In answer to the question you ask I will say that in my opinion it is not ii duty of your department under the circum - stances outlined in your letter to proceed with the adjudication of the right to the use of water on individual tracts of land which are a part of an irrigation district. I do not understand Section S42(&gt;. Compiled Statutes, to re - quire you to apportion the amount of an appropriation made to an irrigation district among the several individual tracts of land comprising the district. The law expressly provides: "AH waters distributed for irrigation purposes shall be apportioned ratably to each land owner upon the basis of the ratio, which the last </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 assessment of such owner for district purposes within said district bears to the whole sum assessed upon the district." Section 2865, Compiled Statutes. The same section of statute makes it the duty of the board of directors of an irrigation district to establish equitable by - laws, rules and regulations for the distribution of water among the owners of land in a district, and another section of statute provides : "In case the volume of water in any stream or river shall not be sufficient to supply the continual wants of the entire country through which it passes, and susceptible of irrigation therefrom, then It shall be the duty of the water commissioners constituted as hereinafter provided to apportion in a just and equitable proportion, a certain amount of said water upon certain or alternate weekly days to different localities as they may, in their judgment, think best for the interest of all parties concerned, and with due regard lo the legal and equitable rights of all. The water commissioners shall consist of the chairman of the board ot directors of each of the districts affected." In view of these various provisions of statute, I am of the opinion that the duty of seeing to it that each tract of land in the district receives its fair share of the water apportioned to the district devolves in the first instance upon the district officers and that if they fail in the performance of this duty the remedy is not an appeal to your department, but an appro - priate court action. In the case of State v. Gering Irrigation District, reported in 192 W. W. at page 212 thereof, the supreme court of this state held that where necessary, lateral ditches should be provided, maintained and supervised by the district in order that a just apportionment of water to each landowner may be made; that if the district does not provide such lateral ditches, the land - owners interested may do so, and that if the lateral ditches are not kept in repair and some of the landowners receive more water from them than their just share those landowners, who are deprived of water may by writ of mandamus compel the directors of the irrigation district to take such steps as to pro - vide them with their just share of the water and to supervise the distribution of same.

Dan Swanson, Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You call the attention of this department to a letter of the treasurer of Custer county addressed to yourself in which speak - ing with reference to Sections 16 to 21 in his county, he says: "In the years 1902, 1903, 1905 and 1906 there was assessed against this land an irrigation tax for the purpose of paying for a ditch in that neighborhood. The project has long since been abandoned and I don't know who would get the money ,if any was collected. "The land is now held by various parties in small tracts, some under lease from the State, some under contract of purchase and some has actually been deeded. However, these parties who have bought the land from the State from sale contract I presume will hardly be willing to pay the irrigation tax, and I would like to know your opinion in re - gard to the .matter, as to who is liable for this irrigation tax if any one." In answer to the question propounded I will say that this irrigation tax is not a lien on the state's interest in the land. If the parties who held leasehold or sale contract interests in the land at the time the tax was assessed still retain those interests in the land, it is possible the tax is a lien upon such interests, but if the holders of such interests at that time have not re - tained them and did not assign them to the present owners, but the owners hold their interests by reason of contracts made di - rectly with the state since the levy of said irrigation taxes, I am of the opinion same are not liens upon the leasehold or sale contract interests of the present owners.

February 25, 1920. Mr. K. H. Willix. Bureau of Irrigation. Power mid Drainage. Department of Public Works. Lincoln. Xehraxko. Dear Sir: In your letter of the 22nd instant you say : "It will be necessary for our Department to take action relative to closing a canal that is storing water for agricultural use which is sub - sequent in right to a power appropriation. There is a question in my mind at this time as to the legality of closing a subsequent appropriator who has a right to store water used during the irrigation season." You ask for an opinion from this department upon the question. Complying with your request. I will say that the supreme court has held : "A completed appropriation of water for power under the law of 1877, is a vested right, of which subsequent appropriators for irrigating purposes are bound to take notice."

Appli - cation 1108, dating June 22, 1921, for any amount not to exceed sixty (60) second feet until 1000 acre feet have been stored to be used for agricultural use." In view of the aforesaid facts I am of the opinion the Champion Milling Company's right to the use of '28 second feet of water for power purposes is superior to the Kilpatrick Brothers' right to store water for agricultural purposes, but that the right to its second appropriation of M feet for power purposes, the appropriation having been made after the law was enacted giving the right to use water for agricultural pur - poses precedence over the right to use it for power purposes, is inferior to any appropriation of water for agricultural purposes. In the matter of closing down the headgates of an ap - propriator by your department in order to enable a prior appro - priator to have the water to which it is entitled under its ap - propriation, I will say that I believe the department has such power under the provisions of Section 8423, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1922, but believe further it is clothed with con - siderable discretion in determining when the power shall be exercised.

The statute being silent upon the point of the restoration of a doctor or other licensee whose license has heretofore been revoked, has this department implied power based upon its expressed power given to license and to revoke to reinstate a doctor after such revocation? 2. Has this department power to impose terms under which such restoration is made and which must be complied with by the restored licensee, assuming for the purpose of this question that the department has power to restore? 3. The Practice Acts relating to some of the professions contain no provision authorizing this department to revoke a license, although giving it power to license applicants. Has the department implied power to revoke a license which it has there before granted? You may assume that a grave moral or professional breach has been committed." I will endeavor to answer your questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. Yes. 2. Yes. The department has power, in my opinion, to impose conditions precedent to the granting of a renewal license to practice medicine to one whose license has been re - voked. Whether or not the department has power to impose conditions subsequent to be observed by the licensee with power to revoke his license in case he fails to observe them may not be entirely free from doubt.

City of Grand Rapids v. Brand;/, 04 N. W. 29 3. I doubt the right of the department to revoke a license granted by it unless the statute provided that such license may be revoked. "It has been held that where provision is made for punishing a vio - lation of the license regulations by fine or imprisonment, such regulation is exclusive." 37 C. J. 247.

GWA TOBACCO AND CIGARS— LICENSE A separate license must be procured for the sale of cigars, tobacco and cigarettes by a dealer at each place of business where such com - modity or commodities are offered for sale. September 3, 1925. Board of Education, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen : In reply to your oral request for the opinion of the attorney general to the following inquiries: </seg>
            <seg id="p201">OPINIONS 201 1. May the vender of cigars, tobacco, cigarettes and cigar ette material authorize another person to sell such commodity under his license? 2. Can the licensee for the sale of cigars, tobacco, cigar - ettes and cigarette material who maintains more than one place where such commodities are sold, sell the same under one license or is such person required to have a separate license for each place where such commodities are sold? We direct your attention to Sections !&gt;8f&gt;0, 9851. 9853 and !»857 of Article III of Chapter i&gt;. Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 19-2-2. which provide: "9850. That licenses for the sale of cigars, tobacco, cigarettes and cigarette material, to persons over the age of twenty-one years shall be issued to individuals, partnerships and corporations, by the clerk of any city, town or village, and by the county clerk of any county, upon appli - cation duly made as hereinafter provided. Provided, that the sale of cigarettes or cigarette materials that shall contain perfumes, or drugs in any form, is prohibited and is not licensed by the .provisions of this law. Only cigarettes and cigarette material containing pure white paper and pure tobacco only shall be licensed." "9851. That every person, partnership or corporation, desiring a license under this act, shall file with the clerk of the city, town or vil - lage where his, their or its place of business is located, if within the limits of a city, town or village, or with the clerk of the county where such place of business is located, if outside the limits of any city, town or village, a written application, stating the name of the person, partner - ship or corporation for whom such license is desired, and the exact loca - tion of the place of business; and shall deposit with such application the amount of the license fee hereinafter provided." "9853. That the license hereinbefore provided for when issued shall authorize the sale of cigars, tobacco, cigarettes and cigarette material by the licensee and employees, to persons over the age of twenty-one years, at the place of business described in said license, unless the same be for - feited as hereinafter provided." "9857. That in the case of the sale of a business where the owner has a license hereunder, the licensing authority may authorize such license to be transferred to the purchaser. In case of a change of loca - tion by any licensee hereunder, the licensing authority may transfer such license to the new location." Article Til of Chapter 9, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 for 1922, was enacted as House Roll 297 and appears as Chapter 180, page 401, Session Laws 1919, and the title of the act reads : "An Act to regulate the licensing and sale of cigars, tobacco and cigarettes and cigarette material to persons over twenty-one years of age, and to provide penalties for violation by licensees, or any other person, partnership or corporation, and for misrepresentation of age by persons, and to repeal Section 8848 of Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1913." It is the opinion of the attorney general that Section 9851 above quoted prohibits the sale of cigars, tobacco, cigarettes and cigarette material by any person, unless such person has pro - cured a license from the proper licensing authority for the sale of such commodities at the location described in such license, and such licensee cannot authorize another dealer to sell such commodities under his license for the reason that the statute specifically provides that every dealer must have a license. It is further Che opinion of the attorney general that ac - cording to Section 9853 above quoted, a license for the sale of cigars, tobacco, cigarettes and cigarette material restricts the sale of such commodities by the licensee at the location of the place of business described in such license. The language of the statute is in the singular and does not authorize the sale of such commodities in more than one place of business, and if such licensee desires to sell such commodity at more than one place of business, he should have a separate license for each place of business where such commodity is offered for sale. We believe this conclusion is further supported by the pro - visions of Section 9857 above quoted which provides for the transfer of a license where the licensee has sold or disposed of the location for which such license was originally granted. This conclusion is further supported by the title of the act of the above quoted statutes which defines the act to be an act to regulate the licensing and sale of such commodities. We recognize that the meaning of the language as used in Section 9853 which provides that the license shall authorize the sale of such commodity or commodities by the licensee "at the place of business described in said license'* is somewhat in- </seg>
            <seg id="p203">OPINIONS 203 definite and in view of Section 9922, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which in part provides "unless otherwise provided, words used in this code in the present tense include the future as well as the present * * * the singular number includes the plural and the plural the singular,'" such language may be construed to mean platen of business, but in view of Section 9851 above quoted, that every person desiring a license under this act shall file with the proper licensing authority a written application setting forth the '"exact location of the place of business" and construing the several sections of the statutes together, it is our opinion that the legislature intended that a license should be had for the sale of such commodity or commodities at each loca - tion where the same is offered for sale, notwithstanding the fact that the same dealer might own several places where such com - modity is offered for sale within such licensing district. LB LICENSES— TOBACCO— WHOLESALE What constitutes a wholesaler? Mr. Hugh H. Drake, Attorney at Law, Kearney, Nebraska. Dear Sir You state that a wholesale tobacco house at York pays license fee of $100 as a wholesaler's license. This company has over ten customers in Kearney. They have one customer who receives from the York concern large shipments of cigarettes, etc., and he in turn delivers this merchandise to the different customers about town, receiving a commission for his work, which might be termed a profit on the resale, as he has been in the habit of remitting for the full amount of the shipment to the wholesale company at York. We presume that he makes a profit from the retail cus- June 23, 1925. </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL tomers in Kearney to whom he delivers the merchandise pur - chased from the York concern. 40 Cyc. 929-930 defines the term "wholesaler" as one who sells to retailers. We presume this means in distinction the one who sells to the individual con - sumer. Chapter 130, page 335, Session Laws of 19*23, provides for a license fee of $100 for wholesalers who sell tobacco in any form at wholesale. We presume that the license of the York concern permits them to sell at wholesale from the place at York and the provisions of their license are exhausted when they sell at wholesale to their customer at Kearney. Under the circumstances as you relate them it would appear to us that the person acting in Kearney is not in reality con - nected with the wholesale company at York, and that he is in turn acting as a wholesaler in thus selling to retailers who in turn sell to the consumer, thus escaping payment of the whole - salers' license. If he is merely an agent by pretense in order to avoid the license we would say that the law would not permit this to be done in that manner. See 33 C. J. 536-539. Also in this connection we call your attention to People v. Neuman, 57 N. W. 1073, 99 Mich. 148; Jones v. Yokum, 123 N. W. (S. D.) 272, which rather indicate that the person selling in the manner you have indicated should have a wholesaler's license. It is very evident that the wholesaler can sell at his loca - tion in York under his wholesaler's license and that he cannot sell at retail. It is likewise evident that your local dealer, if he has a retailer's license has no right to sell at wholesale under that license in the absence of any provision for a jobber's li - cense. We would presume that anyone selling to retailers would l&gt;e a wholesaler. Your Kearney man apparently buys personally from the wholesale house in such manner that the purchase be - comes his property and then he disposes of it to the retailers locally, thus being in a sense a jobber and not the mere agent of the York people. If he were the mere agent of the York con - cern, we would be in considerable doubt on account of the fact that there seems to be no decision in this state upon that par - ticular subject. LD </seg>

August 3. 1926. Her. ('. P. I\ (Hither. I'ttxtor, Sal-em Lutheran Ckurttk l'iiii&lt;-n, Ndbrumktt. Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 2nd instant inquiring if a couple may l&gt;e married in a county upon a marriage license issued in a county other than the place where the couple desire to be married. In reply you are informed that the jurisdiction of the county judge is restricted to the boundaries of his county and that a marriage license issued in one county is not valid in another county in the state. Section 140-2 as amended by Chapter 88, page 201, Session Laws of- 1925, among other things provides: "Previous to the solemnization of any marriage in this state a license for that purpose must be obtained from the County Judge of the county wherein the marriage is to take place and no marriage hereafter contracted shall be recognized as valid unless such license shall have been previously obtained, • * *."

            <seg id="p206">206 state unless and until the supreme court holds that it is unreason- able legislation. October 19. 1925. Mr C. E. Wakh, Attorney at Law, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask our opinion as to the constitutionality of the new law pertaining to prosecution of divorce actions. In our opinion this law would be held constitutional by the supreme court as an enactment within the police powers. Whether or not it is a wise provision is one for the legislature and not for the courts you know, and the supreme court would not go into this phase of that question. The only constitutional provisions which would seem to have any application at all would be Section 13 of Article I, and Section 18 of Article III, of the Constitution of this state. It is true that an ingenious construction could be woven Eut these two constitutional provisions. A person, however, no inherent right to a divorce and undoubtedly that is a ject for police regulation. It does indeed seem a hardship to prevent conscientious litigants from trying their cases within rsame period of time that a case of a different nature might tried. It may result in the loss of the testimony of wit - nesses by death or removal from the jurisdiction. The only protection that the litigant would have in such a case would be to take all the depositions of their witnesses. This does not seem to be a just provision or a just result as it would cost a con - siderable amount to take the depositions and it would be a net loss in the event that witnesses were used in person. The use of the witnesses in person is of course always more desirable. The provision does seem unjust and unreasonable inasmuch as the legislature had already provided that the decree should not become final for a period of six months. The supreme court, however, would deal only with the constitutionality of the law and not with the desirability of its provisions. On account of </seg>
            <seg id="p207">OPINIONS 207 the fact that a vested right is not involved we do not believe that the supreme court would interfere with this exercise of the police power by the legislature. Of course the presumption always favors the constitutionality of the law. We would be glad to have you suggest any authorities which you deem conclusive on the subject. LI) MARRIAGE— POLICE JUDGE MAY SOLEMNIZE Police judges probably have power to perform marriage ceremonies. June 7. 1926. Judge C. I). Smiley, Justice of the Peace, South Siaux City, Sehramka. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not police judge in a city of the second class can legally perform marriage ceremonies. Section 140(5, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 19*22, provides that every judge and justice of the peace, and every preacher of the gospel so properly authorized by his church, may solemnize marriages. Police magistrates are in some places in the statutes re - ferred to as police judges, and we believe that the common usage of police magistrates are police judges, and therefore within the purview of the statute heretofore cited. The use of the term judge in Section 149(5 is undoubtedly used in its com - mon sense to indicate judges of all courts. If you have any authority to the contrary we would like to be advised, but in the meantime we would be of the opinion that police judges would have the power to solemnize marriages. LD </seg>

After making the stop hereby required the driver of the vehicle shall carefully look in each direction for approaching cars or trains and shall not start his vehicle until it has been ascertained that there are no cars or trains approaching the crossing in either direction. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no driver or operator of such motor vehicles shall be less than twenty-one years of age. nor shall he operate the same in any other than a careful and prudent manner, nor at any greater speed than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic and use of the highway by others, or so as to endanger the life or limb of any person.

Dear Sir: In your communication of the 22nd instant you say : "We are operating .a large fleet of cross-country trucks and wish to know if there is a law regulating the width of trucks and busses operat - ing on the highways in the state of Nebraska. If there is such a law, please advise what width is permissible on both trucks and busses." In reply may I suggest that Section 8340 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 provides: "Unlawful motor vehicles on highways — Penalty. — No motor vehicle in excess of seven and one-half (7%) feet in width, or twelve (12) feet in height shall be operated on the system of state highways; nor shall any motor vehicle be so operated in which the limit of load per inch width of tire exceeds 600 pounds. No motor vehicle of which the weight of truck and load combined exceed 7,000 pounds on any one wheel shall be operated on the system of state highways without the special permis - sion of the Department of Public Works. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00 for each offense." You might be interested in Chapter 158, Session Laws for 1923, which provides: "Construction Work — Transportation Over Public Highways.

Provided, further, that it shall be the duty of the party or parties trans - porting such material over steel rails to properly maintain that portion of the streets or highways occupied by said rails and to remove said rails when the work is completed that was contemplated when said rails were laid." One reason for calling your attention to the above section is that same is not indexed or at least it is not properly indexed in the 1923 Session Laws. It seems that in some instances cities have provided regula - tions for trucks and busses under the authority granted by law to cities to provide certain rules and regulations on such sub - jects. It might be well to consult your ordinances as well as the statute. OSS MOTOR VEHICLES— COLLECTION OF REGISTRATION FEES Proportionate part of the registration fees for the year for motor vehicles is collectible as provided by law, but not less than a full quarter year. Arrears should be collected at registration for renewal or suit instituted therefor. December 7, 1925. Department of Public Works, Motor Vehicle Registration Department Mrs. N. G. Tracy, Chief Clerk, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mrs. Tracy: We are in receipt of your inquiry of December 7th. Your question is whether or not if a person buys a car in October, 1925, and fails to register the same as required by law, and makes application for license in the county treasurer's office </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL January 1st. 1026, will he be required to pay the fee for the last quarter of lt&gt;25. together with the $1.00 penalty for not regis - tering: within ten days from the date of purchase? Under date of June 30, 1925, we gave your department a ting under the old motor vehicle registration law. The new r went into effect July 2nd. The new law requires the owner of every motor vehicle to register. In this respect it differs from the old law. The law also provides that the registration license fee shall be in the nature of an occupation tax. Under the oj&gt;eration of the new law, therefore, the owner of the motor vehicle becomes liable for the occupation tax immediately upon to at once register the same and provides that if he fails to his becoming the owner of the vehicle and the law requires him register within ten days that he shall be assessed a penalty as well as the charge for registration. Section 8379, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, pro - vides that if the car be purchased on or after October 1st and on or before December 31st, the fee shall be 25 j&gt;er cent of the annual fee. Under this provision it seems that the annual fee should first be computed and then one-fourth of that amount taken as the fee for the remaining portion of the year 1925. In the event that the person should fail to register his car the penalty provided would, of course, be collectible. We think the county treasurer should urge and so far as possible require the payment of all arrears since July 1st, at the time application is made for renewal license on or after January 1, 1920. Rather than to have any county treasurer become involved in a lawsuit on account of the amount in arrears in the event the motor vehicle owner refuses to pay arrears, we would suggest that he take the amount due for 1926. After he has secured this we would then suggest that he report the matter to the county at - torney with instructions to file suit to recover the amount in arrears and also to prosecute the offender for operating his car without a registration license, in the event you can prove op - eration. </seg>

We therefore feel that all arrears due since the new law went into effect should be collected by suit for that purpose. While we have no Nebraska cases cover - ing the situation, we call your attention to 37 C. J. 24J&gt; per - taining to license fees and taxation and continuing through several pages of that volume. LD MOTOR VEHICLES— DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS Relating to distribution of funds collected by registration of motor vehicles. January 15. 192t&gt;. Mr. Henry •/. Heal, County Attorney. Oiiuiha. Nebrmica. Dear Sir: You ask for our opinion on in your letter of January 12th: the following matter set forth "The question has arisen in this county and it will affect all the counties in the State of Nebraska, whether or not the Treasurer should take for the road fund 30 per cent of the gross amount collected or 30 per cent after deducting the 2 1 - per cent as set out in Section 8337. It is the contention of Douglas County that the 30 per cent set out in Sec - tion 8338 should be taken after the 5 cents and 2'-j per cent have been deducted." Responding, we call your attention to Chapter 158. page 401, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1925, constituting the amend - ment to the old registration law, including Section 8838, Com - piled Statutes for 1022. Considering only the language in Section 8838 as amended, there might be considerable doubt as to the computation of the 30 per cent. The natural conclusion would be that the 30 per </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL cent was to be based upon the gross receipts from registration. However, the title of the act restricts the 30 per cent to 30 per cent of the balance of said registration fees. The balance referred to undoubtedly refers to the balance remaining after deduction of the 5 cents for each registration and the 2y 2 per cent as these things follow in order in the title. In view of the title of the act it seems to us that the proper •construction is to first deduct the 5 cents per registration, then deduct and remit 2V2 per cent of the balance remaining, and then again to deduct and remit 30 per cent of the then remain - ing balance. If it were not for the restriction in the title this opinion doubtless would be otherwise. LD MOTOR VEHICLES— FIVE CENT FEE Section 8337, Compiled Statutes, 1922, not being repealed, requires county treasurers to account for the five cents collected as- registra - tion fees for automobiles.

Dear Mr. Sommer: Replying to your letter of the 1st instant calling my attention to Section 8389, or House Roll 204, page 418, 1925 Laws, and suggesting a lobbyist for the county treasurers and complaining because I do not hold that that section allows the retention of five cents registration fee by the county treasurer himself, will state complaints do not help the situation unless directed to the legislature. I am obliged to construe the law as I find it. Section 8389, while making the treasurer an agent and pro- </seg>

Since Section 8337 is in full force and effect, and provides for the accounting of these fees, I do not feel justified in ad - vising the treasurers in retaining same, especially in view of the rule of law, which prohibits the increase of salary during the term of office, and other rules with which you are familiar. Section 8337 makes the county treasurer an agent just as Section 8389, but the former section provides that he shall ac - count for the five cents in question the same as other fees pass - ing through his hands. OSS MOTOR VEHICLES— MINORS Minors under sixteen years of age may not lawfully operate a motor vehicle. September 17, 1926. Mm. Flora McWilliam*, Hay Spring*. Nehranka. Dear Madam : The law prohibits a minor under the age of sixteen years from driving an automobile. Section 8391, Compiled Statutes ef Nebraska, 1922, provides as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any person under the age of sixteen years of age or for any intoxicated person to operate a motor vehicle, and any owner, dealer or manufacturer of motor vehicles who permits a person under sixteen years of age or any intoxicated person to operate a motor vehicle shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished as here - inafter provided for violation of the provisions of this article."

Ii&gt; reply to your inquiry permit me to refer you to Section 83G5, Compiled Statute* of Nebraska for li'2'2. which provides among other things for the registration by "every owner of a motor vehicle which shall be operated or driven upon the public highways, etc." This section was amended in L925 and appears as a part of House Roll 204. Chapter 159, page 405, of the Laws of Nebraska for 1925, and in the amendment the legislature eliminated the words "which shall be operated or driven upon public highways" and this section now reads as follows: "Every owner of a motor vehicle shall, for each motor vehicle owned, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, make application for registration on a blank to be furnished for that purpose by the County Treasurer of the county in which the owner resides, containing, in addition to such other particulars as may be required by the Depart - ment of Public Works, a statement of the name and post office address of the applicant, a description of the motor vehicle, including the name of the maker, the number, if any affixed to the motor or engine by the maker, color of the car, kind of wheels, number of cylinders, the seating capacity, the published weight of vehicle, and in case of truck, the weight til include the chassis, body and cab, the year model or letter denoted the manufacturer, if any, and with such application, the applicant </seg>
            <seg id="p217">OPINIONS 217 shall pay the proper registration fee as provided in Section 8379, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended: Provided, no charge shall be made for changing certificate in case owner repaints car." The new law seems to require that the owner of every motor vehicle register same without regard to the extent of use of said vehicle upon the public highway. The law also provides that the registration license fee shall be in the nature of an occupation tax. Under the operation of the new law, therefore, the owner of the motor vehicle becomes liable for the occupation tax immediately upon his becoming the owner of the vehicle and the law requires him to at once register the same and provides that if he fails to register within ten days that he shall be assessed a penalty as well as the charge for registration. Answering your inquiry with respect to the official registra - tion year, and the amount of fees to be paid upon cars regis - tered at different periods during the year, the latter part of Section 8379, Compiled Statutes for 1922. as amended in Chap - ter 159 of the Laws for 19*25 at page 412 provides as follows: "The registration fees herein provided for shall be deemed occupa - tion tax: Provided, no registration fee shall be charged for any motor vehicle owned by any city, or village of this state for the use of the police, fire or other department, nor for any motor vehicle owned and used by any school district, county, state or United States Government: Provided, further, that the official registration year shall extend in each case from January 1st to December 31st. inclusive, of the calendar year for which registration is made, provided, however, if motor vehicle is purchased on or after April 1st, and before July 1st, the fee shall be seventy-five per cent (75%) of the annual fee; and after July 1st and on or before October 1st the fee shall be fifty per cent (50%) of the an - nual fee. If purchased on or after October 1st and on or before Decem - ber 31st, the fee shall be twenty-five per cent (25%) of the annual fee as provided in this section: Provided, further, in case the question arises as to the weight of chassis, body and cab, the County Treasurer may demand scale weighing certificates; in the event no weighing certificate is presented the County Treasurer shall determine the weight of the body and cab by adding thirty per cent (30%) of the advertised carry - ing capacity to the advertised chassis weight to determine the total weight of the truck." With respect to Section 8382. Compiled Statutes for 1922, that has also been amended and you will find it on page 413, Chapter 159 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1925. If you do not </seg>

MOTOR VEHICLES— REGISTRATION OF HYBRID VEHICLES A truck with a corn-sheller mounted upon it and moving under its own power from place to place is motor vehicle subject to registration. November 6, 1926. Mr. Howard S. Foe, County Attorney, Red Cloud, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Foe: You inquire whether or not a truck that has been re - modeled with a corn sheller mounted upon it and used to fur - nish power to transport the sheller and to shell corn is a motor vehicle within the provisions of the law requiring a motor vehicle to be registered. Section 8364, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, de - fines the words "motor vehicle" to include all vehicles propelled by any power other than muscular, excepting traction engines, road rollers and any vehicles which run only on rails or tracks. Under this definition we believe that the vehicle to which you refer is a motor vehicle and should be registered. </seg>

Where a village or city of the second class desires to enter into a con - tract with or grant a franchise to the corporation for the furnish - ing of electricity to such municipality or the inhabitants thereof, such officers in making such contract or granting such franchise must comply with the statutory provisions pertaining thereto. September 28, 1926. Mr. F. J. Kobe*, Mayor, Crete, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Kobes: We have your favor of the 28th ultimo stating that your city is contemplating either the construction or the purchase of selling electric energy to the citizens of your municipality, and you inquire if the proposition must be submitted to a vote for an electric light plant for the purpose of manufacturing and approval by the voters within such city limits. We also have the proposal of an electric company wherein they propose to construct an electric plant for the purpose of supplying the necessary electrical energy. They propose to con - struct an electric plant, the plans of which are to be approved by your city engineer. They suggest that a franchise not to exceed twenty-five years be given them for the purpose of using the streets and alleys to distribute the electrical energy. They further agree that the City of Crete shall reserve an option upon its part to purchase such plant at the price set forth in the proposition and mutually agreed upon by the city and the company. It is further proposed that when the net earnings of the company are sufficient to pay the purchase price of the </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL plant and the other items agreed upon, that the company will deed and convey all of its title in and to the plant to the city, provided the city desires to accept such plant. There is no obligation upon the part of the city to either exercise its option to purchase the plant or accept the same when the net earnings of such plant are sufficient to reimburse the company for the amount it has invested in such plant. It is a well settled principle of law that the municipal officers of a city or village may exercise only such power as is directly or necessarily implied by some act of the legislature. This rule was stated by the supreme court of Pennsylvania, in the case of McCormich v. Hanover Ttncnship. 246 Pa. 169, 92 Atl. 195. We find in our investigation of the statutes of Nebraska that we have four separate statutes dealing with the matter of authorizing a city of the second class to make contracts or grant franchises in regard to furnishing the municipality with elec - trical energy. Section 4396 provides as follows: "Cities of the first class, cities of the second class, and villages shall have the power to purchase, construct, maintain and improve heat - ing, lighting systems and ice plants for the use of their respective municipalities and the inhabitants thereof." Section 4188 provides: 'To grant a franchise, subject to the conditions of the section for a period not exceeding twenty-five years to any person, company, or association, and to his or its assigns, to lay and maintain gas mains, pipes, service and all other necessary structures, or to erect and maintain poles, lines, wires and conductors for electricity in the streets, lanes, alleys and public places of the city, for the purpose of furnishing gas and electricity for lighting the streets, lanes, alleys and public places of said city, and for furnishing the same to the inhabitants thereof. "Such franchise shall fix the amount that may be charged during such period for such gas or electricity, and provide that such city may after such period, make any reasonable regulation with reference to any person, firm or corporation, holding such' franchise either as to charges for such gas or electricity or otherwise. They are further authorized to </seg>

These statutes as they now appear were amended and re - enacted at the 1019 session of the legislature, being Senate Kile No. 184. Chapter 181, page 404. Session Laws of 1919. approved April Hi. 1911). and House Roll No. 856, page 129. Session Laws of 1019. approved April 1'.). 1010. Section 4317. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which was likewise amended at the session of the legislature of 1910. and appears as Chapter 40, House Roll 192, page 142, Session Laws of 1019. in part provides: "Any city of the second class or village is hereby authorized and empowered to enter into a contract for the furnishing of electricity, power, steam, or other product of any system or plant, owned and oper - ated by such city or village to any person or corporation, if the furnish - ing of such electricity, power, steam, or other product shall not interfere with the proper purposes for which the lighting, heating, waterworks or other plant of such city or village was intended. Any city of the second class or village is hereby authorized and empowered to enter into a con - tract with any person or corporation either within or without the cor - porate limits of such city or village for the furnishing of electricity, power, steam, or other product to such city or village or to any electric, power, steam, or other system or plant owned and operated by such city or village. Such city of the second class or village is hereby authorized and empowered for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act, to have a right of way for and to maintain transmission lines upon, within and across any of the public highways of this state as is pro - vided by law for persons, firms, associations and corporations engaged in generating and transmitting of electric current within the state. Before any city of the second class or village shall make any contract tcith any person or corporation within or without such city or village for the furnishing of electricity, power, steam or other product to such city or village, or any such municipal plant within such city or village, the question shall be submitted to the electors voting at any regular or special election upon the proposition, and such city of the second class or village may by a majority vote at such election, vote bonds or taxes for the purpose of defraying the cost of such transmission line and con - nection tcith any person, firm, corporation or other city or village wifh </seg>

Such bonds may be issued only when a majority of the electors voting on the question favor their issuance. They shall bear interest, payable annually or semi-annually, at the rate of not to exceed six per cent per annum, and shall be payable any time the municipalities may determine at the time of their issuance, but in not more than Pnty years after their issuance. The council or board shall levy an - lly a sufficient tax to maintain, operate and extend any system or it, and to provide for the payment of the interest on, and principal any bonds that may have been issued as herein provided." Section 4394, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, per - f'ns to the construction of a plant outside the corporate limits a city of the second class or village, the purchase of right-of - ways, etc. Certain rules for the construction of statutes have been an - nounced by our supreme court. It has been repeatedly held : "Statutes in pari materia should be construed together." State v. Opela, 189 N. W. 159. In the case of State v. Board of County Commissioners of Douglas County, 109 Neb. 35, 189 N. W. 639, it was held : "Where two statutes are enacted at the same session and amend pre-existing statutes, the latter enactment prevails if irreconcilable." In the case of Little v. State, 60 Neb. 749, 84 N. W. 248, 51 L. R. A. 717, the supreme court held: "The object of all interpretation of law is to reach the true intent and meaning of the law-making authority." In the case of State v. Omaha Elevator Company, 75 Neb. 637, 106 N. W. 979, it was held : "All statutes on the same general subject are regarded as part of State v. Badherg. 103 Neb. 816, 189 N. W. 157. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">OPINIONS 223 one system, and later statutes are to be considered as supplementary to those preceding them on the same subject." In the case of State v. Cosgrave, 85 Neb. 187, 122 N. W. 885, 26 L. R. A. ns. 207, it was held : "To determine the meaning of the language of an act it is proper to examine the course of legislation upon the same general subject and consider in what connection it has theretofore been employed." Applying the foregoing rules of construction of the statutes to Sections 4396, 4188 and 4317, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, it is necessary that we consider these statutes together as constituting the law pertaining to the granting of a fran - chise or authorizing a city of the second class or villages to sell or authorize the sale of electrical energy to the inhabitants of such municipality. Section 4188 authorizes such municipality to grant a fran - chise to any person or corporation to construct and maintain pole lines and other structures for the purpose of furnishing electricity to the inhabitants thereof. This section further authorizes the village authorities to contract, lease or rent the plant from any person, firm or corporation, "but not for a period longer than five years." There is nothing in this section of the statute which re - quires that the proposition be submitted to the electors of such municipality before the board has authority to act. Section 4317 provides that any city of the second class or village is authorized and empowered to enter into a contract for the furnishing of electricity, or product of any system or plant owned and operated by such city or village to any person or corporation either within or without the corporate limits of such city or village. The statute further provides: . "Before any city of the second class or village shall make any con - tract with any person or corporation within or without such city or village for the furnishing of electricity, power, steam, or other product to such city or village, or any such municipal plant within such city or village, the question shall be submitted to the electors voting at any regular or special election upon the proposition, and such city of the </seg>

Section 4394 provides for the construction of such a plant uutnide of the corporate limit.-, of such municipality and re - quires a vote of the electors upon the proposition. Section 4390 is a general statute authorizing cities or vil - lages to purchase, construct or maintain lighting systems, etc. There is no provision in this statute which requires that the proposition be submitted to the electors before such lighting system may be constructed. The following sections provide for the levying of a tax not to exceed five mills on the dollar valua - tion in any one year for the purposes of paying for such plant. Section 4398 provides for the issuing of bonds for the purpose contemplated by such statute. Such bonds may be issued only when fiO per cent of the electors vote favorably for the issuance of the same. It is therefore the opinion of this department 1. That a city of the second class or village may, without submitting the proposition to a vote of the electors thereof, grant a franchise to a firm, person or corporation for a period not to exceed twenty-five years, authorizing such person, firm or corporation to construct, build and maintain an electric light plant within such municipality for the jjurpose of furnishing electricity for lighting the streets, alleys and public places of such city or municipality, and for furnishing the same to the inhabitants thereof. Such franchise must fix the amount that may be charged during such period for such electricity. Such municipality may contract, lease, or rent the plant from any persdh. firm or corporation furnishing electricity to such mu - nicipality, and such contract or lease shall not be for a longer period than five years. Where a city of the second class or village desires to grant a franchise to a person, firm or cor - poration, as above described, such municipality may reserve an option to purchase such plant at a price mutually agreed upon. </seg>

That a city of the second class or village may without submitting the proposition to a vote of the electors thereof, contract with a person, firm or corporation for the construction and erection of an electric light plant for such municipality and may levy a tax not to exceed five mills on the dollar valuation in anv one year to defray the cost of such utility. Where the obligation for the cost of building and equipping such electric light plant exists and is greater than five mills on the dollar valuation in any one year, the cost of constructing such tftility may l&gt;e defrayed by the issuance of bonds provided the question of issuing such bonds shall have been submitted to a vote of the electors of such municipality, and when sixty jier cent of the electors voting on the question favor their issuance. Where a municipality as aforesaid has granted a franchise to a corporation to construct and operate an electric light plant and such municipality has reserved an option to purchase such plant, and has insufficient funds for such purpose with the aid of making the levy of five mills on the dollar valuation, the question of exercising the option to purchase such land and is - suing bonds for the purpose of defraying the cost thereof, may be submitted to the electors at such time as the city desires to exercise its option. 3. Where a city of the second class or village de-ires to purchase or erect a power plant, electric or other light works. outside the corporate limits of such municipality, it is necessary that such municipality, before it shall contract with any person, firm or corporation relating to the erection of such proposed plant, shall submit the proposition to a vote of the electors in the manner provided by Article V, Section 4304. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. 4.

LB MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS— ELECTRIC LINES AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS Municipal corporations may not build for purpose of selling the same. March 5. 1925. Rev. M. F. Byrne, Emmet, Xebraska. Dear Reverend Byrne: Your favor of the 26th at hand. I understood from your former letter that the village of Emmet was intending to build a transmission line only. It ap - pears from your last letter that the village intends building a distributing system also. Under Section 4317, Compiled Stat - utes. 1022, covering the construction of transmission lines, it is sufficient that a majority vote for the bonds. Where it is the purpose to build a lighting system, a 60 per cent majority is necessary. (Section 4398.) It appears from your two letters and from the cases to which your letters give reference, that the proposition to vote bonds is as follows: The village is to vote bonds to be de - livered to the Tri-State Utilities Company in consideration of which the company is to build a transmission line from O'Neill to Emmet and to construct a distributing system within the </seg>
            <seg id="p227">OPINIONS 227 village. It is assumed that the line would be built before the bonds would actually be delivered. Then the transmission line (it is not clear whether the distributing system is also to be transferred) is to be transferred to the Tri-State Utilities Com - pany. This is to be done upon the agreement of the company to furnish current for lighting the village and to supply the residents thereof. The company also agrees to pay a. local trustee semi-annually 5y 2 per cent on the bonds. That being the rate, as I understand it, that the bonds will bear. It also agrees to pay a semi-annual amount, the exact figure not being stated, that invested at 4 per cent will amount to $8,000 in twenty years. It is supposed that the village will have nothing to pay except for light consumed in lighting the streets. The company provides in the contract a fixed schedule of rates for light, power, cooking, etc. It is not stated in either of your letters that the village would convey the property to the company. As you refer, however, to some other communities which you say have made similar arrangements, I have examined the history of the bonds of one of those communities and I take it that that is the arrangement, at least as to the transmission line. It does not appear in the bond record examined that the municipality had any security, not even a lien on the property conveyed, but accepted the unsecured promise of the company. The plan is contrary to law for the following reasons A. A municipal corporation is not authorized in Nebraska to issue bonds to pay for the building of an electric transmission line or distributing system for the purpose of disposing of the same. As a general rule property devoted to a public use can - not be sold or leased without special statutory authority. Sec - tion 4252 provides as follows: "Cities of second class and villages — sale of real estate. Cities of the second class and villages governed by this chapter shall be bodies corporate and politic, and ma] sue and be sued; contract or be con - tracted with; acquire, hold and convey property, real or personal; have a common seal which they may change and alter at pleasure; and such other powers as may be conferred by law: Provided, real property shall only be conveyed by the proper authorities of such city or village when so authorized by a vote of the electors thereof: Provided, how- </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 228 ever, when any city having more than one thousand inhabitants and less than five thousand inhabitants shall own real estate within or ad - joining the corporate limits of said city, and the electors thereof shall have authorized by a three-fifths vote that said land may be sold by the proper authorities of said city then said land may be sold in one tract, or in several, or it may be subdivided in the manner provided by law for the purpose of laying out any city or village, or any addition thereto, and if so subdivided the city shall comply with all of the laws and ordi - nances governing a private person who subdivides property for the same purpose: Provided, further, no tract, subdivision or lot so created shall be sold until said sale is authorized by a two-thirds vote of the city or village council or governing body." Under Section 4317 it is clear that the purpose of the sratute in providing for the building of an electric plant is that the municipality shall operate it. The last sentence of the pro - vision is as follows: "The council or board shall levy annually a sufficient tax to maintain, operate and extend any system or plant, and to provide for the payment of the interest on. and principal of. any bonds that may have been issued as herein provided." Likewise the concluding sentence of Section 4398 shows the same thing. It is as follows: "The council or board shall levy annually a sufficient tax to maintain, operate and extend any system or plant and to provide for the payment of the interest on. and principal of. any bowls that may have been issued as herein provided.'' B. A municipal lighting system may not be conveyed ex - cept as provided by statute. There appears to be no provision in the statute specifically authorizing the sale of this species of property. (\ A sale may not l)e made in any event by merely taking an unsecured promise to be performed far in the future. In the record examined, as above mentioned, the municipality did not even retain a vender's lien or take back a mortgage on the property conveyed, but turned it over to the company appar - ently without security. The language in that instance is a? follows : "Shall, at once, as soon as the electric transmission line is completed, deliver an instrument in writing conveying </seg>
            <seg id="p229">OPINIONS 229 i the title of said transmission line to the * * * company, its heirs or assigns, upon the payment of one dollar." The bonds of the municipality are. it is assumed, negotiable in form and pledge the credit of the municipality, its revenues and public property, for their payment. So whether or not the company carries out the terms of the contract, the municipality would have to pay the bonds. It would be exchanging its property for a mere promise performable far in the future. This certainly could not be considered as a sale in the usual course of business. D. There is no authority for the appointment of a trustee to receive the funds of the municipality. Village treasurer is the proper custodian of such funds. Furthermore no one knows whether or not 4 per cent can l)e realized and if it should not be realized, then there would be a difference between the amount paid by the village on the bonds and the amount received from the company. E. In the bond history examined, no time is fixed for the payment of the sinking fund to the trustee. The sale of munici - pal property could certainly not be lawfully made, that did not provide specifically for the time of payment. In addition to the reasons above set forth, it would seem that it would be far better as a matter of policy for the village to own the transmission line and simply make an agreement for the furnishing of current. I enclose herewith a copy of the Service Facilities and Physical Connection Act passed in 1923.

Parson, Mayor, Chadron, Nebraska, Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 24th instant stating that the ty of Chadron is a city of the first class, having a population over 5,000 inhabitants, and incorporated under the provisions of Chapter 44, Article I, Section 3972, et seq., Compiled Statutes qf Nebraska, 1922, and at the biennial election of your city held in 1922 one Fred O'Banion was elected city clerk and qualified as such. You further state that the city clerk resigned on August 3, 1925, and the mayor appointed the present incum - bent You inquire whether such appointment continues for the unexpired term or whether such vacancy should now be filled at the coming election. In reply you are informed that Section 2242, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, among other things provides: "Every civil office shall be vacant upon the happening of either of the following events at any time before the expiration of the term of such office, as follows: First: The resignation of the incumbent." Section 2244 provides for the manner for filling vacancies as follows: "In city and village offices, by the mayor and council or board of trustees." Section 2245, as amended- in 1923 Laws, page 153, provides: "Vacancies occurring in any state, judicial district, county, precinct, township or any public elective office thirty days prior to any general election shall be filled thereat." Section 3347, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides : "Appointments under the provisions of this chapter shall be in writ- </seg>
            <seg id="p231">OPINIONS 231 I ing and continue until the next election at which the vacancy can be filled, and until a successor is elected and qualified, and be filed with the secretary of state or proper township clerk, or proper county clerk, re - spectively." In the case of State v. Coleman, 91 Neb. 167, it was held : "By section 5759, Ann. St. 1911, it is provided that vacancies occur - ring in any state, judicial district, county, precinct, township or any public elective office, 30 days prior to any general election, shall be filled at such general election. Section 5757 provides: 'Appointments under the provisions of this chapter shall be in writing and continue until the next election at which the vacancy can be filled.' It therefore seems clear that, when the relator was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of his predecessor, his appointment held good until the next general election which was in November 1911, and if the pro - visions of Chapter 43, Laws 1911, operated to extend the term of the office until the 1st of January, 1913, the person chosen at that time would hold his office for the unerpired portion of the term." In the case of State, ex reh Cassel v. Sckroeder, 79 Neb. 759, it was held that one appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of alderman of a city of the first class holds only until the next general election which is the next election at which the vacancy can be filled, towit: the next regular municipal election. It is the opinion of the attorney general that where a vacancy occurs in the office of the city clerk of a city of the first class, having more than 6,000 population, it should be filled at the next general election, and the person appointed to hold office only holds the same until the successor is elected at the next general election of such city after the vacancy oc - curred in such office. LB MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS— POWER TO CONTRACT Where a municipality contracts with a person, firm or corporation for the furnishing of electricity and fixes the rate for the sale thereof to such municipality and the inhabitants thereof in the absence of a rate-making body, and subsequently thereafter the legislature creates a body for the fixing of rates of a public utility, such body </seg>

February 15, 1926. Hon. A. P. Voleman, Attorney at Law, Walthill, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 13th instant wherein you in - quire if the village of Walthill should sell and dispose of its electric light plant could a contract be entered into with the purchaser which could provide for the rate to be charged for supplying the citizens with current or whether the State Rail - way Commission would have jurisdiction to change or fix the rates. In reply you are informed that at present the State Rail - way Commission has no authority to fix or change rates for electric current furnished to municipalities. Decisions hold, however, that where a public utility has entered into a contract for a rate of current or service of such public utility and if afterwards a regulatory body is established with authority to change, fix or make rates, that such regulatory body may change the rates made pursuant to a contract with the private individ - r. The decisions hold that there is an implied agreement in making of any such contract with any public utility cor - poration that if a regulatory body is afterwards established, such body shall have the right to fix or change the rates regard - less of the contract price. For your information I direct your attention to the follow - ing cases: Ark. Nat. Gas Co. v. Ark. Ry. Com., 43 S. C. R. 387. Marquis v. Polk Tel. Co., 100 Neb 140 </seg>

LB MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS— RAILROADS Railroad cannot require village to remove water mains under tracks. September 17, 1925. Hon. Chan. A. Randall, Railway ( 'om m ixxioiter. Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Sir: I have examined the question which you submitted in refer - ence to the laying; of water mains by the village of Greenwood in its public streets and under the tracks of the Chicago, Bur - lington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company at that point. It appears that a water system is being constructed and that the company demands that the village execute a lease under the terms of which the company might cause the mains to l&gt;e removed upon thirty days notice. The village is not required to enter into a contract with the company nor has the company a right to demand that the vil - lage obligate itself to remove the mains upon thirty days notice.

MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS— RIGHT TO SELL EXCESS ELECTRIC ENERGY A municipal corporation may sell electric energy to persons living be - yond the corporate limits of such municipality where there is an excess amount of current produced by the plant of such municipal - ity. January 29, 1925. Mr. W. F. Ellis, Ever City, Nebraska. r Sir: You ask whether or not your municipally-owned electric light plant may furnish current to farmers and others in the immediate vicinity but outside the corporate limits. You also ask whether or not a transmission line, built by certain farmers, may be attached to the city plant for current. Your letter was referred back to the Railway Commission and presumed that it had been answered, but it has just been returned to us with the suggestion that they preferred that we answer the letter. Under the provisions of Section 4317, Compiled 1 Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, it is our opinion that if your plant furnishes an excess amount of current that the same may be disposed of to any other person or corporation whether within or outside the corporate limits, under the conditions prescribed by the sec - tions cited. This does not mean that you are required to fur - nish current but that you may contract as provided by law. LB </seg>

May 5, 1925. Mr. Dyo F. Davis, Village Clerk, Silver Creek, Nebraska Dear Sir: In reply to your recent inquiry you are informed that Section 4320, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that certificates of election for all officers of cities and villages shall be made out under the corporate seal by the city council or board of trustees at their first meeting after any election of such officers. In the case of Hotchl-iss v. Keck, 86 Neb. 322, 125 N. W. 509, the court held : "Under the statute cited above it was the duty of the board of trustees to determine whether the respondents who were candidates at that election had been duly elected, and if they had been, to issue their certificates to that effect which would give the officers so elected prima facie right to the office. There is no doubt that if the officers wilfully refused to canvass the votes and certify the result, and the right of the candidates elected was clear, the officers could be compelled by man - damus to canvass the returns and issue the certificates of election." You state that there were three vacancies to be filled on the village board of trustees and there were four candidates on the ballot and the name of one more person was written in on the ballots. You are informed that the voter has the right to write in the name of any person as candidate for any office and the writing in of such name signifies the intention of the voter to vote for such person unless he has otherwise marked his ballot </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENE HAL and if the voter fails to make a cross in front of the name so written in, does not invalidate the ballot inasmuch as the law presumes that the" person intended to vote for the person who-** name was written in and should be counted for such candidate.

In reply we direct your attention to Article V. Section JI138, et seq., providing for the preparation of ballots and the manner of placing the names of the candidates upon such bal - lots. This is a general statute applicable to both state and municipal elections. Section 15)45 provides: "In each division, and beneath all candidates placed there by nomi - nation or petition, a blank space shall be provided, into which electors may write the name of any person for whom they wish to vote and whose name is not printed upon the ballot." </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The statutes do not prohibit the withdrawal of the name of any candidate. Section 4041 provides: "The qualifications of electors in the several wards shall be the same as that required for electors under the laws of the state. At a meeting of the council on the first Monday after any city election the Purn shall be canvassed and they shall cause the clerk to make out and Iver certificates of election to the person found to be elected, and a ;lect of any such officer to qualify within ten days after the delivery him of such certificate shall be deemed a refusal to accept the office to which he may have been elected." It is therefore our opinion that where a person has ac - cepted the nomination as candidate for the office of city council - man in a city of the first class, such person may withdraw as such candidate for such office prior to election and if he fails to qualify in a manner provided by law after election, such office may be declared vacant. It is further our opinion that a blank space should be left in each division beneath the names of the candidates within which the electors may write in the name of any person for whom they wish to vote as candidate for such office.

Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1J)22. provides among other things: "The treasurer of each city and village shall be the custodian of all money belonging to the corporation." And Section 4370.

Section 4052. Compiled Statutes.

The city treasurer shall prepare all paving and curb tax lists, and shall collect all paving and curb taxes; and for preparing said paving and curb tax list and collecting the paving and curb taxes; the mayor and council may allow such reason - able compensation in addition to the salary provided for by ordinance as they may determine, not exceeding the sum of $400 in any one year." In view of this provision we l&gt;elieve that the compensation of the city treasurer for collecting paving and curb taxes should be fixed by the mayor and council at such reasonable amount as they may determine, not exceeding $400 per year. The city treasurer may also appoint a delinquent tax collector to collect other taxes than paving and curb taxes, upon which collections the delinquent tax collector may receive 'such per cent as may l&gt;e fixed by the city council, not to exceed the fees allowed by law to the county treasurer for like services.

LD JUSTICE OF PEACE— AFFECTED BY ANNEXATION OF TERRITORY Annexation of a municipality to one of higher class as affecting and abolishing the office of justice of the peace within the annexed ter - ritory. October 18. 19-26. Mr. I. T. Henxey. Bethany, Nebraska Dear Sir You ask our advice in connection with the following situation Bethany. Nebr., was recently annexed to and became a part of the city of Lincoln, a city of more than 40,000 population and less than 100,000 population. It was our understanding that you elected a justice of peace under the provisions of Chapter 152. Session Laws for 1923. which provides in effect that in each precinct in counties not under township organiza - tion there sharll be elected a justice of peace, and also a justice of peace in each city or village within the precinct having 500 inhabitants or more. This law seems to provide for two jus - tices of peace within precincts having cities or villages therein of more than .")00 inhabitants. Evidently you have exercised your jurisdiction within your precinct. The question now arises since the annexation of the city of Bethany to the city of Lincoln whether or not your office as justice of peace has been entirely abolished. In this connection we call your attention to Section 379*2, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and companion sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL tions. which hold that the government of the city to which the territory is annexed shall extend over the annexed territory. So far as we have l&gt;een able to determine, we find no section of the statute or any decision which entirely covers your inquiry. No express provision of law seems to apply to justices of peace in such connection. Although certain city employees are taken into the employ of the city to which the territory is annexed, this does not cover the office of justice of peace. In fact Chap - ter 15*2 heretofore mentioned specifically provides that municipal courts in cities of the class of the city of Lincoln shall be sub - stitued for the office of justice of peace and police judge within such cities. This indicates that after Bethany becomes a part of the city of Lincoln that no justice of the peace will have jxiwer to exercise jurisdiction within the territorial limits of the city of Lincoln. These enactments of the legislature seem to be within the legislative powers, and the supreme court has so construed the law and the provisions of the constitution in State ex rel Bunce v. Knhat, 110 Xeb. 362. This case, however, does not entirely settle the question which you have asked us. While the matter i&gt; not entirely free from doubt, yet we suggest that you con - tinue to hold your office and exercise its functions and duties in the precinct for which you are elected, but outside the terri - torial limits of the city of Lincoln, until such, time as it shall be declared by law that your office has been entirely abolished. Our conclusion is based upon the reluctance which the courts have /to declare a forfeiture in any connection. It is fur - ther based upon our conclusion that we should construe the law if possible favorably to your continuance in office, and that we should not conclude that the office has been abolished in the absence of some express statute or decision of the courts.

Dear Judge Hartman: We have your favor of the 9th instant referring to the provision of our statutes which provides that a penalty of $50 shall be assessed for each chicken killed in violation of the game laws and you inquire if a police magistrate may assess and fine in excess of $100 where a large number of birds have been killed by a person in violation of law. In reply we direct your attention to the statement of the rule concerning the jursidiction of justices of the peace as an - nounced by the author in Volume 16, C. J., page 157, Section 182, wherein it is stated: "The combining of a number of offenses in an information before a justice of the peace is not violative of a constitutional provision giving the justice jurisdiction in criminal cases in which the punishment does not exceed a certain sum. Where jurisdiction is given over a particular crime by name, a subsequent change of penalty does not oust the court of jurisdiction." This statement of the law is based upon decisions of the supreme court of Iowa in the case of State v. Denhardt, 129 la. 135, 105 N.

We note your statement wherein you say that you do not think magistrates have jurisdiction to try and determine liquor cases and impose both fine and imprisonment on account of Section 3-287. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. The second paragraph of this section provides: "Magistrates and police courts are hereby vested with jurisdiction to try without a jury all violations of this act and of all such ordinances wherein the penalty does not exceed a fine of one hundred dollars or imprisonment for a period of three months, and upon the conviction such magistrates and police judges shall impose sentence." </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It is our opinion that this section merely restricts the right of a magistrate to try all violations of this act and of such ordinances wherein the penalty doex not exceed a fine of $100 or 'mi prisonment for a period of three months. This section of the statute does not apply to all violations of the prohibitory law but to such violations of the same wherein the penalty is not more than $100 or the imprisonment does not exceed three months. The constitutionality of this act was upheld in the case of Bell v. State, 104 Xeb. 203. Section 9089, Compiled Statutes of 1922, as amended by Senate File Xo. 9. Chapter 57. page 213. Session Laws of 1935, provides: "Magistrates shall have jurisdiction concurrent with the District Court and co-extensive with their respective counties, in all criminal cases where the punishment can not exceed three months imprisonment, and a fine of one hundred dollars, or both, except as otherwise provided Section 9990, Compiled Statutes of 1922, provides: "In all cases where the magistrate shall have jurisdiction to try and sentence or finally discharge as described in the preceding section, the charge made against the defendant shall be distinctly read to him, and he shall be required to plead thereto, which plea the magistrate shall enter upon his docket. If the defendant refuse to plead, the magis - trate shall enter the fact, with a plea of 'not guilty' in his behalf." Section 9991, Compiled Statutes of 1922. provides "After the plea of the defendant has been entered, if he plead not guilty, the defendant or complainant, or the county attorney, if he be present, may demand a jury; but if no jury be demanded, the cause may be tried by the magistrate." Section 18 of Article V of the amended Constitution in part provides : "Justice of the Peace shall * * • have and exercise such juris - diction as may be provided by law; but no justice of the peace shall Sve jurisdiction * * * in a criminal case where the punishment ly exceed three months imprisonment and a fine of over $100 or both; • » •" </seg>

It is our opinion that Section 9989 as amended by Senate File Xo. 9, Session Laws of 1925, gives magistrates within a county concurrent jurisdiction with the district court in all criminal cases where punishment cannot exceed three months imprisonment' and a fine of one hundred dollars, or both, and there is nothing within the prohibitory laws which restricts jurisdiction of magistrates in the exercise of jurisdiction over violations thereof: Section 3287 merely gives magistrates the right to try with - out a jury such violations of the prohibitory law where the penalty does not exceed one hundred dollars fine or where im - prisonment shall be for a period of three months. Where the fine exceeds one hundred dollars or the imprisonment exceeds three months or where the penalty shall include both fine and imprisonment, if a jury be demanded, such alleged violation of the act may then be tried before a magistrate and the jury. Section 9988, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. as amended by Chapter 102. Senate File Xo. 8. page 291. Session Laws of 1925, provides: "When the complaint is for a misdemeanor only of any grade of punishment whatever, if the cause is pending before the County Judge of the county, before whom the defendant enters a plea of guilty to the complaint, it shall be lawful for such judge to render judgment of im - prisonment not to exceed six months, or a fine not to exceed five hun - dred dollars, or both, according to the law of the case, and pass sentence accordingly, and to enforce the same accordingly to law." It is our opinion that this statute gives to the county court special jurisdiction greater than the jurisdiction of a magistrate in cases where the defendant enters a plea of guilty and au - thorizes, in such particular cases, the county court to sentence such person, wherein the judgment or imprisonment does not </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 exceed six months or a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars, or both. The writer holds very high regard for the opinion of your honor, but after a conference of the several persons in this de - partment, we are constrained to take a different view of Section 3287 than the opinion of your Jionor, and in view of the statutes a-bove cited and the provisions of the Constitution providing for jurisdiction of the magistrates and the county courts, it is our opinion that magistrates have jurisdiction to try and determine cases arising under the liquor law where the punishment cannot exceed three months imprisonment and a fine of one hundred dollars, or both. It is our opinion that under the provisions of Senate File No. 8, amending Section 9988, the county court has special juris - diction in such cases where a plea of guilty to render judgment of imprisonment not to exceed six months, or a fine not to ex - ceed five hundred dollars, or both, and pass sentence accord - ingly, but this would not give the county court the right to hear and determine violations of the liquor law where the judgment would exceed that of a magistrate.

            <seg id="p254">254 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL Article 1 of Section 7 of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska provides: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, sup - ported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized." The prohibitory law provides for the issuance of search warrants. Section 3273, Compiled Statutes for 1922, provides that where any officer of the county or state or any creditable resident freeholder of the county makes complaint before any police, municipal, or county judge, or justice of the peace, in writing and on oath, that he has reason to believe and does believe that any intoxicating liquor, describing it as particularly as may be in the complaint, is in the county in any place de - scribed, unlawfully owned or kept by any person named or de - scribed, or is intended to be or is being by the person named or described in the complaint manufactured, sold, kept for sale or disposition in violation of this act, said magistrate shall, upon the filing of such complaint, And believing there is probable cause therefor, issue his warrant for a search of the premises described, and the arrest of the person named or described therein. It would appear that a warrant may be issued for the search of certain described premises and may describe the person in possession of said premises as John Doe where the true and correct name of such person is unknown, but the person should be particularly described.

October 31, 1925. Hon. W. H. Weekes, Norfolk Press, Norfolk, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Weekes: In your recent letter you state : "Just at this time of the year there is a pretty general dis - cussion as to what is the legal rate for publication of the delinquent tax notice, and opinions seem to vary on this sub - ject: "Our county treasurer holds the old fee to still be in force and I think he bases his idea on the last part of Section 6116, which mentions the old fee of twenty cents for each notice which can be collected from the delinquent. The most of the publishers of the state contend that the second paragraph of Section 2407 as shown by the Session Laws of 1921, page 682, repeals 'all laws in conflict herewith' which might be taken to include the tax list along with the rest. "Our county treasurer publishes the enclosed notice at the head of the list and will, I understand, insist on the payment of the publication in accordance with his price of 'ten cents for each description' which, we think, is in variance with Section 2407. "Will you kindly let me know which you consider to be right ? This matter has been threshed out in the different coun - ties of our state ever since the new law has been in force and some counties pay the publisher under the new law (Section 2407) and some others hold the old price. It seems there should </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL be more unanimity on this and I would appreciate your opinion on the subject." In answer to your inquiry permit me to suggest that in my opinion Section (5052, Compiled Statutes. 1922. is still in force and effect and is not repealed by the repealing clause of Section 2407, Session Laws of 1921, page 082. Section C052 provides as "The county treasurer shall cause the list and accompanying notice to be published once a week for three consecutive weeks prior to the date of sale, commencing the first week in October, in a newspaper printed in the English language and published in such county, having a general circulation therein, which newspaper shall be designated by the county board. The county treasurer shall also cause to be posted up in some conspicuous place in his office a copy of the list and notice. The treasurer shall add to each description of land so advertised, other than town lots, the sum of twenty cents and for each town lot the sum of ten cents, to defray the expenses of advertising, which sum shall be added to the total amount due on such land or town lot for taxes and collected in the same manner as taxes." In view of said section in my opinion the fees for publica - tion of such tax list are twenty cents for each description of land other than town lots and ten cents for each town lot. OSS NEWSPAPERS— SUBSCRIPTION Newspapers have no right to collect for papers after the subscription has expired. March 5. 1920. Mr. L. (i. liapp St. Edward. Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not newspapers have a right to col - lect for papers mailed or sent after the subscription has ex- pired. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">OPINIONS 257 We will say that under the provisions of Section 4810, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, that we do not believe that collection can be enforced after the subscription has ex - pired. If, however, there has been a new order constituting a renewal of the subscription, the contrary rule would be true. We do not believe, however, that any newspaper publisher can make a contract merely by running in his newspaper the item referred to and enclosed in your letter of March 4th. Section 4810, aforesaid, is as follows: "No person in this state shall be compelled to pay for any news - paper, magazine or other publication which shall be mailed or sent to him without his having subscribed for or ordered same, or which shall be mailed or sent to him after the time of his subscription or order therefor has expired, notwithstanding he has received the same." LD NOTARY PUBLIC Change of name through marriage by a lady who is a notary public does not terminate her commission as such notary, but if the same seal and commission are used a record of such change in name should be made in the office of the Secretary of State and such notary should designate her present and former names when sign - ing as such officer. Miss Grace Berr/er, County Clerk, Omaha, Xebraxka. You inquire if a lady, who is a notary public, and who changes her name by marriage, can continue to use the same seal until her commission expires. In my opinion marriage does not terminate such commission, but if the same seal and com - mission are used it would be wise to have a record made of the change in name in the office of the secretary of state, and each February C&gt;, 1926. Dear Madam : </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL I time such notary uses the commission and seal she should sign her present name and use after the name the word "formerly" and then sign the name in which the commission was taken, or she could sign as Mary (nee) Jones (now) Smith. Unless this is done in one form or other or in some form, which will clearly designate the person receiving the original commission, I would advise against the use of such commission and seal, in view of the importance of the matter to a'bstracters and the convenience for all concerned in titles to property and other matters affected thereby. Ob© PUBLIC OFFICIALS— FEES AND SALARIES Clerks of the district court are required to file reports on the first Tues - day in January, April, July and October of each year and to pay over to the county treasurer all fees in excess of the amount allowed by law to be retained by such officer. July 14, 1925. Maude Jackman, Clerk District Court, Ord, Nebraska. Dear Madam : We have your favor of the 11th instant inquiring if you, as clerk of the district court, should account to the board of county commissioners for the fees collected by your office, and further inquire if you should remit for all excess fees in excess of the salary allowed you. In reply we direct you to Section 2369, Compiled Statutes of 1922, which in part provides: "If the fees of said clerk shall exceed two thousand dollars per annum in counties having less than sixteen thousand inhabitants, * * * said clerk shall pay such excess into the treasury of the county in which he holds office; Provided, also, the clerk of the district court of each county shall, on the first Tuesday of January, April, July and October of each year, make a report to the county board under oath, </seg>

Section 2370, Compiled Statutes of 1922, provides : "The clerk of the district court shall receive a salary in addition to the fees provided for his office as follows: In counties having a popula - tion of over seven thousand and of less than seventeen thousand, four hundred dollars per annum; in counties having a population of seven - teen thousand to fifty thousand, six hundred dollars per annum; in counties having a population of fifty thousand and upwards, one thou - sand dollars per annum; which salary shall be paid quarterly out of the general fund of the county and be entered on his fee book and accounted for in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as other fees: Provided, that in all counties in which the fees of the office may be in excess of the amounts fixed by law which the clerk is entitled to retain as compensation, he shall in no case retain to his own use any fees, revenues, perquisites or receipts from whatsoever source, that may come to him by virtue of holding said office, but shall account for and pay the same into the treasury of the county: Provided, further, that nothing herein enacted shall authorize any clerk of the district court to retain such fees, from whatever source received, in excess of the amount fixed by law as the compensation of the office or affect the right of any county to recover such fees not yet paid into its treasury." Section 2396, Compiled Statutes of 1922, in part provides: "All county officers who now make report, as required by law, of the amount of fees received, shall make reports on the first Tuesday in January, April, July and October of each year to the board of county commissioners under oath showing the different items of fees received, from whom, at what time, for what service and the total amount of fees received by such officer since the last report and also the amount re - ceived for the current year, and pay over to the county treasurer of the proper county all money in their hands in excess of the amount allowed by law to be retained by them, and such officer shall take the receipt of the county treasurer therefor. No county officer shall be entitled to draw in any one month more than one-twelfth of the total annual salary, unless he shall have failed to have drawn a pro rata share during a previous month, and that upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of any incumbent of a fee office, such officer or his personal repre - sentative, in case of the decease of said officer, shall retain, of the fees of the office, only such proportion of the yearly compensation allowed by law, as the time actually served shall bear to the whole year, and any excess or such pro rata amount shall be paid over to the county treas - urer of the proper county." </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It is therefore the opinion of the attorney general that statutes in materia partis should be construed together and con - struing the above quoted statutes together, it is our opinion that clerks of the district court are required to file reports on the first Tuesday in January, April, July and October of each year, showing the amount of all fees received by such officer, and where there is an excess of the amount allowed by law to be retained by such officer, that such excess should be paid over to the county treasurer of such county. LB PUBLIC OFFICIALS— INTEREST ON PUBLIC FUNDS Public officials are required to account for all interest received by such official upon the funds coming into his custody. March 17, 1925. Mr. C. B. Remington, Public Accountant, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your recent inquiry asking that if a public official is required to account to the public for the interest received by him upon funds coming into his custody as such official. In reply we direct your attention to Volume 22, R. C. L., Section 131, wherein the author states the rule as follows: "The question whether an officer having custody of public funds who receives interest from the use or loaning of such funds may retain the interest as his own seems to have depended in many cases on the fur - ther question as to the nature of the liability of the officer who has charge of the public funds. In some jurisdictions this liability is held to be absolute, and it seems he has even been considered the absolute owner thereof. In these jurisdictions, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the interest accruing on such public funds is considered as be - longing to the public officer. But the weight of authority is in favor of the view that the ownership of public funds does not pass to the cus - todian, and therefore that a public officer is bound to account for inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p261">OPINION'S 261 &lt; est which he receives on money which comes into his hands by virtue of his office. Where the officer is prohibited by law from receiving any interest from any bank for the use or deposit of public moneys the reasons for permitting the custodian to retain the interest no longer apply, and he must account therefor. But the courts are not uniform in their views on this point, and it has also been held that although a statute forbids an officer to lend the funds in his hands, nevertheless, if he receives interest, it cannot be recovered from him. Where the clerk of a court receives interest on money in his custody which has been paid into court he may be required to pay the amount of such interest to the party entitled to the money tendered." We further direct your attention to the case of Rhea v. Brewster et al., 130 Iowa. 729, 107 N. W. 940, 8 Ann. Cas. 389, wherein the court said after reviewing the number of cases, as follows : "The true test, as it seems to us, is not whether he is absolutely liable to account, but whether he is the owner of the funds in his hands. If he is not such owner and the moneys coming into his hands belong to the county or some one else, any increment thereto is and should be treated as a part of the principal. This is the view approved in the better considered cases, and the only one consonant with sound public policy. In an early New York case (Board of Supervisors v. Wandel, 6 Lans. (N. T.) 33; Id., 59 N. T. 645) a county treasurer was held liable for the interest received by him on county funds, not only because of his fiduciary relation, but for the interest belonging to the county, the court saying: 'The notion that a public officer who would keep back interest which he has received upon a deposit of public moneys as a prerequisite of office, is an affront to the law and morals; if done with evil intent it is nothing less than embezzlement. Having been received by Wandel as county treasurer, the item of interest is within the terms of the bond. 1 See, also Hughes v. People, 82 111. 78; United States v. Mosby, 133 U. S. 273, 10 Sup. Ct. 327, 33 L. Ed. 625; Hunt v. 8tate, 124 Ind. 306, 24 N. E. 887. Eshelby v. Board of Education, (Ohio) 63 N. E. 586, was an action against a school treasurer for interest received by him, and in adjudg - ing him liable therefor, the court said: 'Whether he should be regarded as "a bailee with express and extraordinary liabilities," or as a "special trustee," is not material; for he is in either view the custodian of funds which belong to another. Since the funds belong to the school district, the ultimate question in the case is answered in favor of the defendant in error by the elementary proposition that, in the absence of a statute or stipulation to the contrary, the increment follows the principal. It does not aid an inquiry as to what the law is to suggest that the district would not be injured by the deposit of Its funds at interest payable to the custodian, since he may deposit it without interest. The suggestion </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL appear to have been favorably considered by the Legislature, it has indicated that, while he may deposit it, he may not in any manner invest it. The .safety of public funds has been the chief object of care. For their security the law employs the character and ability of the treasurer and the security which is afforded by his official bond. It has not been thought expedient to establish a policy which would give to the treasurer any personal motive in selecting a place of deposit, nor does the case suggest any reason why it should be regarded as an ex - ception to the rule that a public officer shall receive such compensation only as is expressly provided for.' " "State v. McFetridge, (Wis) 54 N. W. 1098, 20 L. R. A. 223, was an action againsl'the treasurer of the state for interest received on deposits in banks, and after holding the money, although deposited by the treas - urer, belonged to the state, the court in referring to the authorities first cited said: 'The foregoing seem to be the cases most relied upon to sus - tain the proposition that Treasurer McFetridge and his sureties are re - lieved from liability on his official bond for the interest claimed, because of his absolute liability to the state for the public funds received by him by virtue of his office. With all due deference to the able courts which have asserted or intimated the existence of the alleged rule under con - sideration, we are constrained to say that, in our opinion, they have failed to demonstrate, either by authority or upon principle, that the same has any place in our jurisprudence. It has already been held herein that the public funds were lawfully deposited by Treasurer Mc- Fetridge with the banks, and that he lawfully received from such banks compensation by way of interest for the use of such deposits. Under these circumstances, and in the absence of any statute separating the interest from the fund and diverting it to other uses, such interest was an accretion or incrament to the fund, thus becoming a part of it, and logically and necessarily belongs to the owner of the fund, to-wit, the state. It is immaterial that the treasurer stipulated for interest on the deposits, or that the banks paid him such interest without stipu - lation; both the treasurer and the banks intending that he should retain the same as his own, and believing that he was entitled thereto. Such intention and belief cannot affect the ownership of the interest, or its essential character as to a portion of the public funds in the hands of the treasurer. Notwithstanding such intention and belief, the interest was, in fact, paid to the State Treasurer and belonged to his said office, within the meaning and intention of the bond in suit. A law - ful act cannot be rendered unlawful merely because the actors intended to follow it by an unlawful act. So. tchen the treasurer lawfully receives money which of right belongs to his office, he receives it by virtue of his office, and cannot, by forming and executing an intention to retain the money as his own. divest the. act of receiving the money of its official </seg>
            <seg id="p263">OPINIONS 263 a most salutary rule, which should never be departed from unless clearly abrogated by some statute.' " Therefore it is our opinion that where a public official law - fully receives money which of right belongs to his office, and invests or deposits such funds so that an increment is earned, that such increase is public funds and such official must account to the public for the principal and all increase thereon unless there is some statutory authority authorizing such official to retain such increment as a part of the compensation for his office. LB PURE FOOD LAW— MISBRANDING Whether coupon on wrapper of package of oleomargarine announcing prizes for certain numbers of such coupons constitute a violation of misbranding provisions of Section 7429, Compiled Statutes for 1922, is doubtful. December 15, 1925. Honorable N. P. ffansen, Chief, Bureau of Food, Drugs and Oils, Department of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Hansen : In your letter of December 7th you say "At the request of Mr. McLaughlin, I am asking for an opinion from your department on the enclosed wrapper of oleomargarine as to whether or not such a wrapper would pass the Pure Food Law, Section 4, Misbranding defined in Paragraph 6, 'If in case of food products, there be contained in the package any gifts, premiums or prizes, or articles other than the food purported to be contained whether or not declared by label.'" Paragraph 6, which you refer to, is Section 7429, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. This paragraph was formerly part of Section 2537, Revised Statutes for 1913, and read: </seg>
            <seg id="p264">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 264 "Sixth.— In case of food products, if there be contained in the pack - age any gift, premiums or prizes." This wording of the section was in force at the time our court passed upon this question, or a similar question, in re Joseph DeKlotz v. Gns A. Hyers, Sheriff, 98 Neb. 861. In this case there was placed in the package a narrow slip of thin paper with the printed statement: "This coupon will be accepted by us, with others, in full payment (or the many beautiful and costly articles described in our handsomely illustrated catalogue upon conditions stated thereon." A short statement was substantially to the same effect, and printed on the back. The court held that if the slip of paper had not been placed in the package it would not have been un - lawful to give it to the buyer. The state chemist testified the slip or coupon in no way affected the wholesomeness of the food and was of unappreciable weight, and unlike toys which had been placed in other packages and which altered the weight of actual food, etc., and which packages were held to be mis - branded. Our court in the De Klotz case said : "But there is no prohibition in the statute upon the placing of ad - vertising matter in a food package. In fact, common experience shows that many packages of food products contain printed matter advertising either the included product or other articles sold by the same manufac - turer or jobber. Ordinarily there can be no distinction with respect to weight or healthfulness between printed slips of paper. There seems to be no reasonable basis of classification which will permit a package to be declared misbranded which contains one form of printed slip, and an - other package not misbranded when it contains a like printed slip of paper, merely because its words convey a different meaning. Such an artificial distinction cannot legally be made." In 1921 the statute was amended to read as follows: "Sixth. — If, in case of food products, there be contained in the pack - age any gifts, premiums or prizes, or articles other than the food pur - ported to be contained whether or not declared by label." The questions presented are : Is the coupon of the wrapper submitted "an article" as the term "article" is used in the amendment to paragraph 6, and is the coupon "in" the package ? </seg>
            <seg id="p265">OPINIONS 265 Neither of these questions is free from doubt in the absence of a court decision on the nineteenth and twenty-first amend - ment. Webster, in defining "article" says, among other things, it means: "A brief composition, a paper, as an artiele in the morning daily, a distinct portion or member, a single clause, item or particular, a concise statement, a prose composition, complete in itself, etc." Assuming that a court might reasonably hold the coupon to be "an article" within the meaning of the law, the next ques - tion as to whether the coupon is "in" the package presents fur - ther difficulty. It certainly is not "inside" of the package, and yet it is a part of the package. One court, in construing "in" has held : "Where the indictment charged that accused unlawfully shot a pistol 'while in a passenger car', and the evidence showed that he dis - charged the pistol while on the steps of the car, the variance was not material, the words 'in the car' as used in Pen. Code 1895, Par. 511, as amended by Acts 1905, pg. 86, being equivalent to 'on the car.' Andrews v. State, 70 S. E. 111. 112, 8 Ga. App. 700." There is much doubt in my opinion as to the ability of the state to maintain successful prosecution in this instance under the misbranding section. Placing a prize coupon on the wrapper in such form seems to be mere subterfuge and an effort to avoid the letter of the law. While the companies pursuing such course might not be technically liable under the law, I cannot recom - mend such procedure nor promise that they would be exempt from prosecution in pursuing such course. I do recommend that you urge further amendment of the law by the legislature so there can be no question on this- point. OSS </seg>

LB PARDON AND PAROLE The constitutional provision providing for the Board of Pardons and the act of the Legislature creating the Board of Pardons by implication repeals Section 10208, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. No prisoner may be released from the county jail except by an order from the Board of Pardons and Paroles. September 13, 1926. Mr. Edwin M. Burr, Central City, Xebraska. Dear Mr. Burr: We have your favor of the 11th instant inquiring as to the sufficiency of a certificate of a county physician employed by the county board for the purposes of treating persons confined in the county jail and direct our attention to Section 10208, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 192:2. and you further inquire as to when a sentence begins to run, when such sentence has been finished and if the release of a prisoner before the expiration of a sentence for medical treatment releases such person from serv - ing the balance of his sentence, and if the jailer refuses to re - lease a prisoner, is the county liable for any injury the prisoner suffers while confined in jail? Section 10208, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, seems to authorize a jailer to release a prisoner upon his cer - tificate from the county physician employed to treat persons confined in jail and to authorize the jailer to give such persons different treatment than is provided for in the sentence and to discharge the prisoner. This section reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p268">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 268 "When the physician regularly employed to have the medical care of persons in a county jail shall certify in writing to the jailer that the health or safety of any convict confined in such jail requires that he be treated in a manner different from that prescribed by the sentence of such convict, such jailer shall render to the convict such other and dif - ferent treatment as shall be specified in such certificate as necessary, and may discharge him altogether if required by such certificate; Provided, such physician be one employed for such medical care by the approval of the county board." This section was passed at a session of the legislature in 1873 as a part of the criminal code of this state. This statute was enacted prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1875 and the amended Constitution of 1920. The statute as it now appears is in the identical language as when adopted. It ap - pears to us, however, that this statute has been repealed by im - plication by the adoption of the 1920 amended Constitution of Nebraska, which became effective on January 1, 1921. Section 13 of Article IV, Constitution of 1920, provides for a Board of Pardons and Paroles as follows: "The Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State shall con - stitute a board to be known as the Board of Pardons, of which the Gov - ernor shall be chairman. Said board, or a majority thereof, shall have power to remit fines and forfeitures and to grant commutations, pardons and paroles after conviction and judgment, under such conditions as may be prescribed by law, for any offenses committed against the criminal laws of this state except treason and cases of impeachment. But no fine or forfeiture shall be remitted, and no commutation, pardon or parole granted except upon the approval of a majority of the board after a full hearing in open session, and not until notice of the time and place of such hearing, and of the relief sought, shall have been given by personal service thereof upon the judge of the court by which the sentence was pronounced and the county attorney of the county where the offense was committed. Provided, however, the Governor shall have power to grant respites or reprieves in all cases of conviction for offenses against the laws of the state, except treason and cases of impeachment, but such Cites or reprieves shall not extend beyond the next meeting of the rd of Pardons, and in no case for a greater period than thirty days. The proceedings and decisions shall be reduced to writing, and with the reasons for such action in each case, signed by the members of the trd concurring therein, and with all papers used upon the hearing, luding the dissent of any member who may not concur, shall be filed the office of the Secretary of State.

The board shall have power to suspend the execu - tion of the sentence imposed for treason until the case can be reported to the Legislature at its next session, when the Legislature shall either grant a pardon, or commute the sentence or direct the execution, or grant a further reprieve." Section 1 of Article XVII of the Constitution in part provides : "All laws then in force, not inconsistent with this constitution as amended by such proposals as may be adopted at such election, shall continue in force until amended or repealed." The 1921 session of the legislature adopted a statute and provided the procedure providing for a Board of Pardons and Paroles to comply with the foregoing constitutional provision. This statute was enacted as Senate File Xo. 282. Chapter 182, Session Laws of 1921. and now appears as Chapter 37. Section 10229 et seq.. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. Section 10233 thereof provides: "The board of pardons shall have jurisdiction to grant or deny pardons, paroles, commutations, reprieves and the remission of fines or forfeitures.

Dear Mr. Bennett: You inquire whether or not there is any law to prevent peddlers and solicitors from selling house to house. We have a state law pertaining to the occupation of ped - dlers. It is Section 5947 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. This statute, however, applies to peddlers plying their vocation outside of the limits of a city or town. It applies only in the county outside of municipalities. We know of no state law pertaining to peddlers within the limits of municipalities. The occupation within those limits is left for regulation by ordinance by the respective municipalities. You state that your village has such an ordinance. The attorney general's depart - ment passed upon this proposition some years ago. The con - clusion was that cities and villages have the power to license and regulate and tax hawkers and peddlers. This is provided for by Section 4197, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as applied to cities of the second class. Such cities also have a right to levy an occupation tax within the limits of the city. It is possible that your difficulty arises in ascertaining who is a hawker or peddler. It has been held that a person who is merely obtaining orders for goods by the display of goods and who does not deliver the goods at the time of selling is not a peddler. 21 R. C. L. 184; Scribner v. Moore, 90 Neb. 21. We believe also that the definition of a peddler was not intended to exclude any persons who might merely take an order and then go outside and in a few minutes bring in the merchandise. We believe that the exclusion has meant to apply only to persons who in good faith take orders for future de - livery and was not meant to include present delivery with the </seg>
            <seg id="p273">OPINIONS 273 taking of the orders, although there might be an interim be - tween taking the sale and delivery of the goods of a few min - utes or even a few hours. We believe it is meant to cover cases where the goods are not present for delivery and will be shipped upon the order. There is also an exception apparently as to orders taken for goods which are to be shipped from one state to another inas - much as such transactions are connected with the subject of interstate commerce which subject is one for federal legislation. In this connection we call your attention to the case of Cren - shaw v. Arkansas. 227 U. S. 390, wherein the supreme court held that a tax on peddlers who sell and forthwith deliver goods is within the police power of the state, but a tax on one which merely solicits orders to be shipped from out of the state into the state where the sale takes place relates to interstate commerce. LD RA ILRO ADS— ELECTRIC LINES— CROSSING Railroad company cannot require electric company to agree that line will be removed on thirty days notice. Crossing must be con - structed in accordance with regulation adopted by the State Rail - way Commission. May 22, 1025. Hon. Thome A. Browne, Railiray Commixttioner, Linroln, Nebraska.

The </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL gas and electric company objects to signing the form of contract presented. The crossing has been in existence for some time. No change in its construction is necessary at present. An examination of the statutes (Sections 7099 and 7101 - 7108 and 7111-7114 and 5284, Revised Statutes for 1922) re - veals the fact that the several provisions relative to the crossing of railroads by electric wires are not altogether harmonious but it does not appear that any of the discrepancies affect the pres - ent controversy. As the line is already built, there is no ques - tion as to the manner of its building nor as to the kind of construction required; the only phase remaining unadjusted is the amount of damages. Section 7099, supra, provides in part: "Where such persons, associations or corporations esek to carry one or more of such wires over and across the railroad track or tracks, tele - graph wires or right of way of any railroad company in this state, where the same intersects and crosses streets, highways and alleys and other public thoroughfares, or elsewhere, such persons, associations or corporations shall first endeavor to agree by a contract as to the manner and kind of crossing to be constructed (which shall in no case be less than twenty-seven feet above the top of the rails of any railroad tracks) and the compensation, if any, to be awarded as damages. If no agree - ment can be had with any such railroad company as to the manner and kind of crossing, or compensation to be awarded, then such persons, associations or corporations may proceed to have the same ascertained and determined by commissioners to be selected as provided in section 20 of chapter 67 of the revised statutes (5284) relating to the condemna - tion of the right of way for railroad purposes." Section 5284, supra, provides for the assessment of damages by appraisers appointed by the county judge. If the parties cannot agree in this case as to damages, the endeavor to agree having been unsuccessful, appraisers will have to be appointed to ascertain such damages. No action by the Railway Commis - sion will be required. Two other phases of the crossing law are also submitted for opinion although not necessary to a determination of the present controversy. In case there is an alteration of an existing cross - ing, the amount of damage is fixed by the Railway Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p275">OPINIONS 275 (Section 7104, supra) and not by appraisers appointed by the county judge as provided in Section 7099 and Section 5284. In such a case the alteration would have to be in conformity with the regulations as provided by Section 7102 and Section 7103. The third phase of the matter relates to the provisions of the contract that appear to be objectionable. Among them are the requirements that the licensee, the Nebraska Gas and Elec - tric Company, shall adjust the crossing at its own expense to any physical change made in the property of the railroad com - pany, that the electric company will hold the railroad company harmless from all damages due to personal injury, that the con - tract between the two companies is terminable by the railroad company on thirty days notice, etc. Such provisions cannot lie imposed upon a transmission line company. Section 7099, quoted supra, provides that the parties shall endeavor to agree by a contract as to the manner and kind of crossing to be con - structed and the compensation to be awarded. The crossing, of whatever kind, must be constructed in accordance with the regu - lations adopted by the State Railway Commission. The "man - ner and kind" afford a choice only within the limits of such regulations. The compensation may also be agreed upon. If the parties cannot agree, these three matters are referred to the. appraisers appointed by the county judge but the appraisers would also be limited to the designation of such manner of crossing and such kind of crossing as will be permissible under the regulations adopted by the Commission. These matters being once adjusted the relation between the two companies could not be terminated upon notice at the option of the rail - way company nor could the railroad company fix its liability for personal injuries that might l)e incurred at the crossing. In other words, the field of agreement is limited to the items specified in the statutes. In case the parties agree upon a con - struction contrary to its regulations, the Commission should interpose to prevent the construction. HL </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL RAILROADS— FREIGHT TRAIN CREWS Only two brakemen required unless crew runs one hundred miles per day. March 19, 1926. Mr. John E. Curtvis, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Mr. J. F. Moredick of the Brotherhood of Railroad Train - men has submitted to Commissioner Randall the following statement : "The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company is operating a train from .Ravenna to Seneca in the following manner: The train runs from Ravenna to Merna where it changes crews and usually ca - booses. Sometimes the caboose runs clear through. The second crew rthe train from Merna to Seneca. On the return trip the same brings the train back from Seneca to Merna where the crew is again changed and the first crew takes it from Merna to Ravenna. The run from Ravenna to Seneca is made on Monday, Wednesday and Fri - tfrom Seneca to Ravenna, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The ce from Ravenna to Merna is 57 miles, from Merna to Seneca 73 Neither crew runs as much as 100 miles in one day. The train is operated as a "local extra". The mileage is made on the En line and the train carries passengers and local merchan - and does station switching. The question is whether under statutes two or three brakemen are required. Section 5337, Compiled Statutes, 1922, is as follows: "Freight crew — what necessary. It shall be unlawful for any rail - r doing business in Nebraska to operate or run over its road, or any thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road, or any part thereof, outside of yard limits any freight train which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen: Provided, main line local freight trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying passengers, local mer - chandise and doing station switching shall be provided with a crew con- </seg>
            <seg id="p277">OPINIONS 277 sisting of one conductor, one engineer, one fireman, and three brake - men." The purpose of the statute as indicated by its title, Laws 1909, page 406, is to provide for the safety of the traveling public and the employees of the railroads. The object of full crew laws generally is to secure train operation by men who are not overworked and, therefore, incapacitated for the careful and efficient performance of their duties. While the engine runs through from Ravenna to Seneca and occasionally the caboose does also, the run is divided essentially into two parts. The reason for the requirement that men shall not run over one hundred miles is fully met. My opinion is that the safety of the traveling public and of the employees of the railroad is not endangered in any way by the operation of the trains as detailed above and that the com - pany cannot be compelled to put three brakemen on the trains, that two are all the statute requires. HL RAILROAD— OPERATING MOTOR CAR SINGLY CARRYING PASvSENGERS Not a train and may be operated without brakeman. Where such motor car is operated with a trailer, brakeman should be employed. May 28. 1925. Mr. John E. Curtiss. Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Sir: Some time since Mr. J. F. Morediek. Chairman, Nebraska State Legislative Board. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, submitted the following questions: </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 "A. Should a railroad company operating a motor car singly, car - rying passengers, provide a crew consisting of three men, that is, a motorman. a conductor and a brakeman or flagman? B. Where a trailer is attached to a motor car carrying passengers, should there be a crew consisting of three men, that is, a motorman, a conductor and a brakeman or flagman?" Motor cars are being operated by Nebraska carriers singly and with trailers by crews consisting of two men each, that is, a motorman and a conductor, no brakeman being employed. Section 5330, Compiled Statutes for 1922, is as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing business in the State of Nebraska to operate or run over its road or any part thereof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger, mail or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment consists of more than five cars, with a crew, consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one con - ductor, one brakeman and one flagman; and further provided, passenger trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one con - ductor and one brakeman or flagman." Mr. Moredick calls attention to the definition of a train stated in the operating rules of the Nebraska carriers. It is as follows : "Train — An engine, or motor, or more than one engine, or motor, coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers." The rules are to be considered but, of course, they cannot govern the language of the statute. The latter seems to preclude the idea of treating a single motor car as a train. It provides for a fireman, who can only be employed on a steam locomotive which of necessity means that there nre to be both a locomotive and cars. The statute above quoted was approved March 31, 1909. At the same session an act was passed relating to the operation of gasoline motor trains or gasoline motor cars. The latter act, Chapter 97, Laws 1909, was approved April 3, 1909. The first two sections are as follows : » ■ . . . </seg>
            <seg id="p279">OPINIONS 279 ; "That each and every railroad company operating gasoline motor cars or gasoline trains in this state on which passengers are transported, shall on and after January 1st, 1910, cause such cars to be equipped with separate toilet closets for men and women and shall also maintain a smoking apartment; either as a separate car in the train or completely partitioned off by a suitable wall and tightly closing door and suitably furnished. The State Railway Commission shall have power to release any Railway Company from the provisions of this act on new roads where steam passenger trains have not been regularly run until such time as the business will warrant better service, also on parts of roads where at least one steam passenger train is run, which makes regular stops at least six days in the week. Provided, that mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be considered passenger trains." These two acts must have been considered simultaneously by the legislature. They indicate that the legislature itself differentiated between trains and motor cars operated singly. Webster's Dictionary (International Dictionary. La?t Edi - tion) defines a train as "A connected line of cars, etc., on a railroad, without or with the locomotive." It is, therefore, concluded that a motor car operated singly is not a train within the meaning of the statute above quoted, and may be operated without a brakeman. The reasons leading to the conclusion that a motor car may be operated singly without a brakeman indicate that where a trailer is used a brakeman should be employed. The statute is penal in its nature and, of course, the definition of the offense must be within the plain import of its words. While the sub - ject is not entirely free from doubt, it seems to be within the plain import of the statute that a brakeman must be employed where a trailer is used. My conclusion is, therefore, that where a motor car is oper - ated with a trailer a brakeman should be added. HL </seg>

March 19, 1926. Mr. C. J. Maeh, Asfiby, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your favor of the 13th addressed to the State Railway Commission has been handed to the writer for attention. The conditions, as I understand them, are as follows: The Burlington railroad owns three acres of land on which its stockyards are located and yoii have land adjoining the rail - road property. Your inquiry is whether or not the railroad is required to pay all of the cost of the fence on the division line between the three acre tract and your land or only one-half the cost thereof. It is understood that your land does not touch the right-of-way. Section No. 5396, Compiled Statutes, 1922, relating to fenc ing by railroads, is as follows: t "Every railroad corporation whose lines of road or any part thereof open for use, and every railroad company formed or to be formed, whose lines are not now open for use, shall, within six months after lines of such railroad or any part thereof are open, erect and there - ;r maintain fences on the sides of their railroad, or the part thereof open for use, suitable and amply sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, ep and hogs from getting on such railroad, except at crossings of ilic roads and highways, and within the limits of towns, cities and ages, with opens, gates or bars at all the farm crossings of such rail - roads for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining such railroad. They shall also construct, where the same has not already been done, and hereafter maintain, at all road crossings now existing or hereafter established, cattle guards suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep and hogs from getting onto such railroad. So long as such fences and cattle guards shall not be made after the time hereinbefore pre - scribed for making the same shall have elapsed, and when such fences and guards or any part thereof are not in sufficiently good repair to </seg>
            <seg id="p281">OPINIONS 281 accomplish the objects for which the same as herein prescribed are in - tended, such railroad corporation and its agents shall be liable for any and all damages which shall be done by the agents, engines or trains of any such corporation, or by the locomotives, engines, or trains of any other corporation permitted and running over or upon their said rail - road, to any cattle, horses, sheep or hogs thereon. When such fences and guards have been fully and duly made, and shall be kept in good and sufficient repair, such railroad corporation shall not be liable for any such damages, unless negligently or wilfully done: Provided, however, any person, company, or corporation, owning land adjoining the right of way of any railroad company in this state, and not within the limits of any town, village or city, and intending to enclose his or their land, or any part thereof that adjoins such right of way or railroad, with a fence, or the secretary of such company or corporation, by direction thereof, may notify in writing such railroad company of such intention and request such railroad company to build a lawful fence as described in this section on the line between their railroad and the land intended to be enclosed. Such notice shall definitely specify two points on such line between which points such fence is requested to be erected, and describe the field intended to be enclosed. The railroad company shall, within six months after receiving such notice, cause to be erected the fence required by such notice, and in case of a failure so to do, the party so giving notice as aforesaid may cause such fence to be erected at a reasonable cost, and collect the amount thereof from the railroad company so neglecting to erect the fence." The section has been before the supreme court a number of times for consideration but not on the question that you raise. You do not say whether the village of Ashby is incor - porated or not. As the last census gave the population as 130, it may not be. If it be an incorporated village and the property lies within the corporate limits, the railroad company is not re - quired to fence. Even though the village may be incorporated if the yards extend outside they are not required to be fenced. This was held in C. B. tfe Q. v. Hogan, 27 Neb. 801, and C. B. db Q. v. Hogan, 30 Neb. 686. It has also been held where the railroad has a flag station with platform, etc., for public use outside the limits of the city, town or village, it is not bound under the provisions of the statute requiring railroads to be fenced to fence its road in such a manner as to prevent the public from having proper access to its station ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 C. B. &lt;£ Q. v. Sevcek, 72 Neb. 793 and 799. While these cases do not decide the question exactly, they bear upon it by analogy. The court would probably not con - strue the statute strictly but would probably hold that so far as the side adjoining your land is concerned it would be treated as property owned by any private landowner. My conclusion is that you cannot compel the railway com - pany to pay more than one-half the cost of the fence. RAILWAY COMMISSION-JURISDICTION— CONNECTION POINT Physical connection between the tracks of different railroad companies should not be ordered unless proposed connection point is within one mile of incorporated town or city and necessary. January 19, 1926. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The State Railway Commission has submitted the following matter and asked my opinion thereon: An application, treated as formal, was filed with the Commission asking for a connection between the track of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and thtf track of the Chicago and North Western Railway Company at a point southeast of Schuyler, near Edholm in Butler County, Nebraska. A hearing was held and the application was denied by the Commission upon the grounds that the proposed connec - tion was not reasonably necessary, that the expense of such con - ktion would not be warranted by the business that would ve over it and that it would be of small public benefit. t </seg>
            <seg id="p283">OPINIONS 283 The applicants now desire to proceed under Chapter 161, Laws 192$ (pages 389-90) and ask that they be directed as to the proper steps to take. Section 1 of that chapter reads as follows: "All railroad companies in this state at all points of connection, intersection, or crossing at grade of different railroads where it is prac - ticable, shall provide reasonable, ample and equal facilities by track connection, passenger platforms and otherwise, for transferring cars, passengers and property between their respective roads without un - reasonable delay; and at any place where the tracks of the two rail - road companies are within fire hundred feet apart, whether on the same grade or not, where it is practicable and deemed reasonably necessary, the state railway commission, upon the application of any interested person, may require such track connection. All such railroad companies shall not discriminate in their rates or charges between such connecting lines or on freight coming over them; but no such company shall be re - quired to furnish to another railroad company its tracks, equipment, or terminal facilities without reasonable compensation. Each of the con - necting lines shall pay its proportionate share for the building and main - tenance of such track and switches as may be necessary to furnish the transfer facilities required by this and the next following section, and in case they cannot agree on the amount which each line shall pay then said amount shall, upon application by either party, be determined and adjusted by the state railway commission. Provided, however, that in all cases where the railway commission has refused to require track connection as required by the applicant in such case where the applicant agrees in writing to pay the cost of making such track connection, and costs of maintenance of same, and offers adequate security therefore, then in that case said railway commission shall order such track con - nection to be made by said railroad companies whether said railway commission deems such track connection practicable or reasonably neces - sary, or not, and provided, further, that said railroad tracks, at the point where such connection is to be made, run within one mile of the corpo - rate limits of any city or village." Two objections appear to further action by the applicants: First — The Commission found that Nimburg, a '"blind" sta - tion on the Burlington railroad, is .85 of a. mile from the rail - road crossing, that Edholm is 4.75 miles distant and that each of the other towns mentioned is more than two miles from the proposed track connection. It is not found by the Commission whether or not Nimburg is incorporated. The 1920 census shows </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL it then had a population of twenty-three. It is probable that it has not yet sufficient population to be incorporated as required by Compiled Statutes, 1922, Section 4223. A population of one hundred is necessary for incorporation. Even if it has the population it does not appear that the necessary legal steps have been taken for incorporation. Unless the proposed track connection is within one mile of the corporate limits of a city or village the applicants cannot secure it in the absence of ap - proval by the Commission. Second — The Commission has found, and the evidence seems ample to sustain the finding, that the proposed track connection is unnecessary. Where the evidence clearly shows that there is no need of the proposed connecting track, it is beyond the power of the legislature to require the companies to construct it simply because someone wishes it and is willing to pay for it. It is well-known that switches located so that they cannot be watched are sources of danger in the operation of railroads. Disastrous accidents often result from their being tampered with by unauthorized persons. A railroad company thus may tve substantial ground for refusing to install such a connec - &gt;n. It may not be subjected unnecessarily to added liability and loss. It is realized that ordinarily the Commission will not ques - tion the constitutionality of a statute. That is a safe rule to follow and deviation from it should not occur except under extraordinary circumstances. The present instance falls under such exception. The Commission should not order a track con - nection where to do so would deprive the companies of their property without compensation and without due process of law. Unless it be shown that Nimburg is incorporated and that there is some real need of the proposed construction so that the companies will not be deprived, arbitrarily, of their property, the Commission should take no further action.

            <seg id="p285">OPINIONS 285 RAILWAY COMMISSION— DECISION OF AS RES JUDICATA Former decision on crossing application not binding upon Commission, but entitled to high presumption of correctness. April 17, 1925. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The Commission has submitted the following question: A complaint was heretofore filed by a land owner owning lands on both sides of the right-of-way of a railroad asking for an underground crossing. The Commission denied the com - plaint. Later the same land owner filed a second complaint asking the same relief. Assuming that conditions have not changed, may the Commission entertain the second complaint or is its decision on the former application a bar to the second complaint? My opinion is that it is not, that the matter is not res judicata and that the Commission may entertain the second complaint and order an underground crossing if the facts war - want such a determination. The question involves a consideration of Section 5527, Compiled Statutes of 1922, as amended by Chapter 167, Session Laws of 1923. As amended, it provides that whenever a person owns land on both sides of the right-of-way of a railroad, the company owning such railroad shall provide and keep in repair at least one adequate means for such land owner to cross the right-of-way. It also provides that the land owner may file written complaint with the State Railway Commission setting forth the inadequacy or dangerous character of any existing crossing and the Commission shall thereupon make an investiga - tion and hold such hearing as may be necessary and, if the facts warrant, shall issue an order for an adequate crossing. Section 5527 must be taken in connection with Sections 5496-5498 par- </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ticularly, as Section 5527 does not contain full provisions for the procedure in such cases. As an order requiring a crossing would substantialh' affect the property rights of the railroad company, it must have an opportunity to be heard and defend. Section 5496 provides generally for the procedure. It seems clear that the action of the Commission would have to be in accordance with the requirements of Section 5496. The order authorized to be entered under Section 5496 is limited by Sec - tion 5498 which provides that such an order shall be in force and effect from and after the date fixed by the Commission "until annulled, modified or revised by the Commission or until finally adjudged to be unreasonable and unjust in a court of competent jurisdiction." These provisions seem to make the order subject to revision at any time, even without additional hearing. Section 5497 also provides that the findings and order of the Commission in such a case shall thereafter, when properly authenticated, be admitted in all judicial proceedings as evi - dence of every fact found and that said orders are prinia facie, just and reasonable. The statute, therefore, seems to treat such an order as lacking judicial qualities. If it is not, in fact, a judicial order, it cannot, in any event, be res judicata. The specific terms of the statutes seem to make it subject to revision by the Com - mission itself. In the case of Postle v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 98 Neb. 192, the supreme court reversed the order of the Com - mission requiring the building of an overhead crossing. This under the statute prior to the amendments of 1921 and . The appellant, railroad company, contended in that case that the Commission erred in assuming jurisdiction of the com - plaint for the reason that its determination involved the ad - judication of private rights and was, therefore, an exercise of judicial power with which the Commission was not vested.

HL RAILWAY COMMISSION— JURISDICTION— CROSSING SIGNAL Location of signal at crossing is under jurisdiction of commission October 30, 1926. Mr. Leonard D. Denxmore, Secretary, State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 28th relating to a flashlight signal in - stalled upon a highway near Jansen at hand. It appears that a flashlight signal has been installed about eight feet from the track of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company and near the center of United States high - way No. 3, crossing the railroad track a. mile east of Jansen, that when the highway project was approved by the U. S. government engineers it was provided in the contract that this signal should be removed. A number of petitions have been presented to the State Railway Commission asking that the signal be allowed to remain where it is and stating that it is a great protection to those using the highway and protesting against its removal. The question propounded by you is whether or not the State Railway Commission has jurisdiction over the signal. </seg>
            <seg id="p288">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 288 The Commission has such jurisdiction. Section 5526, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is as follows: "Wherever any railroad track shall cross any such way In a cut, or on a curve, or side hill, or in timber lands, or near buildings, or near any obstruction of the view from the way, the commission shall direct such precautions to be taken as it shall deem necessary for the safety of the traveling public, the facts having been developed either on the motion of the commission or upon complaint of interested parties. Each and every railroad company shall also provide and maintain such gates, crossings, signs, alarm bells, and flag men, as the commission shall direct. The commission may adopt some uniform crossing sign, which shall be placed at any crossing and at such other places as the commis - sion may direct. The commission may direct the placement of special signs where the physical conditions of any crossing warrant such ac- The fact that this is a federal highway does not alter the power of the Commission with regard to it. It also appears that the highway has been completed and that the federal government is withholding fifteen thousand dollars because the signal has not been removed. It is obvious that the state authorities cannot compel the federal authorities to pay the money now withheld. Section 2 of the federal highway act (Act Nov. 9, 1921, Ch. 119, U. S. Comp. Stat. 7477y 4 ai-7477y 4 y, 1923 Supplement) provides in part as follows: "The term 'highway' includes rights of way, bridges, drainage struc - tures, signs, guard rails, and protective structures in connection with highways." Section 12 of the same act provides as follows: "The construction and reconstruction of the highways or parts of highways under the provisions of this Act, and all contracts, plans, specifications, and estimates relating thereto, shall be undertaken by the state highway departments subject to the approval of the Secre - tary of Agriculture. The construction and reconstruction work and labor in each state shall be done in accordance with its laws and under the direct supervision of the state highway department, subject to the inspection and approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and in accor - dance with the rules and regulations pursuant to this Act." </seg>

Any question as to payment for the building of the highway will be determined by federal authorities.

Upon failure to do so he shall serve a written notice to the person or persons violating this act warning him or them to comply with its provisions; and, if in one week from the time such notices are given such person or persons are still violating this act, then such at - tendance officer shall file a complaint against such person or persons before the judge of the juvenile court of the county charging such per - son with violation of the provisions of this act: Provided, that if after such notice shall have been sent to any person or persons violating this act, such person or persons may again violate the same act, no written notice shall be required, but a complaint may be filed." It will be noted that this section is a speciaJ section pro - viding that a complaint shall be filed before the judge of a juvenile court. Section 1174 of the Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1922, which is under Article VII, entitled "Juvenile Courts", provides among other things as follows: "Jurisdiction. The district courts of the several counties in this state, and the judges thereof in vacation, shall have original jurisdic - tion in all cases coming within the terms of this article; the county court in each county shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the district court, but said jurisdiction shall not be exercised by the county court except in the absence of the judge or judges of the district court" from the county. Where a proceeding has been instituted under this. Article before any county court the jurisdiction of this court over such proceed - ings shall continue until the final disposition thereof: Provided, appeal may be had to the district court in the same manner as is now provided by law in civil cases." Considering the above quoted sections together, and also 1175 and 117G of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 19*22. on? would be inclined to the conclusion that the special Section. 0500. fixes the form and requires the action to lie filed before the district judge unless all district judges be absent from the county, and then in that event jurisdiction would seem to lie conferred upon the county court.

The court said : "Juvenile courts are not criminal courts. Their function is not to try criminal charges and punish for criminal offenses. It is only upon the theory that they are not criminal courts that their establishment, and that their methods of procedure, can be sustained as constitutional. Children are considered wards of the state. When a child is found without proper parental care, in poverty or neglected, or incorrigible, or surrounded by vicious and immoral influences, tending to prevent it from growing into a useful and law abiding citizen, the juvenile court takes up the matter, not as the trial of a criminal charge, but as a prob - lem to determine the status of the child, to see whether the child is de - pendent, neglected or delinquent, and hence whether it has become neces - sary, for the welfare of the child and in the interest of the public, that the state, in the particular instance, shall step in and require a change of the custody of the child, provide other associates or a new environ - ment, and provide for such care and training as may lead to its refor - mation. Such a proceeding is obviously quite different from a criminal proceeding and is not penal in character. • • • Under the statute involved in this case, the person who causes or contributes to the delinquency of a child is made gulity of a misde - meanor. Prosecution upon that charge is clearly a criminal prosecu - tion. It is not a proceeding to determine a status, but to establish guilt and inflict punishment. It is not such a proceeding as is within the general purview of the jurisdiction of a juvenile court, nor one in which special procedure or summary punishment can be logically justified." 14 R. C. L. 277, Par. 48. Our court further states that "In some states where the legislature has attempted to provide that the prosecution of such charges shall be had before the juvenile courts without a jury and without that general protection which must be afforded in criminal trial, the laws have been declared invalid since they impair the constitutional rights of the accused. * * • Prosecutions on the charge of causing or contributing to the de - linquency of a child are not matters for summary disposal of juvenile courts, but are for the criminal courts and are to be tried before a jury and in the manner provided by the general criminal code."

The complaint should be filed before the county judge, in any event, should the district judge be absent from the county.

There is no authority given the Commission to fix damages in such a case as the one before it. HL SCHOOLS— DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY Where a rural high school district has voted to discontinue such dis - trict, the trustees of such district may dispose of the property of such district if directed to do so by the vote of the annual meeting.

February 27. 1926. Mr. H. A. Heyne, Winner, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 25th instant requesting the opin - ion of the attorney general upon the following inquiry : "Shall the candidates for the Board of Education be nominated in connection with the city caucus, held in the city hall, or, shall a special and independent caucus be held at the school house for the nomination of candidates for the Board of Education?" You do not state under which section of the Statutes your school district is organized, but we assume that it is organized under the provisions of Article 6, Section 6339, et seq.. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1922. Section 6339. supra, in part pro - vides : "Provided, that in any such school district containing within its boundaries any incorporated village, the members of such school district shall be elected at the regular village election of such village upon a separate ballot by the qualified voters of such school district, as denned by this chapter. The conduct of such election and the method of plac - ing the names of candidates upon such ballot shall be governed by the primary and general election laws in so far as the same may be ap - plicable hereto.

That in said district caucus the two candidates having the highest number of votes for each place to be filled upon the district school board shall be certified as caucus nominees and their names shall be placed upon the printed ballots at the ensuing election." Section 6271. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1922, defines school electors as follows: "Every citizen of the United States, male or female, who has re- sided in the district forty days and is twenty-one years old and who owns real property or personal property that was assessed in the dis - trict in his or her name at the last annual assessment, or who has chil - dren of school age residing in the district shall be entitled to vote at any district meeting or school election held in any district, village or city: Provided, all electors at school elections held in cities where regis - tration of voters is required shall comply with the provisions of such registration law before they shall be entitled to vote." You will note that according to the provisions of the fore - going statutes the school district election is a separate and dis - tinct election from that of the village. The village may be situated within the school district, but the school district may have a large number of school electors who do not reside within the limits of the village. The qualifications of the electors at the school election are different than the electors of the village election. It is the opinion of the attorney general that the caucus provided for in Section 6039, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 192*2, for any school district containing within its boundaries an incorporated village to be held for the purpose of nominating candidates to be elected members of such a school district board is a separate and distinct caucus from the regular village caucus, and that such school district caucus should be held at the school house in said school district at least two weeks before the regular village election, and that notice of said caucus should be given by the school officers by posting public notice in the manner provided by law.

June 18, 1926. Honorable John M. Matzen, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to the question propounded by P. H. Schmidt, county treasurer of Scotts Bluff County, to yourself in which he inquires whether it is the duty of the county treasurer or the county superintendent to apportion the free high school funds among the several districts where there is not sufficient money in the fund to pay the high school tuition in full, I will say the statute provides that the proper officer of each district which has furnished instruction to pupils outside the district for which it is entitled to payment out of said fund "• • * shall, on or before the second Monday in June of each year, certify to the county superintendent the names and number of non - resident pupils enrolled in the high school of said district during the year ending the second Monday of June, and the number of weeks or fraction thereof during which each of said pupils have attended said high school. The county superintendent thereupon shall certify the same to the county treasurer, who shall upon the order of the county superintendent, on or before the first day of July following, pay to the school district treasurers and to the treasurers of boards of education an amount sufficient to pay the high school tuition of said pupils at a rate fixed by law per week or fraction thereof for each week's attendance or fraction thereof; and if the free high school tuition fund therein pro - vided for shall not be sufficient to pay the full amount of said tuition, Ethe said fund shall be distributed pro rata among the districts en - to such fund. If there shall be any such deficiency it shall be pro - for in making the levy for the succeeding year: * • •" </seg>
            <seg id="p297">OPINIONS 297 You will observe that if there is not sufficient money in the fund to pay the high school tuition in full, the law provides that the matter shall lye taken care of in making the levy for the succeeding year. This being true, I am of the opinion that it is the duty of the county superintendent to report to the county treasurer the amount of tuition due each district for the present year regardless of whether there is sufficient funds in the treasury with which to pay it in full or not. The law further provides that the county treasurer shall pay each school district entitled to payment from said fund the amount certified by the county superintendent if there is money in the fund with which to pay in full on or before the first day of July, and if there is not sufficient money in the fund shall pay each district their pro rata share thereof. This payment is made upon an order of the county superintendent, but the law does not say whether the county treasurer or the county sup?rin - tendend shall apportion the fund. Inasmuch as the county treasurer has in his office the data necessary for determining the amount of money collected for the fund at any time, it occurs to me that he is the proper party to pro rate the fund. If he desires a statement of the exact amount to be paid to each district made in the order issued to him by the county superintendent he can advise the superin - tendent of the amount payable to each district where the fund is pro rated, and the superintendent then can issue an order to him to pay that specific amount, but I am of the opinion that he will be justified in pro rating it if the county superintendent orders him to pay a certain amount to each district if there are funds in his hands with which to pay to districts the amount due them, and if not, to pay each district its pro rata share.

In view of the above quoted provision of statute, I am of the opinion that the mem'bers of the school board are not only authorized to maintain school in the district for a period of nine months, but that it is their duty to- do so under the facts stated in vour letter.

Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 13th instant in which you inquire as to your right to read the Bible in a public school, I will say that the supreme court of this state has said : "The law does not forbid the use of the Bible in the public schools; it is not proscribed either by the constitution or the statutes; and the courts have no right to declare its use to be unlawful because it is pos - sible or probable that those who are privileged to use it will misuse the privilege by attempting to propagate their own peculiar theological or ecclesiastical views and opinions." 65 Neb. 877. In the same case the court further said : "Exercises by a teacher in a public school in a school building, in school hours, and in the presence of the pupils, consisting of the reading of passages from the Bible, and in the singing of songs and hymns, and offering prayer to the Deity in accordance with the doctrines, beliefs, customs or usages of sectarian churches or religious organizations, is forbidden by the constitution of this state." "Enforced attendance upon religious services is forbidden by the constitution, and pupils in a public school can not be required either to attend such services or to join in them." "It is immaterial whether the objections of a parent to his children attending, and participating in, a religious service conducted by a teacher in the schoolroom during school hours, is reasonable or un - reasonable. The right to be unreasonable in such matters is guaranteed by the constitution." "The point where the courts may rightfully interfere to prevent the use of the Bible in a public school is where legitimate use has degen - erated into abuse, — where a teacher employed to give secular instruc - tion has violated the constitution by becoming a sectarian propagandist."

The correct answer to the question you ask is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court decision upon the point involved. I am of the opinion, however, that a certificate granted by the Metropolitan School District of Omaha entitling the holder thereof to teach in the public schools of that district will entitle the person licensed to teach corresponding grades in a parochial or private school.

            <seg id="p306">306 • "An examination of the Constitution will convince anyone that the provisions in regard to elections were not intended to apply to school districts."

Mr. J. O. Shroyer, Secretary, Legislative Committee. F miners Edueat'wnal d- Co-op. State Union, Humboldt, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Shroyer: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 18th instant, I will say : 1. I do not believe a consolidated school district is liable in damages in Nebraska to one who is injured by the negli - gence of a driver of one of the vehicles used in transporting its pupils to and from school, even though such driver is in its employ and has not been required by the school l&gt;oard to fur - nish bond, as by law in that behalf, is required. There is no express provision of statute in this state making a school dis - trict liable in such a case and the general rule is that "In the absence of statute a school district is not liable for injuries caused by its negligence of its officers * * * in transporting pupils to and from schools." 35 Cyc. 971-2. Thus the supreme court of New Hampshire has said "Any duty of a school district to transport school children to and from school is a public duty and their right to be transported is a public right so that in the absence of a statute making the district liable an action may not be maintained against it for personal injury to a scholar from its negligent furnishing of unsafe and unsuitable means of con - veyance." Harris v. Salem School District, 51 Atl. 332. Similarly it has been held in Pennsylvania that "School districts are agents of the commonwealth and can not be held liable for the negligence of their employees." 15 Atl. 812. ii.

            <seg id="p308">308 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL such a district will be held personally liable for the negligent acts of a driver from whom they should have required a bond, but did not. is another matter. It is the opinion of the writer that they cannot be held liable in any substantial amount because of their failure to re - quire a bond of the driver. The law does not fix the amount of the bond the driver shall give except to provide that it shall not lie for a greater sum than five thousand dollars. It may be any lesser amount so far as any express provision of statute is concerned. It is obvious that the liability of the board for their failure to require a bond cannot be greater than the amount of the bond it was their duty to require of the driver. I may add that the supreme court of New York has held under a statute somewhat different than our own in a case in - volving damages to a child who was being transported to school that "Though the board of trustees of a school district is a governmental agency * * * it is liable for its own negligence." Williams v. Board of Trustees, 198 N. Y. 476. I know of no case in this state where this precise question has been before the courts. GWA </seg>

August 20, 1926. Mr. E. A. MnrkwaMer, Superintendent of School* , Ansley, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 14th instant. I will say that I doubt the right of the school board of your dis - trict to borrow money upon the credit of the district for the purpose of paying the running expenses of the school. The rule is that "A school district * * • through its proper board or officers has such power and such only, of incurring indebtedness, or making expen - ditures, as is either expressly or by necessary implication conferred upon it by statute." 35 Cyc. 972-3. I am of the opinion, however, that one who loans money to the school district to be used for the purpose of taking up valid outstanding warrants against the district can recover, if the money is so used, the value of the warrants taken up with the money so advanced by him. Thus it is said : "One 'F,' having certain warrants against the city of P., which were duly and legally issued, exchanged the same under the provisions of an ordinance of the city for its funding bonds, which were declared illegal because issued in excess of the limit fixed by law.

I am of the opinion that a board of education in a city school district may provide for raising a certain amount of money each year to be used at some time in the future in the construction of a school house, provided the total amount of school tax levied does not exceed the amount authorized by law. The rule as to the powers of a board of education is that "Except as limited by the statutes restricting the amount of taxes that may be levied, and the provisions regulating the borrowing of money by the issuance of bonds, the board of education has full power to administer the affairs of the school district as to school sites ani buildings."

Tt is possible the correct answer to the question asked by Miss Berry is not entirely free from doubt, but I am of the opinion, however, that the annexed territory would lie required to assist in the payment of the bonded indebtedness of the dis - trict to which it was attached. In the case of Clother v. Maher, 15 Neb. 1-7, the judge who wrote the opinion called attention to what is now Section 376, Compiled Statutes, 1922, and which defines the term "school district", and said in speaking of that section : "Although not very happily expressed, the design we think was merely to hold subsequently detached territory for the payment of such bonds, but not to exclude such as might be added to, nor property brought within the district afterwards."

August 26, 1926. Mr. Arthur A. Gregg, Clark*. Nebraska. Dear Mr. Gregg: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 24th instant I will say that it is the duty of the outgoing school district treas - urer to turn over the treasurer's books and the money in his hands belonging to the district to his successor in office. He can be compelled by mandamus to turn over the treasurer's books belonging to the district to his successor in office. "The rule is well established that, while mandamus will not lie to compel respondent to turn over to the relator the books, papers, etc., pertaining to an office where the relator does not show a prima facie title or where the proceeding would necessarily involve the trying of the title of the parties to the office, yet the writ will lie in favor of the holder of the prima facie title to an office after making the proper de - mand to recover the possession of the property and insignia of the office, including the books, records, papers, rooms, and buildings against one holding over after the expiration of his term." 38 C. J., p. 708, Sec. 294. See also State v. Quinn. 86 Neb. 758. If there is no dispute as to the amount of money belonging to the district which is retained by the outgoing treasurer, mandamus is the proper remedy in that case, too. and a man - damus action can be brought to compel the outgoing treasurer to turn over both the books and the money. "A writ of mandamus may be issued after the expiration of the term of a public officer to compel him to make report of the public money coming into his hands during his incumbency and incidentally to pay into the treasury sums so ascertained to be unlawfully retained by him; but mandamus is not a proper remedy to litigate a claim of right by which an officer claims to retain money in his hands, nor will it lie </seg>

A school district cannot compel a teacher or other creditor of the district to accept less than the legal rate of interest upon a school warrant registered for want of funds. 2. Claims against school districts should be paid by warrants duly signed by the president and board. countersigned by the secretary of the December 22, 1925. Honorable John Speedie, Deputy State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say the school district of the city of Havelock has out - standing warrants issued on the general school funds to the amount of about $80,000; that one of the banks has made an oral proposition to the school board to handle all warrants and to charge the school district but six per cent interest on such warrants after they are registered: and that the school board wishes to know whether it can legally accept such offer. In answer to the question you propound, I will say that I do not think it would be unlawful for the school board to enter into an agreement with one of the banks to charge the school district but six per cent on warrants purchased by it after they are registered, but I do not think the school board could law - fully control what shall be done with the warrants after they </seg>
            <seg id="p315">OPINIONS 315 »re issued to the district's creditors. In other words. I do not think the board can compel any teacher or other creditor of the district to sell his or her warrant to the bank in question or to scale the interest to six per cent upon warrants which are registered for the time they remain unpaid. You say the same school board raises another question relative to the right of the school district to issue a blanket warrant payable to the district treasurer to create a cash revolv - ing fund in his hand for the payment of small bills which he will pay by issuing checks against such cash revolving fund. In answer to that question. I will say that Section 6594, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 19:22. provides among other things in de - fining the duties of a treasurer that "He shall pay school moneys only upon warrants signed by the president of the board or in his absence by the vice president and coun - tersigned by the secretary." It appears, therefore, that, technically speaking, the treas - urer is barred from paying claims against the district with school money in any way than by warrants duly signed by the president and countersigned by the secretary of the board.

In other words, is there any to exercise the petition of recall in such cases?" </seg>
            <seg id="p317">OPINIONS 317 I will endeavor to answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. The electors of a rural school district have the right at a special meeting properly called for that purpose to appoint a committee to adopt plans and specifications for and to supervise the construction of a new school house. In the case of Mizera v. Auten, et al., reported in 45 Nebr. at page 239 thereof, the supreme court said: "Certain sections of chapter 79, Compiled Statutes, 1S93, entitled 'Schools' construed, and held, (1) that the electors of a school district and they alone, at their regular annual meeting, or at a special meeting called for such purpose, have power to direct the building of a school house; (2) that the district board of a school district has no power or authority of law to appropriate the funds of a school district to the erec - tion of a school house, unless first authorized so to do by a vote of the electors of such school district; (3) that when a school district owns a school house site and has the money in its treasury sufficient to build a school house, which money was raised for that purpose, the electors of such school district, at any regular annual meeting, or at a special meet - ing called for that purpose, may direct the building of a school house on the school site, and that such school building be paid for out of the funds on hand for that purpose; (4) that the electors at such meeting may designate the school board to act as the agent of the district to superintend the construction of such school house; (5) that if no one is designated by the electors of the school district to superintend the construction of a school building directed to be built, then the school board of such district has authority to make contracts and superintend the erection of the school building ordered; (6) that the electors of a school district are not obliged to select the members of the school board as agents to superintend the construction of a building ordered to be built, but may select such person or persons as, in their judgment, will best subserve the interests of the school district." 2. The school board is not compelled to purchase a school house site just, because the electors of the district have voted they should do so. when no funds have been provided to pay for such site. In fact. I doubt their authority to purchase a sites when no steps have been taken to provide funds for that purpose. 3.

Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 9th instant, I fsay that this department has given an opinion that junior sges established by a public school district in this state can - collect tuition from resident pupils under the age of twenty - yoars. unless the pupils pay it willingly. In arriving at this conclusion we have considered junior colleges established by public school districts as a part of the public school system of the state. In other words, as a part of the common schools, the Constitution says: t'The Legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the corn - schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and ty-one years."

The plat you sent me shows that your school house is located more than three-fourths of a mile from the center of the district, but the ordinary rural school district can only change its school house site at the annual meeting. The Supreme Court of this state has held that "A school-house cannot be changed at a special election of the voters of a district, but can be relocated at any annual meeting by a vote of two-thirds of those present, except where the original location is three - fourths of a mile from the geographical center of the district, in which case the site may, by a majority vote, be changed to a point nearer such center." Wilber t. Woolley. 44 Neb. 739. If members of a school board are proceeding to erect a school house upon an unauthorized site they may be enjoined, in my opinion, in a suit brought by any resident taxpayer and elector of the school district. F may add that if any one has advised you the attorney general has power to render decisions in cases such as this which will have the force and effect of law until reversed by the courts, he is misinformed. It is the state superintendent, and not the attorney general who has such power. The law provides that "He shall decide disputed points in school law and all such deci - sions shall be held to have the force of law until reversed by the courts."

Paterson, 45 Neb. 848, it was held that "The provision of section 127 of the revenue law, for the execution of tax deeds under the hand and official seal of the county treasurer, being mandatory, it follows that there is under existing laws no author - ity for a valid conveyance by said officer of lands sold for delinquent taxes.

The statutory requirements that the common schools of a county shall be closed during the time the county teachers' institute is in session, and that teachers attending the institute shall be paid their salaries for the time their schools are closed to permit of their attendance at the institute, are plain and .unambiguous. Section 6449. The schools shall be closed during the time the county or joint institute is in session and teachers' salaries shall not be sus - pended but they shall be paid their usual salaries in full by their district board for such time as the school or schools shall be closed while teachers are in attendance at the county joint institute. Section 6452. "The county superintendent shall notify all teachers and the board of all school districts in his county of the time when the institute will begin and all common schools shall be closed during the continuance of the institute." In other words the legislature has determined as a matter of public policy that the public schools of the state shall be closed during the time the respective teachers' institutes are in session and that the teachers whose schools are closed in order that they may attend their county teachers' institute shall re - ceive their pay just as though their schools had not been closed and the rule is: "The law of the place where the contract is entered into at the time of making the same is as much a part of the contract as though it were expressed or referred to therein." 13 C. J. 560. The statement of the rule of law above quoted is supported by numerous citations under Note 57, page 560, 13 C. J. One of the cases cited is the case of Watkins v.

The right of the superintendent to bring mandamus ac - tions in such cases is not exclusive, however. The teacher whose salary is wrongfully withheld in such a case may himself bring the action. See State v. Bloom, 19 Neb. 562. GWA TEACHERS' INSTITUTE FUND The County Board is not the custodian of the Teachers' Institute Fund. December 31, 1926. Honorable John M. Matzen, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You submit to this department for answer, a letter to your - self from Miss Martha H. Schultz, county superintendent of Adams «county, in which she asks: "Whether or not the county board can insist upon the Teachers' Institute Fund being turned over to them." In answer to her question, I will say "no." The county board is not the custodian of the Teachers' Institute Fund and I find no provision of statute which requires them to approve of disbursements from that fund. The law provides: "All the disbursements from the institute fund shall be upon the order of the county superintendent and upon bills approved by him, which bills shall be filed in his office." Section 6451, Compiled Statutes, 1922. </seg>
            <seg id="p327">OPINIONS 327 The law does provide, however: "The county superintendent shall make an annual statement under oath to the county board of all moneys received by him for the institute fund and of all moneys disbursed by him from this fund." Section 6, Chapter 182, Session Laws, 1925. I think the county superintendent should leave in the county treasury until it is needed for the payment of bills the amount of money allowed by the county board out of the county general fund for the support of the teachers' institute. GWA TRANSFER FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES One who is standing in loco parentis to a child of school age residing in his home is entitled to make application for a transfer for school purposes for such child. December 10. 1926. Miss Jessie- M. Gainsforth, County Superintendent, Ogallala, Nebraska. Dear Madam: You say: "Before the annual meeting of June, 1926, a man and his wife ap - plied for transfer for school purposes for a boy who was living in their home. This boy has parents living in the county and is not legally adopted. This woman says: 'they have papers to show they have him legally,' but they have not gone through the county court. "We made the transfer and this gave them the right to vote in District No. 51, instead of District No. 32. "These people have two grown daughters, one twenty-three and one twenty-eight, who live at home. They both have property assessed in their own names, just enough to allow them to vote. They claimed the right to vote in District No. 51, but their votes .were challenged. Now they claim they are guardians of this boy as well as the parents, that they own more property than shows on the tax report and demand the right to vote in District No. 61. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "1. Would they have a right to a transfer without they were legal guardians? "2. Would the two girls be considered guardians as the transfer now stands and would they have a right to vote in District No. 51?" I will answer your questions in the order in which they are asked: 1. I am of the opinion the transfer was rightfully made although that is dependent. I think, upon the agreement be - tween the boy's parents and the married couple with whom he resides. In the case of Mizner v. School District No. 11 of Shermmi County, et a7., which is reported in 2 Neb. Unofficial Reports, 241, it is said: "Where • • * the child with the consent of her parents goes to live in the family of another as a member of the family and under an agreement that that is to be her home, and she is to be cared ,for and provided with school facilities she becomes a bona fide resident of the district where living and the person with whom she resides occupies the relation of a parent, stands in loco parentis and may demand for her every right to which his own natural child is entitled." 2. I do not think the two unmarried daughters of the family with which the boy resides are his guardians and this being so. I doubt their right to vote in the district to which their parents were temporarily transferred. You will note the transfer in such a case is only for one year and the only provision for a transfer of taxes is for a transfer of the tax on the real estate and also of the personal tax of the parent or guardian for that year. This is a matter, however, that is not entirely free from doubt, and I suggest that you get the ruling of the state superintendent on the ques - tion and follow that unless and until it is reversed by the courts as the statute gives the state superintendent power to decide fisputed questions of school law in the first instance.

January 21, 1926. Honorahle L. C. Oberlies, Board of Control, Lirwoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire: "Would the Board of Control be justified, in view of Section 6957, Compiled Statutes of 1922, in admitting Civil War veterans to the Sol - diers' Home without fee regardless of their property holdings?" In answer to your question I will say that one of the qualifications for admission to the home as set forth in Section 6957, Compiled Statutes, is that the applicant shall have "become disabled • * * from earning a livelihood and would be de - pendent upon public or private charity." Likewise the county board of the county in which the ap - plicant resides is required to ascertain whether he is unable to earn a livelihood and whether he is dependent upon public or private charity before the application for admission is for - warded to your board. Construing: these several provisions of statute together, I am of the opinion that a necessary qualification to entitle an old soldier to admittance to the Soldiers* and Sailors' Home at Grand Island is that he is dependent upon public or private charity. This is said with one qualification. Section 6961, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides: "The amount of the pension received by such sailor or soldier shall not be taken into consideration in determining his qualifications to be - come an inmate of the home."

Mr. Robert G. Douglas, Chief Clerk, State Fund Relief Committee, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask for the interpretation of Section 6801 and Section 6802, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, pertaining to soldiers' relief in the various counties of the state. Your specific inquiry is whether or not the relief afforded by these sections is available to soldiers of the late war, known as the World War. You state that the county attorney and board of commissioners of Harlan county interpret the sections referred to as being applicable only to veterans of the War of 1812, Mexican War and the War of the Rebellion. They undoubtedly reached this conclusion by virtue of the provisions of Section 6798, Compiled Statutes for 1922, which does so designate the persons entitled to relief under this chapter. The sections heretofore cited are old sections of the law which were amended in 1915 and in 1921 by Chapter 136, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1921. The board of county commissioners of all the counties are authorized to levy a tax not exceeding one-tenth of one mill for the purpose of creating a fund for the relief of and for funeral expenses of honorably discharged indigent soldiers, sailors, marines, and the indigent wives, widows and minor children of a specific age, etc. Sections 6798 and 6801 were a part of Chapter 128, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1915. This chapter is amended as we above suggested by Chapter 136, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1921. As amended, therefore, it appears to us that the intention of the legislature is to include veterans of the late war in the class designated for relief in the counties. </seg>

February 24, 1926. Hon. Charles W. Pool, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your oral request for an opinion thereon I will" say that the name of the state auditor signed to warrants is as valid and binding if the writing of the signature is actually done by another in the presence and at the request of the auditor, as it would be if the signing was done by his own hand. In 36 Cyc. at pages 451-2 it is said "Where a person's name is signed for him at his direction and in his presence by another, the signature becomes his own, and is sufficient to give the same validity to an instrument as though written by the person himself. The signature is sufficient, although it purports to have been signed by another; thus the form, 'A for B, at his request,' is sufficient. It is not a sufficient signature, however, where the name of the person whose signature is required is written in that person's absence, although the writing of his name may have been authorized by him, unless he subsequently acknowledges and adopts the signature as his own." In the case of Reed v. City of Cedar Rapids. 116 (la.) N. W. 140, the supreme court of Iowa has said : "Where the 'signature' of the assessor to the oath required to be appended to the tax rolls was written by a clerk at his request, it was his signature, and as effective as if written by himself." Similarly, the supremecourt of this state said in an early case: "If the deed is signed in his presence, by his direction, an oral request is all that is required.

(iWA STATE INSTITUTION— BOARD OF CONTROL— POWERS— REFORMATORY INMATES A minor under eighteen years of age, and subject to confinement in the boys industrial school, who is confined to the state reformatory, because he falsely stated that he was over eighteen years of age, may be transferred from the reformatory to the industrial school by the Board of Control under Section 1198. December «. 192(5. Hon. A. T. Wester velt, Board of Control, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Westervelt You say a minor under eighteen years of age was convicted of an offense, which if he had been over eighteen years of age. would have justified his confinement in the reformatory for Ejn; that although under eighteen years of age, he falsely ited that he was over eighteen; and that acting upon false formation as to his age, he was sentenced by the court to con - finement in the state reformatory for men, rather than the boys' industrial school. You inquire whether the Board of Control has authority under the law to transfer him from the reformatory to the boys' industrial school. In answer to your question I will say that in my opinion the Board of Control has such power. Section 1198, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, I think, clothes them with that power. It reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p333">OPINIONS 333 "Any minor having been committed to any state institution may be transferred by the board of control to any other state institution, when - ever it shall appear that such minor by reason of its delinquency, de - pendency, neglect or physical defect or any other reason ought to be in another institution. Such board before making such transfer shall make a minute of the order for such transfer and the reason therefor upon its record, and shall send a certified copy at least seven days prior to such transfer, to the person shown by its records to have had the care or custody of such minor immediately prior to its commitment. Provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the transfer of persons to or from the state penitentiary." This section seems to except only the state penitentiary from the list of state institutions from which such minor may be transferred. The reformatory was not in existence at the time of the passage of this act. OSS STATE INSTITUTIONS— OFFICERS— APPOINTMENTS BY BOARD OF CONTROL Appointments or removals from office by the Board of Control may be made by a majority of the board. June 2, 10-26. Mrs. Frank J. Birsx. Board of Control, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Madam: I am of the opinion that appointments by the Board of Control of the several officers and employees named in Section b840. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1022. may be made by a majority of the board, and that removals from office may be made by a like number if cause for removal exists. It is to be borne in mind, however, that the statute only provides that re - movals may be made for inefficiency or misconduct, and pro - vides further that after such a removal any officer shall, upon </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 his written application, be given a full and proper hearing be - fore the board on written charge or complaint which shall be served upon him at least two weeks prior to the date of hearing. The general rule is in regard to actions by any board or assembly, that a majority may act unless the statute otherwise provides. Thus it is said : "In the absence of charter or statutory .provision to the contrary the rule is well established that a majority of a quorum is all that is re - quired for the adoption or passage of any ordinance, resolution, or order properly arising for the action of a municipal council or other municipal body." 28 Cyc. 335. GWA STATE INSTITUTIONS— PRISON SCHOOLS - ORCHESTRA Playing in the orchestra or merely being trained to play in the orchestra at the state penitentiary is not attending the prison school within the meaning of Section 7017, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which pro - vides a diminuition of time from sentences for those making satis - factory progress in the prison schools. January 0, 1926. Mr. N. T. Harmon, Chief Probation Officer, Board of Pardmix and Paroles, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether a convict in the state penitentiary who plays in the orchestra or is being trained to play in the orches - tra of the institution is attending school or can be said to be attending the prison school is entitled to a diminution of time tm his sentence as provided in Section 7017, Compiled Stat - s of Nebraska for 1922. Section 7017 reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p335">OPINIONS 335 "The board of commissioners of state institutions is hereby author - ized to grant to prisoners employed outside of the prison enclosure and to prisoners makinc satisfactory progress in the prison school, a diminu - tion of time from their sentences, in addition to that provided for in Section 657 of the criminal code of Nebraska (10260), such grants to be conditioned on good behavior, a cheerful compliance with rules, diligence in work and fidelity to trust; but such additional diminution shall not exceed the rate of one month for each year of the sentence." This section was enacted by the legislature in 1911. Pre - vious to the enactment of this section the legislature provided in Section 7015, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as follows: "In order to promote the general moral and physical welfare of the prisoners, improve the discipline and provide for their mental develop - ment, it shall be the duty of the warden to install a night school, to pro - vide games and amusements with special reference to such entertain - ments as have an educational value, and provide for military exercises not less than three times a week, and daily if possible, the same to be in the yard whenever weather permits. "The night school shall offer the prisoners an opportunity for schooling in the common English branches and along such other lines as may to the warden seem beneficial. As far as possible the warden shall use trustworthy convict instructors for such purpose, said convict instructor to receive credit therefor as overtime in the same manner as he may be credited for performing his regular daily task. • "The military exercises shall consist of setting up exercises, niarch - ing in squads and such other drill similar to those carried on in a mili - tary training school as may be practicable and will tend to give the prisoners an erect carriage and improve their general health." In view of the wording of the two above sections which should be read and construed together unless said convict take his instruction in the night school as provided by the sections and actually be a student in such school, in my opinion he would not be entitled to such diminution of time although this question is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court decision.

February 2, 1926. Lieutenant Chas. A. Anderson, F President. Gage County Reserve Beatrice, Nebraska. A. O. R. C, Assn., Dear Sir: In your communication of recent date you say "The Gage County Reserve Officers' Association endorsed by many prominent citizens, The Chamber of Commerce and other civic organiza - tions pf the City of Beatrice, are very desirous of securing permission to use certain property which is part of the State Institution of Feeble Minded Youths, located near Beatrice, Nebraska. The property in ques - tion is shown on the attached blue print marked landing field. t'^t is proposed to use this property, which is to be planted in al - , as an emergency landing field for U. S. Army planes flying be - ll Ft. Crook and Ft. Riley and as a landing field for army planes in the training of reserve pilots and observers. "This proposal has the endorsement of Dr. L. T. Sidwell, superin - tendent of the local institution, and Mr. L. C. Oberlies, chairman of the State Board of Control. "This idea is not original with this association as the federal gov - ernment used alfalfa fields as landing fields for aeroplanes at practically all points where fields are not constantly in use. It has been proven that the landing of an occasional plane in an alfalfa field does not dam - age either the crop or plane. "Everything pertaining to the landing field will be in the hands of a committee consisting of members of this association, who are reserve officers in the great citizen army of our country. "The U. S. Army and the mail service can rightfully be proud of their splendid record in the air and were all aeroplanes and pilots sub - jected to the same rigid inspections that the army plane and pilot must pass, accidents from flying would be practically non-existent. </seg>

In answer to your inquiry permit me to state that the writer would be pleased to assist your worthy association and the good citizens of Beatrice in their efforts to assist in the ad - vancement of the great work in which you are interested, but I regret to say that after careful consideration of this matter I am unable to find authority for the contract which you sug - gest, in view of the fact that this particular property upon which the landing field is proposed has been appropriated and ?et aside as a part of and for the use of the State Institution of Feeble Minded Youths located near Beatrice. When the legis - lature sets aside property and appropriates it to a specific use, as in the instant case, no one has authority to appropriate it to a different use without an amendment by the legislature provid - ing for such appropriation and use. Therefore, I regret to .state that in my opinion there should be at least permission from the legislature to make such contract feasible or binding and capable of enforcement. OSS STATE INSTITUTIONS— PUBLIC MONIES— PAID IX Monies of state institutions must be paid over to the state treasurer within ten days after receipt except as to monies received from sales in operation which are accounted for monthly. Honorable L. C. Oberliex, Board of Control, State Houxe, Lincoln, Nebraxka. Dear Sir: We are in receipt of your letter of May 14th in which you May 14, 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p338">338 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL request our advice as to the proper method of paying over funds collected by state institutions to the state treasurer. Two sections of the 1922 Statutes have application. Section 7260 provides as follows: "The gross amount of money received by every department, from whatever source, belonging to or ,f or the use of the state, shall be paid into the state treasury, without delay, not later in any event than ten days after the receipt of the same, {Without any deduction on account of salaries, fees, costs, charges, expenses or claims of any description what - ever. No money belonging to or for ,the use of the state shall be ex - pended or applied by any department except in consequence of an appro - priation made by law and upon the warrant of the auditor of public accounts." Section 6860 was enacted in 1907, while Section 7260 was enacted in 1919. Section 7260 does not expressly repeal Section 6860. We are inclined to the belief, therefore, that on account of Section 6860 being a special statute pertaining to moneys re - ceived from the sale of property belonging to the State of Nebraska by the superintendent or the head of any of the insti - tutions, that this clearly shows that it was the intent of the legislature to put the operation of the institutions so far as the receipts of the operation are concerned upon a monthly basis. This special section requires an accounting to the state each month for all receipts and sale of property. As to those receipts which do not come within the special section it would be om* opinion that a payment should be made to the state treasurer, as provided by Section 7260. We find no other sections applicable to your inquiry. </seg>

September 17, 1926. Honorable L. C. Oberlies, Chairman. Board of Control, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: If the county court was sitting as a juvenile court when it committed the feeble minded person of whom you speak to the Beatrice Institution for Feeble Minded, I am of the opinion that court has power to take custody of the child away from the Beatrice institution and place it somewhere else if it is of the opinion the best interests of the child require such a change in its custody. The concluding part of Section 1181. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, reads as follows: "The jurisdiction of the court shall continue over any child brought before the court, or committed under the provisions of this article and the court shall have power to order a change in the custody or care of such child, if at any time it is made to appear to the court that it would be for the best interests of the child to make such change." If, however, the child was not committed by the county judge sitting as a juvenile court, but was committed by him in conformity with the provisions of Sections G881 and G882, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, it is not so clear that the judge of that court has jurisdiction at this time to take the child out of the institution in which it was originally placed, and give its custody into other hands.

April 13, 1926. Mr. Roy E. Howser, Attorney at Law, Omaha. Nebraska. Dear Mr. Howser: In reply to your favor of the 3rd instant you are informed that it is our opinion that a person who is insane regardless of whether such person is a citizen or not. may be admitted to the insane asylum from the county in which such person maintained his domicile. Section 6904 provides that the County Board of Commis - sioners of Insane upon complaint shall investigate as to the sanity of a person found in the comity "and has a legal settle - ment therein" may be treated in a hospital for the insane. Section 6908 further provides that if they find that such person has a legal settlement in some other county, that such commissioners of insanity shall notify the superintendent of such hospital and the commissioners of the county wherein such person has a legal settlement. It is our opinion that that part of the statute referring to legal settlement does not mean that such person shall be a citizen in order to be admitted to such institution.

            <seg id="p341">OPINIONS 341 January 18. 1926. Honorable W. C. Condit, State Sheriff, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether a deputy or assistant of the state sheriff, appointed by the governor to assist in the enforcement of the law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, is quali - fied to make complaints for search warrants in liquor cases. In answer to the question you ask 1 will say that in my opinion he is, when authorized so to do by the governor. The law provides: "If any officer of the county or state or any creditable resident free - holder of the county makes complaint before any police, municipal, or county judge, or justice of the peace, in writing and on oath, that he has reason to believe and does .believe, that any intoxicating liquor, describ - ing it as particularly as may be in the complaint, is in the county in any place described unlawfully owned or kept by the person named or de - scribed, or is intended to be or is being ,by the person named or described in the complaint manufactured, sold or kept for sale or dis - position in violation of this act. said magistrate shall, upon the filing of such complaint, and believing there is probable cause therefor, issue his warrant for a search of the premises described." Section 3273. Compiled Statutes, 1922. And further provides in speaking of the duties of the governor relative to the enforcement of said law: "He may call to his assistance any number of persons necessary to see that said law is enforced, including such special attorneys, assistants, and clerks and provide quarters for them, as he may deem necessary, and may authorize any of them to perform any and all duties in the en - forcement of this act and any person so authorized is hereby vested with all of the powers possessed by prosecuting and peace officers."

July 24, 1926. Mr. K. G. Douglas, State Relief Fund Committee, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 22nd instant, I will say the legal title to the securities purchased with the $2,000,000 men - tioned in Section 6208, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, is in the State of Nebraska rather than in the American Legion, although at the present time said securities are being held in trust for the purpose of "furnishing food, wearing apparel, medical or surgical aid, care or relief, or in bearing funeral expenses of discharged soldiers, sailors, marines or nurses who are eligible to membership in such association." You will note the law places the investment of the principal sum in the hands qf a board of executive state officers and provides that "upon the completion of said trust the principal funds so held by said board of trustees shall revert to the treasury of the state." Section 6207, Compiled Statutes, 1922. There may be some question as to whether the American Legion is not the legal owner as trustee of the income from said investments which is from time to time turned over to it for use in certain specified charitable ways, for as you say the American Legion Department of Nebraska has been disbursing this money (subject to the statutory restrictions as to the pur - poses for which it can be used). It is to be borne in mind, however, that the by-laws which the American Legion adopts providing for such disbursement </seg>
            <seg id="p343">OPINIONS 343 are to be approved by the State Board of Educational Lands and Funds and that it is required to report its disbursements to said board four times a year, so that if the American Legion can be considered at all the owner of said fund it must be in a very qualified sense. GWA STATE SUPPLIES— PURCHASE Supplies must be purchased in the manner designated by statute and upon approval of quarterly estimates and not upon an indeterminate contract. March 3, 1925, C. E.

Dear Sir: You submit to this department the form of a contract for the purchase of certain supplies for the state, under a contract which provided for a certain price on unlimited quantities of certain supplies and providing that the contract should run for one year with an option to the state for an additional year. You ask whether or not this would be a valid contract and also as to the form of the contract and its execution. We call your attention to Section 7282, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides that "No appropriation shall become available for expenditure to any expending agency until such department shall submit to the Department of Finance quarterly estimates of the amount required for such activi - ties to be carried on and such estimate shall have been approved by the Governor; and the account shall be kept and reports rendered showing the expenditure for each such purpose."

After receiving the estimates quarterly as provided it is provided by Section 7284 that the Department of Finance shall notify the bidders as provided in that section. It provides that the schedule furnished to bidders shall contain an itemized statement of the probable number, kind. form, style, size and quality of each article of office supplies and typewriter supplies to be used. Each bid shall be in accordance with the schedule and specifications and the department shall have power to re- E're whatever bond, cash security or certified check from each der as it shall deem necessary to guarantee that the bidder 1 perform the contract. As soon as the foregoing is complied with it seems then that the contract with the bidder may be made. Section 7285 provides that as soon thereafter as practicable, notice shall be given by the department to the successful bidder and he shall within five days thereafter enter into contract with the state to furnish the same in accordance with the schedule and specifica - tions. Unless he so contracts, he loses his bid and the contract is let as provided further in the section. </seg>
            <seg id="p345">OPINIONS 345 It therefore appears that the contract submitted does not comply with the law in that it does not let the contract in ac - cordance with the schedules and estimates which would neces - sarily be required in accordance with the sections heretofore cited. There is no limitation in the contract on the quantity of supplies, etc., to be purchased and the contract is not limited to the quarter as seems to be contemplated by law and does nor contain a description of all those supplies and materials to be purchased and supplied. Therefore, we feel that we could not approve the contract. So far as the execution of contracts of this sort is con - cerned, will say that the sections referred to seem to give the Department of Finance, through its secretary, implied power to execute a contract in behalf of the state. However, this au - thority is not clear and being but implied we would suggest that the safe thing to do and the thing which would meet our approval would be to have the governor not only approve the estimates upon which the contracts are made, but also to secure the execution of the contract in the name of the state by the governor, attested by the secretary of state and approved and executed also by the secretary of the Department of Finance.

We note your further statement that Section 1520, Compiled Stat - utes of 1922, was amended by Senate File No. 96 at the 1925 session of the legislature. In the latter enactment or amend - ment no reference was made to the former amendment as pro - vided in House Roll No. 97 and you inquire if in the opinion of the attorney general House Roll No. 97 of the 1923 session of the legislature was repealed 'by implication. In reply, we direct your attention to the case of State ex rel City of Omaha v.

            <seg id="p347">OPINIONS 347 Superintendent F. A. High, Lincoln, Nebraska, which has been referred to this office for an opinion. We note your statement that it is contended in a prosecu - tion for violation of Section 3273, Compiled Statutes of 192'2. that such statute when enacted failed to comply with that pail of Article III of Section 13 of our Constitution, which in part provides : "No amendment to any bill by one house shall be concurred in by the other nor shall the report of any conference committee as to any bill be adopted by either house except by the assent of the same number of members as is required for the passage of the original bill taken by yeas and nays entered upon the journal." We further note your statement that 3 7 ou are of the opinion that this statute was not properly enacted by the legislature and is therefore void for the reason that the House and Senate journals fail to show the members voting aye and nay on the conference committee report on Senate File No. 196. We are unable to concur in your opinion as to the effect of the failure of the journals to show the names of the persons voting upon this conference report. In Vol. 36, page 957 Cyc, the rule of law pertaining to House journals is stated as follows: "In the passage of a bill by either house the journal thereof must show affirmatively that all the constitutional requirements were com - plied with by it; but such compliance will be presumed, notwithstand - ing the failure of the journal to show such compliance, where it other - wise appears that the legislature has expressed its will in accordance with the constitution. "If it appears from the journal that a bill had not been actually passed it cannot become a law. The journal cannot be impeached on the ground of mistake or fraud. If there are errors the house itself is the only tribunal authorized to correct it." In the case of State v. Frank, 60 Neb. 327 (334) our supreme court has passed upon this section of our Constitution as it formerly appeared. In the opinion of the court by the late Judge Sullivan it is said: </seg>

They also contend that, since the house journal does not show the yea and nay vote upon the final passage of the bill, we are bound to declare, without further inquiry, that the constitutional requirement was not observed, and that the law is, there - fore, null. In other words, respondent's position is that we must look in the office of the secretary of state for a record of the vote, and, if we do not find it, must say that it does not exist now, and that it never did Kt. We are not willing to go quite so ,far for the purpose of over - wing a duly authenticated act of the legislature." On page 330 it is said: "When the journals are defective, mutilated or incomplete, their silence should not, as against the enrolled bill, be taken as evidence that the yeas and nays were not .recorded as required by the constitution. The condition of the house journal, as a record of legislative action upon House Roll 251, does not justify us in accepting it as an unimpeachable witness; and we accordingly hold that the bill was passed in strict con - formity with constitutional procedure." We also direct your attention to the following cases: State v. Abbott, 59 Neb. 106. State v. Mickey, 73 Neb. 281. State v. Jvnkin, 79 Neb. 540. It is a presumption of law that a statute is constitutional ; that it has been properly passed by the legislature and unless the house journals fail to affirmatively show that such statute has not made all of the constitutional and statutory provisions for its enactment, the enrolled bill on file in the secretary of state's office cannot be otherwise impeached. The mere fact that the house journals are silent as to whether or not the aye and nay vote was taken will not be presumed.

Gentlemen : Answering your inquiry of December 30th, will state that the legislature of this state has made very little provision per - taining to the subject of strikes and strikers in this state as we have very little trouble in this connection in this state. How - ever, we have a statute pertaining to the subject of picketing which may be of interest to you and which is self explanatory and is as follows: "That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons, singly or by conspiring together, to interfere, or to attempt to interfere, with any other person in the exercise of his or her lawful right to work, or right to enter upon or pursue any lawful employment he or she may desire, by doing any of the following acts, to- wit: by using profane, insulting, indecent, offensive, annoying, abusive or threatening language toward such person or any member of his or her immediately family, or in his, her or their presence or hearing, for the purpose of inducing or influ - encing, or attempting to induce or influence, such person to quit his or her employment, or to refrain from seeking or freely entering into em - ployment, or persist in talking to or communicating in any manner with such person or members of his or her immediate family against his, her or their will, for such purpose, or to follow or to intercept such per - son from or to his work, from or to his home or lodging, or about the city, against the will of such person, for such purpose, or to photograph such person against his will, or to menace, threaten, coerce, intimidate or frighten, in any manner, such person, for such purpose, or to commit an assault or assault and battery upon such person, for such purpose, or </seg>

Sec. 9753, Comp. St. 1922. Answering your further inquiry, will say that all persons in this state are entitled to equal protection of the law so far as their personal safety is concerned. In time of riot or un - usual emergency the government may call out the "militia to quell the disturbance. We also have a statute defining sabotage.

This section may answer some of your questions, especially if the dance is on Sunday. Evidence of this fact should be presented to the county attorney, and if he fails to prosecute when sufficient evidence is presented then I should be glad to hear from you again: on the other hand, if this dance is run in such manner on week days or nights that it is a nuisance, and that it is merely a rendezvous for drunkeness and disorderly conduct, it is possible to reach it with an action for injunction, as was done with the dance-hall near Norfolk. This also is a matter you should refer to your county attorney with the evi - dence of the acts which are unlawful and complained of. It is first the duty of the county attorney to move on matters of this kind, and since there are ninety-three counties in this state we do not have sufficient funds to function for local officers except in cases where local machinery has broken down or where the burden of prosecution requires assistance. If that be the case in any quarter and local officials refuse to do their duty, the matter should be taken up with the governor with respect to suspension of such officer, and of course, in such cases we try to assist in helping local government to function until some new officer can proceed.

            <seg id="p357">357 OPINIONS The rule is: "Unless specially authorized by statute, assessors have no power to add to their completed assessment roll any names not already included or any items pt property omitted." 37 Cyc, p. 1068. The question then is, has the current year for which these taxes were levied yet expired? The matter is not entirely free from doubt but I am of the opinion the current year during which the taxes for 1925 were levied has not yet expired and that the omitted property may yet be placed on the tax list. Very often the current year means the calendar year, but that is not always its meaning and I do not think it is in this case. It was held in the case of Clark v. Lancaster County, 69 Neb. 717, that the term "current year" did not mean calendar year in the provision of statute then under consideration and in the case of Pittsburg, etc. R. R. Co. v. County Treasurer, 78 Ohio St. 227, the supreme court of Ohio held that the term "current year" meant surrent tax year and not current calendar year. In this state the fiscal year begins July 1st and ends June 30th. . (Section 4891, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.) I suggest that it may be well to notify the individual tax - payers of the proposed action before placing the omitted prop - erty on the tax list. GWA TAXATION— ASSESSMENTS— FOR IRRIGATION Special assessments for irrigation purposes in an irrigation district on school land held under contract should be levied and collected as real estate taxes are levied and collected. September 17, 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p358">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 358 Mr. C. G. Perry, Attorney at Law, Bridgeport, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of inquiry of the 14th instant, addressed to Honorable Dan Swanson, Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, has been referred to this department for answer. You say : "As I understand it, school lands lying within an irrigation district are subject to taxation for irrigation purposes. Are these taxes a lien on the land or on the lease, or what sort of a lien are they? Do you know of any way that a lien for taxes can be enforced in the event a man wished to dispose of his lease without any disposition having been made as to taxes? What would be the result? Your questions are answered. I think, by Section 2877, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which provides among other things: "Assessments on leasehold estates on land belonging to the state are a lien against the property assessed," and further provides that such taxes may be collected as other taxes against real estate are collected, that is to say by a sale of the property assessed. I am of the opinion that any such assessment is not a lien upon the state's interest in the land but is only a lien upon the leasehold interest therein. I am further of the opinion that the owner of the lease cannot transfer or assign the lease so as to cut out the lien of the irrigation assessment thereon, but that if his lease expires by lapse of time or by his default in paying the rent due thereon, and the state leases the land to another party, the new lessee takes his lease free and clear of any pre - vious assessment of the old leasehold interest for irrigation pur - poses. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">OPINIONS 359 TAXATION— BANKS— COLLECTION OF TAX Where a state bank has not failed and is not in the hands of a receiver, the taxes levied against its stock may be collected. June 15. 1926. Mr. Frederick S. Berry, Attorney at Lair, Wayne, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Berry: Your letter of the 12th instant has been received and con - tents noted. I agree with you that where the stock of a national bank has no value and has had none since its affairs came into the hands of a receiver, the receiver is not liable for the taxes levied against it. The cases cited by you, and other ca.ses. too, along the same line, sustain that contention. It seems to me, however, that a different question is pre - sented where the matter at issue is the collection from a state bank which has not gone into the hands of a receiver of the amount of tax levied against its capital stock. In the case of a failed state bank the statute gives federal, state, county and municipal taxes priority over the claims of depositors and holders of exchange. (Section 8033, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922.) It follows logically, I think, that even when a state bank is in the hands of a receiver the taxes levied against its shares of stock are payable out of its assets if there is sufficient left to pay them with after deducting the costs of administering the receivership. Where a state bank has not failed and is not in the hands of a receiver I know of no reason why it should not pay the taxes assessed against its capital stock even though the value of that stock may be impaired to some extent. </seg>
            <seg id="p360">360 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL A natural person who has returned his property for taxa- Ei is not relieved from liability because of the fact that the perty taxed has deteriorated in value or been lost or de - ived after the taxes were levied. Even in the case of a national bank it has been held that: "A state law requiring the national banks to pay the tax which is rightfully laid on the shares of its stock is valid." National Bank v. Commonwealth, 76 N. W. 352. "Under the legislation of Nebraska, shares in national banks may be taxed and the tax enforced by distraint against the property of the bank." First National Bank v. Douglas County, 3 Dillon 330. If such is the law in the case of a national bank why is it not the law in the case of a state bank where the statute gives the claim for taxes priority over the claims of depositors? When the legislature in an amendment of the Guarantee Fund Commission Act in 1925 provided that "The claims of depositors for deposits not otherwise secured, and claims of holders of exchange, shall have priority over all other claims, Eept federal, state, county and municipal taxes, and subject to sdch es, shall at the time of the closing of a bank be a first lien on all the sts of the banking corporation from which they are due." Session Laws, 1925, p. 129. did it not intend the taxes should be paid out of the bank assets if there were assets with which to pay them, even though the assets of the bank were impaired and the depositors could not receive their money in full without drawing on the bank guarantee fund?

May 11, 1926. Han. T. K. Williams, State Tax Vommissioner, Lincoln. Xehrmka. Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiry regarding the deduction of real or other tangible property owned by a bank from the gross value of its capital stock in order to arrive at the value of the stock for taxation purposes, I call your attention to the pro - vision contained in Chapter 165, Session Laws of 1925: "Whenever any such bank, association or company shall have ac - quired real estate or other tangible property which is assessed separ - ately, the assessed value of such real estate or tangible property shall be deducted from the valuation of the capital stock of the association or company. Provided, mortgages, trust deeds, and all other liens or in - terest in real estate less than a fee title, and held as security for loans shall not be considered or assessed as part of the capital stock for pur - poses of taxation, and shall not be deducted from the capital, surplus or undivided profits. The county assessor shall determine and settle the true value of each share of stock after an examination of such state - ments; and in case of a national bank an examination of the last re - port called for by the comptroller of the currency, and if a state bank the last report called for by the Department of Trade and Commerce; and if the county assessor deems it necessary, he may make an ex - amination of the officers of such bank, association or company under oath, in determining and .fixing the true value of such stock, and shall take into consideration the market value of such stock, if any, and the surplus and undivided profits." It is my opinion that under the above quoted provision of statute a bank is entitled to have deducted from the gross value of its capital stock in determining its value for taxation pur- </seg>
            <seg id="p362">362 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL poses, the assessed value of all real estate or other tangible property owned by it and assessed separately (not including, of course, in the deduction trust deeds or other interests in real estate held by it merely as security for loans.) I think, however, that in determining the amount of deduc - tion to be made, the assessor has the right to take into considera - tion the question of whether the value of the real estate whose assessed valuation he is asked to deduct in determining the true value of the capital stock for taxation purposes was included in determining the value of the shares without deductions. I do not understand how it can be contended with any show of reason that real estate belonging to a bank should not be considered as constituting a part of its assets but that the as - sessed value of such real estate should be deducted from the total value of its assets in determining the true value of its capital stock for assessment purposes.

Any taxes so discharged, released, remitted or commuted, may be recovered by civil action from members of any such board, council or trustees, and the sureties on their official bond at the suit ,of any citizen of the county, township, city or village." It is quite clear from the above quoted provision of statute that the legislature has not authorized in any way the com - mutation of any part of taxes due, and it is equally clear that it has no authority under the Constitution to authorize such commutation. Section 4 of Article VIII of the Constitution of Nebraska reads as follows: "The Legislature shall have no power to release or discharge any county, city, township, town or district whatever, or the inhabitants thereof, or any corporation, or the .property therein, from their or its proportionate share of taxes to be levied for state purposes, or due any municipal corporation, nor shall commutation for such taxes be author - ized in any form whatever."

July 11, 1925. Mr. C. A. Bemis, Seward, Nebr. Dear Sir: You say: "The assessor returns certain cottages erected by private individuals with their own funds upon lots owned by a church organization and Esd by church to said individuals for 99 years with annual rental of ). Cottages are only used by owners during the camp meeting ods. Owners of cottages are restricted by church in lease to occu - pancy and alienation," and inquire if such cottages are subject to taxation In r.nswer to your question, I will say that in my opinion ri cottages to which you refer are taxable. The general rule that privately owned property is taxable. If they are exempt it must be upon the ground that they are owned and used exclusively for educational or religious pur - poses, and I do not believe they are owned or used exclusively for either of such purposes. In other words, if a man purchases or constructs a building for the purpose of housing himself and family while he is attending religious services or taking a cour.-e of instruction in some school, I do not believe the fact that the building is so used by him will exempt it from taxation. fn support of the views herein expressed I call attention to the rule of statutory construction that "A grant of exemption from taxation is never presumed, on the con - trary, in all cases of doubt as to the legislative intention or as to the inclusion of particular property within the terms of the statute the pre - sumption is in favor of the taxing power and the burden is on the claimant to establish clearly his right to exemption." 37 Cyc. 891. </seg>

Where a dwelling is erected upon the land of a camp meet - ing association under a parol license or lease for a money con - sideration, the land is subject to taxation because not occupied by the association for its own purposes within the meaning of the statute.

Dear Sir Your questions are answered, I think, by Section 5923, Compiled Statutes. 1922, which reads as follows: "When any person phall bring personal property into the state after the first day of April and prior to the first day of July in any year, it shall be the duty of the assessor to list and return such property for taxation that year, unless the owner thereof shall show to the assessor, under oath and by producing a copy of the assessment duly certified to by the proper officer of the state or county in which said property was assessed, that the property has been listed for taxation for that year in some other county in this state, or in some other state or territory of the United .States, or that such property has been received by him in </seg>

If such property is brought into any county, after the assessor has made his return for that year to the county clerk, the assessor shall at cnce assess such property and return the same to the county clerk, who shall enter the same on the tax books as in other cases. The person so assessed shall have the right to appear before the county clerk at any time before the taxes become due, and the county clerk shall equalize such person's assessment." If the cattle shipped into Rock County from Arizona after April 1, 10-26, were assessed for taxation in Arizona prior to April for the year 19 % 2fi they are not taxable here, but the burden of showing they were assessed for taxation there is upon the owner, who claims they are exempt from taxation here. If cattle were brought into this state between April 1st and te 1st of the present year, being brought here from another e where they were not assessed, they should be assessed to the owner here in my opinion.

The assessor shall de - termine the average amount of the total investment in the business and the amount, if any, by .which the average total investment exceeds the value of the real estate and tangible property so assessed. In determin - ing the excess of the total investment, he shall take into consideration the purchases and sales during the year and for that purpose he shall have the right to inspect all books of account and check books and other records. The pxcess, if any, of the average total investment shall be separately listed and shall be taxed at the same rate as the tangible property and this tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes."

February 15, 1926. Mr. D. F. Kiechel, City Attorney, Superior, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Speaking for the city of Superior, Nebraska, which is a city of the second class, you inquire : 1. "Does Section 4185 coupled with Section 4281 of the 1922 Gen - eral Statutes, give the city council the right to levy a special tax for, (a) building a city hospital, (b) maintaining and .supporting a city hospital? 2. "Does Section 322 of 1922 Statutes give cities of the second class r right to aid the construction of a hospital as a work of 'internal im - ement' or not?" In answering your questions, permit me to say : 1. Inasmuch as Section 4185 gives the city power to erect a hospital I think the city authorities may levy a tax for that purpose without a vote of the electors of the city, provided the amount of such tax together with the amount of all other gen - eral city taxes does not exceed the maximum limit which the city may levy under the law. ti. The right of a city of the second class to vote bonds for the erection of a city hospital upon the ground that it is a work of internal improvement is so doubtful to my mind that I do not advise proceeding along that line under the statute as it now exists.

Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not the taxpayer may deduct from the value of the note which he holds the amount of his indebted - ness in making return for taxation. This has been somewhat a mooted question in the State of Nebraska. The correct answer to same seems to depend con - siderably upon whether the note represents an actual loan of money, or whether the same constituted a "credit" as defined by Section 5914, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1022. Our Supreme Court has held that credits to be returned for taxation mean "net credits" and not "gross credits". This seems an indi - cation that if the note is merely a credit that the net credit should be returned for taxation purposes. This is particularly true in the event that holder of the note is indebted to the maker of same. In that event, you can readily see that each would offset whiit was owing him from the other that which lie owed the other person thus getting the net credit on that trans - action or between those parties. The law does not seem entirely plain as to whether or not indebtedness to peraanb not parties to the particular credit may be deducted. In view of the hold - ings of the court, however, we are inclined to believe that it is the intention of the legislature to ascertain the net worth of the individual for tax purposes and that in ascertaining the amount of credits to be returned it is contemplated that the net amount of credits should lie ascertained which would of necessity re - quire the deduction of outstanding claims against the credits. In this connection we call your attention to the following cases: Hoagland v. Merrick County, 81 Neb. 83. May 27, 192(&gt;. </seg>

What I want to know can the county make a special levy to meet this in excess ,of the levy allowed by law for county purposes?" The correct answer to your question is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court decision upon that point. I am of the opinion, however, that such a levy may be made and without a vote of the electors of the county if the entire levy made by the county board for all purposes including this Lancaster County v. McDonald, 73 Neb. 453. </seg>
            <seg id="p371">OPINIONS 371 purpose does not exceed the fifty cents per one hundred dollars permitted by Section 5 of Article VIII. I base this opinion upon the proposition that paving the streets of an incorporated city or village is not, strictly speak - ing, a county purpose as that term is used in Section 5979, Compiled Statutes, which limits the amount the county board may levy for county purposes. In support of this opinion I cite the case of Powder Hirer Cattle Company v. Johnson County Commixfii&amp;ners, 29 Pac. 361, in which the supreme court of Wyoming held: "The county commissioners may levy a tax for the support of com - mon schools, not to exceed three mills on the dollar, but that the aggre - gate tax for territorial and county purposes should in no case exceed 16 mills on the dollar per annum, the taxes for county purposes do not in - clude taxes levied for the support of the common schools of the county."

            <seg id="p372">372 St. Thomas Orphanage are subject to taxation. In answer to your question I will say that if the bishop holds the legal title to said land in trust for St. Thomas Orphanage to be used by it exclusively for charitable purposes. and if the land is used exclusively for charitable purposes, I am of the opinion it is exempt from taxation. It is provided by "Property owned and used exclusively for * * * charitable • * * purposes when such property is not owned or used for financial gain or profit to either the owner or user." (Section 5821, Compiled Statutes, 1922.) shall be exempt from taxation. You will observe the law does not say that the property shall be owned and used by the same person but merely that it shall be used exclusively for charitable purposes a^id that neither the owner nor the user shall derive financial gain or profit from its use. If the land in question is not rented out but is used by St. Thomas Orphanage itself as a place where the inmates of the institution may be given needed recreation or receive instruction in agriculture, and thus be better fitted to earn a livelihood, I am of the opinion it is not subject to taxation under the pro - vision of statute above quoted. "Property which is used directly for the purposes and in the opera - tion of the charity is exempt although it may be used in a manner to yield some return and thereby reduce expenses." 37 Cyc. 928-929. If a part of the land is rented that part is subject to taxa - tion under the rule laid down in Young Men's Christian Asso - ciation v. Lancaster County, 182 N. W. 593, 106 Neb. 105. in which it was said : "Where certain floor space in a building owned and occupied by a charitable organization is leased to outside parties for the operation of a cafeteria, open to and patronized by the general public as well as the membership, the rentals being applied to the purposes of the organiza - tion, that portion of the building so leased is not exempt from taxation." f \JI7 A " </seg>

Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not all or any of a group of lots purchased by a church for church purposes and title to which passed July 15, 1024, December 10. 1924. and November 2. 1925, are liable for taxes for the year 1925. In answer to your question I will say that whether the property you mention was liable for taxes for the year 1925 de - pends upon whether it was owned and used for church purposes at the time the tax levy was made. In the case of First Christian Church v. City of Beatrice, 39 Neb. 432, it was held : "The exemption by section 2, article 1, chapter 77, Compiled Statutes, of 'property which may be used exclusively for religious pur - poses' does not extend to property owned by a religious society separate and distinct from that on which is situated its church edifice, the mere intention in the future to erect such an edifice on said property not so occupied, and the accumulation of the present rents arising therefrom for that purpose, not being sufficient to bring the property within the purview of the statute referred to." The Constitution does not exempt church property from taxation, but it clothes the legislature with power to exempt it where it is owned and used exclusively for religious purposes. You will observe that it takes both ownership and use for re - ligious purposes to exempt property from taxation. GWA </seg>

November 19, 1926. Hon. T. E. Williams, Tax Commissioner, Lincoln, Xehraska. Dear Mr. Williams In answer to your inquiry regarding the proper method of taxing certain cars belonging to the American Railway Express Company which are used and operated in this state — not by the express company itself, but by various railroads to whom it leases its cars — I will say that inasmuch as the American Rail - way Express Company owns these cars even though it does not operate them but leases them to others, it comes within the definition of a car company as that term is defined in Sub - division 3 of Section 5861, Compiled Ftatutes of Nebraska, which reads as follows: "The term 'car company' shall include any person, association or corporation owning or operating sleeping cars, refrigerator cars, stock cars, furniture cars, or cars of any other description over any line or lines of railroad, or parts thereof, in this state." The fact that the American Railway Express Company pays an occupation tax as an express company under the provis - ions of Section 7141, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, does not relieve it from the payment of a property tax. This is made clear by the provisions of Section 7145, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which reads as follows: "The provisions of this article shall in no wise operate against the collection of taxes from express companies, as provided by the general revenue laws of this state."

Dear Sir: You inquire if gasoline obtained and placed in a tank wagon at a tank service station of an oil company in Omaha, which is later hauled across the river into Council Bluffs. Iowa, is subject to the gasoline tax of 2 cents per gallon in this state. In reply to your inquiry, permit me to suggest that under the law the tax is levied on the business of handling gasoline by a dealer in this state, and that tax amounts to 2 cents per gallon for each gallon handled by such dealer. Under the facts as you present them it is my opinion that it matters not whether the gasoline purchased in Omaha be used in this state or trans - ported to another state. After the same is obtained from the dealer in this state it is subject to the 2 cents tax under the Nebraska law. OSS </seg>

Dear Sir: You inquire whether it is possible to provide by law that taxes on personal property shall be a lien upon such property from and after the first day of April of the year in which they are assessed. In reply, would suggest that our court has not passed on this particular question, but I find that a similar question has been before the courts in some of the states. For instance, the supreme court of the State of Washington in City of Puyallup v. Lakin. County Treasurer, 88 Pac. Rep. 578, held: t'^hen valued by the assessor, personal property is 'assesSed'. In the meaning of Session Laws, 1903, p. 74, c. 59, art. 3, providing personal property taxes shall be a lien upon all real estate and per- I property from the date the assessment is made." The same court in the case of State v. Snohont-ixh ('aunty, et al., 128 Pac. Rep. 667. held that "Section 9235, Rem. &amp; Bal.

Roberts County, South Dakota, 34 So. Dak. 498; 149 N. W. 163; 1915-D, L. R. A. 886, in which the court said: "Under a statute making all taxes upon personal property a first lien on all personal property of the person against whom they are assessed, an assessment of a personal property tax will take precedence, as to the entire tax on the owner's personalty, of an existing chattel mortgage given to secure the purchase price of a particular article of machinery." The note under said case as set forth in L. R. A. 1915-D page 886, states that "The proposition expressly held by the court in Minneapolis Thresh - ing Machine Company v.

June 26, 1925. Hon. Sam K. GreenUaf, County Assessor, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Greenleaf As requested, I have considered the matter of taxation of officers and soldiers of the United States Army stationed in Omaha. I assume that these men are stationed in Omaha pur - suant to orders of the War Department, and that they have no voice in the matter of deciding where they shall be stationed or the length of their stay. It has been suggested that some of them are not quartered on the government's reservation, as they usually are under normal conditions. The fact, however, seems to be that some of them are in Omaha outside of the reserva - tion due to the lack of quarters on the reservation, and their present location is merely a matter of convenience to the gov - ernment. Being in the nature of transients and with the excep - tion of such real estate as they may own, in my opinion, they should not be compelled to pay taxes.

In our judgment the legislature by the amendment of 1891 intended to authorize county com - missioners in their discretion to use money in the ditch fund to pay for removing obstructions from any public ditch constructed under the pro - visions of article 1, ch. 89, Comp. St. 1909. In Hail v. State, 54 Neb. 280, cited by the plaintiff, the warrant which formed the basis for the re - lator's demand for a writ of mandamus was issued in 1889, and the opinion is correct as applied to the statute then in force." Section 1098, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides as follows: "The county board .shall, if necessary, at their June session, levy a E, not exceeding one mill on the dollar of the assessed valuation of the nty, sufficient to pay for the location and construction of such por - 18 of the respective ditches located by them, or by the county board two or more counties, as may be apportioned to the county, and the loval of any obstructions that may accumulate in any portion of any ditch. * • •" In view of the holding in Seng. v.

Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, pro - vides that "All improvements put on leased public lands shall be assessed to the owner of such Improvements as personal property, together with the value of the lease and listed and assessed as such in the place where the td is situated, and the taxes imposed on such improvements shall be lected by levy and sale of the interest of such owner, the same as in all other cases of collection of taxes on personal property, or by suit in the name of the county against such owner."

            <seg id="p383">OPINIONS 383 September 2, 1926. Mr. J. H. Steuteville, County Attorney, Bridgeport, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire concerning the collection of taxes on the pur - chaser's interest in certain school lands sold on contract and situated within certain irrigation districts in your county. You say: "Some of these irrigation districts are pretty hard up, and some lands under some of them are state lands under contract. They are in irrigation districts. The owner of the contract, of course, has an equity in the land, and the state the fee, and in case these taxes are re - maining unpaid, what is the remedy of the county and of the irrigation district to get these taxes? Are assessed as real estate taxes or as personal taxes, and would we have to foreclose on the tax sale certificate to shut out the contract owner, , or in your opinion can the county levy on this contract, that is, the owner's interest in it, and sell it as per - sonal property for the recovery of the taxes?" Permit me to say in answer to your letter that in my opin - ion these taxes should be levied, assessed and collected as real estate taxes are levied, assessed and collected, but, of course, the land should only be valued at what the purchaser's interest is worth for the purpose of general taxation. The law recog - nizes that the interest of the purchaser in school land not fully paid for is real estate. Thus it is said: "The interest of a vendee in possession of school lands under a con - tract of purchase from the state, part of the purchase price of the land having been paid, at his death, descends to his heirs, and does not pass to his administrator. It is alienable, descendible and devisable in like manner as if it were real estate held by a legal title." Mauzy v. Hinrich*. 89 Neb. 280. And the law contemplates that the purchaser's interest in such land may be sold for taxes. Thus it is said : "Whenever any school or university land bought on credit is sold for taxes, the purchaser at such tax sale shall acquire only the interest </seg>

GWA TAXATION— PROPERTY OF A CLUB Property belonging to a club which is not used exclusively for educa - tional or charitable purposes is subject to taxation. June 30, 1926. Mr. L. H. AfcKUUp, County Attorney, Seward, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 29th instant in re taxation of property in your county belonging to the Kiwanis Club of Lincoln. I will say that in my opinion such property is taxable in view of the state of facts mentioned in your letter. The Kiwanis Club, I take it, is neither a religious or charitable organization and the property in question is not used exclusively for educational, religious or charitable purposes, and if it is not, I know of no provision of statute which exempts it. It is to be borne in mind in this connection : "Statutes containing exemptions from taxation construed strictly in favor of the state." * should be 36 Cyc. 1177. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">OPINIONS 385 I am also inclined to the opinion that the buildings built and owned by individual holders of leases at Riverside Park, said leases being given by the trustees of the Nebraska Confer - ence of the Evangelical Association, are not exempt from taxa - tion. I do not believe such buildings are owned and used exclusively for religious purposes although they may have been erected in the first instance for the use of the owner and his family and possibly his guests while attending camp meeting. "It is well settled that a rectory or parsonage, built and owned by a religious society, is not exempt from taxation as a place for public worship — and even though the statute exempts church property used for 'religious purposes', this is held not to include the rectory or parsonage." 37 Cyc. 1)43-944. "A grant of exemption from taxation is never presumed, in all cases of doubt as to the legislative intention, or as to the inclusion of particular property within the terms of the statute, the presumption is in favor of the taxing power." 37 Cyc. 891. GWA TAXATION— SPECIAL TAXES The property of a church or religious institution is not exempt from paying a special assessment made for the purpose of improving such property in any improvement district. The statutory provision ex - empting property used for religious purposes pertain3 only to the exemption of such property from the general taxes. Mr. John 11. Stewart Friend, Nebraska. In reply to your favor of the 13th instant inquiring con - cerning the &lt;ts.-es*nient of property for paving purposes along September 15, 1926. Dear Mr. Stewart : </seg>
            <seg id="p386">386 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL church property, you are informed that paving tax is a special assessment and is known as a special tax. In the case of City of Beatrice v. Brethren Church of Beatrice, 41 Neb. 358, our supreme court held that the constitu - tional provision exempting church property from assessment rained only to the general taxation and that a church was exempt by reason of such constitutional provision from pay - ing special taxes. Section 4283, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 135, Senate File 106, page 330, Session Laws of 1923, authorizes cities of the second class and villages to pave or otherwise improve the streets and to levy a tax there - for by organizing certain improvement districts. This statute does not exempt church property. Where it is located in an immediate district the church would be liable for its share of the tax assessed as a benefit by such improvement. LB TAXES— PAYMENT WITH STATE WARRANT State warrants are receivable in payment for state taxes. November 22, 1926. Honorable C. D. Robinson, State Treasurer, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether county treasurers in making their set - tlements with the state treasurer for state taxes collected by them are permitted to turn in state warrants. Your inquiry is answered I think by the words of the ■ &gt;\.'i\ t u to which provides * </seg>
            <seg id="p387">OPINIONS 387 "State warrants are receivable for the amount payable into the state treasury on account of tax levied for general state purposes." Section 5997, Compiled Statutes, 1922 and further provides "The treasurers of the several counties shall pay into the state treasury all funds in their hands belonging thereto on or before the tenth day of each month, and at such other times as the, state treasurer shall require, and the sums so paid in shall be the identical state war - rants, if any received by the treasurer for payment of the taxes, or in coin or in treasury notes of the United States." Section 6035, Compiled Statutes, 1922. It is clear, I think, from the reading of the sections of statute above quoted that county treasurers must receive state warrants when tendered in payment of state taxes, and that they have a right to turn in such warrants in their settlements with the state treasurer. I am further of the opinion that the word "warrants" in - cludes registered warrants. In fact, where there is money on hand with which to pay warrants such warrants will rarely if ever be tendered in payment of taxes. If the warrant can be turned into money at once that will be done in practically all instances, and the taxes will be paid with cash instead of with warrants. GWA </seg>

Compiled Stat - utes of Nebraska for 1 ( &gt;2:&gt;. provides that in cities of the first class, having between five thousand and twenty-five thousand inhabitants, the city treasurer is charged by law with collecting all paving and curbing taxes. Keferring to Section 4323, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1022, we find it provides that in cities of the second class, and villages, the treasurer of each city and village shall l&gt;e the custodian of all money lx'longing to the corporation. lender Section 4340, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, it is provided that the taxes belonging to cities of the :-econd class, and villages, are certified to and collected by the county treasurer, but Section 4370. Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for \$±2. provides: "The treasurer of the county shall pay over on demand to the treasurer of any city or village all money received by him arising from taxes levied belonging to said city or village."

After careful consideration of these various sections of the law, and after construing them together, I am of the opinion that the city treasurer is the legal custodian of paving taxes, but where the paving bonds of a city or the interest thereon are made payable at the office of the county treasurer, it is the duty of the city treasurer to remit to the county treasurer the required amount to redeem such bonds or coupons at least ten days before the same become due. With school bond funds we find a different rule, and there, it seems that the treasurer keeps such funds because they are all payable at his office. The law provides as follows : "It shall be the duty of the county board in each county to levy annually upon all the taxable property in each school district in such county, a tax sufficient to pay the interest accruing upon any bonds issued by such school district, and to provide a sinking fund for the final redemption of the same, such levy to be made with the annual levy of the county, and the taxes collected with other taxes, and when col - lected shall be and remain in the hands of the county treasurer a specific fund for the payment of the interest upon 3uch bonds, and for the final payment of the same at maturity.

September 25, 1925. Mr. L. A. Goynes, City Manager, Cnce, Nebraska. Sir: We have your favor of the 19th instant requesting the opinion of the attorney general as to whether or not House Roll 214, Chapter 172, page 448, Session Laws of 1925, commonly known as the gasoline tax law, contravenes either Section 2 or Section 7 of Article VIII of the Constitution of Nebraska. In reply, we direct your attention as follows Section 2, Article VIII, of the Constitution of Nebraska, as amended, in part provides: "The property of the state and its governmental subdivisions shall be exempt from taxation." Section 7 of Article VIII provides: "Private property shall not be liable to be taken or sold for the payment of the corporate debts of municipal corporations. The legis - lature shall not impose taxes upon municipal corporations, or the in - habitants or property thereof for corporate purposes." The foregoing constitutional provisions requires an exam - ination of the statute in question to determine as follows: 1. Does the statute under consideration attempt to levy a property tax upon property of the state of Nebraska, or a gov - ernmental subdivision thereof? 2. Does the statute under consideration subject private property to be taken or sold for the payment of the corporate debts of municipal corporations. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">OPINIONS 391 3. Does the statute in question impose taxes upon munici - pal corporations, or the inhabitants or property thereof, far corporate purposes? If such statute does any one of the foregoing things, then it is unconstitutional insofar as it applies to municipal cor - porations. Subdivision "C" of Section 1 of the act specifically pro - vides that it shall apply to state, county, municipality or sub - division or either thereof, and defines "dealer" as follows: "The term 'Dealers' is hereby defined and includes any person, firm, co-partnership, company, agency, association, corporation, state, county, municipality or subdivision or either thereof, who imports or causes to be imported into the State of Nebraska, and also any person, firm, co-partnership, company, agency, association, corporation, state, county or municipality or subdivision or either thereof, who produces, refines, manufactures or compounds such motor vehicle fuel as herein defined, any part of which is for use, distribution, sale or delivery in the State of Nebraska." Section 5 of the act provides that each dealer shall pay a tax as follows: "Every dealer who is now engaged or who may hereafter engage, in his own name, or in the name of others, or in the name of his repre - sentatives or agents in this state, in the sale, distribution and use of motor vehicle fuels, shall, not later than the fifteenth day of each cal - endar month, beginning with May 15, 1925, render to the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, on forms prescribed, prepared and fur - nished by said Secretary, duplicate sworn statements of the number of gallons of motor vehicle fuels sold, distributed and used by such dealer in the State of Nebraska during the preceding calendar month, which statement shall be sworn to by a resident of the State of Nebraska who is a principal officer, general agent, managing agent, attorney-ln-fact, chief accountant, or owner. And in addition to the taxes now provided for by law, shall at the time said statement is filed pay a tax of two cents (2c) per gallon upon all motor vehicle fuels, as shown by such statement, remitting said tax to said Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, who shall receipt the dealer therefor, and shall forthwith deliver to the state treasurer one copy of said sworn statement specified in this section, and pay to said state treasurer all of the money thus re - ceived. The Department of Agriculture shall have authority to adjust all errors in payments, to pay all refunds payable under this Act, and to issue vouchers therefor." </seg>
            <seg id="p392">392 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 12 sets forth the purpose for which the funds so raised may be used as follows: "All sums of money received under this Act .by the State Treasurer shall be placed by him in a fund to be known as the Gasoline Highway Fund. Out pt said fund there shall be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to administer and carry out the provisions of this Act. The balance remaining in said fund shall be, by the State Treasurer, upon the first day of each month, transferred to the Department of Public Works. The Department of .Public Works shall place this money in a special fund for the improvement, including construction and main - tenance, of the State and Federal Highway System as contemplated in Section 8344, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922; Provided, said money may be used in conjunction with Federal Aid money and when so used shall be expended in compliance with Section 8355, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and shall be .apportioned to the credit of the several counties of the state for improving the State and Federal Highway System within, the counties as provided in Section 5 of Chap - ter 185, Laws of Nebraska for 1917." The foregoing provisions of the act disclose that the tax is not levied upon the -property but upon the privilege or right to use or deal in gasoline, and as such, is an excise or license tax and not a property tax. The amount of the tax assessed for such privilege is measured by two cents per gallon of the amount of gasoline or motor vehicle fuel oil used or sold by such dealer. In the recent case of Bowman v. Continental Oil Company, 256 TJ. S. 642; 41 Sup. Ct. Rep. C06, 65 L. Ed. 1139, the supreme court of the United States held a similar statute of the state of New Mexico provided for an excise or license tax and further held that a state had the right to make such a tax. The court in part said: "The tax imposed by the act under consideration upon the 'sale or use of all gasoline sold or used in this state' is not property taxation, but in effect, as in name, an excise tax. We see no reason to doubt the power of the state to select this commodity as distinguished from others in order to impose an excise tax upon its sale and use."

            <seg id="p393">OPINIONS 393 the United States District Court for the western district of New York, in passing upon a similar question held : "The next contention arises from the sales of fire trucks and ap - paratus to municipalities. It is perfectly true that the federal govern - ment cannot .burden the state or subdivision thereof to which automobile trucks, etc., were sold by plaintiff, by imposing taxes upon them, although there is no express provision of the Constitution prohibiting it. The well-established exception of states and their subdivisions from tax by the federal government is implied from our dual system of government, and the principle that the national and state governments must function separately, and separately maintain instrumentalities for conducting their governmental operations, and accordingly the states and munici - palities cannot be hampered or impaired by administering their own affairs by the taxing 4 power of the national Congress. The tax in the present instance, however, was not a direct tax on the municipalities to which articles were sold, nor on the articles acquired. The tax imposed on plaintiff was for the privilege of vending and dealing in the manu - facturer! articles. Section 602 (Comp. St. 1918, Sec. 6309%c). There was no connection as agent or otherwise between plaintiff and the mu - nicipalities. It does not relieve plaintiff that sales to municipalities were under contract. This principle of taxation on sales finds support by analogy in various cases decided by the supreme court of which United States V. Perkins. 163 U. S. 625, 16 Sup. Ct. 1073, 41 L. Ed. 287; Snyder v. Bettman. 190 U. S. 249, 23 Sup. Ct. 803, 47 L. Ed. 1035, and South Carolina ». United States, 199 U. S. 437, 26 Sup. Ct. 110, 50 L. Ed. 261, 4 Ann. Cas. 737. are believed fair examples. The first two cases re - lated to taxation of bequests to the United States and to states and municipalities. The court held that the taxes imposed were upon the right to acquire property by succession or will and not upon the prop - erty of the state or municipality. In the South Carolina case certain persons, as agents of the state were selling intoxicating liquor, and the court held that the salesmen were not relieved from paying the internal revenue tax, even though they had no interest in the profits, since the tax was not upon the property of the state, but upon the means by which that property was acquired. By a parity of reasoning the mu - nicipalities which bought fire vehicles are not in fact required to pay the tax* and hence the liability therefor is based upon the manufacturer or salesman." Our supreme court has recognized the right of the legisla - ture to provide for an occupation, excise or license tax in the case of Aachen d- Munich Fire Ins. Co. v. City of Omaha, 72 Xeb. 518 (523), 101 N. W. 3, wherein the court said: </seg>
            <seg id="p394">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 394 is never presumed that the legislature enacted a law with the ition of violating the constitution, ,and it is a sound rule that if two inable constructions of a statute may be made, one of which will not violate the organic law while the other will, that construction is to be preferred which is in accordance with constitutional provisions. The tax in question is not a license tax imposed upon this corporation as a condition precedent to being allowed to do business in this state; no element of police power enters into it; its purpose is merely to raise revenue; it is a tax upon the business of transacting fire insurance by a class of fire insurance companies ,who are incorporated in other states and foreign countries. It is not a property tax, but it is a tax on insur - ance interests which is a business tax, and is not authorized by the first subdivision of Section 1, Article IX of the Constitution." "In Hughes v. City of Cairo, 92 111. 339, the constitutionality of a statute which authorized the cities and villages of the state of Illinois impose &amp;. tax upon the premium receipts of foreign insurance com - iles doing business within their respective limits was assailed, but court upheld the imposition levied as a valid exercise of the power taxation." "In the absence of constitutional restraints, the power of the legis - lature over taxation is as unlimited as the subject with which it deals. In our constitution, that power is restrained in two particulars only, namely, taxes upon property and franchises are required to be levied in proportion to value and taxes upon persons or occupations are to be uni- Ewith respect to the classes affected by them, but the legislature is with a free hand in the matter of classification, and as to what es shall be taxed and what exempt, and as to the gravity of the burden imposed upon the former. It is only required that such taxes for general state revenue purposes shall be levied in accordance with a uniform rule, and that those levied by munipical corporations shall be imposed by corporate authorities in the exercise of powers conferred upon them by the legislature." It is therefore the opinion of the attorney general that House Roll 214, Chapter 172, page 448, Session Laws, 1925, known as the gasoline tax law. is a statute providing for a license or excise tax, assessed upon the privilege of using or dealing in gasoline within this state, and is in no sense a tax upon property. In the absence of any constitutional restriction prohibiting the levying of an excise or license tax, the legislature may pass such a statute. </seg>
            <seg id="p395">OPINIONS 395 It is further the opinion of the attorney general that since the tax provided for is a license or excise tax the statute does not attempt to tax property of the state of Nebraska or any governmental subdivision thereof, neither does such statute sub - ject private property to be taken or sold for the payment of the corporate debts of municipal corporations, nor does the statute impose taxes upon municipal corporations, or inhabitants or property thereof, for corporate purposes, and is not in contra - vention of any of the provisions of the amended Constitution of the State of Nebraska, pertaining to the taxing of property of the state, county, municipality or any sub-division thereof. It is further the opinion of the attorney general that each municipality or any subdivision thereof which uses or deals in gasoline or motor vehicle fuel oil as provided in said House Roll 214 is subject to the payment of such occupation tax, and where the officials of such municipality or subdivision thereof fail to pay such tax in the manner therein provided, such offi - cials are subject to the penalty therein provided. LB GASOLINE TAX— EXEMPTIONS The provisions of the statute, House Roll 214, providing for an occupa - tion tax of 2 cents per gallon to be assessed upon those dealing in gasoline and motor vehicle fuel oil is an occupational tax assessed upon the privilege of engaging in such business, measured by 2 cents per gallon upon the number of gallons used or sold by such dealer and is such a tax upon such property.

S. 50C&gt;. «7 L. ed. 1005, in the opinion written by Chief Jn«tice Taft. the supreme court of the United States construed a recent jrasoline tax law enacted by the state of Texas as it affected interstate commerce. The court said in part : </seg>
            <seg id="p398">398 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The question we have to decide is whether oil transported by ap - pellants from New York or elsewhere outside of Texas to their ware - rooms or warehouse in Texas, there held for sale in Texas in original packages of transportation, and subsequently sold and delivered in Texas in such original packages, .may be made the basis of an occupa - tion tax upon appellants, when the state tax applies to all wholesale dealers in oil engaged in making sales and delivery in Texas. "Our conclusion must depend on the answer to the question: Is this a regulation of, or a burden upon interstate commerce? We think It is neither. The oil had come to a state of rest in the warehouse of the appellants, and had become a part of their stock with which they proposed to do business as wholesale dealers in the state. The inter - state transportation was at an end, and whether in the original pack - ages, or not, a state tax upon the oil as property, or upon its sale in the state, if the state law levied the same tax on all oil or all sales of ,it, without regard to origin, would be neither a .regulation nor a burden of the interstate commerce of which this oil had been the subject. • * • "The distinction between the immunity from state taxation of im - ports in original packages, and that of articles coming from interstate commerce in original packages, is again brought out with emphasis by Mr. Justice White, afterwards Chief Justice, in American Steel d Wire Co. v. Speed, 192 U. S. 522, 49 L. ed. 547, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365. In that case, articles of hardware were shipped by the American Steel &amp; Wire Company from their factories in the East to Memphis, Tennessee, and there kept in store in original packages, to be distributed to Arkansas and other states when sold, on orders to be subsequently secured. Memphis, under a general law, imposed a merchant's tax on the Wire Company, based on the average capital invested in the business, and included this stock of original packages in the average. The court conceded that if these goods were 'imports', they could not be taxed under Brown v. Maryland, but said (p. 510): 'But the goods not having been brought from abroad, they were not imported in the legal sense, and were subject to state taxation after they had reached their destination and whilst held in the state for sale;' and cited the cases of Woodruff v. Parham and Brown v. Houston." "Many of the sales by the appellants were made by them before the oil to fulfill the sales was sent to Texas. These were properly treated by the state authorities as exempt from state taxation. They were, in effect, contracts for the sale and delivery of the oil across state lines.

            <seg id="p400">400 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The case of Bowman v. Continental Oil Co. was the same case as the Askren Case, the representatives of the state having changed. The Askren Case had come here on appeal from an interlocutory injunction, and was decided on the averments of the bill. When the case went back, an answer was filed and the case was heard, and it turned out that only 5 per cent of the business was in tank cars and unbroken packages sold, and that 95 per cent was in sales of gasoline in quantities desired. The main point decided in the Bowman Case was that a license tax law which imposed a lump tax as a condition of doing business, part of which it was unlawful under the Federal Constitution to tax, must be declared void, though the other part of the business might have been properly the subject of such a tax. As to the excise tax, the court directed the in - junction to issue with respect to the imposition upon sales of gasoline brought from without the state into the state of New Mexico, and there sold and delivered to customers in the original packages, whether tank cars, barrels, or other packages, and in the same form and condition as when received by plaintiff in that state.' If this covered gasoline that was ordered by the purchaser before importation, it was right. If it covered gasoline, whether in original packages or not, which was sold after it reached its destination, then it is not in accord with the law as we understand it to be under the authorities we have cited. There is nothing in the case, as disclosed either in the statements of facts in the Askren or the Bowman Case, to show what the fact was in this regard." In the case of Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., 256 U. S. C)+i&gt;. 41 Sup. Ok Rep. C&gt;OC». 86 L. ed. 1130. the Supreme Court of the United States held, speaking through Mr. Justice Pitney in construing the gasoline tax law enacted by the state of New Mexico, which imposed an excise tax of '2 cents for each gallon of gasoline sold or used and an annual license contract of $."&gt;0.00 for each distributing station or place of business: "Upon the going down of the mandate, plaintiff amended its bill by averring that, in addition to carrying on the business of buying and selling gasoline and other petroleum products, it is using gasoline at each of its distributing stations within the state of New Mexico (37 in number), in the operation of its automobile tank wagons and other - wise; that, under the terms of the act, it is prohibited from using this gasoline except upon the payment of the excise tax of 2 cents per gallon therefor; that this is a property tax, void under sec. 1, of article 8, of the State Constitution, because not levied in proportion to the value of E gasoline; and that the imposition of the tax denies to the plaintiff equal protection of the laws, and amounts to a taking of its prop - without due process of law, in contravention of the 14th Amend- </seg>
            <seg id="p401">OPINIONS 401 ment, and, further, is in violation of the commerce clause of the Con - stitution of the United States." * * * "The tax imposed by the act under consideration upon the 'sale or use of all gasoline sold or used in this state' is not property taxation, but in effect, as in name, an excise tax. We see no reason to doubt the power of the state to select this commodity, as distinguished from others, in order to impose an excise tax upon its sale and use; and since the tax operates impartially upon all, and with territorial uni - formity throughout the state, we deem it 'equal and uniform upon sub - jects of taxation of the same class,' within the meaning of sec. 1 of article 8. "There is no substance in the objection that the excise tax, as ap - plied to domestic sales and domestic use of gasoline, infringes plaintiff's rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment." In the ease of »S7. Louis d- E. St. L. Elec. li. Co. v. State of Missouri, 25(5 U. S. 415. (55 L. ed. !'4C&gt;. where a suit was brought by the plaintiff to recover a tax assessed upon the intangible property of a street railway company, the company owns a part of its electric line in the State of Missouri and another part in Illinois and in passing upon the case, the court said in part: "It is not contended that this valuation is unreasonable in amount, but only that the property of the company, which was valued as 'all other property,' consisted solely of its franchise to conduct interstate passenger traffic over the interstate bridge, and that therefore the tax, so far as levied on the valuation placed on that property, is a direct tax and burden on the right to engage in interstate commerce, and that it is, for this reason, unconstitutional." * * * "The law applicable to the state of facts thus developed was sum - marized in Atlantic it P. Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia. 190 D. S. 160, 47 L. cd. 995, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817, in a form which has been frequently ap - proved by this court, notable in St. Louis Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Arkansas. 235 U. S. 350, 365, 50 L. ed. 265, 272, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99. Slightly condensed, it is that, while a state may not, in the guise of taxation, constitutionally compel a corporation to pay for the privilege of engag - ing in interstate commerce, yet this immunity does not prevent the state from imposing an ordinary property tax upon property having a situs within its territory and employed in interstate commerce. Even the franchise of a corporation, if not derived from the United States, al - though that franchise is the business of interstate commerce, is subject to state taxation as a part of its property." </seg>
            <seg id="p402">402 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL In 37 C. J., page 216, Section 72, the author states the rul - ing pertaining to the tax of governmental agencies as follows: "A state cannot impose a tax upon the business of an agency or instrument of the federal government such as a national bank or rail - road company operating under a frachise granted by the United States." It is therefore the opinion of the attorney general that any person, firm, partnership, company, agency, association, corpora - tion, body politic or municipality who shall buy and use any motor vehicle fuel and consume the same for the purpose of operating or propelling tractors and combines used for strictly agricultural pufposes, except in the operation of motor vehicles upon or over highways, streets or alleys, within this state, should be reimbursed the amount of said tax so paid, provided such person so using the same shall have paid such tax under protest to the Department of Agriculture and file claims for reimburse - ment in the manner prescribed by such Department of Agri - culture within thirty days after the purchase of such gasoline or motor vehicle fuel oils. It is further the opinion of the attorney general that the provisions of said act do not apply to foreign or interstate com - merce. However, when gasoline and motor vehicle fuel oils are imported into this state for the purpose of sale either in the original or broken packages for use that the interstate trans - poration thereof terminates upon said oils acquiring a local situs, and that such oils are then subject to the payment of the tax as provided by said House Boll 214. • Any person, firm, corporation, co-partnership, company, agency, association, body politic or municipality owning or operating a railroad engaged in domestic and interstate com - merce and being domiciled within this state, which uses gaso - line or motor fuel oils in carrying on or conducting such domestic and interstate commerce within this state is required to make the payment of such tax, notwithstanding the fact that such person imports such motor fuel oils where such motor fuel oils so imported acquire a local situs and where such tax is uni - form in regard to the domestic commerce as well as interstate commerce. </seg>
            <seg id="p403">OPINIONS 403 It is further the opinion of the attorney general that the act does not apply to the use of such gasoline or motor vehicle oil when used by an agency of the federal government. How - ever, the sale by a dealer to an agency of the federal govern - ment is not exempt from the provisions of the act unless such sale is a tax upon such agency of the federal government. However, the act specifically provides in defining the term ''dealer" that it shall include municipalities or subdivision thereof which sells or uses gasoline. It is our opinion that gasoline or motor vehicle fuel oil used by a municipality or any subdivision thereof or department thereof within this stat. 1 , is subject to the payment of such tax. Inasmuch as the act provides for the reimbursement of the tax by the Department of Agriculture, where it appears that such gasoline and motor vehicle fuel oil is used for a purpose exempted by the act, it is our opinion that where a dealer or person claims exemption from such act, that such tax should be paid under protest and affidavits filed in the manner pro - vided by such act and the rules of the Department of Agricul - ture, and when the department is satisfied that the use for which such gasoline or motor fuel oil has been sold conies within the exemptions of the act. such dealer or person should then be reimbursed for the amount of such tax thus paid under protest.

November 2. 192&lt;5. Dr. T. W. Buna, Chief, Dirision of Gasoline Taut. Department of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: AVe have your inquiry stating that a certain company is engaged in selling, among: other products, a high grade naphtha which may be used for cleaning purposes, and inquiring if such product is subject to the occupation tax provided for in House Roll 214. commonly known as the gasoline tax law. Section "B" of House Roll 214, page 448. Session Laws of Nebraska for 1935, in defining motor vehicle fuels subject to the provisions of such act is as follows: " 'Motor Vehicle Fuels' are hereby denned and shall include such fuels known as gasoline, naphtha, benzine, benzol and such other volatile and inflammable liquid as may be produced or compounded for the pur - pose of, or as may be used for, operating or propelling motor vehicles except the product commonly known as kerosene oil, kerosene distillate, crude petroleum, residum, gas oil or smudge oil." It will be observed that the tax applies to naphtha and other volatile and inflammable liquids which may be produced or compounded for the purpose of, or may be used for operating or propelling motor vehicles. The statutes do not require that such commodity shall be used only for the purpose of propelling motor vehicles, but also includes such commodities above named, including naphtha which may be used for such purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p405">OPINIONS 405 It is therefore the opinion of the attorney general that any person who is a dealer as defined by House Roll 214, supra, who sells naphtha, which product may Ix* used or could be used for the purpose of propelling a motor vehicle, or which product could be produced or compounded for such purpose, is subject to the payment of the tax provided for in said House Roll 214. notwithstanding the fact that the purchaser of such product may not desire to use the same for propelling a motor vehicle. LB TRUST COMPANIES— INVESTMENT OF FUNDS A trust company may invest trust fund3 in loans secured by first mort - gages upon real estate mortgages unless the agreement upon which such funds are received precludes such an investment. October 27. 1926. Honorable Kirk Griggt, Secretary. Department of Trade and Commerce. Lincoln, Xehraska. Dear Sir: You inquire: "If a trust company were to loan on first mortgage, securing several notes, would you consider that it might lawfully invest trust funds In a part or all of these notes? It has been necessary, in numerous instances, for trust companies to foreclose on such mortgages, and expenses have been incurred in the payment of taxes, costs, etc. "If investment of trust funds had been made in the notes or parts thereof, in your opinion, could such advances of expense be deducted by the trust company from the principal of such trust funds; also, would other investors be liable for their proportion of such expenses and could the payment thereof be demanded and collection enforced?" In answer to your questions I will say : </seg>
            <seg id="p406">406 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 1. It is clear, of course, that a trust company may law - fully loan money upon real estate provided the loan is not made for more than forty per cent of the appraised value of such real estate (Section 868, Compiled Statutes, 1922), and I find nothing in the law which forbids the loan of trust funds upon such security. The statute provides, however, that such com - pany has power: "To receive trust funds for investment or in trust upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon." The general rule is: "The creator of a trust requiring the investment of money may direct how the investment shall be made, and what securities shall be taken, • • •" 39 Cyc. 405. It is therefore possible, although not very probable, I think, that a trust fund may be received upon such terms and condi - tions as will bar its investment in real estate securities. In the absence of any terms or conditions under which trust funds are received limiting their investment to other kinds of securities, I think it is entirely proper to invest such funds in notes secured by mortgages on real estate. 2. When it becomes necessary to foreclose the mortgage securing such an investment, the question as to whether the expenses connected with such foreclosure can be deducted from the principal of a trust fund by the trust company, depends, in my opinion, upon the facts involved in that particular case. "Where a trustee has made improper investments, the cestui que trust has an election to take the original fund and legal interest thereon, or to take the fund as invested at the time of the accounting and all legal profits realized by the trustee thereon." . 39 Cyc. 414-5. If the ceatui qve trust elects in such a case to take the amount of his principal with the legal interest thereon, of course the expenses of litigation can not be deducted from the amount he is to receive. </seg>
            <seg id="p407">OPINIONS 407 "If trustee invests in the securities expressly allowed by statute they will, except under very extraordinary circumstances, be protected, no matter how the investment may result. So long as they keep them - selves strictly within the line of duty, and exercise reasonable prudence, care, and diligence, they cannot be made responsible for any loss or de - preciation of the fund intrusted to them; • • * " * 39 Cyc. 416. In such cases it has been held frequently that the trustee is not liable for any loss arising from the depreciation in value of property on which he has loaned part of the trust funds, when such depreciation is caused by a financial panic or depression. In such a case, I am of the opinion that the trustee, whether a natural person or a trust company, is entitled to be credited when it settles with the cestui fue trust with reasonable at - torneys' fees and other costs incurred by him or it in conserving the trust estate. I may add: "Whenever a trustee, charged with the duty of investing money be - longing to and for the benefit of another, invests it in such a way as to make it possible for him to profit by the investment individually, he makes himself personally liable for any loss which may occur by reason of such investment. Therefore a trustee who invests trust money in his own name, without in some way designating it as trust property, will be responsible for any loss that may occur to the fund while so invested or deposited. In such case the good faith or intention of the trustee in making the investment in his own name is in no way involved. The rule applies even to an investment in securities which the court would have sanctioned." 39 Cyc. 409. I find no case in which it has been held that a trustee can recover a judgment against the cestui que trust for money ex - pended in conserving and protecting the trust estate. I presume that a trust company could make a contract under the law gov - erning its organization in this state that would entitle it to recover for expenses reasonably incurred by it in protecting funds left with it for investment, but I think such contracts are unusual to say the least.

Under this exclusion of the statute, we do not believe that the Workmen's Compensation Act covers county or precinct elective or appointive officers appointed for a regular term of office. In view of the decisions of our supreme court in the cases of Ray v. School District, 181 N. W. 140, and Rooney v. City of Omaha. 181 N. W. 143, it is possible that our supreme court would hold that employees engaged in work for the gain or profit of the county in a financial or business way might come within the compensation law. After reading the authorities we have cited you will see that they must clearly come outside the exception mentioned in Section 3038.

You are acting in a quasi judicial capacity when you are engaged in hearing such claims and the general rule is that an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff (claimant) before the final submission of the case.
