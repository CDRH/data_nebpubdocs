            <seg id="p012">12 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6 SUMMARY. 1. It is concluded from a general review of methods that the one best suited for studying the use of water by crops is to grow the plants to that stage of maturity at which they are normally harvested in farm practice, under control conditions in pots sufficiently large to grow a normal plant according to the fertility of the soil. This method, however, is, in general, subject to many sources of error, which must be overcome in order that reliable data of importance may be secured. Many investigations hereto - fore reported have been subject to vital errors. Means for the elimination of such errors are discussed. 2. The object of experiments reported in this bulletin has been to determine principles according to which water is used by crops. In many agricultural districts, water is frequently a seriously limiting factor in crop production. It has been thought that some means might be devised thru a correct understanding of the principles involved, whereby economy in the use of water in farm practice could be increased. In this effort there are two chief points of attack, namely, (1) adjusting the external factors to the needs of the plant, and (2) selecting plants adapted to the conditions. 3. Corn (Zea mays) has been used altogether in a study of the relation of environmental factors to the water requirement. In addition, several sorghums and sunflowers have been compared with corn, and a number of varieties of corn differing in acclimati - zation and plant characters were compared. Single plants were grown in galvanized-iron pots filled with soil. With the exception of an experiment to determine the effect of the amount of soil and one small greenhouse test, all pots were 16 by 36 inches in size. The amount of soil contained varied slightly, according to soil type, and in different years, but their capacity was approximately 250 pounds of moisture - free soil. The rain was excluded and evaporation from the soil surface reduced to an almost negligible amount. The quantity of water taken up from the soil and transpired by the plant was determined by the loss in weight of the entire pot in which the plant grew. Except in experiments to determine the effect of various degrees of relative saturation, an optimum supply of water was maintained practically constant. Except in a few greenhouse tests, all pots were situated in a cornfield with their top level with the sur - rounding land, so that the exposure of the plants was quite normal. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 13 A comparison of plants grown in the potometers and in the field under normal conditions shows that the yield in the potom - eters was entirely normal. 4. The limitation of the amount of soil thru the size of the potometer may be a great source of error in pot experiments. It seriously affects not only the transpiration relationships but the entire development of the plant. 5. The soil in pots fully exposed to the sun acquired a some - what higher temperature than normal field soil, but the water requirement per pound of dry matter was affected only slightly. It appears that comparable data may be secured from exposed pots. 6. Much variation exists in the results obtained from dif - ferent pots receiving similar treatment. Error due to such individuality is greatly reduced by repetition. 7. The "probable error" has not been calculated for the results from these experiments, because it is evident in actual practice that knowing the "probable error" for such a small number of cases has little value. 8. Transpiration is essentially evaporation. The rate of water loss from a corn plant is affected in a rather similar manner by changing climatic conditions as it is from a physical free water surface. 9. The amount of water transpired from a given leaf-area of corn (based on expanse of leaf rather than both surfaces) is approximately one-third as great as the evaporation from a free water surface of the same area. 10. The maximum transpiration as well as the maximum evaporation rates occur between 1 and 3 p. m. Prior to this time the increase is gradual from early morning, and following it the rate gradually recedes until late in the evening. The rate of water loss follows the same general sequence as the diurnal climatic factors. 11. Transpiration is reduced relatively more during the night than is evaporation. This may be explained, perhaps, by the fact that the leaf stomata actually close almost completely at night, and as a result the opportunity for diffusion is reduced. 12. Variation in the water requirement from day to day is very marked. Occasionally this daily variation amounts to 300 or 400 per cent in successive days. The maximum variation ob - served in two successive days has been 600 per cent. On days of extreme temperature in very dry years there may be an atmospheric demand of 10 pounds of water from a single average corn plant during 24 hours. The greater part of this exists for a period of about seven hours in the driest, hottest </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. period of the day. Such days are exceptional, but they are very critical for corn in case there is not sufficient moisture in the soil to supply the demand. In a comparatively short time the corn may receive injuries from which it never fully recovers. Bearing this in mind it is evident that a period of brief duration may affect yields more than the annual amount of rainfall. 13. The amount of water used during each week of growth gradually increases until the plants have developed their max - imum leaf-area. The four or five weeks following this are usually the hottest and driest of the season, and the transpiration rate remains high. Fully one-half of the total water used by the plant is transpired during this period of about five weeks. Following such a period, the transpiration falls off rather rapidly until maturity is reached. The rapid transpiration rate during the tasseling and earing period is coincident with this condition of the plant and not the result thereof. 14. A marked variation exists in the water requirement of different years, due to natural climatic differences. There is a rather consistent relationship in the relative seasonal varia - tions between the (1) transpiration per unit of dry matter, (2) transpiration per unit of leaf -area, and (3) evaporation from a free water surface. There is no such thing as a definite water requirement which is constant for any one kind of crop. 15. As an average for three greenhouse tests conducted during two years, a difference of 22 per cent in relative humidity and 1.7° F. during the day caused a difference of 42 per cent in the water requirement per pound of dry matter, 38 per cent in the transpiration from a unit of leaf-area, and 46 per cent in the evaporation from a free water surface. 16. Corn plants which had been grown for two months in a greenhouse with humid atmosphere exhibited no different tran - spiration rate from a given leaf-area when transferred to a dry greenhouse than took place from plants which had been con - tinuously grown under the dry conditions. The same is true of plants which were transferred from a dry to a humid greenhouse in comparison with plants continually grown in the humid atmosphere. There appears to have been no histological adapta - tion due to previous condition of growth which would affect the rate of transpiration when the plants were subjected to widely different climatic conditions. 17. Transpiration is found to exert a marked reduction in the leaf temperature when the air temperature is high, and as a result exercises a valuable self-protection against water loss. A transpiring leaf was found to be uniformly cooler than a dead, dry one, amounting under the severe climatic conditions </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 15 of a test in 1913 to 8.6° F. in the sun at 2 p. m. when transpiration was maximum and 4.2° F. in the shade at the same time. The transpiring leaf was 4.1° F. cooler in the sun and 3.2° F. cooler in the shade at 2 p. m. than was the air under similar conditions. It cannot, however, be concluded that it is an object of tran - spiration to prevent excessive heating of the leaves, but rather that this cooling is merely a fortunate coincidence. 18. As measured in terms of evaporation from free water surfaces at different elevations in corn, wheat, and oats fields, the vegetation is a great protection against excessive transpira - tion and also against evaporation from the soil surface. 19. A shallow free-water-surface evaporation jar containing only about 1.5 inches of water is very sensitive to climatic changes and responds more quickly than a deeper body of water. 20. A reduction in soil-moisture content below the optimum during three years reduced the water requirement per pound of ear corn 4.3 per cent, and per pound of total dry matter 7.9 per cent. This reduction in water requirement was, however, accom - panied by 37.3 per cent reduced stalk yield, 28.5 per cent reduced yield of ear corn, and 30.7 per cent lower yield of total dry matter. It appears that it would be impracticable to lower the soil - moisture content intentionally below optimum for the sake of so slight a reduction in the water requirement, because yield is reduced relatively so much more. An increase in the soil-moisture content above the optimum during three years, increased the water requirement per pound of ear corn 13.5 per cent, and per pound of total dry matter 8.2 per cent. This increase in water requirement was accompanied by 11.3 per cent reduced stalk yield, 21.1 per cent reduced yield of ear corn, and 16.7 per cent lower yield of total dry matter. The increased water requirement in the production of dry matter is not due to an effort on the part of the plant to get rid of surplus water or to greater ease in obtaining it, but rather to a less thrifty growth due to some detrimental effect from an over - abundance of soil moisture, and consequent reduced available fertility. 21. The water requirement per pound of dry matter is much larger in an infertile soil than in a fertile soil. Increasing the fertility of the soil reduces the water requirement for grain pro - duction and for total dry matter. An application of manure has a much greater effect upon an infertile than upon a fertile soil. Thus, as an average for two years, equal applications of sheep manure to infertile, intermediate, and fertile soils reduced the water requirements for ear corn production 42.6 per cent, 25.4 per cent, and 10.5 per cent, respectively. For total dry matter </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. 16 these water requirements were reduced 28.9 per cent, 17.1 per cent, and 8.1 per cent, respectively. However, the total water requirement per plant was increased by an application of manure to infertile, intermediate, and fertile soil respectively 106.7 per cent, 42.6 per cent, and 28.7 per cent. From these figures it is apparent that increasing the fertility does not reduce but rather greatly increases the total amount of water necessary per plant. This is due to increased plant growth. The reduction in water requirement per pound of dry matter is due, not to some effect of a denser soil solution upon the need for a rapid transpira - tion rate, but rather, simply to a more thrifty and vigorous growth of the plant, resulting from a more favorable supply of food materials. It appears to be more a matter of nutrition than of transpiration. 23. The average water requirement per pound of dry matter of two varieties of corn which had been grown for many years under the humid conditions of New York was approximately the same as the average for two varieties which have been grown continuously under the relatively dry conditions of western Nebraska. 24. The extreme variation in the water requirement of 11 different corns was 230 pounds and 296 pounds per pound of dry matter, which suggests that varieties may differ markedly in their water requirement. Most varieties, however, were rather uniform in this regard. 25. Several corns with alleged special drouth resistance pos - sessed practically the same water requirements per pound of dry matter as the average for all 11 corns tested. 26. The water requirement for milo was the same as the average for 11 corn varieties, while it was considerably higher for Black Amber sorghum. It appears that the drouth-resistant qualities of certain crops must lie elsewhere than in a low water requirement per pound of dry matter. 27. Wild sunflowers possessed a water requirement per pound of dry matter approximately double that of corn, and a total water use somewhat greater than that of three corn plants. 28. A study was made of the intake of soil solutes as measured in terms of ash content in the crop harvested. Data were obtained concerning the relation between transpiration and ash content as affected by (1) atmospheric humidity, (2) seasonal climatic differences, (3) soil fertility, (4) soil moisture, (5) kind of crop and variety, and (6) limitation of the amount of soil thru the size of the potometer.

A natural climatic difference which lowered the free water surface evaporation 40 per cent during July and August in 1913, as compared with 1914, reduced the transpiration per gram of ash content 22 per cent and per gram of dry matter 27 per cent. The greater the availability of the soil solutes in different degrees of soil fertility, other conditions being equal, (1) the greater was the amount of solute taken in per unit of water transpired, (2) the greater was the dry matter produced, (3) the greater was the total amount of water transpired, (4) the greater was the total amount of solute taken into the plant, and (5) the smaller was the amount of water used per unit of dry matter. Less water was transpired per gram of ash content and also per gram of dry matter in a relatively low soil saturation than where an abundance of water was present. The size of the potometer and consequent degree of soil limita - tion exerts a great influence upon the relation of transpiration to the intake of soil solutes. The quantity of transpiration per gram of ash content decreases rather consistently as the size of the potometer and amount of soil increases. In potometers con - taining 32.5, 85, 150, 239, 583, and 956 pounds of soil, the amount of transpiration per gram of ash content was: 6.14, 5.70, 5.20, 5.50, 5.07, and 4.32 kilograms, respectively. Considerable variation exists in the ash and transpiration re - lationships of different corn varieties, but there appears to be no absolute correlation between the percentage of ash, the quantity of water transpired per gram of ash content, or the transpiration per gram of dry matter. There is, however, a strong tendency for varieties having a low water requirement per gram of dry matter, to have also a relatively low transpiration rate per gram of ash content. Milo and Black Amber sorghum transpired a slightly smaller quantity of water per gram of ash content than the average for the corn, while sunflowers transpired relatively much more per gram of ash content. From a review of all of the data it may be concluded that at least within the practical limits of crop production, other things being equal, an increase in the density of the soil solution is accompanied by an increase in the amount of solute taken into the plant per unit of water transpired. Such a relationship is subject to climatic influences. Plants growing in a weak soil solution as exists in a soil of low fertility, under conditions of low evaporation, may take in a larger amount of solutes per unit of water transpired than would be the case in a stronger </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. soil solution under conditions of high evaporation rate. The density of the soil solution as taken into the plant is not neces - sarily the same as the density of the soil solution as it exists within the soil. The transpiration rate may be independent of the density of the soil solution as it exists within the soil or as taken into the plant. The evidence in no way corroborates the theory that the necessity for or the rate of transpiration may be reg - ulated thru the density of soil solution. 29. Considerable variation existed between the different varieties of corn and sorghum in regard to the thickness of the leaf and of the epidermis and also in the number of stomata per unit of leaf-area. There was, however, no apparent striking or consistent correlation between these histological coefficients and the transpiration rate per unit of dry matter or per unit of leaf - area of the different varieties. There was also no striking re - sponse in the relative number of stomata to variation in either soil moisture or soil fertility. 30. As an average for 11 varieties of corn, a plant having 949 square inches of leaf-area had 104,057,850 leaf stomata. The stomatal apertures in the epidermis of both sides of the leaf occupied, when open, 1.52 per cent of the entire area of the leaves. The stomata were found to be practically closed at night and also when the leaves are wilted. The entire epidermis comprised 30.8 per cent of the leaf thickness. 31. Many of the factors influencing the economy of water use by plants, which have been commonly regarded as directly in - fluencing the transpiration rate as such, are rather factors in plant nutrition. Any factors which cause malnutrition result in a relatively high water requirement in the production of dry matter, because of the continued use of water without a normal increase in dry matter. Transpiration appears to be a purely physical phenomenon, depending primarily upon the moisture supply in the leaf and the evaporating power of the atmosphere, which is modified in some degree by temperature effects resultant within the leaf from chemical activity, transpiration, and from the absorption of radiant energy. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">TRANSPIRATION AS A FACTOR IN CROP PRODUCTION. BY T. A. KIESSELBACH. PART I. GENERAL SURVEY. Such large quantities of water are used in the growth of agri - cultural crops that the water supply is frequently a limiting factor in production. The importance of proper water relationships has long been recognized, and the subject of transpiration is deserving of thoro investigation. Water taken in by the roots of plants during growth either enters chemically into the products of photosynthesis or escapes from the above-ground parts of the plant (mainly the leaves) as the result of internal and external forces tending to establish an equilibrium. The relative amount entering into chemical com - bination is negligible. The forms in which water escapes from the leaves may be classified as (1) water in liquid form and (2) water vapor. The former is negligible in amount and results occasionally from in - ternal pressure caused by high turgesence, which forces drops of water thru minute water pores in the epidermis. The second source of water loss, namely, evaporation, practically equals the amount taken into the plant, and is caused by the evaporating power of the atmosphere adjacent to the leaf. A small amount is evapor - ated directly thru the nearly impervious walls of the epidermal cells. 1 The remainder is evaporated into the air spaces within the leaf from adjoining cells, and is removed thru the stomata in Acknowledgment for efficient assistance during the course of these ex - periments is made to Messrs. J. A. Ratcliff, C. A. Helm, F. D. Keim, R. E. Holland, Ernest Anderson, Bert Danley, E. R. Ewing, and Miss Bessie Noyes. References to previous publications from this Station on the subject of transpiration are as follows: Montgomery (1910), Kiesselbach (1910), Kiesselbach and Montgomery (1911), and Montgomery and Kiesselbach (1912). 1 Barnes (1910, p. 327) states that, "Of the total water lost, scarcely more than 20 per cent and as little as 3 per cent escapes thru the epidermis. ' Barnes does not state how this estimate was obtained. His estimate probably covers the extreme range of plants. With our cultivated crops this cuticular transpiration probably does not greatly exceed the lower limit. </seg>

For practical purposes these two sources of water loss by evaporation (cuticular and stomatal) from the plant may be placed in one group, and for the sake of brevity and distinctive - ness will be included in this bulletin under the old term "transpira - tion," altho there has been some contention in recent years that it should be called merely "evaporation from the plant." CHARACTER OF PAST WORK Woodward (1699) ' was apparently the first to measure this water loss. Stephen Hales conducted transpiration experiments as early as 1736, having in view a possible application to agri - culture. Since then many experiments have been made both for purely scientific and for applied purposes. 2 Burgerstein had recorded 394 publications on transpiration in 1904, and the 1 The year in parentheses following an author's name in the text serves to associate the reference with a particular publication in the bibliography (pp. 209), where the complete title is given. 1 A number of investigators have reviewed more or less critically earlier work on the subject of transpiration. (1) Abbe (1905) reviewed a number of experiments and speculated con - cerning their practical application. (2) Burgerstein (1887, 1889, 1901, and 1904) assembled and discussed briefly all available publications concerning transpiration. In 1887, he reviewed chronologically 236 publications. In 1887 the general subject of transpiration was divided into subtopics, under which the work of investigators to date was discussed somewhat critically. Eight additional investigators were listed. In 1901, 109 additional publications were listed chronologically, and discussed according to general subtopics. The monograph published in 1904 contains a list of practically all transpiration studies prior to that date. Methods of investigation are reviewed in a critical attitude. (3) Briggs and Shantz (1913b). This publication reviews in a critical manner practically all the experiments in which rooted potted plants were grown beyond the seedling stage, relative to the use of water by plants in the production of dry matter. Experiments with seedlings were not considered because of the unreliability of the method. Both a summary of the results and a fairly complete statement of the methods used are given with each review. (4) Montgomery (1912). Various methods of studying the water require - ments of plants are outlined, and attention is called to the need for more uni - form and accurate methods, so that the work of different investigators may be comparable.

This publication reviews experiments dealing with the relation of transpiration to certain atmospheric conditions, including light, humidity, temperature, wind, and the effect of jarring.

This, however, does not nec - essarily mean that the problems have been solved. On the con - trary, that stage in the work has now been reached when we can look upon the past largely as preliminary, preparing the way for more significant experiments. This is not to be considered in the light of discredit to the earlier workers. Methods of obser - vation have simply undergone a natural evolution. The results of many experiments have been rendered questionable by a full appreciation of the sources of error entering into them. The factors influencing transpiration determinations may be grouped into two great classes: (1) Factors influencing transpira - tion determinations as sources of experimental error, and (2) factors influencing transpiration in fact. The significance of the results of the numerous investigations which have been pub - lished depends upon the reliability of the methods by which they were obtained.

            <seg id="p022">22 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. A number of very ingenious and in some cases intricate modifi - cations and combinations of the methods outlined have been devised. However, the principles involved are the vital part, and for these the outline is inclusive. BASIS OF COMPARISON (1) Comparing transpiration rates solely by total water loss per plant is of significance only in special cases. During short periods in which the leaf-area and thrift of the plant are practically constant, the effect of variations in environmental factors on the total water requirement for a unit of time may be noted. To know the total amount of water used in the normal growth of a plant is also of value in calculating the approximate amount of water required for a unit of field area of a similar crop, provided growth conditions are comparable. The relative total transpira - tion cannot be regarded as an index of relative growth. (2) Certain interrelationships between the plant and its atmospheric environment may be studied by basing the relative transpiration rates upon a unit of leaf-area. The effect of dif - ference in leaf structure and condition of leaf may also be observed by the water loss from a unit of leaf-area. (3) From an economic standpoint the most important basis for comparison is the amount of water transpired in the production of a unit of dry matter. To obtain these data it is requisite that the total yield of crop and the total water consumption be secured, which data furnish a basis for making all important deductions in which the yield of dry matter is concerned. The total water transpired, the amount of water used per unit of dry matter, and the amount per unit of leaf-area bear no neces - sary relation to one another. The relative effect of soil differences has very frequently been measured solely in terms of total loss per plant or loss per unit of leaf-area during only a fraction of the lifetime of the plant. Since no necessary relation exists be - tween these characters and the addition of dry matter in the plant, the data are inapplicable and are of little importance. METHODS OF DETERMINING TRANSPIRATION. THE COBALT METHOD The methods which have been employed may be grouped first according to whether they are largely demonstrative, or whether quantitative measurements of water loss may be made. The cobalt test is a case of the former, in which a blue sheet of cobalt paper held in close contact with the transpiring surface loses its </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 23 color from the effect of moisture. Paper infiltrated with certain other chemicals than cobalt chloride may also be used. Since the rate of change in color depends upon the rate of water applica - tion to the paper, it is possible to make a somewhat relative com - parison of the rate of water loss from two leaves, but it is impos - sible to make an accurate quantitative measurement. Livingston ( 1912, pp. 121-123) describes a standardized cobalt test and suggests that it "should be of value in many problems of physiological ecology and of agriculture. The study, for example, of the relative drouth-resisting powers of different varieties, an important one in agriculture, should be much facilitated by these means." In a later paper (1913), "The Resistance Offered by Leaves to Transpirational Water Loss, " Livingston 1 gives tables and charts comparing hourly records from the standardized cobalt test with evaporation from white and brown atmometers, and with actual "relative" transpiration from plants. It is evident that the hygro - metric paper gives only approximate comparisons and cannot be considered quantitatively reliable. The method is wrong in principle for determining the plant response to normal climatic conditions. That portion of a leaf covered by an opaque paper held in close contact with it by means of a glass plate fastened with clamps for 10 minutes or longer certainly is not exposed normally to the surrounding atmosphere. The same may be said of the water bottle with which it is compared. It would be impossible to prevent the relative temperatures and other conditions of the leaf and water bottle from fluctuating during the reading, which destroys the possibility of standardization. FIELD ESTIMATES. Field estimates 2 of the amount of water used by plants are based upon initial and final soil-moisture samplings together with rainfall records during the period between moisture determi - nations. Since no accurate estimate can be made of the run-off or evaporation of moisture from the soil, results secured cannot be regarded as indicating the amount of transpiration. COLLECTION OF TRANSPIRED WATER. 3 The method of collecting and weighing the transpired water has been used rather extensively. Some closed vessel containing 1 Other investigators who have used a cobalt or similar test are Stahl 1894, pp. 117-145J and Merget (1878, p. 293). ' This method has been used by the following investigators, some of whom realized its limitations: Briggs and Shantz (1913), Leather (1911), Powers (1914), Widtsoe (1912), and Willard and Humbert (1913). ' This method has been used in recent years by Shreve (1914), Roberts and Freeman (1908), and Cannon (1905). </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. an absorbent salt is used, and a leaf or twig of a growing plant is inserted into it. A number of intricate and ingenious modifica - tions have been devised. The increased weight of the salt indicates the amount of transpiration from a given area. This method would appear to be fundamentally wrong in that the leaves in - closed are not subjected to the same climatic influences as the main portion of the plant tested and consequently will not be representative of the transpiration taking place from the plant. A slight difference in the climatic factors may have a marked effect upon the transpiration rate. If the method were reliable, it would be of value in measuring transpiration from plants rooted in their natural habitat, and which cannot be transferred to pots for weighing. THE POTOMETER METHOD. The potometer method consists in the use of a vessel filled with water, nutrient solution, sand culture, or soil, by which the amount of transpiration is determined from contained cuttings or rooted plants, either by loss in weight or by measuring the intake of water. MEASURING THE INTAKE OF WATER Early investigators determined the transpiration extensively by measuring the amount removed from the containing vessel. The base of a cutting or seedling would be inserted in a sealed bottle filled with water or nutrient solution, and having a graduated capillary tube by means of which the loss could be read in cubic millimeters. The method also had strong opponents who declared that the intake of water could not be a measure of the outgo from the plant. They were justified in that the water content of the plant varies at times according to turgescence, and more water may be taken in than is transpired, or somewhat more may be transpired than is taken in. Such a discrepancy is, however, only serious when the total losses are very small and for only very short intervals — as was customary with this method. Error due to variations in the amount of water contained by the plant caused by differences in turgidity would, in general, be negligible in its effect upon the total amount of water transpired in growing to maturity. LOSS IN WEIGHT Determining transpiration by loss in weight of the potometer with its contained plant is correct in principle, and, when healthy rooted plants are used, most nearly approaches natural con - ditions. If the necessary precautions are taken, it registers quite accurately the amount of transpiration under the conditions of the test. When the experiment extends over any great length of </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 25 time, it is necessary to measure the water applied during growth as well as the difference in initial and final moisture content of the soil. A number of self-recording arrangements have been devised for securing a continuous record of water loss. These are, however, not essential. CHARACTER OF PLANT. Quantitative measurements with potometers may be divided into two general groups, according to whether plant cuttings or rooted plants are used. Rooted plants are much to be preferred and in fact are indispensable for a serious study of transpiration. We cannot rely upon conclusions drawn from other than normally functioning plants, unless the object is to study the abnormal condition as such. Plant Cuttings. — The great source of error with the use of cuttings is that the entrance of solutions does not take place in a normal manner. The tests must also be of short duration and under protected conditions, so that the rate of water loss is suffi - ciently suppressed for the stem to take in the moisture as quickly as it is lost from the leaves. Especially in experiments correlating transpiration and the production of dry matter, it is essential to use rooted plants functioning in their normal manner under the environmental conditions of the test. Rooted Plants. 1 — Investigations with rooted plants may be grouped according to the stage of maturity upon which results are based. They fall naturally into three main classes, viz: Seedlings, mature plants, and intermediate developments. Briggs and Shantz (1913 b) pointed out the chief source of error from the use of seedlings when transpiration is correlated with dry matter, and they have eliminated such experiments from serious con - sideration. We are in hearty accord with them and believe that important conclusions relative to dry weight cannot be drawn from seedlings. Sufficient growth must be made to overcome the effects of mere translocation of substance from the seed. This stage may be reached long before the plants are mature, but with few exceptions, in the case of certain agricultural crops, the water requirement should doubtless be determined up to that stage at which they are commonly harvested in farm practice. It has been observed that the relative effect of two treatments on the early growth of plants is sometimes very different in degree from the final comparative growth at maturity. It is entirely possible to establish certain interrelationships 1 A list of investigators who determined transpiration from plants grown beyond the seedling stage by loss in weight of the potometers is given on page 36. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. between transpiration and atmospheric conditions by the use of small plants, even in the seedling stage. However, these are limited because of the rapid change in the size of the plants and must, with a few exceptions, be regarded more as demonstrative than as quantitative measurements. SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION ON METHOD PRINCIPLES. In summarizing the discussion of the principles involved in the various methods which have been used for quantitative transpira - tion determinations, it is concluded that the use of potometers with rooted plants alone can be relied upon to furnish significant results. Plants grown beyond the seedling stage are indispensable when the relative transpiration is based upon the production of dry matter. This basis of comparison is of chief interest from an applied agricultural standpoint. However, certain principles of response to variable conditions can be satisfactorily determined by the loss per unit of leaf-area and the total loss per plant during a given length of time. DETERMINING THE TRANSPIRATION OF FIELD CROPS. To determine the relation of transpiration to production it is necessary to secure the ratio of water loss to total dry matter produced, and in the case of grain crops also to the yield of grain. To attempt any quantitative application to field conditions it is desirable also to know the total water transpired per plant, the total yield of dry matter per plant, and the normality of growth. In comparisons of different kinds of crops these must also be grown under conditions comparable to the field conditions of the particular crop tested. To determine merely the relative effects of two differing factors, such as soil moisture, soil fertility, or relative atmospheric humid - ity, it is not so essential to have the plants exposed to normal field climatic conditions. It is very desirable, however, to have as complete a record as possible of all environmental factors which may influence the transpiration rate. SOURCES OF ERROR IN POTOMETER TESTS. The potometer method in which growing rooted plants are grown beyond the seedling stage is correct in principle for study - ing the water requirements of crops. This method is itself, how - ever, subject to sources of error, many of which must be eliminated in most part in order to secure significant and applicable results. Since we must rely upon this method for securing transpiration </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 27 data as related to the yield of agricultural crops, and since nearly all such data of importance have been secured by this method in the past, it becomes desirable to consider the special sources of error entering into it. Such a knowledge is necessary to evaluate correctly the results of an investigation. The following outline is suggestive of these sources of error.

The personal element in drawing conclusions. DISCUSSION OF SOURCES OF ERROR IN POTOMETER TESTS. CHARACTER OF POTOMETER AND CONTENTS. One of the most common sources of error in determining the amount of water transpired in crop production is the uninten - tional undernourishment of the plants, either thru the use of too small a potometer or thru growing too many plants in a potometer. Hellrieg?l (1883), Leather (1911), and Briggs and Shantz (1913? and 1914) conclude that the amount of water transpired per unit of dry matter produced is increased by a deficiency in the supply of food materials, which may become a source of experimental error. The same conclusion may be drawn from experiments reported in this bulletin. Below a certain range of optimum </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. fertility, the plant makes a poorer growth, and the water require - ment ratio is increased as the condition is extended in the adverse direction. This is especially true in relation to grain production. Consequently, the amount of soil available for each plant should be sufficient to enable it to make a normal growth typical of field development. If the object is to determine the need for fertilizer applications to a particular soil, care must be exercised that the amount of soil rather than its degree of fertility is not the limiting factor. It appears that any soil, no matter how fertile, will respond favorably to fertilizer application if overcropped. In determining the water requirement ratios of different crops it is important that the relative number of plants of each crop grown in a potometer should bear approximately the same pro - portion to one another as are grown under field conditions. Thus, in eastern Nebraska we grow in the field 100 wheat plants upon an area of land equal to that occupied by one corn plant. Conse - quently in comparing wheat and corn in pots we should grow 100 plants of wheat in a potometer of the same size as we use to grow one corn plant. Investigations have shown that plants adjust themselves to a certain extent, and the stand may vary somewhat without materially affecting results. By such an adjustment of the relative number of plants per pot, the amount of soil, if it becomes a limiting factor in the growth of one crop, does so proportionately with the others as well. In - vestigators generally have failed to provide against both over - cropping the soil and lack of reasonable uniformity in the degree of cropping, in comparing different crops. Thus, Leather (1910, 1911) grew three to four plants each of 14 different kinds of crops, including wheat, barley, oats, linseed, sarson, peas, gram, maize, juar, rice, murwa, kodo, rahar, and guar in quantities of soil ranging from 14 to 50 kilograms. Pots of uniform size were used in each experiment, except where the object of the test was to compare the effect of potometers of different size. In Leather's experiments a corn plant was given from 3.5 to 12 kilograms of soil according to the size of potometer, while wheat, oats, and the other plants were given the same amount. His plants were grown to maturity. It is very evident from the yields and the photo - graphs that the quantity of soil was altogether too small for corn and several other crops, while it was much more nearly optimum for small grains. Leather also investigated the fertilizer requirements of the soil in these small pots and their effect upon the water requirements per pound of dry matter. With such a relatively limited quantity of soil, neither a satisfactory crop test nor fertilizer test could be made. Briggs and Shantz have tested 20 kinds of crops, consisting </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 29 of more than 100 varieties at Akron, Colorado, and also a number of varieties in other localities. Regarding the number of plants in a potometer, these investigators state (1913, p. 10) that 20 small-grain, 8 sorghum, 6 corn, and 6 sugar beet plants were grown. The potometers all contained 115 kilograms of soil. This provides approximately the same amount of soil for three small-grain plants as for one corn plant. Under eastern Colorado farm conditions approximately 50 seeds of wheat are planted on an area of land equal to that occupied by one corn plant. Speaking in a general way, it may be concluded that Briggs and Shantz grew six corn plants in a potometer where they should have grown one, and in proportion to corn they grew 20 wheat plants when they should have grown 300. Altho Briggs and Shantz were of the opinion that cans of the size used by them were of adequate size to allow normal develop - ment of the plants, it appears from their illustrations and tables that at least the corn and grain sorghums were very much underdeveloped, the corn more so than the sorghums, however. The total yield per potometer of dry matter from the six corn plants is about equal to what the yield from one plant of the larger varieties should have been. Briggs and Shantz (1913a, p. 18; 1914, p. 5) concluded from tests with Kubanka wheat in 1911 and 1912 that the soil used by them bore sufficient fertility for normal development. The fertilizer application increased the actual yield of dry matter 9 per cent in 1911 and reduced it 3 per cent in 1912. In 1911 the water requirement of the unfertilized set was 6 per cent above the fertilized set, and in 1912 it was 4 per cent below that of the fertilized set. While these tests show little need for fertilizer on the part of the wheat, they do not indicate what would have been the result on corn planted at a relatively much thicker rate. The effect of overcropping upon the water requirement per unit of dry matter is much less marked than the effect upon the amount of dry matter itself. (See Table 4 of this bulletin.) This general problem of adjusting the number of plants to be grown in a unit mass of soil needs further investigation. LIMITATION OF SOIL FERTILITY. In certain lines of investigation the degree of soil fertility may become an important source of error. The principle is again involved that the ratio of water loss to dry matter is increased as the soil fertility is decreased below a normal range. In an experiment to determine the relative water requirements as related to the difference in climate of two distinct regions of the country, it is essential to use soils of equal productivity in both regions. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. Otherwise, the difference in water requirements may be partly due to the difference in soil fertility. Thus, Briggs and Shantz (1913, Bui. 285, p. 61) compare the water requirements of both wheat and sorghum in Colorado and Texas during 1910 and 1911. Native soil was used in the tests, which may account for part of the difference assigned to climate. Briggs and Shantz recognize this factor in 1913 (Bui. 284, p. 15). King (1905) compared the water requirements of corn in four States, using native soil in each case. No data are given by which we can estimate what portion of the difference in the several States is due to difference in soil fertility. Such comparisons give the combined effect of difference in soil and climate. The need for similar precautions regarding uniformity of soil fertility applies to determining the variation in water require - ment from year to year as well. Variation in soil fertility may influence the water requirement fully as much as climate. IMPROPER DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL MOISTURE. In experiments to determine the effect of variation in soil - moisture content, some investigators have added all the water either from above or from below. In those potometers having a low relative soil saturation, water added to a single portion may not become distributed thruout the soil mass, which will unin - tentionally affect the degree of saturation in the different parts. EVAPORATION FROM SURFACE OF SOIL Of the forty-odd experimenters who have studied the water requirements for the production of dry matter with plants beyond the seedling stage, only eight have taken the necessary precaution to reduce the evaporation from the soil surface to a negligible quantity. Many have attempted to correct such loss by sub - tracting the water loss of similar uncropped pots from the com - bined evaporation and transpiration of cropped pots. The rate of surface evaporation is, however, affected by so many factors that not much faith can be placed in the accuracy of the method. The evaporation rate varies with the relative soil saturation, the soil texture, and the shading, which are certain to be variable factors between cropped and uncropped pots as well as between pots intended to be similar. In some experiments conducted in this manner, the amount of water transpired by the crop is so much larger than the amount evaporated from the soil that the experiment may indicate the character of the effect altho not in definite degree. We cannot assume that such experiments furnish dependable quantitative measurements. Some investigators have made the error of assuming that the </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Transpiration as" a Factor in Crop Production. 31 transpiration from the crop plus the evaporation from the soil surface in a pot represented a similar combined loss under field conditions and have called it transpiration plus evaporation. The amount of evaporation varies naturally in addition to the before-mentioned factors, with the amount of surface exposed, which has seldom been comparable with the area occupied by a similar amount of crop under field conditions. ENTRANCE OF RAINFALL. Most investigators of water requirements of crops have avoided the entrance of rain into the potometers. Part of the experiments have been conducted in greenhouses; part have been arranged to be moved under shelter in time of rain; while still others, which were fully exposed in the open, have been corrected for rain by keeping a record of the rainfall and adding the weight of the known depth and area of water to the amount lost in growing the crop. Very few have sealed the potometers so as to exclude the rain and yet permit continual standing in the open. The greatest error from rain would result from sealing the entire surface except a small opening for the plant and assuming that this would keep out the rain. Our tests have shown that the plant acts as a funnel, and for each inch of rainfall 65 pounds of water were caught by the leaves and conducted down the out - side of a full-grown, well-developed cornstalk into the potometer. This would make an error of 65 pounds per corn plant, if 10 inches of rain should fall after it had made much growth. EXPOSURE OF POTOMETER TO ATMOSPHERE. In most transpiration experiments the potometer has been left exposed to the atmosphere, which results in soil temperatures somewhat different from normal field soil. The effect of such difference in soil temperature due to exposure is slight, at least within reasonable limits as indicated in Table 9 of this bulletin, and data obtained from the use of exposed potometers should be comparable and not far from normal. UNINTENTIONAL LACK OF UNIFORMITY IN THE SOIL. An unintentional lack of uniformity in the soil is not likely to arise frequently. It is perhaps best illustrated by Widtsoe's (1909, p. 5) fertilizer experiment in 1908 with four different types of soil. Pots filled with soil were used which had been left un - disturbed since 1905, previous to which time the same soil contents had been subjected to varied treatments. Widtsoe assumed that the effects of different treatments in earlier years had been oblit - erated by the lapse of time, but such an assumption is not war - ranted. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. A deterioration of soil-growing conditions may occur from confinement for a period of years in pots, as described in this bulletin, pages 157 to 159. ENVIRONMENT. Experiments have shown that the intensity of the various climatic factors bears a close relation to the water requirement. Consequently, results obtained under abnormal exposure should not be construed to give correct measurements for field conditions. To illustrate, Briggs and Shantz (1914) found that 10 per cent more water is usedby Kubanka wheat fully exposed in an isolated place than is used by wheat sunk in a pit level with the ground in a wheat field. Again, the fully-exposed wheat transpired relatively 20 per cent more than wheat in a screened inclosure. Since the majority of the crop tests made by Briggs and Shantz (1914, p. 3) were made in this screened inclosure, they state that the "in - closure measurements, at least in the case of wheat, are less than 10 per cent below the water requirement of plants exposed under field conditions." In this way we are given a basis for correction in reducing to field requirements. The authors state (1913 a. p. 13) that "the determination of the relative water requirement of the different crop plants is, however, the main problem from an economic standpoint. " It would be of great interest to know just how much the various crops differ under field conditions in their self -protection against evaporation influences. It seems probable that the leaves in a pumpkin field are differently exposed to the action of the wind and other climatic influences than are the plants in a corn or sorghum field. Again, it appears that the dense vegetation in an alfalfa meadow would provide greater self-protection against transpiration than the more open vegeta - tion of a cornfield. This factor of difference in self-protection against evaporation is overlooked when crops are brought to - gether out of their normal field conditions and are tested under one uniform abnormal exposure. It seems that we must con - sider the results in regard to the relative water requirements of different kinds of crops obtained in this uniformly exposed manner as doubtful until the relative degree of self-protection has been determined for each or a similar type of crop. THE PLANT. Plant individuality may be an important source of error in pot tests. The most practical way of overcoming this is by replication, which is quite effective as shown in Tables 13 to 21 of this bulletin. The plants may be replicated either within a pot or in different pots. In the former case, care must be taken </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 33 not to introduce the additional error of overcropping and acci - dental or unintentional lack of uniformity in cropping. Among the investigators who have made extensive tests, Briggs and Shantz have uniformly replicated their potometers in a given year more than other investigators, usually averaging together six similarly treated pots. The Nebraska potometers have all been replicated from four to eight times barring an occasional injured plant, with four as the standard number. Occasionally, potometers contain broken or diseased plants and should' be discarded in compiling averages. STAGE OF MATURITY. This factor has been discussed as a source of error in connec - tion with methods on page 25 of this bulletin. It was concluded that results with seedling plants are not dependable. The total water requirement up to the normal time for harvesting as a crop is of greatest practical interest. This requires mature plants with grain crops. In potometers too small to grow the crop normally to maturity, it should be harvested at a stage before the amount of soil has become an abnormal limiting factor. Conclusive experiments have not been made to show the relative water requirement at different stages of maturity. Fest (1908), Von Seelhorst (1908, 1910), and Thorn (1913) have in - vestigated the effect on water requirement of harvesting at different stages, but have not discriminated as to what part of the difference in water requirement is due to climatic differences and what part to the stage of development. ERRORS DUE TO METHODS OF COMPUTATION. A rather common error in compiling data which results in incomparable summaries and wrong conclusions is the placing in an average column the averages for different crops or treatments which do not cover the same period of years. As an illustration, the following table has been compiled from King's reports. </seg>

The data in columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 are given in this same form by King (1895) to show the relative water requirements of crops in Wisconsin. The other columns have been compiled to show how subject to error such a summary may be. King compares without qualification the water requirements of dent corn and barley tested during two years, 1891 and 1892, with red clover 1 and field peas tested one year, 1892; with flint corn tested in 1893; with oats tested in 1891, 1892, and 1894; and with potatoes tested in 1894. Such a summary is meaningless. Briggs and Shantz (1914) have largely overcome this error in their comparison of the water requirements of crops tested during three years at Akron, Colorado, by arbitrarily increasing the ratios for 1912 30 per cent. Certain crops had been tested all three years, while certain others only two or one year. The crops grown continuously showed practically the same water requirements in 1911 and 1913, while the water requirement was approximately 30 per cent lower in 1912. 1 King apparently tested clover for two years, but Ihe wr ter can find the records for only one year, 1892.

            <seg id="p035">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 35 Widtsoe (1909) has been inconsistent in making a similar error of averages in tests where the effects of different soilsand treatments have been averaged for four years. Data secured during one, two, three, or four years are given equal rating in comparing one with the other, and this error occurs in his Tables 6, 7, 8, 15, 20, 21, 27, 28, and 30, while it is partially or wholly recognized and over - come in Tables 5 and 24. An error of averages may be made in averaging the water requirements in the production of grain and of total dry matter. Some potometers may fail to produce grain. For the purpose of comparing the relative water requirements for grain and for total dry matter in a certain crop, it is important that the same po - tometers be averaged in both cases. If certain potometers fail to produce grain, this should be charged against the average. If only four or five potometers out of six duplicates produce grain, the total of these four or five should be divided by the full number of potometers, or six. Briggs and Shantz (1914, Tables 6, 7, 13, 14, and 24) may be cited as examples of this error. An illustration of the point in question may be found on page 60, Table 4, column 3 of this bulletin. Three out of four duplicate small potometers failed to produce an ear. This lack of ear develop - ment due to shortage of available nutrients must be charged against the small potometers, and the weight of the one small ear produced must be divided by four to secure the average performance. In the table which follows is given a list of the investigators to date who have based the transpiration requirement upon crop yield and used plants grown in potometers beyond the seedling stage. Data concerning a number of factors are also tabulated to show the lack of uniformity, and also the opportunity for error from a number of sources. A few of the investigators did not conform entirely in all of their investigations to methods credited to them in the outline. The publications of some also fail to givo full information concerning part of the factors. </seg>

FACTORS INFLUENCING TRANSPIRATION IN FACT. 1 The phenomenon of transpiration or evaporation from plants is subject to many influences. Some of these are very profound in their effect, while others are comparatively insignificant. In the following outline is given a rather inclusive list of these factors. They are either environmental in nature or inherent plant charac - ters. Space will not be taken in this bulletin to discuss each of these. However, the experimental data with discussions which follow concern most of these influences that are important. These footnotes refer to the table on the preceding page. 1 This list of investigators is complete so far as the writer has been able to determine, and there are probably not many omissions. 1 Briggs and Shantz tested over 100 different crops and varieties, these in the table being merely representative, and planted respectively at the rates indicated. The crops were harvested immature in several tests. 1 Daszewski gives a table in which Wilm's (1899) data with potatoes are reduced to dry weight. He also gives the composition of the crop. 4 Deherain. The difference between seepage water and rainfall was regarded as the amount used by the crop. 1 Heinrich grew his plants in nutrient solution without soil or sand. * King partly excluded the rain in 1894. He also tested barley, oats, and peas. 7 Khankhoje harvested some plants at an earlier stage to compare with mature plants. ■ Leather tested wheat, barley, oats, linseed, sarson, peas, gram, maize, uar, rice, murwa, kodo, rahar, and guar. * Liebscher mentions damage from an overabundance of rain, so his pots probably stood in the open. 10 Marie-Davy. In 1876, part of the pots were exposed to rain and part were not. Apparently correction was made for the rainfall. In 1874 and 1875 only the yield of grain is given, while in 1876 the weights of stems were 692 - 1,065 grams, and the grain weights were 262-474 grams. Only the large potometers were used in 1875 and 1876. " Pfeiffer, et al., used an unsatisfactory method for correcting evaporation. 11 Schroeder. Evaporation was not very satisfactorily prevented in 1893. "Seelhorst apparently grew his plants outdoors and moved them into a shelter at time of rain, altho this is not definitely stated. " Sorauer tested a number of additional species, but the methods are so faulty as not to be applicable. Most of Sorauer's tests must be included with the seedling stage. 11 Widtsoe. His illustrations indicate that the soil was much overcropped with corn. " Wilms based the transpiration on green weight of tubers, but this was reduced to dry weight by Daszewski in 1900. " Wollny tested nine varieties in all, including corn, barley, oats, millet, buckwheat, peas, rape, mustard, and sunflowers. The evaporation was almost prevented by means of a cover, but bare pots were used for correction. Wollny states that the rain was excluded by means of covers which had only a small hole in the center for the plant. Without sealing the opening about the plant, it is possible by this method that rain is conducted down the outside of the plant into the pot. 1 Contrasted with " Factors influencing transpiration determinations with rooted plants in pots as sources of experimental error," — p. 27. </seg>

            <seg id="p041">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 41 PART II. THE EXPERIMENTS. The investigations which follow have been conducted at the Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr. Most of the data have been secured during the last three years (1912-1914) and have not been published before. In some instances earlier work at this Station has been continued along similar lines or extended, in which case the related data have been reproduced here, and reference given to the earlier pub - lications. PROBLEMS UNDER INVESTIGATION. The general project has been to study the relation of environ - mental factors and plant characters to the water requirements of crops. Under environment, climatic factors, soil fertility, and soil moisture have been investigated. Evaporation from a free water surface, as a summary expression of the various climatic factors, has been studied at different elevations in corn and small-grain fields. Concerning plant characters a number of measurements have been made of all plants tested, in order to observe any possible correlation. During one year (1914) the relative water requirements were determined of corn secured from humid and semiarid districts, of corn varieties differing in growth habits, and of a number of sorghum varieties and sun - flowers in comparison with corn. Histological studies were made to determine whether there may be any structural correlations. Ash determinations were made for studying the relation between transpiration and the intake of soil solutes. Thus, it is seen that all the investigations, with the exception of 1914, have been made with corn. It is believed that in this way general principles concerning transpiration may be established which will apply not only to corn, but to many other crops as well. In connection with the general project, possible sources of ex - perimental error have been investigated. METHODS OF COMPILING DATA. The data contained in the following general tables consist of two distinct kinds, namely, ( 1 ) exact quantitative measurements and (2) ratios between these exact measurements. To illustrate by referring to Table 4, columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 13 are exact measurements, while columns 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are ratios. It is important to understand the manner of compiling the average data for the duplicate potometers. Those columns in the tables which contain exact quantitative measurements are averaged by adding the column and dividing by the number of duplicates. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. 42 In the case of the ratio columns, the average results are obtained by finding the ratio of the averages for the other columns, rather than by averaging the ratio columns. In case of the ratios in the average summaries we have, then, the ratio of averages rather than an average of ratios. In most cases the differences obtained by the two methods of calculating are rather slight and immaterial. Both methods appear to be mathematically correct, but the one employed in this bulletin appears to be more desirable. From the performance standpoint, it is important to know what are the production and the amount of water transpired in the aggregate, and then to establish a ratio between these average results. Table 4, column 8, illustrates an instance where the method of calculating is rather vital. In a test to determine the effect of the size of the potometer as a source of experimental error, the smallest size limited the plant growth to such an extent that ear production was almost impossible, and only one plant out of four succeeded in producing a small ear. Consequently, for practical purposes, the amount of water tran - spired by the four plants must be charged up against the one small ear. This can only be done by determining the ratio of averages. In all cases where the data of two or more years have been averaged together in a summary table, the average of ratios was determined rather than the ratio of averages, as was done in the case of averaging different individuals within a single year. This was done in order to avoid overemphasizing in the average ratio the seasonal effects of a given year. For these reasons the sum - maries in this bulletin may not appear to be quite mathematically correct, but they are in fact merely subject to the well-known effects of averages. The probable error has not been computed for any of the data in this bulletin, altho the potometers have been replicated from four to eight times. A calculation of the probable error where the frequency is so small would appear to be of little value to establish the reliability of the results. Where small numbers are averaged, it is entirely probable that the actual error in certain groups of duplicates will be consistently and abnormally high above the correct mean, while in others it will be below the correct mean. The actual error may be large in these cases due to averaging either high or low extremes, while the computed probable error may be very small, due to consistency of the individuals averaged. Again, both high and low extremes may fall within a group to be averaged, so that the average result will be correct, altho the computed probable error is high. Illustrations of such grouping may be seen in Table 12. All measurement determinations made in these experiments are expressed in the "regular" system, namely inches. Thus, </seg>
            <seg id="p043">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 43 leaf-areas and free water surfaces are indicated in square inches. This probably has an advantage in being more readily interpreted. All weights of crop and of water used are expressed in the "metric" system, because the smaller units of weight possess an advantage in these calculations. The scientific ideal no doubt would be to express all weights and measures uniformly in either the "metric" or "regular" system. METHODS OF DETERMINING THE YIELD AND LEAF-AREA. The crop was in all cases reduced to a moisture-free basis by drying to a constant weight in an electric oven at 110° C. The oven used was a specially constructed Freas oven, having a drying chamber 36 by 24 by 48 inches. The plants were pulled from the ground and the roots cut away from the base of the stalk. The dry matter harvested included the entire plant except the roots. It would be of interest to know the weight of the roots as well, but it seemed impossible to make a reliable separation of the roots of the crop from roots and other organic matter previously in the soil. The leaves were gathered from the plants as they ripened. The leaf-area of the corn plants was determined when full grown, as in earlier experiments, by taking three-fourths of the product of the length by the maximum width of the individual leaves and adding together these products for the total leaf-area. This method is discussed by Montgomery (1911, p. 113). A distinction should be observed between "leaf-area" and "leaf -surf ace" as used in this bulletin. The latter is twice the area of the former, in that each leaf has two surfaces. METHODS OF INVESTIGATION. LOCATION OF EXPERIMENTS AND MATURITY OF PLANTS. All transpiration measurements were made with rooted plants grown from the outset in pqtometers filled with soil. They may be grouped according to their location, as experiments conducted either in the cornfield or in the greenhouse. The greenhouse was used for only a comparatively small portion of the determinations, namely, the measurement of the effect of differences in relative atmospheric humidity upon transpiration. All plants were grown to maturity except those in the greenhouse, which were harvested at the silking stage. DESCRIPTION OF POTOMET RS USED. Three types of potometers were used, according to the nature of the experiment. Each proved admirably suited for its special </seg>

These have been described in previous publications, but for convenience and a few slight modifications will be assembled and restated here. In the field experiments the potometers stood in walled-up pits of such depth that their tops were on a level with the adjoining held. This field was planted to corn and furnished rather normal cornfield surroundings. POTOMETER WITH TOIL-WATERING DEVICE.' Fig. 2. — Potometer with coil-watering device.

The amount of soil contents varied somewhat from year to year but was approximately 250 pounds of moisture-free soil. The exact amount is stated with each experiment. A 3-inch layer of gravel served to reduce surface soil moisture evaporation. Rain was excluded by means of a loosely fitting galvanized-iron lid having a 4-inch opening for the plant. After the plant had attained a height of 18 inches a further protection against the entrance of rain was added in the form of an oilcloth covering over the opening about the plant, which was sealed to the stalk by means of a 3-inch collar of plastic modeling clay (plastocene) illustrated in Figure 3. Fig. 3.— Potometer lid showing oilcloth and plastocene seal about the plant. The leaves of a corn plant act as a funnel, and it has been determined that without this close seal at the base approximately 6} pounds of water will be conducted along the stalk of a full-grown plant into the potometer for each inch of rain. The seal is so made that the plant may sway in the wind without disturbing the seal. 1, potometer wall; 2, galvanized-iron lid; 3, oilcloth; 4, oilcloth; 5, corn stalk; 6, plastocene; 7, oilcloth girdle. Buried in the soil and connected at the top with a covered 6-quart can, was a spiral coil made of §-inch brass tubing 16 feet in length and perforated every 8 incfces.

All water was weighed accurately in grams before being added. On the floor of the pit were three double tracks upon which the potometers, standing on small iron trucks, could be rolled back and forth. (Fig. 4.) At any one time the potometers stood on the middle and one of the outside tracks. At one end of the three tracks, a fourth track at a right angle to the others was Fig. 5. — Detailed view showing arrangement for weighing potometers to determine the daily use of water by corn plants.

A platform scale graduated to one-hundredth of a pound was located permanently at the end of the middle track. (Fig. 5.) When about to be weighed, the potometers on the middle track would first be rolled individually upon the scale, weighed, rolled upon the switching truck, and moved back upon the empty receiving track. The potometers in the second row were then switched back upon the middle track and weighed while passing over the scale. This arrangement for weighing and switching the potom - eters is much better than that described in the Twenty-fourth Annual Report of this Station. It is a great advantage to have the scale permanently located. Fig. 6. — Potometer with subirrigation-watering device for maintaining a con - stant moisture supply. In experiments where soil moisture is not a variable factor under investigation and the object is to determine the total amount of water transpired during the growth of the plant, the watering device shown in Figure 6 is very simple in operation and is very satisfactory. Except in experiments to determine the effect of the amount of soil, the potometers were of the same size as those just described, 16 by 36 inches, and were made in the same manner.

            <seg id="p049">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 49 quantities of water are added to covered 4-gallon, glazed earthen jars, which stand on a level with and are connected at the bottom to the potometers. A constant supply of water is kept in the jars so that the soil-moisture content is continually kept fairly uniform in all potometers. The water runs from the jar thru a rubber connecting tube into a 1-inch, gravel water bed in the bottom of the potometer and rises into the soil by capillarity. The distribu - tion of moisture thruout the soil mass is shown in Table 2. Evaporation is prevented and rainfall excluded by the same devices as with the previous potometer. The total water used is found by taking the total weight of water applied minus the amount remaining in the jar at the close of the experiment, and either adding or subtracting the difference in initial and final weight of the potometer, according to whether it has lost or gained in weight. Figure 7 illustrates the manner of weighing these potometers. Fig. 7. — Method of weighing potometers where only initial and final weights are made to determine the total water used. The potometer is lifted by means of differential block and tackle and weighed on steelyard of 2,000 pounds capacity. At this stage, the corn was reduced to one plant, per potometer, several kernels having been planted to insure a full stand. </seg>

LABORATORY POTOMETER.' Figure 8 illustrates the type of potometer used in part of the greenhouse experiments. Corn plants grown in potometers of this size must be harvested at an early stage before the small quantity of soil has become a limiting factor in growth. The apparatus consists of a 4-gallon, glazed earthen jar, filled with approximately 35 pounds of fertile soil. An inverted, porous, clay flower pot is placed in the bottom of the jar and connected with the surface by two f-inch glass tubes. Water is added in weighed quantities thru one of the tubes by means of a funnel having a rubber-tube connection. The second tube pro - vides for the escape of the replaced air, as water is added. The flower pot serves both as a water chamber and as an aerating device. By frequent *"•?• b 8 ~? ma11 weighing and replacement of water, any amount potorneter ry °f moisture may be rather constantly main- tained. Surface evaporation is prevented either by sealing with plastic modeling clay (plastocene) or by covering with paraffined paper weighted down with gravel. The water and potometers are weighed in grams on a Troemner balance. RELATIVE GROWTH IN FIELD POTOMETERS AND IN FIELD By growing one corn plant in the standard potometers, 16 by 36 inches, and supplying fertile soil, the vegetative growth and ear development is fully equal to that of plants in a normal cornfield under favorable conditions. Figure 9 shows a mature crop of plants ready to be harvested. Table 1 shows the comparative development of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn grown in the potometers and in the field during four years. During the first three years given, the corn was grown two plants per hill, while in 1914, three plants per hill were grown. The hills were 3.5 feet apart. DISTRIBUTION OF MOISTURE IN SOIL. Table 2 shows the moisture content in foot sections in repre - sentative potometers of the two large field types. The data for the potometers with the coil show how a relatively low degree of saturation may be maintained uniformly thruout the soil. 1 This type of potometer was first used and described by Kiesselbach (1910). </seg>

Note the plastocene collars at the base of the plants for excluding rain. Also note the normal development of the plants. In those potometers to which a constant supply of water was added thru the jar at the bottom, the soil naturally contained all of the water it could take up by capillarity. The lower foot of soil contained 4 per cent more moisture based on dry soil weight than did the upper foot, while the middle section was inter - mediate. Variation in the total moisture content of the duplicate potometers was less than 3 per cent. So small a difference will not materially affect the transpiration rate when water is plentiful. WATER LOSS BY EVAPORATION FROM THE POTOMETERS. Since neither the potometers nor the water jars were sealed air-tight, it was to be expected that a small amount of water would be lost by evaporation in addition to that used by the plant. To determine the approximate amount of such loss, three uncropped potometers were tested during two years, 1913 and 1914. The water jars were full of water thruout the season and consequently a maximum amount evaporated from them. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 53 The results contained in Table 3 show an extreme individual variation of 2.35 kilograms and an average total loss of 3.4 kilo - grams for 1913. In 1914 the extreme variation was 1.66 kilograms, and the average total loss was 3.02 kilograms. No attempt has been made to correct the experimental data for such evaporation. For comparative purposes, one would conclude that an error exists of about 2 kilograms per plant in relative total transpiration when grown to maturity, while on an average the total transpira - tion for all plants is about 3 kilograms too high. The percentage of error is small and has been disregarded. During two months in the greenhouse in 1912, four of the small 4-gallon laboratory potometers described on page 59 lost an average of 420 grams of water, when left uncropped.

Not only transpiration but extensive fertilizer and other cultural experiments as well have been conducted in pots by various investigators. They are used largely in greenhouse experiments, but some agricultural experiment stations have pot cultures located in the field where they may be exposed to the natural elements. For convenience in handling and economy of space, the pots are usually rather small. This is especially true of those used in greenhouses. In order to secure accurate data to help interpret the results of other investigators and to determine the reliability of our own work, the relative growth ■References concerning the effect of soil limitation: Hellriegel (1883), Leather (1910, 1911), and Seelhorst and Bunger (1907).

The soil was a fertile loam from the surface six inches of a productive cultivated field, and was uniform thruout all the potometers. The subirrigation type of potometer was used, and all growing conditions were uniform except the size of potometer and quantity of soil. The shorter potometers were elevated so that the top of all were on a level with the surrounding cornfield. A single stalk of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn was grown to maturity in the center of each potometer. All of the seed was secured from the middle of a single ear. A duplicate series was grown with all conditions identical with the first series, except that well-rotted sheep manure was mixed with the upper foot of soil in each potometer at the rate of 4 pounds per plant as it came from the pile, or 1.75 pounds of moisture-free manure. This rate per plant under average eastern Nebraska field conditions would amount to about 21 tons of moist manure, or 9 tons of moisture-free manure per acre, count - ing 10,668 plants per acre. Each size of potometer and method of treatment was replicated four times. Figure 10 illustrates the different sizes of potometers used. Figure 11 shows the relative plant development in the potom - eters of different sizes, both without and with manure. A repre - sentative plant was chosen from each set. Figure 12 shows the actual ears harvested. Four plants were harvested in all but two sjts. One plant in each set of the 16 by 36 inch and 30 by 36 inch potometers without manure was broken early by the wind, reducing the number to three plants. Several plants produced more than one ear. The results of the experiments dealing with the size of potom - eters are given in Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7, and Charts 1 to 7. A detailed study of the tables shows a very marked relation - ship between the amount of soil available to the plant and the growth and water requirements. An increase in the amount of soil rather consistently increased the ear weight, the total dry weight of the plant, and the total amount of water transpired. It decreased the amount of water used per unit of dry weight of plant, altho this decrease was not proportional to the increase in weight of plant nor to the increase in the amount of soil. The addition of equal quantities of manure to the different sized potometers increased the average ear weight 722.5 per cent in the smallest and only 2.9 per cent in the largest potometers. The total dry weight per plant was increased 176.4 per cent in the smallest and only 7.2 per cent in the largest potometers. The total amount of water transpired per plant was increased </seg>

Manure reduced the water transpired per gram of dry weight 73.7 per cent for the ear and 21.7 per cent for the entire plant in the smallest potometers. For the largest potometers these data are somewhat inconsistent in that manure actually increased the water requirement for the ear and the entire plant 9.0 and 4.6 per cent, respectively. Doubtless, apparent inconsistencies are often due to the averaging together of an insufficient number of plants to overcome individuality. The reader is referred to the tables and charts for other relationships. A preliminary test of three different sized potometers was made the preceding year, 1913. The results which follow in Table 8 substantiate in principle the more extensive 1914 data. relationships but the entire development of the plant. A modified test of the effect of the size of the potometer is planned in which the amount of manure added will be varied according to the amount of soil contained by the potometers. The soil unit rather than the plant unit will be taken as the basis for comparison. "■able 8. — Summary showing effect of size of potcmeter u nd water requirements of corn. 1913.

See Table 7. i FECT OF EXPOSURE OF POTOMETER ON THE GROWTH AND WATER REQUIREMENTS OF CORN. As is rather customary in pot experiments, our potometers have been exposed to the surrounding atmospheric conditions rather than buried in the soil. This greatly facilitates weighing and handling, but subjects the soil contents to somewhat different temperatures than are normal under field conditions. Potom - eters exposed in this manner have been criticized by several investigators. Fortier, Hasselbring, Thorn, and Willard and Humbert have surrounded their pots with a water jacket, for the purpose of reducing temperature fluctuations. In order to secure data concerning the effect of this exposure upon soil temper - ature, growth, and transpiration, the tests reported in Tables 9, 10, and 11 were made. The subirrigation type of potometer was used and all were filled with fertile surface-loam soil equivalent to 239 pounds moisture-free soil, and 1.75 pounds moisture-free sheep manure was added. Eight potometers were fully exposed in the pit, and eight were buried in the soil in the field and connected by means of 1 References concerning the effect of the exposure of the potometer: King (1895), Leather (1911), Liebscher (1895), and Briggs and Shantz (1914) </seg>

Four others were surrounded by a 4-inch water jacket, which was kept filled with water. The water jackets as used were not exactly what water-jacket advocates recommend in that they were not sunk in the ground, but rather stood on top of the floor of the pit. A buried water jacket would have kept the potometer temperature more nearly the same as the field soil, and in future tests of the method this will be provided for. The advantage of surrounding the potometer with a water jacket rather than filling soil around it is that it may facilitate occasional weighing.

VARIATION IN RESULTS FROM SIMILAR POTOMETERS AND REDUCTION OF ERROR BY REPETITION. Forty-eight standard potometers were planted to Hogue's Yellow Dent corn in 1912 and 80 potometers in 1913. The weight of moisture-free soil was 248 pounds in 1912 and 243 pounds in 1913. The potometers were filled with soil from a productive field taken to a depth of 6 inches and no additional fertilizer was added. The soil-moisture content was maintained constant by adding water to the jars at the base. The conditions were similar each year for all plants tested, and the variations between the different plants in any one year may be regarded as indicat - ing the amount of experimental error to be expected between individual potometers due to individuality of the plants. The detailed data for 1912 for the individual potometers are given in Table 12. The potometers have been averaged in groups of four adjacent potometers to correspond to one of the regular experiments in which the effects of differences in soil moisture, soil fertility, or variety are compared. The 80 plants grown in 1913 and the ears harvested from them are shown in Figures 13 and 14. The results from the 48 potometers of 1912 and the 80 potom - eters of 1913 have been compiled in Tables 13 to 21 so as to show the extreme variation and the coefficient of variability when single potometers are used and when grouped in sets of two and four each. Since variation varies with frequency, these coefficient of variability tables have been prepared so that the averages are for the same frequency, whether single potometers or the mean of two or four potometers is used. The coefficients of variability for the two years may be sum - marized as in Table 22. The data show a consistent reduction in the coefficient of variability as the number of potometers averaged together is increased. However, considerable variation still exists when four potometers are averaged together, and the data will serve to guard against attaching too much importance to very small differences in the experiments which follow. The extreme variation between groups of four is also seen to be rather high, and this must be kept in mind when interpreting results. </seg>

            <seg id="p087">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 87 THE RELATION OF CLIMATE TO TRANSPIRATION. 1 HOURLY TRANSPIRATION AND EVAPORATION IN RELATION TO CLIMATIC FACTORS. Records have been secured during two years, 1910 and 1914, relative to the amount of water transpired by a corn plant and the amount evaporated from a free water surface during consec - utive hours of the day in a cornfield. A record of the accom - panying climatic factors was taken by means of self-recording instruments in the cornfield. The facilities and methods for obtaining these records are shown in Figure 5, p. 47. The United States Weather Bureau has installed at the Ne - braska Experiment Station a Maivin pyrheliometer and a Callendar recording pyrheliometer, so that beginning with 1915 solar radiation records will be available for correlation with tran spiration and evaporation in addition to those weather records taken heretofore. The transpiration data were secured from plants standing undisturbed on platform scales thruout the tests. The scales were read at the end of each hour between 7 a. m. and 8 p. m., and the hourly transpiration was determined by loss in weight. Only the total transpiration and evaporation were determined for the night, but the weather factors were being taken continually. The test was made after the plants had acquired their maximum leaf-area. In 1910 the soil contained 60 per cent and in 1914 ,70 per cent of its water-holding capacity. In 1910 the evaporation data were secured by averaging the losses from five Livingston porous clay cups at an elevation midway between the base and tip of the plant. In 1914 a shallow free water surface was used, 1.5 inches deep and of 36 square - inch surface area, in which the water was restored by weight to the jar each day to one-half inch below the top. A shallow body of water has been found to respond more readily to changing conditions than a deeper body. The data are given in Tables 23 and 24, and in Charts VIII and IX. The 1914 data are an average for 30 days between July 14 and August 22 (weighings were not made on rainy days), while the 1910 data are the average for only nine days. The former, therefore, are more representative because of a greater duration. 1 References concerning the relation of transpiration to climatic factors: Briggs and Shantz (1913, 1914), Fittbogen (1873), Hasselbring (1914), Hell - riegel (1883), Heinrich (1894), Kiesselbach and Montgomery (1911), Kiessel - bach (1910), King (1905), Leather (1910, 1911), Montgomery and Kiesselbach (1912), Pfeiffer et al.

Table 26 is summarized from Tables 23 and 24, which show the hourly transpiration and evaporation rates for periods in 1910 and 1911 during which the plants were full grown and the leaf-area remained rather constant. The 24 hours were arbitrarily divided into 12 hours each for day and night in 1910, and in 1914 the night included 11 hours and the day 13 hours. It is very interesting to note that as an average for the two years the average hourly night transpiration amounted to only 7.5 per cent of the hourly day loss. The corresponding difference in climatic factors is summed up as follows: The night tempera- ture was 14.1° F. cooler, the relative humidity 25.5 per cent higher, and the wind velocity 3.2 miles an hour lower. There was also the normal light and darkness of day and night. These differences in climatic factors were sufficient to reduce the average hourly night transpiration to one-thirteenth of the day transpiration. At the same time, the evaporation from a free water surface was reduced only to one-eighth of the day evaporation. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. 94 Table 26.— Average relative day and night transpiration and evaporation rates during nine consecutive days in 1910 and 30 days in 191 U- (Taken from Tables 23 and £4.) 1 The average hourly transpiration and evaporation for the night (12 hours in 1910 and 11 hours in 1914) is expressed in per cent of the hourly day loss. For the exact losses in grams, see Tables 23 and 24. Just why the transpiration rate should be reduced relatively so much more during the night than the evaporation rate is not fully understood. It would appear that there may be two chief possible causes, namely: (1) The internal heat developed by photosynthesis in the light is absent in the dark of the night. This factor may, however, be quite offset by the greater cooling effect of a more rapid transpiration in the daytime. (2) A comparative study of the condition of the stomatal apertures during the daylight and at night has shown that they are closed at night, and open in the day. At night the walls of the guard cells which form the stomatal aperture lie in such close contact that they merely appear as a heavy black line. On the other hand, in the daytime a very distinct, colorless aperture is found to exist between these cell walls. Occasional stomata show a slight aperture even at night. As a result of these observations it is evident that the area exposed for diffusion is greatly reduced at night in the case of the corn leaf, while it is constant with a free water surface.

DAILY TRANSPIRATION AND EVAPORATION IN RELATION TO CLIMATIC FACTORS. During two years, 1910 and 1914, daily records were obtained, for a period of about one month each year, of the transpiration by corn plants, evaporation from free water surface, temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and sunshine. The climatic records, except percentage of sunshine, were obtained in the cornfield by means of self-recording instruments, as previously described and illustrated. (Fig. 4, page 47.) The evaporation from a free water surface has been obtained each year by averaging together the losses from six evaporation jars of 36 square inch area standing at different elevations near the corn plants at intervals of 2 feet from the ground up. (See Fig. 3, page 46.) The plants used for these measurements were grown in the experiments for testing the effect of different degrees of soil - moisture content on the water requirements of corn. For cor - relation with the climatic factors, only those groups of plants were averaged each year in which the shortage of water was not so great as to reduce the growth very abnormally. In 1910 the daily losses were averaged for plants in the 60, 80, and 100 per cent soil saturation potometers. In 1914 the data for plants in 50, 70, and 95 per cent saturation were averaged. A complete record of the growth and water requirements of these plants may be found in Tables 53 and 55, pages 133 and 135. Tables 27 and 28 and Charts X and XI contain a daily record for 1910 and 1914 of the average transpiration, evaporation, and climatic factors. The results appear to indicate clearly that tran - spiration from corn plants, and evaporation from a free water surface are similar phenomena and respond in a fairly similar degree to changes in the climatic factors. Transpiration is essentially evaporation. In the main, the daily losses for these two factors correlate and are fairly parallel. The occasional in - consistencies between the two may be largely due to the difference in the physical condition of the evaporating bodies and to dif - ference in exposure. In these tests the transpiration rate kept pace with free water evaporation when the atmospheric demands for moisture were high. When these evaporation demands were low, there was no definite tendency for the transpiration rate to be relatively less </seg>

During two years, 1913 and 1914, eight plants of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn were grown in each of several different degrees of soil moisture. Summary data of the results secured relative to the growth and water requirements are included in Tables 56, 57, and 58, pages 137, 138, and 139. The average daily loss during about one month for the plants in each degree of soil moisture is recorded in Tables 29 and 30 and Charts XII and XIV. The plants were full grown and the leaf-area was practically con - stant during this period. The relative daily transpiration in the different degrees of soil moisture is also shown in these tables by regarding the loss under the optimum moisture conditions (70 per cent saturation) as 100 per cent. The object is to show to what extent the fluctu - ations in the daily transpiration rates are independent of the soil-moisture content, under the conditions of these tests. These data are shown graphically in Charts XIII and XV. With a few exceptional days, the rates of water loss from plants in dif - ferent degrees of soil moisture, altho markedly different in amount because of smaller plant development, are seen to be rather parallel in their daily fluctuation. There is no consistent or striking tendency for the plants lacking moisture to transpire a relatively large amount on days of low climatic values or relatively small amounts when climatic values are high, as measured in per cent of the loss from plants with ample soil moisture. These facts, together with the failure of transpiration to lag behind free water surface evaporation in the heat of the day as shown in Charts VIII and IX, are contrary to the observations termed incipient drying by Livingston, B. E., and Brown, W. H., 1912. It seems entirely probable that had the water supply been sufficiently low to cause prolonged wilting, the transpiration would have been relatively low during the wilted condition. Wilting is accompanied by a reduced turgidity or a relatively low moisture content in the leaf. It is a principle in physics that water evaporates less readily from an object with a low moisture content than from one containing much moisture. Microscopic examination has shown that with a collapse of leaf tissue which accompanies wilting, the stomata are in a fairly closed condition, thus reducing the opportunity for diffusion. </seg>

            <seg id="p105">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 105 VARIATION IN WEEKLY TRANSPIRATION IN RELATION TO CLIMATIC FACTORS. In 1914 a complete weekly record of transpiration and the climatic factors were obtained thruout the entire growing season. The results are given in Table 31 and Chart XVI. The weekly water requirement gradually increases early in the season with the growth of the plant, regardless of the weather conditions. Late in the season the water requirement decreases, due to the ripening of the plant and consequent reduction in the amount of transpiring leaf surface. As the plant ripens, the leaves fail to function, become dry, and consequently have no moisture to be evaporated. In 1914, the leaf-area of the plants continued to increase until about July 8 and remained fairly constant until about August 15, when it gradually became reduced by the maturing of the plants. With a given variety, the dates of this cycle of development vary a few weeks in different years, according to climatic conditions. The season of 1914 was especially early.

            <seg id="p107">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 107 In a normal year the period from July 10 to August 20 is the most critical in corn production under Nebraska conditions, which may be ascribed to the high transpiration rate due to the combined high evaporating power of the atmosphere and the maximum leaf development of the plant. This is aside from the occasional blasting of the pollen and consequent reduction in grain development.

(Graph of Table 32.) VARIATION IN YEARLY TRANSPIRATION. As was seen in Table 31, the climatic conditions prevailing in July and August are the determining factors in the yield of corn, so far as transpiration is concerned. In 1914, 86 per cent of the entire transpiration from corn occurred during July and August. Accordingly, in an attempt to correlate the seasonal transpiration with evaporation and the climatic factors, during the five con- </seg>
            <seg id="p108">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. 108 aecutive years 1910-1914, the data for the two months of July and August were used. Plants taken for this comparison were grown in standard potometers in the cornfield under similar conditions as to corn variety, soil fertility, soil moisture, soil mass, and the exclusion of sources of error as surface evaporation and the entrance of rain. The yearly differences recorded in Table 33 may there - fore in the main be ascribed to variations in the climatic condi - tions affecting the evaporating power of the air. For these yearly comparisons the evaporation from a free water surface is based on the loss from the evaporation jar 10 feet above the ground. This jar stood higher than the surround - ing corn each year, and consequently always had identical ex - posure. Since there was some likelihood that our weather instruments might vary a degree in adjustment between the different years, it was thought best to eliminate such a possibility of error, and consequently the seasonal weather records were calculated from hourly records taken by the United States Weather Bureau three miles distant. 1 In a few instances when its data were in - complete they were supplied from our own records. These weather data are compiled in Table 34. The summary tables indicate that there is a marked difference in the evaporating power of the atmosphere in different seasons, which may be accounted for by seasonal climatic variations. There is a rather consistent relationship in the relative seasonal variations between the (1) transpiration per unit dry matter, (2) transpiration per unit leaf-area, and (3) evaporation from a free water surface. The two years 1913 and 1914 offer an extreme contrast in the water requirements. The data for these two years have been compiled in Table 35 for comparison with similar data obtained during two years 1911-1912 under controlled green - house conditions, in which the effect of a difference in relative humidity was the object sought. The comparison shows a very similar difference in the prevail - ing temperature and humidity under natural field conditions in 1913 and 1914, as existed in the greenhouse experiments of 1911 and 1912 in which a difference of 22 per cent in relative humidity was artificially maintained. The complete data for these green - house experiments follow. 1 The author is indebted to Professor G. A. Loveland, section director of the United States Weather Bureau, for access to the original hourly records from which these seasonal climatic data were compiled. </seg>

            <seg id="p111">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 111 RELATION OF TRANSPIRATION TO ATMOSPHERIC HUMIDITY. To secure further data relative to the effect of atmospheric humidity on transpiration, the previously-published greenhouse work of 1911 was continued and extended in 1912. Humidity is the easiest of all the climatic factors to control in greenhouses independently of other factors. Two greenhouses were employed. One was maintained at the normal humidity by eliminating all possible sources of damp - ness. The atmosphere in the other was maintained as humid as possible by means of fine atomizers attached to the water system, and by keeping the floor and benches wet. The ventilators were so adjusted that only very slight differences in temperature re - sulted. A self-recording thermometer and hygrometer were kept in each greenhouse. Since transpiration at night has been found to be only 7 or 8 per cent as great as in the daytime, the weather factors for the day only should be used in studying their effect upon the total transpiration. The results of three tests in 1911 and 1912 are contained in Tables 36, 37, and 38 and are summarized in Table 39. In 1911 all of the plants were grown in the subirrigation type of potometers, 16 by 36 inches, filled with a fertile loam. Two plants grew in each potometer. In 1912 part of the plants were grown singly in the same style of potometer as was used in 1912 and part were grown singly in the small 4-gallon potometers con - taining 18 kilograms of a fertile compost-loam mixture. A small variety of pop corn was grown in these small potometers so that the plants might grow for a relatively long time before the small amount of soil should become a seriously limiting factor. All plants were harvested at the same time, at about the silking stage. Table 39 shows that largely as the result of 22 per cent higher humidity and 1.75° F. lower temperature during the day, only 58 per cent as much water was transpired per unit of dry matter, and 62 per cent as much per unit leaf-area, while the evaporation from a given free water surface was 54 per cent as mucn in the humid as in the dry greenhouse. EFFECT OF PREVIOUS CONDITION OF GROWTH ON TRANSPIRATION. Pop corn plants were used in this experiment which had been grown almost to the silking stage in either the dry or the humid greenhouse in 1912 under the climatic conditions described in Table 38. At the end of the eighth week, part of the plants were transferred from each greenhouse to the opposite green - house and there compared in relative transpiration rate with the </seg>

The results indicate that there was no significant adaptation of the plants under one condition of atmospheric humidity which would either retard or accelerate the transpiration when brought under markedly different conditions. EFFECT OF TRANSPIRATION ON LEAF TEMPERATURE. It is a well-known principle in physics that evaporation has a cooling effect upon the evaporating body. It, therefore, seems reasonable that the evaporation from the leaf should have a modifying influence upon the atmospheric temperature affecting it. The resultant reduction in leaf temperature must serve to reduce the transpiration rate. In this manner transpiration tends to reduce its own magnitude. Some preliminary data relative to leaf temperatures were secured during 1912 and 1913. In 1913 the comparative temperatures were determined for a transpiring leaf of a corn plant growing in the cornfield, and of a dry, dead leaf having the same exposure. Being fairly similar objects, the two leaves should have acquired rather similar temperatures had not the evaporation from the living leaf exerted a cooling effect. Water taken in by the roots naturally acquires the relatively low temperature of the soil, and its movement thru the stalk and leaves also exerts a somewhat cooling effect. The data follow in Table 41. Table 41. — Summary of plant temperatures showing the effect of transpiration upon leaf temperature. {Average for 7 days, August 25 to SO, 1913.)

            <seg id="p116">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. 116 The data indicate that a transpiring leaf is uniformly cooler than a dead one, amounting (under the high air temperatures of 1913) to a difference of 8.5° F. in the sun at 2 p. m. when tran - spiration is maximum, and 4.2 degrees in the shade at the same time. Averaging the sun and shade temperature for the day we find that the average daily temperature of the green leaf is 2.2° F. below the air temperature, while the dry leaf is 1.6° F. higher than the air. A probable reduction of 4° F. in the temperature of the leaf due largely to the transpiration is sufficient to exert a marked protection against water loss. The degree of leaf - temperature reduction would doubtless vary with climatic con - ditions. We cannot conclude that it is one of the purposes of transpira- Table 42. — Summary of plant temperature records in the cornfield. 1912. All temperatures were taken in the shade.

Additional temperatures recorded in Tables 42 and 43 were taken in 1912 and 1913 to determine the relative temperature of the leaf and other parts of the plant as compared with the air temperature. The temperature within the stalk, underneath the leaf sheath, and underneath the husks surrounding the ear were rather similar, while the leaf temperature was 2 to 3° F. higher and yet approximately 2° F. cooler than the air. The leaf temperatures were all taken by inserting the ther - mometer momentarily in a fold of the leaf, taking care to eliminate the effect of body heat of the operator. Altho this method is not very refined, it is probable that these temperatures are approx - imately correct. An elaborate method for determining leaf temperatures has been used and described by Shreve (1914). An electric potentiometer method for determining leaf-temperature is described by Ehlers (1915). A study of leaf-temperatures at this station will be continued with the use of thermocouples properly connected with a potentiometer. RELATIVE RATES OF EVAPORATION FROM EQUAL AREAS OF FREE WATER SURFACE AND LEAVES OF GROWING CORN PLANTS. In 1914, 24 potometers, each containing one corn plant with a fully developed leaf-area, were weighed each day for a period of 30 days, and the daily transpiration determined. Likewise the evaporation from six evaporation jars of 36 square inch free water surface, standing at regular intervals ranging from the ground surface to 10 feet above the ground, was determined daily for the same interval of time. The total average transpira - tion for one corn plant of 1,378 square inch leaf-area during the 30 days was 75,924 grams, which is equal to 55.1 grams water per square inch. The total average evaporation for one evaporation jar of 36 square inch area was 5,915 grams, which is equal to 164 grams per square inch. Accordingly, the transpiration rate per square inch leaf-area was 33.6 per cent of the evaporation from a square inch free water surface. During 30 days in 1914, the hourly transpiration was deter - mined for one corn plant having 1,500 square inches leaf -area. The evaporation from a free water surface standing midway between the top and base of the plant was also determined </seg>

The average transpiration per day was 3,112 grams, which is equal to 2.1 grams per day per square inch leaf-area. The average evaporation per day was 227 grams, which is equal to 6.3 grams per square inch free water surface. In this test the transpiration rate per square inch leaf-area was 33.3 per cent of the evaporation from a square inch free water surface. In 1910, the daily transpiration was determined during 30 days for 12 corn plants after the leaf -area was fully developed. Likewise the evaporation from six evaporation jars of 36 square inch free water surface at elevations above the ground of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 feet was determined. The total average transpiration for one corn plant of 1,209 square inches leaf-area during the 30 days was 71,277 grams, which is equal to 58.9 grams per square inch. The total average evaporation for one evaporation jar of 36 square inches free water surface was 7,363 grams, which is equal to 205 grams per square inch area. According to these data, the transpiration rate per square inch leaf-area was 29 per cent as great as the evaporation from a square inch free water surface. As an average for all three tests in 1910 and 1914 we find that the evaporation from a square inch of leaf area was 32 per cent as great as the evaporation from a square inch of free water surface. Since a corn leaf has two epidermal surfaces from which water evaporates, one may calculate that the evaporation from a given area of free water surface is approximately six times as great as from an equal area of leaf surface. The above leaf and free water surface evaporation data are quite comparable for the reason that the leaf-area was fairly constant during the time of the tests. At the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station an average acre of well-adapted corn has two acres of leaves, or 4 acres of leaf surface, counting both sides. THE GROWING CROP AS A PROTECTION AGAINST WATER- DISSIPATING INFLUENCES. EVAPORATION STUDIES IN CORN AND SMALL-GRAIN FIELDS For a number of years, botanists have been studying eco - logical conditions of natural habitats of native plants. Similar principles may be applied in the study of cultivated fields. In fact, our study of crop production is largely one of applied plant physiology and ecology. Among the least investigated features of this field ecology are the water dissipating influences as expressed by the evaporation power of the air within the </seg>
            <seg id="p119">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 119 field itself. The extensive data concerning the relative evapora - tion and transpiration rates reported in pages 87 to 116 have shown that these two phenomena (which are really only one phenomenon acting on two somewhat different media) are strikingly parallel, and respond in a rather similar degree to similar influences. It is entirely probable that, soil conditions being equal, the relative evaporation rate in two conditions, localities, or regions is a very good index as to the relative water require - ments of similar crops grown under those conditions. Two of the chief objects sought in the tests which follow were: 1) In what degree is the vegetation in a field a protection against excessive transpiration as measured in terms of evaporation from a free water surface at different elevations within the growing crop; and (2) to what degree is such a crop likely to serve as a protection against moisture evaporation from the soil. The method used was to place a number of evaporation jars of 36 square inch surface area and 1 gallon capacity at different elevations in corn and small-grain fields. The lowest jar was placed with its surface level with the ground (unless otherwise stated) and the highest jar stood above the crop even after it had attained its maximum growth. Studies were made in the cornfield in 1912, 1913, and 1914, in spring wheat in 1912, and in oats in 1913. In the cornfield, the evaporation jars which regularly stood at different elevations at the north end of one of the potometer pits were not used for these determinations. But a separate series of jars was placed out in the cornfield under strictly normal field conditions where Hogue's Yellow Dent corn was grown three plants in a hill, with hills 3 feet 6 inches apart. Moving leaves and birds were prevented from disturbing the water by arching woven chicken wire over the jar. Normally, the water was \ inch below the surface of the jars, which were weighed in grams each evening and the evaporated water replaced to a standard weight. The results are contained in Tables 44 to 50. It must be borne in mind that crops do not make exactly the same growth each year and are lodged more some years by wind than others. Such influences disturb somewhat the normal relationships from year to year. The evaporation rate within the crop increases with an increase in elevation. The crop doubtless causes a higher atmos - pheric humidity and lower wind velocity at the bottom of the vegetation, which change with the elevation. It certainly would appear that a plant afforded the protection of fellow plants under field conditions, against the water-dissipating influences </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. of the atmosphere, should transpire relatively less water than an isolated plant in an exposed place. This self -protection in mass makes it possible to grow a larger amount of vegetation on a given amount of soil moisture than would be possible if the plants were freely exposed. In all tests the evaporation at the surface of the ground bore a rather constant proportion to the evaporation from the highest jar. These ratios were: Corn, 1912, 0.31; corn, 1913, 0.36; corn, 1914, 0.31; spring wheat, 1912, 0.36; oats, 1913, 0.39. From these figures it may be concluded that, as a general prin - ciple, the water-dissipating influences are approximately three times as effective just above the growing crop as at the ground. The relationship may be expected to vary with the stage of development and character of the crop. In an open, bare field, the evaporation rates would not be identical above the ground and at the surface, but rather increase with elevation. However, we can assume that the above reduction in evaporation rate represents in large measure the degree of protection afforded by the crop. This has an important effect on reducing the loss of TABLE 44. — Weekly summary of evaporation from free water sur - faces 36 square inches in area at six elevations in a cornfield. 1912.

The oats have grown up around the lowest jar so that it cannot be seen in the picture. When the oats were full grown, only the upper jar showed above the plants. moisture from the soil by surface evaporation. In 1913 the first records of evaporation at different elevations in corn were ob - tained when the corn had made practically no growth and the comparative evaporation rates were little affected by the sur - rounding crop. During the first week (Table 44) the evaporation 10 feet above the ground was 220 per cent of that on the ground surface, while at the time the corn reached maturity the upper evaporation was 430 per cent of that from the lower jar. Table 50 on page 123 summarizes the relative losses in the five tests. RELATIVE WIND VELOCITIES 3 FEET AND 10 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND IN A CORNFIELD. Relative wind velocities were determined during 50 days in 1914 (July 17 to September 5) at elevations of 10 feet and 3 feet above the ground in a cornfield. The movement of the wind </seg>

The wind gauge above the corn recorded a total wind velocity of 8,055 miles for the 50 - day period, while only 521 miles were registered within the corn 3 feet above the ground. The upper wind velocity exceeded the lower fifteen times. METHOD STUDY WITH FREE-WATER-SURFACE EVAPORATION JARS. To secure data regarding the degree of reliability of the evaporation rates obtained from the jars used in the preceding experiments, an hourly evaporation test was made for 30 days in 1914, comparing three styles of jars. They were all 36 square inches in surface area and made of gray glazed earthenware one-half inch in thickness. They were filled uniformly to within ] inch of the top each day, and the surfaces were freely exposed 5 feet above the ground in the cornfield. Jars Nos. 1 and 2 were of the same depth, with 10 inches of water; while No. 3 was shallow, with only 1^ inches of water. Jar No. 1 was insulated with excelsior to eliminate the heating effect of the direct rays of the sun on the outside of the jar. Nos. 2 and 3 were not insu - lated and stood fully exposed to the sun. Hourly temperature records were taken of the water at the surface in order to account for differences in evaporation rates. The results are contained in Table 51. The summary indicates that the shallow jar is most sensitive and responds quickly to climatic changes. It warms more quickly in the morning and cools more quickly toward evening in response to atmospheric changes. As might be expected, the water in the deeper jars cools more slowly at night and warms more slowly in the daytime. The insulated jar remains 6° F. cooler in the heat of the day. The average day temperature of the water in the shallow jar is 1 degree cooler than the air, which compares favorably with the average transpiring leaf temperature shown in Tables 41, 42, and 43, which was 2.1° F. cooler than the air. It would appear from these figures that the shallow evaporation jar most nearly records the evaporating power of the atmosphere at any particular time, and is fairly comparable with the tran - spiring leaf except for some difference in exposure to the sun and wind. In comparison with the shallow jar, the deep exposed jar evaporated 15 per cent more water during the 24 hours of day and night, probably because the water remained warmer at night and cooled more slowly in the afternoon. The results indicate that the evaporation data accompanying the daily transpiration tests reported in Tables 27 and 28 were </seg>

RELATION OF AVAILABLE SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT TO GROWTH AND WATER REQUIREMENTS OF CORN. 1 PLAN OF THE EXPERIMENTS. During the three years 1910, 1913, and 1914, groups of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn plants were grown in potometers with all factors uniform except the degree of available water in the soil. Potometers 16 by 36 inches in size, having the coil-watering device, illustrated on page 44, were filled anew each year with fertile surface loam from one of the Experiment Station fields. The amount of water required to saturate the soil was regarded as the amount retained by the soil after seepage from water poured on the soil surface of duplicate potometers had ceased. Thus, the soil was considered saturated when it contained all the water it would hold against percolation. The standard weight of each potometer was determined for its particular degree of soil moisture content, and this standard weight was restored each day. The potometers were weighed and the water added between 7 p. m. and 8 p. m. except in 1913, when it was added two hours earlier. By this practice the transpiration rate was low at the time of applying the water, which was in this way given time to distribute itself thruout the soil mass during the night, before heavy transpiration commenced the following day. DECREES OF SOIL MOISTURE MAINTAINED. The various water contents of the soil during each year are indicated in Table 52. The results obtained with the different per cents of relative soil saturation as used in the potometers cannot be expected to correspond exactly to the same relative saturation under field conditions. The normal water-holding capacity of soil is doubt - less considerably disturbed by refilling and packing in potometers. It also varies greatly with the type of soil. Nevertheless, the data obtained in this way should serve to indicate general prin - ciples of response to variation in soil moisture. The relative effects of differences in soil moisture content also vary in dif- 1 References concerning the relation of transpiration to toil moisture content: Fittbogen (1873), Fortier (1902), Harris (1914), Hellriegel (1883), Il'enkov (1865), Kiesselbach (1910), Kiesselbach and Montgomery (1911), Leather (1911), Maercker (1896), Ohlmer (1908), Pfeiffer et al.

For example, the total dry matter produced in soil 50 per cent saturated was much below that in optimum soil moisture in 1913, while in the season of 1914 this moisture content resulted in a yield not far below the optimum. Climatic conditions were such that the free-water-surface evaporation during July and August in 1913 was only 60 per cent as great as in 1914. The difference in the climatic conditions of the two years is shown in Table 34, page 109. In 1910 the maximum total plant weight was attained at 80 per cent relative saturation, while the maximum ear weight was had with 60 per cent relative satura - tion. Indications are that a range of optimum moisture content may exist within the limits of which a variation does not ma - terially affect the growth of the plant. A reduction of soil - moisture content to 45 and 35 per cent relative saturation greatly reduced the ear and total dry matter, while an increase to 95 per cent also resulted in a marked reduction in total weight and weight of ear. From these data it was concluded that a mean saturation of 70 per cent of the water-holding capacity of the soil (70 per cent relative saturation) may be regarded as an opti - mum condition for this soil, and was used as such in the experi - ments which followed. In 1910, five different degrees of relative saturation were maintained, namely, 35, 45, 60, 80, and 100 per cent of the water-holding capacity of the soil. During 1913 and 1914 three degrees of water content were compared, representing less than optimum, optimum, and above optimum soil moisture. These were 50, 70, and 95 per cent of the water-holding capacity, with 70 per cent as the optimum. During 1914, an unmanured and a manured group of potometers were conducted at each of these three degrees. In addition, one group of both manured and unmanured potometers was started at 70 per cent relative saturation, the same as the normal 70 per cent group, but each day only two-thirds as much water was added to each potometer as was transpired on an average by the eight plants continuously kept in 70 per cent saturated soil. The results of all three years' tests follow in detail in Tables 53, 54, and 55, and are summarized in Tables 56, 57, and 58. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. The results of the three years' tests have been summarized in Tables 56, 57, and 58. In Tables 57 and 58, the data have been assembled into three general classes, according to whether the plants were grown in optimum, less than optimum, or above optimum soil-moisture content. This necessitated averaging together for 1910 the 35, 45, and 60 per cent relative saturation 5 </seg>

The water used per gram dry weight of ear was reduced 4.3 per cent, per gram total dry matter 7.9 per cent, and per square inch leaf-area 28.2 per cent. The ratio of leaf - area to dry matter was 40.4 per cent greater and the ratio of weight of ear to weight of stalk was 11.2 per cent greater in the deficient moisture content than in the optimum. The height of plants also was reduced 26 inches, or 25 per cent. At first thought it would appear that a greater efficiency in the use of water had been effected by a reduction of the soil moisture below the optimum. However, a saving of 7.9 per cent in the water requirement per unit total dry matter, and 4.3 per cent in the water requirement per unit weight of ear, was accom - plished only thru a reduction of 30.7 per cent in the yield of dry matter and 28.5 per cent in the weight of ears. Consequently, a reduction of soil-moisture content below the optimum would not be practicable in order to bring about a saving in the water requirement per unit dry matter. It is clear that the efficiency of the leaves in elaborating dry matter is reduced with a deficiency of soil moisture, the average increase in leaf-area per unit dry matter being 40 per cent in these experiments. This is probably due to a relatively more normal growth up to the time of full leaf development, followed by a retardation of growth caused by excessive evaporation demands occurring during August and the latter half of July. The reduction of 28.2 per cent in the water loss per unit leaf - area would perhaps appear to support the old theory that the leaf stomata exert a regulative control by partial closing when a deficiency of soil moisture exists. However, it must be borne in mind that these plants were doubtless less exposed to evaporation influences, being 26 inches less in height. The free-water-surface evaporation data in Table 50, page 123, show an average reduction of 17 per cent in the evaporation rate with an average reduc - tion of 23 inches in elevation in a cornfield from 84inches to 61 inches. During the two years 1910 and 1913, the plants also grew slowly and the maximum leaf development did not occur until some - what later than with the optimum soil moisture. This reduced the length of time during which the total leaf-area evaporated water, and thus reduced slightly the relative water loss per square inch leaf-area. The close correlation between the hourly and daily transpiration and evaporation rates in relation to climatic factors shown earlier in this Dulletin also fails to support the theory of stomatic control. If there was an inherent reduction in the transpiration rate per unit leaf-area aside from the influences mentioned above, it was perhaps due to a lower water content or lessened turgidity of the leaves. It is a principle in physics </seg>
            <seg id="p141">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 141 that water evaporates less freely from a partially saturated object than from one fully saturated. A slight wilting also occurred, in a few instances. This may actually reduce transpiration by stomatic closure due to a physical collapse of the tissues rather than thru regulative closure. An examination of stomata in wilted leaves has shown them to be practically closed as compared with open stomata in a turgid leaf at the same time. Future studies may throw more definite light upon these speculative observations. EFFECT OF AN OVERABUNDANCE OF SOIL MOISTURE. THREE-YEAR AVERAGE. An overabundance of soil moisture, existing in an average relative saturation of 97 per cent, decreased the moisture-free weight of stalk 11.3 per cent, the weight of ear 21.1 per cent, the weight of leaves 14.4 per cent, the total dry matter 16.7 per cent, the total water transpired 9.8 per cent, and the total leaf-area 9.1 per cent. The water used per gram dry weight of ear was increased 13.5 per cent, per gram total dry matter 8.2 per cent. The water used per unit leaf-area was reduced 1.1 per cent. The ratio of leaf -area to dry matter was 9.4 per cent greater, and the ratio of ear weight to stalk weight 11.2 per cent lower. The average height of plant was nearly normal, being reduced 2.8 per cent, or 3 inches. From such data as these, showing an increase in the water requirement per unit weight of dry matter, investigators have rather generally concluded that the plant in some way releases a control over the transpiration rate, and that the plant strives to get rid of the surplus water by increased transpiration. It has been frequently said that less work is required by the plant to absorb moisture from a saturated soil, and that it is therefore used more extravagantly. The writer, however, believes that no consideration of a vital element on the part of the plant need enter into an interpretation. It appears more probable that the water requirement per unit dry matter is increased because of a reduction in the available fertility due to surplus water in the soil. Toward the end of the season the lower leaves of the plants usually show symptoms of a lack of nitrogen. An average reduction of 16.7 per cent in the dry weight of the plant supports this interpretation. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. EFFECT OF INCREASING THE FERTILITY OF SOILS DIFFERING IN MOISTURE CONTENT. In 1914 (Table 56) half of the potometers in each degree of soil moisture received an application of 1.75 pounds of well - rotted moisture-free sheep manure per plant, which is at the rate of 9.3 tons per acre, counting 10,668 plants per acre grown three per hill, with hills 3.5 feet apart. The object was to note the effect of increasing the fertility of soils differing only in their water content. One frequently reads the statements that: As a principle in dry farming, a shortage of moisture may be offset by an increase in soil fertility thru manure or other fertilizer; to a certain extent, manure may take the place of water; and a field of grain may be grown with actually less rainfall if the soil fertility is increased, even tho the soil is fertile to begin with, as are most soils of the Great Plains area of the United States. No definite conclusions may be drawn from the single test reported here concerning this interrelationship, for the reason that the lowest relative saturation employed proved little in - ferior to the optimum moisture content — due to the low atmos - pheric evaporation values of the particular season. The applica - tion of the manure to the soil with a shortage of moisture in - creased the yield of dry matter 21 per cent, and also increased the total water used per plant 14 per cent and the water used per square inch leaf -area 24 per cent. (The increased transpira - tion per unit leaf-area when manure was applied was probably partially due to a healthier condition of the lower leaves during the latter half of the growing season.) The water requirement per unit dry matter was reduced 5 per cent. The application of manure affected the results in very much the same manner in the optimum (70 per cent) and the overabundant (95 per centi soil moisture, as may be seen from a study of Table 56 for 1914. The plants which started out in 1914 with an optimum (70 per cent) amount of moisture and received each day thereafter only two-thirds as much water as was transpired by the average of eight plants in soil constantly 70 per cent saturated, were reduced 14 per cent in yield of dry matter. With these plants, the manure failed to affect in a material degree any of the im - portant growth or transpiration relationships, as is summarized in Table 56. Other data indicate that probably different results would be secured under such conditions as prevailed in 1913, when moisture was a great limiting factor with those plants in the lowest saturation. This problem of the effect of increasing the fertility where a marked shortage of moisture exists will be further investigated in future experiments. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 143 RELATION OF SOIL FERTILITY TO GROWTH AND WATER REQUIREMENTS OF CORN. 1 Two different series of soil fertility potometers have been operated and are reported in this paper. (1) The first of these was started in 1911, one year's results having been published. 2 The soil used in the initial filling of the potometers in 1911 has remained undisturbed thruout the past four years. A crop of corn has been harvested from it each year, and the yields and water requirements have been determined. (2) The second series was commenced in 1914, and was similar in plan to series No. 1 except in the degree of soil fertility. In each experiment three soils were used, representing low, medium, and high fertility. Eight duplicate potometers of the subirrigation type were filled with each kind of soil, four of which received an application of well-rotted sheep manure, thoroly mixed with the upper 10 inches of soil. The other four potometers of each group remained untreated. Manure was applied in both experiments at the rate of 4 pounds per potometer, which was equivalent to approximately 21 tons per acre, wet weight, count - ing 10,668 plants per acre grown three per hill, with hills 3.5 feet apart. Reduced to a moisture-free basis, this manure application was 2.4 pounds per plant in 1911 and 1.75 pounds in 1914, which equaled respectively 13 tons and 9 tons of moisture - free manure per acre. The average composition of the different soils used is given in Table 59, while the total amount of plant food elements contained in each potometer is given in Table 60. The soils may be briefly described as follows: (1) Infertile soil. This has been classified as Lancaster Fine Sandy Loam, and was taken from a cornfield of low productivity five miles distant from the Agricultural Experiment Station. In the 1911 experiment the soil was refilled in the potometers in 6-inch layers as they were taken from the soil, while in 1914 only the surface 10 inches of soil was used. (2) Fertile soil. This was Wabash silt loam taken in 6-inch layers in 1911 from a native pasture of the Agricultural Experi- 1 References concerning the relation of transpiration to soil fertility: Briggs and Shantz ( 1914 ), Heinrieh (1894), Hellriegel (1883), Kieaselbach 11910), King (1893, 1894), Lawes (1850), Leather (1910, 1911), Liebscher (1895), Maercker (1896), Marie-Davy (1874, 1875, and 1876), Montgomery and Kiesselbach U912i, Ohlmer (1908), Pfeiffer et al.

In 1914 the surface 10 inches of a similar soil was taken from an adjoining productive cornfield. (3) Intermediate fertile soil. This soil was prepared in 1911 by filling the bottom two feet of the potometer with the 2d and 3d foot of the infertile soil, and for the upper foot an equal mix - ture of the surface foot of the infertile and fertile soils was used. In 1914 a uniform mixture was prepared by combining equal weights of the infertile and fertile soil. An intermediate stage of fertility was evidently secured each year, since in comparison with the infertile and fertile soils, the yields of dry matter were respectively 113, 184, and 270 grams in 1911 and 142, 330, and 417 in 1914. The higher yields in 1914 are due in large part to the fact that only surface soil was used. RESULTS OF THE TWO SOIL FERTILITY EXPERIMENTS. 1911 AND 1*14. The soils placed in the potometers in 1911 evidently deterio - rated after the first year, because the plants have each year since acquired a yellowish color and have been comparatively unpro - ductive. Altho the data for the last three years from these soils are summarized in Table 66, the results must be regarded as abnormal.

            <seg id="p153">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 153 DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. The results of the experiments during 1911 and 1914 have been summarized in Tables 63 and 64. The reader is referred to these two summary tables for a full and concise statement of results. The average production for the two years shows that three very distinct degrees of natural fertility existed. Without fertilizer, the average yields of dry matter from the infertile, intermediate, and fertile soils were 128, 257, and 344 grams per plant, while the ear weights were 54, 121, and 181 grams per plant. The respective amounts of water transpired per plant were 57.76, 91.87, and 107.51 kilograms. The water transpired per gram dry weight of ear was 1,223, 861, and 634 grams according to fertility, while the water requirements per gram total dry matter were 463, 384, and 327 grams. The dif - ferences between the water losses per square inch of leaf-area, which were 119, 132, and 139 grams, are not very significant. The comparatively low ratio for the infertile soil can be explained at least partially by the smaller height of the plants and also by a somewhat slower vegetative development. Table 64 shows the effect in percentage of applying manure to the three natural soils differing in fertility. The average for the unfertilized potometers is in each instance used as a basis and is regarded as 100 per cent. The application of manure increased the yield of dry matter per plant in the order of infertile, inter - mediate, and fertile soil, 194.5, 78.7, and 41.2 per cent. The weight of ears was increased 296, 105.9, and 45 per cent. The total water transpired per plant was increased 106.7, 42.6, and 28.7 per cent. Again in the order of infertile, intermediate, and fertile soil the manure reduced the water requirement per gram dry weight of ear 42.6, 25.4, and 10.5 per cent. The water require - ment per gram total dry matter was reduced 28.9, 17.1, and 8.1 per cent. The water used per square inch leaf-area was increased by the manure 9.9, 12.5, and 5.2 per cent. The more infertile the soil, the greater was the effect of manure in increasing the dry matter per unit leaf-area, and in increasing the relative ear development in proportion to stalk. A brief summary of the results is given in Table 65. </seg>

For a discussion of method used in compiling averages for two or more years, see page 42. It is very evident that an application of manure to the in - fertile soil reduced the water requirement per unit dry matter in a very marked manner. The effect upon a fertile soil was, how - ever, much less marked. These results would at first thought appear to confirm the prevalent belief that increasing the fertility of the soil reduces the amount of water transpired by the crop. But when we look at the column showing the total amount of water used per plant, we see that an actually much greater amount of water is used rather than a reduced amount of water. This is due to an increased development of the plant and greater tran - spiring surface. The reduction in the amount of water transpired per gram dry matter is due not to a reduction in the transpiration rate from the plant, but rather to a much more vigorous and constant growth of the plant. The situation may, in a general way, be stated as follows: In a fertile soil the plant continues to increase in dry matter in a thrifty manner all of the time that it is transpiring water. In an infertile soil, on the contrary, the plant continues to tran - spire water, but the increase in dry matter is greatly retarded because of malnutrition.

            <seg id="p155">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 155 These apparently contradictory and yet very logical water relationships may be clearly brought out in Charts XIX and XX. There is a rather prevalent popular theory that the absorption of food materials from the soil is dependent upon the transpira - tion rate; that in an infertile soil containing a weak nutrient solution, the crop must transpire at a relatively much more rapid rate in order to obtain the necessary amount of nutrients; that the plant exercises control over this transpiration rate and thereby can control the amount of nutrients absorbed; and that in a fertile soil containing a strong nutrient solution the necessary amount of nutrient materials may be absorbed with a relatively small amount of water, thus making it possible for the plant to thrive on a much smaller amount of water. Indications are, however, that the transpiration rate is independent of the strength of the soil solution, and that a more fertile soil does not lower the total amount of water necessary for the plant but rather increases the production thru increased vigor of growth, and thereby coincidentally reduces the amount of water used per unit dry matter. //7/^/'/'//e so// /ofcr/rredtetc fesf/Ze ferf//c so// sa// Chart XIX. — Effect of manure on the water requirement per unit of dry matter with corn.

This results in greater efficiency of the plant and a consequent greater produc - tion in proportion to the water consumed. Popularly this is said to reduce the water requirement, tho in fact it is not a function of the transpiration at all but merely a coincidence. The ease with which evaporation takes place from the plant will not be materially reduced or increased whether the solution absorbed is dense or not. As Livingston (1911, p. 161) has stated, "A solution of the strength of the highest concentration Chart XX.— Effect of manure on the total water transpired per plant with corn.

EFFECT OF PROLONGED CONFINEMENT IN CANS OF SOILS DIFFERING IN FERTILITY. The plan of the experiment recorded in Table 66 has been discussed on page 143. Attention has been called to the fact that after the first year the plants lacked their normal thrift in these soils. They assumed a yellowish color and made poor growth as tho the soil had greatly deteriorated in available fertility. This effect is attributed to a lack of aeration under the conditions prevailing. The low productivity cannot in all probability be assigned to a toxic effect from continuous cropping to corn, for the reason that four years of continuous corn cropping under field conditions on similar soil does not appear to be similarly injurious.

            <seg id="p159">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 159 Aside from a lack of thrift during the last three years, the reduced yield might be partially explained by the fact that a smaller variety (Pride of the North) was grown than the Hogue's Yellow Dent variety of the first year. A comparison of these two corns was made in the variety test of 1914. The Hogue's Yellow Dent corn produced 25 per cent greater dry matter. However, in this fertility experiment, the average yield of dry matter for the six degrees of fertility was 304.9 grams in 1911 and only 169.0 grams in 1914. It might be stated in this con - nection that in all the experiments reported in this bulletin, with this one exception, the potometers were filled with new soil every year. In spite of the abnormal condition of the plants in this experiment, the data show a very marked residual effect of manure on production for four years. The cause of this deterio - ration of soil productivity from prolonged confinement in cans will be further investigated. INFLUENCE OF ACCLIMATIZATION, VARIETY, AND KIND OF CROP UPON THE TRANSPIRATION RELATIONSHIPS. 1 In 1914 a comparative study was made of the use of water by corn differing in acclimatization, growth habits, erectness of leaves, and alleged drouth resistance. Sorghums and wild sun - flowers were also compared with corn. The ears harvested from the different corn varieties are shown in Figure 21. The plants were grown singly in potometers 16 by 36 inches in size, containing 248 pounds of fertile, moisture-free surface soil, and having an application of 1.75 pounds of well-rotted moisture - free sheep manure mixed in with the upper 10 inches of soil. A constant and uniform amount of moisture was available to all plants. The results are given in detail in Table 67 and are sum - marized in Table 68. ACCLIMATIZATION.' Two varieties of corn (Rocky Mountain Dent and Wood's White Dent), acclimatized to the humid soil and climate of New York, were compared with two varieties (Calico from North Platte, Nebr., and Martens' White Dent from Chadron, Nebr.) 1 References concerning the relation of transpiration to kind of crop and variety: Briggs and Shantz (1913, 1914), Hellriegel (1883), King (1892, 1893, 1894, and 1895), Lawes (1850), Leather (1910, 1911), Seelhorst (1906, 1908), Sorauer (1883), Thorn (1913), Thorn and Holtz (1914), Widtsoe (1909), Widtsoe and Merrill (1902), Willard and Humbert (1913), and Wollny (1877).

These varieties had been grown for many years in their respective localities. Very fortunately the average date of ripening was practically the same for all four varieties, so that no effect of difference in length of growing season need be con - sidered. The yield and water requirement may be summarized as follows: It would appear that the plants have developed no character - istics as a result of acclimatization which would cause them to differ in their water requirement. DIFFERENCE IN GROWTH HABITS The object of this test was to compare early, medium, and late varieties, which might also be described as small, medium, and large. Three varieties grown in the vicinity of Lincoln, Nebr., were selected, namely, Pride of the North, University No. 3, and Hogue's Yellow Dent. The varieties did not differ as much in their growth in the potometers as had been expected. The results follow: The data suggest that the Pride of the North corn used in this test was very efficient. The test will be repeated for a number of years to confirm the results.

ERECTNESS OF LEAVES. Two related selections of corn differing in that the leaves of one of them has no ligules were secured from R. A. Emerson and compared as to their relative water requirements. This liguleless character of the leaves causes them to stand somewhat more erect, and it had been suggested that such a condition may re - duce the exposure to evaporation influences and thus reduce the water requirement. The results follow: Dry Water matter require- Description ment Grams Grams 327 248 Corn with normal leaves Corn with liguleless leaves 248 313 296 Contrary to expectations, the liguleless corn had a considerably higher water requirement. The test needs verification with a greater number of selections. It is possible that one of the above selections was more efficient aside from this matter of the position of the leaves. SPECIAL DROUTH-RESISTANT CORN. The feature of this test was a hybrid 1 by H. F. Roberts in which he attempted to introduce the accredited drouth resistance of Chinese corn and Esperanza (Mexican hairy corn) into a stand - ard variety of Kansas corn known as Sherrod's Dent corn. The Chinese and Esperanza corn have bean described by G. N. Collins and are accredited by him to have great drouth resistance. The seed of all but the Esperanza was secured from Mr. H. F. Roberts, while the Esperanza was grown from old seed obtained four years ago from Mr. G. N. Collins. A satisfactory growth was obtained from all except Esperanza. All the plants of this variety were badly infected with smut and failed to produce ears, and for this reason the results from them are not included in the tables. The yield and water requirement may be summarized as follows: 1 The pedigree number given this seed by Mr. Roberts is F'H58— 9 ABC </seg>

A striking observation concerning the id was that the vegetative parts were much less pubescent with either of the three varieties entering into the cross. It is evident that if Chinese corn is especially drouth resistant it is so by virtue of other reasons than low water requirement. SORGHUMS Milo and Black Amber sorghum were compared with our standard variety of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn. Milo is a nonsaccharine grain sorghum, grown extensively in some regions for grain, while Black Amber is a saccharine sorghum grown primarily for forage. Both are recognized as unusually drouth-resistant crops as compared with corn, and the object of this experiment was to determine whether such drouth resist - ance may be due to a lower water requirement. The results follow : Compared with the average for 11 corn varieties, the milo and corn had practically the same water requirement per unit of dry matter, while sorghum exceeded the corn 16 per cent. The milo used 5 per cent less water per unit dry matter than Hogue's Yellow Dent corn, while Black Amber sorghum used 13 per cent more. These data suggest that other causes of drouth resistance in sorghums must be looked for than a relatively low water require - ment.

Such a plant uses approximately as much water as a hill of corn with three plants. RELATION OF ASH CONTENT TO TRANSPIRATION UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS OF GROWTH. 1 There are two common theories relative to the relationship between the transpiration rate and the intake of soil solutes. According to one theory the amount of solute taken up by the plant from the soil solution is proportional to the amount of water transpired, and the amount of transpiration is in inverse ratio to the density of the solution. According to the second theory, the amount of solute taken in by the plant may be in - dependent of the density of the solution and the amount of water transpired. In order to secure information regarding these relationships, ash determinations 2 were made of a large number of the plants harvested in 1913 and 1914. Altho the ash left on incineration has not the composition of the inorganic compounds taken up by the plant from the soil, nevertheless it may serve as an index of the relative absorption of soil solutes. In these determinations every precaution was taken to insure the highest degree of accu - racy. The whole plant was reduced to a fine powder, thoroly mixed, and sampled. The samples were ashed in a carefully regulated electric furnace, so that loss by volatilization was re - duced to a minimum. In all cases duplicate determinations were made. The following tables contain data concerning the relation between transpiration and ash content, as affected by: (1) Atmospheric humidity, (2) seasonal climatic differences, (3) soil fertility, (4) soil moisture, (5) kind of crop and variety, and (6) limitation of the amount of soil thru the size of the potometer. The complete plans and other detailed results with these plants have been given earlier in this bulletin, reference to the related data being given below each of these tables. EFFECT OF CLIMATIC DIFFERENCES UPON RELATION OF TRANSPIRATION TO ASH CONTENT. The plants grown in the dry and humid greenhouses in 1912 furnish excellent material to determine the effect upon the 1 References relative to transpiration and the intake of salts: Daszewski (1900), Fittbogen (1873), Hasselbring (1914a, 1914b), Ilenkov (1865), Lawes (1850), Preul (1908), Wilfarth and Wimmer (1902), and Wimmer (1908). ! The ash determinations were made under the direction of Dr. F. W. Upson, Station Chemist. </seg>

Ash determinations were made of plants grown in comparable potometers in the field during 1913 and 1914 in the test for deter - mining the seasonal effects upon transpiration. The 1913 and 1914 soil saturation tests also contained comparable plants during the two seasons 1913 and 1914, for which ash determinations have been made. The reader is referred to Tables 69, 70, and 71 for detailed data concerning these relationships, which are sum - marized in Table 72. Table 70. — Effect of difference in seasonal climatic conditions upon the relation between transpiration and the ash content of corn plants. 1913 and 1914. 1 1 Further data concerning these plants are reported in Tables 33 and 34, which contain five years' results showing the transpiration relationships in similarly treated potometers to seasonal climatic differences. 2 Average for July and August. By averaging the per cent ash ratios in the dry and humid greenhouses for the plants grown in both the large and small potometers during 1912, we secure an average ratio of 100:95.5. A similar ratio for the field potometers in 1913 and 1914 secured by averaging the ratios from the three different degrees of soil - moisture content and also from the plants reported in Table 70 gives a ratio of 100:93.5. The data of the three tables as sum - marized in Table 72 indicate that there may be considerable variation in per cent ash of the corn plant, but that as a general principle the per cent ash is slightly lower under climatic condi - rions having a low evaporation coefficient.

            <seg id="p175">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 175 Under comparable greenhouse conditions an increase in relative atmospheric humidity which lowered the evaporation rate from a free water surface 47 per cent reduced the amount of water transpired per gram ash content 38 per cent, and per gram dry matter 40.5 per cent. In comparable potometers situated in the cornfield during two years (1913 and 1914), a difference in climatic factors, which lowered the evaporation rate from a free water surface 40 per cent during July and August, reduced the transpiration per gram ash content 22 per cent and per gram dry matter 27 per cent. (Table 72.) EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES IN SOIL FERTILITY UPON RELATION OF TRANSPIRATION TO ASH CONTENT. An ash determination was made for all the plants grown dur - ing the season of 1914 in the new fertility series and also for the plants grown during both 1913 and 1914 in the old fertility series which was commenced in 1911. A full description of the experi - ment with other tables and conclusions is given in pages 143 to 158. It will be recalled (p. 145) that the plants reported in Table 73 were entirely normal according to the fertility of the soil, while those in Table 74 were not entirely normal due to soil deterio - ration from prolonged confinement in the potometers. As a result, the data in Table 73 are normal. The differences secured from the old fertility series according to the various soil types are so marked, however, that the data appear of value in corrobo - rating the results in Table 73 and to help establish a general principle. The results for the separate experiments have been averaged together in Table 75. In all three tests the amount of water transpired per gram ash content was reduced somewhat as the fertility of the soil was increased. It would probably be more accurate to say that the amount of solute per unit water taken in by the plant was increased as the fertility of the soil was in - creased. The denser soil solution did not, however, reduce the actual transpiration rate, for in fact the total amount of water transpired per plant increased consistently as the strength of the soil solution increased. This correlates rather closely with the relative amounts of water used per gram dry matter. The greater the availability of the soil solutes within the limits of these tests (1) the greater was the amount of solute taken in per unit water, (2) the greater was the dry matter produced, (3) the greater was the total amount of water transpired, (4) the greater was the total amount of solute taken into the plant, and (5) the smaller was the amount of water used per unit dry matter. </seg>

EFFECT OF A DIFFERENCE IN SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT UPON RELATION OF TRANSPIRATION TO ASH CONTENT. The ash content was determined for the plants in the 1913 and 1914 soil saturation experiments. These are described fully with additional data in pages 127 to 142. The ash relationships are given separately for each year in Table 76 and are summarized in Table 77. These summary data are obtained by first averag - ing the 1914 plants with and without manure in each degree of soil saturation. This average for 1914 is then averaged with the 1913 data.

EFFECT OF SIZE OF POTOMETER UPON RELATION OF TRANSPIRATION TO ASH CONTENT. It is apparent from the data in Table 78 that the limitation of the amount of soil available for the plant has a marked influence upon the various relationships. The variations due to size of potometer were somewhat irregular, but there was a rather definite trend from the smaller to the larger potometers. In those potometers receiving no manure, the transpiration per gram ash content was, from the smallest to the largest potometers, 6.14, 5.70, 5.20, 5.50, 5.07, and 4.32 kilograms. Where manure was applied, these figures were 4.88, 6.03, 6.10, 5.43, 4.87, and 4.40 kilograms.

EFFECT OF KINO OF CROP AND VARIETY UPON RELATION OF TRANSPIRATION TO ASH CONTENT. Ash determinations were made for all of the corn varieties described in pages 159 to 169, and are reported in Table 79. Considerable variation exists in the ash relationships of the different varieties of corn, but there appears to be no absolute correlation between the percentage of ash, the amount of water transpired per gram ash content, or the transpiration per gram dry matter. The sunflowers possessed a high percentage of ash and water requirement per gram of ash and per gram dry matter. The two sorghum varieties were slightly lower in the amount of water transpired per gram ash content than was the corn. Of the 12 corn varieties, the Chinese corn and Roberts' hybrid, which was related to Chinese corn, had the lowest transpiration per gram ash content. Averaging together the five corn varieties with a water requirement per gram dry matter of 260 or above, and in a second group those varieties with a water requirement ratio of less than 260, we get the following relationships: First | Second group group Water transpired per gram dry matter (grams) Water transpired per gram ash content (kilograms Ash content (per cent) 276 249 5.01 4.29 5.53 5.82 Total dry matter (grams) 439 411 </seg>

CORRELATIVE RESPONSE OF LEAF STRUCTURE AND TRAN - SPIRATION, AS RELATED TO VARIETY, ACCLIMATIZATION, AND SOIL CONDITIONS. Careful measurements of leaf thickness and the relative num - ber of stomata per unit leaf-area were made with the corn and sorghum varieties grown in the 1914 variety and acclimatization test. The relative number of stomata was also determined for the corn plants grown in the different degrees of soil moisture and of soil fertility in 1914. For these histological studies two leaf sections were taken by means of a Ganong leaf punch from each of three leaves of every plant. The leaves selected were the ear leaf and the leaf on either side. It was considered that these three central leaves would be fairly representative for the entire plant. The sections were taken in the widest portion of the leaf midway between the midrib and the margin. Since there were four duplicate potometers, 24 leaf samples were obtained for each variety or treatment. To determine the relative number of stomata, the number in 120 separate fields under the microscope was counted for each variety or treatment. To determine the epidermis and leaf thickness, 30 to 60 measurements were made for each. For stomata counts, the epidermis was stripped from the leaf. The thicknesses were measured from stained microtome sections of material imbedded in paraffin. The technique is explained in detail on pages 188 and 189. By reference to Table 80 it will be seen that considerable variation existed between the different varieties in regard to the thickness of the leaf and of the epidermis and also in the number of stomata per unit leaf-area. There was, however, no apparent striking or consistent correlation between these histo - logical coefficients and the transpiration rate per unit dry matter or per unit leaf-area of the different varieties. It is also evident from Tables 81 and 82 that there was no very striking response in the relative number of stomata to variation in either soil moisture or soil fertility. The reader is referred to the tables which follow for a summary of these relationships. Some very interesting histological generalizations concern - ing corn may be drawn from the 11 varieties grown in the potom - eters in 1914. These are tabulated in Table 83. </seg>

The specimens were allowed to remain in this solution 24 hours and were then washed 24 hours in running water. They were then transferred to 15, 35, 50, 70, 80, 95, and 100 per cent alcohol at intervals of about 2 hours, then to 25, 50, 75, and 100 per cent xylol at the same intervals. After thoro infiltration with paraffin, the specimens were imbedded and put away for sectioning. The material for stem work was preserved in alcohol and formol in the proportion of 95 c. c. of 50 per cent alcohol and 4 or 5 c. c. of 40 per cent formol. The stomata material was stripped from the leaf and plunged at once into 100 per cent alcohol. The leaf sections were cut 10 to 15 microns thick and stained in safranin and light green. The safranin stain consisted of equal parts of a saturated water solution and a saturated alcohol solution. The light green was a saturated clove oil solution. The stem sections were stained in the same safranin and light green. The stomata material was stained in Delafield's haematoxylin and eosin. The material was mounted in balsam for permanent slides. A comparison of fresh material with permanent mounts showed very clearly that with the latter the chloroplasts in the cells of the chlorophyll-bearing bundle-sheath assumed an abnormal elongated shape and grouped themselves in an unnatural crescent arrangement about the outer edge of the cells. For this reason the chloroplasts have been drawn in these cells in the following plates as they occur in fresh material. It is of interest to observe the distinct difference in size, and reaction to the killing process, between the chloroplasts in the cells of the chlorophyll-bearing bundle-sheath, and those of the leaf parenchyma in general. All other tissues shown in the camera lucida drawings have been checked with fresh material and found to be normal. 1 TISSUE STRUCTURE. Plate I contains microphotographs showing the general charac - ter and arrangement of the tissues involved in the transpiration current of corn. Figure 1 is a vertical section of the root showing the root cap and the origin of the vascular strands. Figure 2 shows in cross section the specialized area of the corn root thru which the water ascends, for the most part, after its intake from the surrounding cells. The vascular tissue of the root is arranged in one circle around the central portion of the root. The origin of a lateral rootlet is seen in the figure. Figure 3 is a 1-5 sector of 1 The author is indebted to Dr. Florence A. McCormick for suggesting a comparison of the fresh and permanently mounted specimens. </seg>

The cut ends of the vascular tubes may be seen in this figure. Water rises thru the vascular tubes of the stem and passes into the leaves thru the vascular bundles shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 is a cross section of part of a corn leaf. Here may be seen the two epidermal layers which are nearly impervious and serve to practically prevent water loss except that which passes thru the stomata, a number of which may be seen in section on both sides of the leaf. Figure 5 represents 1.3 square millimeters of lower epidermis. This shows the definite arrangement of the stomata in rows as well as the stomatal apertures thru which the internal water is evaporated into the air. Plate II shows various studies of the epidermis, both upper and lower surfaces. With the exception of Figure 8 which is diagrammatic, all figures were made with the camera lucida. Figure 1 is a cross section of the upper epidermis, showing the relative size of normal upper epidermal cells and the relative thickness of the walls. Figure 2 is a longitudinal section showing the same features. Figure 3 and 4 are cross sections of the upper epidermis showing groups of enlarged cells to which has been attributed the seat of leaf curling in time of water scarcity. Figure 5 is a longitudinal section of these enlarged cells. Figure 6 is a cross section of the lower epidermis, showing normal cells. Figure 7 is a longitudinal view of the cells of the lower epidermis. Figure 8 is a surface view of the lower epidermis. This figure shows diagrammatically the arrangement of the epidermal cells and stomata in rows extending lengthwise of the leaf. The prominent nuclei in the cells of the epidermis as well as the subsidiary cells of the stomata, are evident. Figure 9 shows more in detail the relation of a single stoma and the surrounding epidermal cells. The incurving of the walls of the epidermal cells to meet the walls of the subsidiary cells is quite characteristic. Figure 10 is a single stoma as seen under an oil immersion lens. The prominent nuclei of the subsidiary cells as well as the chloro - plasts located in the ends of the guard cells are features to be noticed. The number of plastids varies in different stomata. The aperture between the guard cells is the stoma proper, altho the whole structure is often referred to as the stoma. Figure 11 is a cross section of a stoma of the same magnification as Figure 10. This section is taken somewhere in the region of the two nuclei of the subsidiary cells. Figure 12 is a leaf hair, which is a single modified epidermal cell. Plate III shows various studies of sections of the leaf. Figure 1 is a longitudinal section of a leaf in the region midway between </seg>
            <seg id="p191">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 191 two bundles. There is little differentiation in the corn leaf between the chlorophyll-bearing cells of the upper and lower surface of the leaf. The rather loose texture of the leaf with the relatively large air spaces is characteristic of a vertical section in this region. Figure 2 is the same kind of a section taken closer to the bundle, thru a row of the cells of the chlorophyll-bearing bundle-sheath. The texture of the leaf here is not so loose as in the region illustrated in the preceding figure. Figure 3 is a longi - tudinal view of a leaf thru the vascular bundle. Compact tissue relatively free from air spaces is always found in and immediately surrounding the bundles. A chlorophyll-bearing sheath of single - cell thickness is always a prominent feature in connection with a bundle. Figure 4 is a cross section of a leaf showing a single bundle. The compact chlorophyll-bearing tissue is here seen in cross section. The water-conducting tissue of the bundle is represented by three heavy walled tubes shown in cross section. The relationship of a stoma in connection with its underlying air chamber to the internal leaf tissue is here seen. Figure 5 is a cross section of two bundles showing a lateral connection between the water conduction elements of the bundles. This doubtless accounts for the fact that a bundle in a leaf may be cut without completely isolating the remainder of that bundle in respect to its water supply. Figure 6 is a cross section of one of the more prominent ribs of a corn leaf. The thick-walled protective tissue on both the upper and lower sides of the bundle is characteristic. Small bundles are completely surrounded by a chlorophyll-bearing sheath while large bundles such as this one are only partly en - compassed. Plate IV has two semidiagrammatic figures. Figure 1 is a three-plane view of a corn leaf. The view given here is the same as that of three walls of a box. The features shown are the same as those already explained in other figures, so that detail is not necessary. The three planes have not been drawn in perspective but merely assembled to show their relationship. Figure 2 is a two-plane view of a portion of stem, showing cross and longitudinal sections in their relative positions to each other. The longitudinal section view is taken midway between the large vascular elements which always show so prominently in any cross section view of corn bundles. The phloem seen at d in cross section and d in longitudinal section consists of sieve tubes and numerous companion cells. This tissue is always located at one side of the water-conducting tubes. </seg>

APPLICATION The problem of conserving the water loss from the soil other than used by the plant does not concern us in this paper. It may be said, however, that because of the nature of the soil and the cultural treatments given it, much can be done toward conserving water for plant use (although this has been greatly over-emphasized — except the weed factor.) This is very important, since an abun - dance of soil moisture is so essential for crop production in all regions having only a moderately humid atmosphere. Much of the investigation and speculation which has been done concerning the economy of water in dry farming and irrigation has taken into consideration the relation of available water to crop yields, with - out determining the actual amount evaporated by the plant. It is possible that some means can be devised whereby the actual water transpired by crops under given conditions will be reduced. There are two chief points of attack, namely, adjusting the external factors to the needs of the plant and, second, adapting the plant to the conditions. The growth conditions of a cultivated crop may be either favorable or unfavorable for yields, with many intermediate degrees. Those factors which are most variable in any agricul - tural district are soil fertility, water supply, physical condition of the soil, and climate. There is also much variation in the plant characteristics of different crops and varieties. Each one of these may be a critical factor in crop production. A control of some one or more of these variable factors would naturally appear to give the greatest promise of controlling transpiration. The problem is somewhat different for irrigated and nonirri - gated conditions. Under irrigation the total amount of water may be adjusted to the requirements of the plant. Where the total available water supply is fixed by nature, no irrigation being possible, the problem is to produce the maximum crop (within profitable limits) on stated quantities of water. The optimum condition for any one growth factor is to be regarded as that which is associated with the highest yield. As any one important condition becomes less favorable, others being equal, the yield is reduced. In the case of many factors there is a rather wide range of optimum condition. SOIL FERTILITY. A broad interpretation of our present knowledge would be that for any given locality those soil conditions relating to available fertility which are conducive for optimum growth </seg>
            <seg id="p201">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 201 result in production at the lowest water cost, or in other words the least water is required per unit dry matter. This does not mean, however, that under these optimum conditions less water is required per plant or per acre. In fact, it appears to mean just the reverse. For example, as you add manure to an infertile, unproductive soil, you may greatly reduce the water required per unit dry matter produced, but at the same time you also actually increase the total amount of water transpired. The ratio of water loss to dry weight is lower because the plants grow in a more normal manner. Anything below the optimum fertility approaches a pathological condition. In this condition the plants lack the thrift and vigor characteristic of a fertile soil, and con - sequently the elaboration of carbohydrates and the accumulation of dry matter are less for a given water usage. The plants grow more luxuriantly in fertile soil, having a greater leaf-area, and consequently each plant requires a greater total amount of avail - able water. Under conditions where the rainfall is limited, what would be the result of adding fertility? It would not mean that the plants could endure dry weather better by requiring less water, but it would mean a greater total water requirement per plant, and the crops would tend to withstand the shortage of moisture less well than if no fertility had been added. The addition of manure to an infertile soil would not appear to offer any hope of growing crops in territories too dry to grow crops without it, by virtue of reducing the amount of water consumed by the individual plant, as is commonly stated, for in fact the total transpiration would be increased. Thus, in regions of limited rainfall where corn is now grown but suffers from lack of moisture, an application of manure or other fertilizer might be expected to cause even greater injury from a lack of moisture provided the same rate of planting was practiced, thus giving a greater total vegetable growth and greater leaf-area per acre from which water would evaporate. COMBINATION OF INCREASED FERTILITY AND REDUCED RATE OF PLANTING. There is one manner suggested by these experiments in which this reduced water requirement in the production of dry matter by the plant due to increased fertility may be taken advantage of under the above conditions of limited available moisture. If the plants were spaced farther apart upon the land so that a thinner stand would exist even after the greater amount of stool - ing which usually follows a reduced rate of planting has taken place, relatively more water would be available in the soil for the </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. amount of growth it supports. Manure might then be applied, thereby combining for the individual plant a greater abundance of moisture and a greater production per unit water transpired resulting from increased fertility. There would doubtless be a counter tendency for more water to be lost by evaporation directly from the soil surface when the stand is reduced because of less protection given by the crop. This loss, however, would not be equal to the additional amount made available for the individual plant, and we might by such means hope to increase the efficiency of the total water available. But the writer believes that this increase of water efficiency is not due to any effect of the denser soil solution upon transpiration as a plant function, but simply to a more responsive growth of the plant. This would eliminate the conception that feeding the plant a more concentrated soil solution (or thick soup, as it is sometimes called) diminishes the need for, and actual amount of, transpiration. It has been a very common experience of farmers in Nebraska and many other regions, that during relatively dry seasons, corn on alfalfa sod, except on irrigated or subirrigated land, produces a lower yield than on land which has not been in alfalfa. As is commonly said, "the corn burned up." The reason for this is twofold. (1) An old stand of alfalfa dries out the subsoil more than any other crop, and consequently a shortage of moisture exists for the corn to begin with. (2) Because of increased avail - able fertility, corn on alfalfa sod makes a greater vegetative growth, having a greater leaf surface exposed to the climatic evaporation factors. As a result, there is a greater demand for moisture than on less fertile soil. This combined smaller supply of water and greater demand results in reduced yields during dry seasons. This difficulty could probably be overcome in a large measure, and the benefit of the increased fertility taken advantage of, by planting the corn at a thinner rate on alfalfa sod. Where corn is grown at the rate of three plants in hills 3.5 feet apart on normal soil, a stand of approximately two plants per hill should be suitable for rich alfalfa sod. Listing corn on very fertile soil suggests itself as a rational practice. Listing tends to reduce or stunt the vegetative growth without proportionately reducing the ear development, and there - by less vegetative surface is exposed to the action of a drying atmosphere. Another suggestion of possible practical value under semiarid conditions is that of Cunningham (1914) to space the corn rows twice as far apart as is commonly practiced, with double the normal number of plants in the row. The principle involved is that the plants will be reduced in vegetative growth because of </seg>
            <seg id="p203">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 203 competition, and the roots may continue to grow into the moister soil between the rows. Our experimental data concerning the effect of increased fer - tility also suggest that it may be practicable on very fertile soil to grow a smaller variety of corn. The increased fertility will result in production at a relatively low water cost, while the total amount of water transpired will be held within reasonable limits by avoiding a luxuriant vegetative growth. These suggestive methods appear encouraging and are deserving of thoro investi - gation in practical field tests. Our experience would indicate that much corn is planted at too thick a rate. The reduced yields from the thicker rates are due primarily, under our conditions, to a shortage of moisture, and secondarily to a shortage in available fertility for so large a number of plants. Farmers in the drier regions of the Great Plains area have recognized this principle and their rate of seeding is markedly lower than is practiced in more humid sections. Ordinarily the reduction in total water used will not be propor - tional to the reduction in stand, because of greater vegetative growth when plants are more favored. MOISTURE CONTENT OF SOIL The fact that a shortage of moisture below the optimum for the individual plant reduces the total water requirement and some - what reduces the water requirement per unit dry matter of crop has no great practical value for application. This reduction can - not be brought about without a reduction in yield. Soil with a surplus of moisture needs drainage. An over - abundance of soil moisture reduces the yield. This is doubtless due to some injurious effect which decreases the amount of available fertility. Under irrigation, there is no advantage in applying a surplus of water. Water will not take the place of soil fertility, nor is the common saying true that fertility may replace water. Increased fertility merely causes a more responsive growth, which is a factor in plant nutrition and not in transpiration. An excessive application of water results in a greater amount being transpired per unit dry matter produced than under optimum moisture content, but this is due, in part at least, to a less normal growth. The largest total amount is used under optimum soil moisture, when the largest yield is also harvested. There may be a large variation in the water content without materially affecting the growth relationships. Thus, the lowest soil saturation conducive to maximum growth is the most practical, for then less water is lost by surface evaporation than with a wetter soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. CLIMATIC FACTORS. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that the water require - ments vary greatly with the climate. A low annual rainfall in a region with a cool, humid, "wind-still" climate would go as far as a much larger rainfall in a region where the air, at least during the growing season, is dry, hot, and windy. This is due to a lower value of the climatic water-dissipating influences. In re - gard to this, Briggs and Belz (1910) show in connection with studies of Shantz (1911), that the natural vegetation is a good index to crop production as related to climate. Short grass, con - sisting chiefly of buffalo grass and grama grass, is typical of semi - arid conditions, such as found in the Great Plains area of the United States. A strip of short grass extends from Montana to Texas, limited on the west by drouth and on the east by compe - tition with other grasses. In Montana the annual rainfall is 14 inches, while in Texas it is 21 inches. The difference of 7 inches in rainfall represents the additional amount of rainfall needed to offset the increased evaporation. Thus, we see that the necessary supply of available water for crop production cannot be measured by the rainfall without also knowing the evaporation rate, which Briggs and Belz (1910) have shown to vary from 24 to 72 inches annually from a free water surface in different parts of this country. Prospective settlers should keep in mind that in regions of low annual rainfall and high evaporation rate, the transpiration rate is also very high, working double hardships for crop production. In some sec - tions, the evaporation rate is subject to great temporary ac - celeration from strong hot winds. A few hours of hot winds, coming as they are apt to do in periods of drouth, seem to be more fatal to crops, particularly corn, than are as many days of drouth minus the hot winds. The evaporation from a shallow free water surface is affected by atmospheric conditions in a manner rather similar to the evapora - tion from the plant. Thus, knowing the free water evaporation during the growing season may be an index as to the relative amounts of water transpired in crop growth in any given locality. This explains why crops may be grown in the Northwest on lower rainfall than in the south central portion of the United States. A knowledge of the evaporation rate of a region is almost as important as to know the rainfall. The new meteorological term, "effective precipitation," covers this combination of factors. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 205 ADAPTATION OF PLANTS. The production of plants adapted to meet the requirements for a low transpiration rate offers a field of great possibilities. Under this may be included the testing and selection of estab - lished varieties already well adapted, and also the selection, with - in a variety, of strains possessing certain characters, or the creation by breeding of new characters correlated with low relative water consumption. It is well known that some plants are especially adapted to dry and others to humid conditions. For instance, the grain sorghums are well suited for dry farming. Just what characters fit them for this purpose is not fully known. Results with two of these crops, Milo and Amber sorghum, reported in this bulletin indicate that these crops do not have a lower water requirement in the production of dry matter than does corn under favorable moisture conditions. The work to date has been too limited to draw final conclusions. It may be pos - sibje that these dry land agricultural plants approach the con - dition of the desert plants described by Fitting (1911), which possess a high osmotic pressure and are able as a consequence to extract moisture from a comparatively dry soil in which the water films are very thin. Experiments have now been planned which should give definite information concerning this. It is evident from relative histological studies of the leaves of several sorghums and corns that the former have no special leaf structural adapta - tion for reducing the transpiration below that of corn. It has been observed under field conditions that sorghums appear to possess the power of entering into a more or less dormant stage when growth conditions become very unfavorable, as in time of a very dry spell, and renew growth without having been greatly injured when rains come. A plant possessing this power would have a great advantage. Frequently, under Nebraska conditions, several days of very severe dry, hot, windy weather may greatly reduce the yield of corn, because the evaporation rate is more rapid than the roots can supply, due to low soil-moisture content, and the corn plant is unable to go thru such a period without injury. It is these few outstandingly severe days that are espec - ially injurious to most crops. Merely to know the water requirement per pound of dry matter is not necessarily an index as to whether a crop is suited to drouth conditions. A kind of crop with a relatively high water require - ment per pound of dry matter may normally produce a small tonnage per acre, and consequently the total water transpired be no higher than with another kind of crop having a relatively low water requirement. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. It appears that the best means of securing crops definitely suited to dry fanning conditions is actually to grow and compare them under those conditions. WEEDS. One of the most practical cultural treatments which a farmer can give his crops is the reduction of weeds. Weeds require water and fertility the same as does the crop, and where a shortage of moisture exists the crop is certain to suffer from the presence of weeds. Weeds use moisture in proportion to their number and Fig. 24. — A field of corn which had been robbed of moisture by sunflowers and pig weeds. 1914. size. Wild sunflowers grown in these experiments consumed as much moisture individually as an entire hill of three large corn plants. WATER USED PER ACRE. Experience with potometer and field tests would indicate that caution must be taken in applying the results from potometer studies to general farm practice. It is impossible to estimate from potometer experiments the exact amount of water used per acre by a given crop under field </seg>
            <seg id="p207">Transpiration as a Factor in Crop Production. 207 conditions. The amount of available soil fertility, soil moisture, and other conditions in potometers never are and probably can - not be made to be strictly comparable to field conditions. This fact does not, however, prevent the establishment of general principles concerning the response of the plant to variable con - ditions under control in potometers nor concerning the relative water requirement of different crops. (1) It was seen in Table 1 that as an average for four years the potometer plants had 5 per cent greater leaf-area and weighed 21 per cent more than the average of plants grown in the field at the rate of two plants per hill or 7,112 plants per acre, during three years, and three plants per hill during one year. Assuming that a corn plant in the potometers used as an average the same amount of water &lt; 132 kilograms) as was used by a corn plant in the field spaced two plants per hill, in hills 3.5 feet apart, we find that an acre of such c &gt;rn would use 9.14 acre-inches of water. It is fairly certain that the total amount of water used per plant would not be greater under field conditions than the above figure. With the customary rate of three plants psr hill, the total water transpired per acre would doubtless be greater, altho not proportional to the increase in the number of plants unless sufficient available fertility and soil moisture were present to support fully the increased number. The increased self-protection of a thicker stand would probably tend to reduce transpiration. (2) The 5-year average water requirement per pound of ear, as given in Table 31, is seen to be 629 pounds. Allowing 16 per cent for cob, we have a water requirement of 750 pounds per pound dry weight of grain. Assuming a 50-bushel yield of moisture - free grain, 1,050 tons or 9.3 acre-inches of water would be used, which is practically the same result as obtained by the previous method of calculation. The actual average yield of moisture-free corn at the Experiment Station during the past five years has been 37 bushels per acre, grown three plants per hill. According to the method just discussed, this yield would have had a water require - ment of 6.9 acre-inches. This amount is evidently too low, since it does not take into consideration the water used by barren stalks, which are ordinarily rather numerous. The proportion of ear to stalk was also lower in the field than in the potometers. The average yield of moisture-free corn at the Experiment Station during 13 years has been 46 bushels per acre. (3) The amount of water used in the production of a given yield of grain in potometers cannot be applied directly to the grain yield under field conditions without qualifications, because there are so many variable factors, all of which affect the water requirement. </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 6. We would probably not be far wrong in estimating the average water requirement of corn in eastern Nebraska at 9 inches of rainfall, which amount fluctuates greatly, of course, in different years. The average annual precipitation in eastern Nebraska is approximately 28 inches, two-thirds of which is lost in ways other than by transpiration from the corn crop. </seg>
