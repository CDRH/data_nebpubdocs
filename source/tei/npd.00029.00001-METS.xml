Aldrich, Governor: K respectfully submit the following report on the work of this office e annual period ended this date: INSPECTIONS. Ederal law requires that an inspection of the National Guard be annually by officers of the U. S. Army, also by officers of the al Guard. I The inspection for the War Department was made by Captain John Heavey, in January and February. Such inspections are made to rtain if the National Guard is organized, armed, and equipped for ice in the field; and the result was satisfactory In this respect. A detailed report of the attendance at this inspection is shown in General Order No. 6, herewith. ■There were present 1004 commissioned and enlisted, absent 323, an ■egate of 1327. Thus 24 per cent of the membership was absent from inspection. ■By way of comparison, the 1910 inspection showed, present 914, absent an aggregate of 1174, of which 16.7 per cent were absent. I The state inspection was made by Major Louis H. Gage, Chief of nance, in October, November, and December, and showed satisfactory litions. A detailed report of the Inspection is shown in General &gt;rs No. 21, herewith. ■ This inspection showed, present 1136, and absent 448, aggregate 1488. rhich 30.1 per cent were absent. ■In comparison, the 1910 state inspection showed, present 1172. absent aggregate 1427, of which 25 per cent were absent. ■The absentees vary according to the number temporarily away from e station on business, in school, etc. CAMPS OK INSTRUCTION. E annual camp of instruction of the entire guard of the state, asacm - i brigade, was held near Bellevue, September 27 to October 6. for report of which I refer you to the reports of officers in command, d herewith. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 TARGET PRACTICE. P;ars an annual state camp of target practice has been tils from the various companies participated. With the ore men to practice, such state camp was abandoned • companies encouraged to do more shooting at home rs and men being allowed two days' pay for actual par - small allowance made for rent and equipment of the I The result is that 486 officers and men fired with the rifle this year. gainst 231 last year, and the "figure of merit" was raised from 16.58 to 1. The total expenditures for this purpose were practically the arnmm hat for carrying on of a state camp the previous year. ARMY MANEUVERS IN TEXAS The mobilization of troops of the regular army in southern Texas dur- ing the early part of the present year afforded the War Department oppor- tunity to invite the states to detail a few officers there to participate in Joint encampment, maneuver, and field instruction, and under whch author- ization the following officers participated Lieut. Col. W. E. Baehr 1st Regiment Major C. W. Walden Medical Corps Major H. J. Paul 2d Regiment Capt. I. S. Johnson 1st Regiment Capt. Henry A. Jess Signal Corps Capt. C. E. McCormick 2d Regiment Capt. C. H. Johnson 2d Regiment Capt. Chas. A. Bull 2d Regiment These officers made reports on same, printed copy of which is handed you with this CHANGES IN COMPANIES KA machine gun company had been maintained at Beatrice for the past years, but were not supplied with complete equipment, and the guns i an old style, caliber 30, Gatling. ■This company was made up of an exceptionally good personnel, and it desired to change It into a battery of fi»ld arlilierv The War Department stood ready to provide the equipment, but they required that the state provide a good armory, also a paid caretaker. Aa our present funds were not such as would provide for this, coupled with the fact that Beatrice was already maintaining an infantry company, the company was mustered out September 22, 1911. Ee Second Regiment Band, Kearney, having lost a number of its rs, including the leader, by reason of non-residence, was mustered y 24. 1911 </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 Rusbvllle, having been mustered out in 1910, new companies in their stead were mustered, Company H at Osceola on May 25, 1911, and Company I at Auburn on August 23, 1911. NEW DEPARTMENTS. Irhe desire of the War Department, that the states organize their mili - forces as near as possible similar to the regular army, resulted during past year in the organization of an ordnance, also a medical depart- Ee officers who had been on the staffs of the brigade and regimental nders as inspectors of small arms practice were transferred to the ce department, and ull medical officers, including those appointed to aces, were transferred to the medical department. PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS. The IT. S. Army physical standard for recruits has long been in effect, but had not been fully carried out until the past year, when the system of requiring a physical examination before enlistment was adopted, and is now being carried out. Pbe examinations are made by our medical officers, where such reside i home stations of companies, and by civilian physicians, at other , for which pay is made at U. S. Army rates, viz., $1 for single exami - is, and 50 cents for each additional examination made at the same Eie result is that we now feel sure our officers and men are physically tent, and that the War Department will no longer criticise us in this t METAL ARMORY LOCKERS. Ehe urgent need of improvement in company armories led to the tw - ig of all companies, with the exception of the First Regiment Band, metal lockers during the past year. A total of 1442 lockers were ed, at a cost of $8037.62. Els believed that this will result in a saving of property, and enable cere to enforce the laws which require that all property be kept in lories at all times U. S. ARMY OFFICERS DETAILED. Eir some years the Federal law has provided for the detail to state* ired officers of the army as military advisers, under which law n Robert L. Hamilton has been on duty since April 4, 1910.

            <seg id="p030">30 STATE OF NEBRASKA, The Adjutant General's Office. Lincoln, December 9, 1911 General Orders No. 1» 1. With sorrow the Commander-in-Ohief announces the death of ex-Gov. Albinus Nance, which occurred December 6. 1*11, in Chicago, 111. II. Gov. Nance was born at LaFayette, Stark county, 111., March 30, 1848. His early education was acquired in the public schools of his native town. At the age of sixteen he enlisted in the 9th 111. Cav. for the Civil War, and served until its close, participating in all the battles in which his regiment was engaged, including those at Guntown, Hurri - cane Creek, Franklin, Tupelo, Spring Hill, Columbia, and Nashville, Tenn., and in the latter was wounded. At the close of the war he attended school at Knox College, Gales - burg, 111., and later studied law. In 1871 he settled on a homestead in Polk county, Nebraska; later he took up the practice of law in Osceola; his genius and ability were soon recognized and he became one of the foremost lawyers of the state. In 1874 and again in 1876 he was elected a member of the state legislature, and became speaker of the house, in which capacity he became a popular and capable leader. In 1878 and again in 1880 he was elected governor, and at the close of his four years' service as such, in 1883, he retired from the gubernatorial chair when but thirty-four years of age, leaving a record for good management of public affairs, creditable alike to himself and his state, which he served so well in this, its formulative period. It was while serving his second term as governor, that, having seen the necessity of the organization of a state militia, he made recommendation to the state legislature that resulted in the organization of the 1st Regt , Nebraska National Guard, in 1881. III. Armories will be draped in mourning for the next thirty days in testimony of respect to the memory of this soldier and statesman. By Order of the Governor, E. H.

In general, a spirit of loyalty and patriotism exists that would allow them to willingly take up such duty. "Practically all companies still have on hand a supply of the old blue clothing. In but few companies is this uniform worn or even issued, in most cases it being packed in boxes and stored away. Arrangements sbouid be made to relieve company commanders of this accountability. Property rooms are, as a whole, small, and already taxed to the limit, and the storing of these uniforms only takes up that much room which might be advantageously used for storing and arranging other equipment. P Property and equipment ts generally well and properly oared for. In • instances, however, this is not true, and in these few cases the fault oubt lies with the company commander who has not instructed his in its care and who is probably careless and neglectful himself. "Rifles, in tfie majority of companies, do not receive the care and attention that should be given them. In some companies no attempt was made to clean them for inspection, and their condition was positively dis - graceful, it appearing that a good many had not been cleaned or oiled since the return of the company from camp. K "Spare parts have become broken and have never been replaced, r and throng cases are missing. A large per cent of the rifles were equipped with the front sight covers. These front sight covers are iidered an appendage to the rifle, are issued for protection to front t. and rifles should be equipped with them at all times. ■ o et a ■X ~ &lt; &lt; 0- i 0 19 19 56 33.9 34 45 </seg>
            <seg id="p039">39 as often as is necessary and the rifles repaired and kept in a serviceable condition at all times. "All arms not in use by members of a company should be thoroughly cleaned and given a coat of cosmic. Those issued should be given more attention; and an inspection at least once each month, with a small prixe offered for the rifle in the cleanest condition, would create interest in • company, and the results obtained would more than justify the small expenditure made for the prize. t 'Bayonets and scabbards, in a good many companies, seem to have forgotten and as a consequence have become rusty. I "Property is allowed to be taken from the armories, and as a result imes lost and stolen. This is particularly so with reference to cloth - especially olive drab shirts. With the issue of the steel lockers, it is &gt;d that this custom can and WILL be abolished, for it was with this in view that the lockers were purchased and issued to the guard. shortage in olive drab shirts is large, due to the fact that they have 1 issued and carried away from the armories by members of the com - f. If a record of the issue of these shirts had been properly kept, they d be traced and returned, but in few cases has this record been kept, wearing of these shirts at drills, etc., is not necessary, and because of fact that the shortage is so great, I would recommend that all com - r commanders be ordered to have these shirts turned in, when they to be laundered and packed in boxes and issued for camp duty only. t"In a good many companies the record of property and equipment ?d is not properly kept. Articles are issued and properly charged, credits for articles turned in are not posted. As a result the only % a company commander or his quartermaster sergeant has to fall : upon is his memory, and with several members checking in their pnient. or part of it. they are sure to forget Just what equipment each actually did turn in, and do not know whether to believe their own ;s or take the word of one of the members of their company. i "During the past year a loose-leaf property book has been issued, and pany commanders will find it to their interest to put this book into and keep it posted at all times. i"It is a surprise to note that there are carried on the rosters of several panies enlisted men who have removed from the company home ion. Some of these men have removed from the county, others from state, and the addresses of a surprisingly large number are even lown to the commanding officer. Evidently these company com - ders believe in having a large roster, regardless of where the mem - may reside or how often they attend drill. The inspecting officer is le opinion that this is bad policy and should not be done; that mera - of a company who remove from the home station and are not able do not attend drill, should be discharged for non-residence; that it is le best interests of the company, as well as the guard as u whole, to &gt; a company of forty enlisted men and have them all active and inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 mtat soldiers, regular in attending drill, than to have a roster of seventy men with perhaps 50 per cent of them 'dead ones' "During the past year a number of companies have built and equipped ranges near the home station. All of these companies have held rifle camps during the record season and interest in shooting apparently is increasing. "Many companies do considerable gallery shooting during the indoor target season, using the caliber .22 gallery rifle. This work should be carried on by all companies, as it is a training for the men and keeps up interest during the dull winter months when it has a tendency to fall off. "Companies are generally rusty on drill, but this is usually the case during the winter months. This is probably due to the fact that floor ■pace for company drill in the majority of the armories is too small, except for drill in the Manual of Arms. During the summer months, in fact at all times when the weather permits, company drills are generally held out of doors. Where floor space is not sufficient for company drills, company commanders might well devote the time during the winter months to squad drills, having the corporals drill their respective squads, and thus increase the efficiency of these non-commissioned officers. "In the majority of cases armory facilities are fairly good, though the drill halls are. as a whole, small. Some companies have very good quar - ters, others are not satisfactory. Storage facilities are adequate, and by ■■!■( a systematic plan, all companies could properly take care of their property and equipment and it could be neatly arranged and given the care and attention that it should receive. I "Quite a number of companies have furnished club rooms for members le companies. This is considered a good plan, the members become tainted with one another, and an interest is created and kept up which s the company together throughout the year." By Order of the Governor. E.

I accompanied the Signal Corps on all maneu - problems, and was with the captain in making his regular Saturday l&gt;iiriy inspections. I On May 1, Gen. Schuyler's 2d Cav. Brig, was ordered out for re on the following day this brigade went out to the maneuver reserva - at I.eon Springs, twenty-seven miles west of San Antonio, this com - i being attached to Gen. Schuyler's brigade. The march was made in day. At this camp the troops went into bivouac and slept in sh b. Maneuver problems were worked out every day. the signal corps ui; six wireless sets in the field, keeping the different units of the y in communication with each other at all times, at the same time be - in communication with the camp at San Antonio. My tour of duty there was very interesting and instructive, and will help me to further the efficiency of our signal corps. I find that to furnish communication for cavalry branch of the service it is necessary to have wireless sets, because they move so rapidly and so great distance that it would be impossible to pick up the wire after them. ■ The officers of the regular army were very courteous, and did all they d to show and teach us anything we wished to know, or that would be nportance to us. I will make a few remarks that I think will be of importance to the company commanders and officers of the guard: I After being with the regular army for two weeks I find that the Guard ery lax in military courtesies and discipline. The company com der who thinks that military courtesy and discipline are not necessary itstaken, and he will never have a company that will amount to any g. His men should know that an order is an order and must be I find that in the regular army they take great pains to teach the men sanitation and how to take care of themselves. At the San Antonio camp of all the men who were in the hospitals. 90 per cent were there be - cause of accidents. There was no sickness as we often have at our state camp. Men should be taught to live on the government ration, and not fill up on uncooked fruit and soda pop, then report for sick call the next morning. I Every company should have a mess sergeant whose duty it is to look r the cooking and be with the men at mess. Each company should ■ mess tables, thus keeping the men from scattering particles of food iver the company street. » </seg>
            <seg id="p066">66 feet long. One table will seat twenty men. By removing a few nails tables may be folded, the boards being one bundle, and the trusses the other. In all it will not weigh over seventy-five pounds. Every company should be provided with, or make an incinerator near the kitchen, for burning rubbish and slop. They may be made in a dozen different ways, and it would be cheaper to buy wood than to have this rubbish and slop hauled away. There would be no cans with the lids off and the slop running over, and drawing flies. Company commanders should see to it that the uniform is worn prop - erly, that it is kept in a neat and clean condition. When wearing a blouse it must be buttoned at all times, the hat or cap to be worn square on top of the head, and not cocked on the back of the head, and never al - lowing men to wear suspenders when not wearing the blsjuse, belts to be used to support the trousers or bret&lt; I The quartermaster department should provide cots for the Guard, i sleeping on the ground do not rest well, many complain of stiff neck use back.

Very respectfully, HENRY A. JESS, Captain Commanding Co. A, Signal Corps, Nebraska National Guard. Stanlon, Nebr., April 24, 1911. The Adjutant General, Lincoln, Nebraska. I Sir — Pursuant to your Special Order received at Fort Sa.-i Houston. , I herewith submit the following report of my observations made at Maneuver Camp at San Antonio, Tex., April 4 to April 18, 1911. al - gh my observations are only up to April 14th. as I was called home on date to a brother-in-law's funeral. I left Stantcn, Neb., April 2, reported to the Chief of Staff, Lieut Col. Ladd. April 4, 4:00 p.m., and was assigned to Capt. Guy G. Palmer. Co. A. 18th Inft., 1st Brig., for duty. K found this regiment located in a draw, and the recent rains had made real mud-hole, so I dare say both officers and men of this regiment been working hard, and were anxious to move onto higher ground, h they did the next Saturday, of which I will mention later in this April 5, getting located. ■On the morning of the 6th, accompanied my captain through the com - r inspection, also in office tent » here he signed the morning report and </seg>
            <seg id="p067">67 officers with this regiment assembled at headquarters, where Major Nel - son, 18th Inft., gave us a talk on camp sanitation, and afterwards took us through a tew company streets and kitchens, where our attention was called to the extensive use of lime, and also the new collapsible range, which is much easier to handle and gives quicker service than the ones we have in the National Guard. The rock incinerators were also ex - plained: A trench 6 or 7 feet long and about 3 feet wide, sloping down to about a foot and a half at one end is dug. Rocks that were gathered were then placed on sides und bottom, and on the man h iron bars are placed across and cooking done that way, but in camp used for heating water, and a fire is kept going all the time, as all liquids and solids were thrown in the trench, and in that way got rid of. As a rule, I do not think the kitchens were kept as clean as in a National Guard camp. In the forenoon of the 7th was with my captain through squad and company drills. The men were mostly recruits, and drilling was not very good. In the afternoon the National Guard officers were marched over to the field bakery by Capt. Holbrook. Here there were nine knock-down ovens in operation that turned out over MM loaves per day — enough for the entire division. Capt. Holbrook stated that the government had an order for 59 such ovens at an iron work company in St. Louis, at a price of $ • each, in the field, one for each regiment. I have an extra &lt;opy of the bread making subject, which you will find enclosed, and which will explain it better than I am able to. Iaturday, April 8. we were up extra early, as we were to move. The had been paid the day before and everything moved slowly; how we got to our new camp by a late dinner. It seemed as if the regi - were short on wagons and teams, only one for each company. They o make several trips, the distance being only a quarter of a mile, march much of this stuff would have been left, such as gun racks, ixes, etc. In the afternoon rain prevented us from doing anything. Sunday, April 9, was a cold, rainy day. and nothing doing. fpril 10. No drill today on account of vaccination, and in the after - lecture by Capt. Herron, 18th Inft., on field orders.

The 3d Field Art. consisted of 6 batteries, 24 3-inch field guns and necessary officers, enlisted men, and horses. Medical personnel: One major surgeon, 2 assistant surgeons. 1 sergeant, first class: four. privates, Hosp Corps, same being assigned from Field Hosp. No. 38 for duty with the 3d Field Art.; Regimeutal Field Infirmary. Camp Sanitation: About 10 to 12 feet from each battery kitchen I ob - served a method to do away with liquid and solid garbage effectually and promptly, which deserves special mention. A trench 5 or 6 feet long, and about 2 feet wide is dug, sloping down to 18 inches or 2 feet at one end, paved at the bottom, sides, and ends, with boulders, or stones, which were usually found around the camps. A grate made of l^-inch wagon tire is placed over the trench. A fire Is kept burning in this trench, the stones becoming hot; the liquid, when placed at the upper end of the trench, evaporates instantly, and the solids burn quickly. Tin cans, bot - tles, and rubbish are thrown in also. In the permanent camp at Fort Sam Houston, wagons remove the ashes once a day. On the march, trenches are covered with loose earth, and new ones dug as occasion requires. Sev - eral days prior to my tour of duty, officers of our organization were ex - perimenting with a jug form of incinerators, which they were of the opinion would be more satisfactory than the trench. I Latrines: The ordinary trench latrine was used, covered by a box seat lid. Each day at 8:00 a.m. the boxes are removed and trenches led out with hay saturated with crude oil, and the sides were white - led with lime. In each sink a large garbage can was placed, in which men urinated. This was also emptied and whitewashed. This form itrine was used in the permanent camp at Fort Sam Houston. In the maneuvers the trench incinerators were also used as described, and for latrine made of pole and cross pieces at each end, in place of box a, the same care being given them. On May 13, the undersigned, with the other National Guard officers who were assigned to the 3d Field Art., submitted to the anti-typhoid in - oculation, and report that on some it was rather sickening in its effect*: with others it simply caused a soreness of the joints, accompanied by a slight rise in temperature. Outside of a slight inconvenience of ill feeling for 36 hours, it is not annoying and of no danger whatever, at least so claimed by Maj. J. B. Allen, U. S. A., with whom I was on detail he stat - ing he had vaccinated some 4,500 men since March while in camp, with no bad effects.

I was attached to the Adjutant of the 15th Inft.. 1st Bug.. The entire division was ordered to break camp the following morning, when they were planning to start out to the government reservation, but owing to a heavy rain that night the march pas postponed until Saturday morning. The 1st Brig., consisting of the 11th, ISth, and 15tn regiments of infantry, with two machine gun sections attached to each regiment, started about 7 a.m. and covered a distance of about thirteen miles by 1:20 p.m., marching fifty minutes and resting ten of each hour. A few of the things brought to my attention at this time were first: the quick work made by the 15th Inft. in breaking or making camp, owing to the systematic squad work of each company. Every squad has a pre - scribed duty, as soon as they arrive on the ground, such as wood squad, cook squad, baggage squad, etc. This particular day we noted that six minutes from the time the baggage train arrived, the cook shacks were all up and smoke was coming out of the stacks. The lack of sufficient trans - portation facilities was quite noticeable. Every man went as light as possible, equipped for field service, and even with the baggage reduced it was about all the wagons could do to handle it. Two of the wagon wheels broke during the trip, and as no extra wheels are provided for such emergencies, it caused delay and inconvenience. The march to the reservation was resumed the following morning (Sun - day) about 7:15. arriving there about noon, covering a distance of twelve </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 very good, only one or two dropping out. The principal trouble with the men on these hikes is blistered feet, whic h are usually treated at once by painting them with iodine and using adhesive plasters. The location of our camp was a very desirable one, being well drained, shaded, and near the water supply. The division was divided Into three camps on the reservation, two or three miles apart, the largest number of troops being at the target range, the 3d Field Art. being at Well No. 7, and oar brigade was located at Louis' Ranch, the troops being divided ac - cording to the water supply at these respective places. Artesian wells furnished the water supply. Although it was known that the water supply was not sufficient for men and animals, they did not use the spring water for the horses, whk*h was near the '-amp. This water was pronounced all right for su&lt; h purposes by the surgeons. The grazing was excellent on the reservation but the principal forage used for the horses was baled hay. which was bought and hauled to camp. There also seemed to be an abundance of wood all around us, but they were buying wood and having it hauled in. I The individual company incinerators were used, and, I think they Id be practical In all cases, if wood for fuel could be procured. « incinerators are usually built ai the rear or side of the cook shark, are made by digging a hole about three feet in diameter and about feet deep, lined with rock, sloping down toward the center. A slow I fire is kept burning and all food scraps and dish water is poured in , the hot rocks causing the water to evaporate and all scraps are ed up. Upon arriving in camps, latrines were dug at once, and they ilways left open until the last thing before breaking camp. Euring our stay on the reservation, our forenoons and part of the oons were taken up with the maneuver problems, which were very ctive in many ways, such as practical map reading, handling of the the positions of defense and attack selected, the handling of field I, establishing sights for dressing stations, etc. Esually lectures were given in the afternoons for the Denefit of the officers on the problem of the forenoon, and such subjects as map ig, camp sanitation, etc., which were helpful. Among the things impressed on us in our lecture on camp sanitation was the necessity of the men washing their hands just before eating MM, for the prevention of typhoid, as this is one of the best ways to prevent the typhoid bacilli from entering the system. It has also been proven that the using of the anti-typhoid serum has greatly diminished the percentage of typhoid cases in the army. irhe band, which is an important part of the regimental organization. lome of the troubles that we have in our National Guard bands, aa necessary for them to pay many of their musicians extra pay out of egimental fund, in order to keep their band up to the proper stand The 15th Inft. have an excellent band, and is cne that any regiment justly be proud of. </seg>

KSir — I have the honor to submit the following report of my detail to Maneuver Camp, near San Antonio. Tex., and the following is the re - of my observations, and by questioning what I was able to bring out, in my opinion would be ot" use to the Guard of our state. I left my home station May 25 at 4:00 p.m., and arrived at San An - tonio, Texas., at 7:40 a.m. on the 27th. Reported to Col. Ladd at Division Headquarters, Maneuver Camp, at 9:00 a.m. and was mustered and ordered to report to commander of the 3rd Brig, in person. Reported to 3rd Brig. Headquarters, was met by one of Gen. Hoyt's aides, who In - formed me that the general was not there just then. He, however, as - signed me to the 17th Inft., attached to Lieut. Col. Territt, to whom I reported at 10:45 a.m. I was assigned to a tent and was then informed that owing to the fact that a division review was to be held that afternoon and all but one wagon was ordered to be in line, that it would In all probability be quite late in the evening before my baggage would arrive at the camp. It was suggested that as long as there was nothing of im- </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 portance that day, and the next day being Sunday, with nothing but the routine camp duties, that I might employ myself in looking around the camp and surroundings. I went to the quadrangle in the afternoon and •elected a mount. I had been informed that mounts ranged in price from $2 to $5 per day, and found this to be correct. The mounts offered for |2 per day would not have brought in any market in the world to exceed $35 per head. After looking over about thirty head, I finally selected one at a rental of $3 per day, which proved to be a fair mount. I then wit - nessed the division review, which was interesting from the standpoint of the number of men in line and the rarity ol these ceremonies It afforded no instruction, simply following the lines and principles in Drill Regulations. Went down to the city, where I remained for the night. Re ported to the camp the next morning, and, nothing doing, returned to town, where I spent the time in making acquaintances with National Guard officers from other states and discussed to a considerable extent the methods of company administration a* was being practiced by the different company commanders. I cannot say that I learned anything new from this, as most of the schemes for the betterment of their com - panies had either been tried out by companies in our state or are now being tried. The general consensus of opinion seemed to be that what was one company's salvation would not apply at all to another, and for that reason a hard and fast rule would not apply. I did not talk with or hear of a single guard officer that was not heart and soul in favor of the National Guard pay bill. Remained in the city all night and re - ported to camp again at 6:00 a.m. Monday. I Being informed by Lieut. Col. Territt that there was nothing special forenoon, I went over to where Maj. Baker was drilling and instruct - the Hospital Detachment, this consisting of picking up wounded, ying by litter, loading in wagon, use of the first aid packet, bandag - and use of splints on compound and simple fractures, shell injuries, •r cuts and rifle shots.

National holiday. Accompanied Maj. Baker, at my request, on tour of inspection of the camp. There was nothing much In this except the "pit incinerator," one for two companies. A de - ption of this incinerator is given on page 137. I consider this to b« superior to any method we have ever used, and I heartily recom - d its use in our camps in the future for the following reasons: doing away with the garbage can and the transportation of garbage rad the limits of the camp; the almost instantaneous disposition of se of the kitchen, also the slops, leaving no place for the roosting or ding of flies. For camps of 10 days or more I would recommend in- </seg>
            <seg id="p075">75 cinerators of this kind, which I was informed was a product of th&gt; gineers. Take two lime barrels and i-aw them in two equal parts in the middle, then place them so that when a coal oil or petroleum barrel simi - larly cut will rest on the large ends and the entire surface covered with about 12 or 14 inches of clay. Then place inside the openings of the barrel halves some wood and burn out slowly, this will allow the baking of the clay and make it hard enough to withstand wear and tear. The advantages of this incinerator are that the refuse put into it will go on the center of the flre and cannot lie around the edges as sometimes happens in the open incinerator, and the economy of fuel. Found the cook houses and latrines in excellent condition. A point particularly noticeable was the absence of flies or any refuse that they could breed In. Wednesday: Muster in the morning. Nothing new in this. This regi - ment has been equipped with the new pack and seems to give a great deal of satisfaction, as it is a great improvement over the old Idea of the blanket roll. I took the liberty of questioning quite a few old soldiers on this question and found that they were practically unanimous in the opin - ion that it was a big improvement out the old idea. I, however, learned that they were also of the opinion that the pack needed some readjust - ment for the reason that when the pack was loaded with the full equip - ment, including the ammunition that the balance was nearly perfect, but. under the conditions, as at camps, etc.. the pack had a tendency to hang too much on the back and made the man establish a new equilibrium that was, or proved on marches, to bo quite tiresome. After muster the National Guard officers reported to Brigade Headquarters and were es - corted to Field Hosp. No. 4. We were directed around the hospital by an officer who explained the different features very carefully. There was nothing new in this except the method of accounting for the property of the sick or wounded men who arrived at the hospital, which briefly is as follows: As each man arrives, his property is checked and be is given a duplicate of the check, and when the man leaves, his receipt is taken, when the property is returned to him. This prevents many claims of lost property. Each tent is under the supervision of a non - commissioned officer or private, and he is held responsible for the police and the linen, and if he fails to watch and a nuisance is committed, he is obliged to take care of it himself, or tf he permits any linen to be lost he is held responsible. The linen is changed evry Saturday forenoon. No operations here, although they have the equipment for it, also no serious cases accepted. A doctor makes an examination of each patient immeJi ately on arrival before being taken from the wagon, and if it is a serious case, it is sent at once to the base hospital. From there we were con - ducted to an ambulance company and shown the new ambulance, this also has quite a few improvements over the old style. It is a few Inches wider and is fitted with springs for the lower stretchers. Bn the afternoon at 1:30 we were conducted through the division ry under Capt. Holbrook, who took great pains to explain the work - of this establishment. This was very interesting. I am convinced </seg>

(Data furnished by Capt. Holbrook attached.) I Thursday, June 1: Reported to Brigade Headquarters and waa es - ed to where some artillery were drilling. Here we vere given a • technical talk by ■ lieutenant-colonel and a captain, the lieutenant - mel taking up the disposition and use by map.

He then had a 3-inch field jiece run out went through practically the same things. I consi.ler this to be most technical for the average guardsman (infantry). The main idea that I was that the artillery was the most efficient branch of the service, the iufantry phould work in harmony and conjunction with it End r ability to cover the assault by infantry of the enemy's position to iin 2dO yards, and that they considered it much better to kill a few of own men than to let the enemy do it. I suppose they are right, but a what thought I have put to it I fail to reach the same conclusions. I Friday, June 2: Brigade broke camp at 5:30 a.m. and began march 10, arriving at Bluemells, about eleven miles, at 11:30 a.m. In the luct of the marches the ri'les laid clown in Field Service 1910 was fol - ■d to the letter. In all the inarches that I observed there seemed to onsiderable delay. I wish to commend the system of transportation ogue in the army. 1 marveled at the facility with which camps were en and made, the manner in which the baggage ami impedimenta - loaded and unloaded; no noise, no confusion, nothing lost; in the :h of nearly twenty-five miles 1 observed but one wagon of the brigade i that required to be readjusted. Rested in the afternoon. Saturday, June 3: Broke camp, column cleared camp site at 7:05 a.m. Brigade was delayed by something ahead for about three-quarters of an hour, much valuable time was lost. The day was very hot and the road very dusty. The march was about fourteen miles. Arrived at camp site at 11:35 a.m. I can not help mentioning the manner in which this inarch was, conducted. The laet two miles the pace was accelerated by nearly one mile per hour. This seemed to me to be extremely pour judg - ment on the part of the leading element, causing much unnecessary fatigue to the men. and consequently much dropping out of the column and straggling. The camp, consisting of practically the entire division, waa strung out on the east slope in a valley and extended abcut a mile and three-eighths. Water was supplied from wells, pumped by gas en - gines into tanks and piped along the length of camp, a spigot for each company. I Sunday, June 4: No duty today.

            <seg id="p077">ADJUTANT GENERALS III 77 Monday, June 5: Problem today: Two brigade* try to develop and force a reinforced brigade to withdraw from an intrenched position. Five rounds blank ammunition per man. The criticism of iho umpire on this problem was: Lines too thin, and the ground to ihe front not jroperly covered. My version as follows: In the two regiments I had an oppor - tunity to observe the lines were positively congested, elbow to elbow, and still men trailing in rear that could not find room in the line. This at 800 to 300 yards from the position attacked, and where the line waa halted. This in the final stages would have been perfectly proper, but at the i arises mentioned above and in tlit lace of intrenched troops, mould have been nothing less th;\i! massacre. I vas mu h surprised at 'tie in - ability of the officers to orient, read, aril lDt\it.! themsolve.s on the maps according to orders; overheard a heated Ham into* as to the number of a ;x officers — five opinions. A commend; i&gt;1.&gt; feature of the problem was the u«e of the artillery and the sanitary troops. Did no) see any signal troops or lines of communications until quite a while after the lines of battle were established. The artillery (Mountain Howitzer Battery) was very slow in reporting after being sent for, but when they arrived they went into action promptly and from a very well chosen posi - tion. First aid stations were promptly established and plainly marked as soon as a line of battle was established. I Tuesday, June fi: Problem for today was outpost by regiment, iment left camp at 7:00 a.m. Marched with advance guard to No. established line from 119 to 110. The work in this problem was very mendable, especially the work of the patrols. Wednesday. June 7. The problem today was a marching problem in - volving the arrival by several routes of the columns at certain point* at set time. Third Brigade moved at 7:00 a.m. as right flank guard of main body by road 4-17. Enemy reported 6 miles east of 14. When brigade had cleared camp about one hour orders were received to occupy line from hill 141 to 142, 28th on right, 10th on left, and attack enemy on hill 140. This proved to be another enveloping movement in which the enemy's left was rolled back. Our line was seen from hill 142 extended nearly three miles in the shape of a crescent. The movements of the troops were much better today than any time I have witnessed yet, but I am of the opinion that the firing line is too lieavly loaded before the final stages of the fight. Against a civilized enemy our losses would be so great I doubt whether we would reach him. ■Thursday,. June 8: No problem today.

Eny attempted description of the organization, camp, equipment, sanitary methods, administration and discipline, of the maneuver m, wouli be a repetition of tht text bocks authorized by the War tment. I make the following observations on points that I think would be ot t to the National Guard, although I think the Nebraska National covers very generally the same field of work in camp as the regular lacking most noticeably in precision, and attention to minor details, le theoretical instruction of officers in field work. I The company officers act in executive and supervisory capacities, leav - the preliminary instruction of the men, enforcement of discipline, inistrative paper work, to the non-commissioned officers, thus avoiding tusting drain upon the time of the officers, affording them more time heir studies, and for recreation, a condition we do not experience. K Paper work is simplified and reduced to a minimum, a few little loose books which can be carried in the pocket being sufficient for nearly all company records. Two drills are held daily, both in the forenoon, and of about one hour's duration each, with an interval of one and one-half hours between, leaving the afternoon for the care of the person, clothing, equipment, and camp; parades and reviews in the evening only when ordered, then announced some time in advance. This does not tire the men and exhaust their patience, as does the overcrowded routine of long drills and short intervals, both forenoon and afternoon, followed by unannounced parades or reviews, usually seen in the National Guard camps, leaving the men no time for other duties, either being left undone, or done in the most hurried manner, and necessitating heavy detail* for camp work. I In the army absolutely every person belonging to an organization must nd every drill, except one cook and the non-commissioned officer in •ge of quarters, camp duties being performed by the details in the rvals between drills and in the afternoons. K Another noticeable feature was the anticipation of every duty by the , they always being in place and equipped ready to fall in at the tinted time without any prompting or urging. KThe new system of handling commissary supplies appears very satis - »ry, the commanding officer being, given a cash credit to the value of ration his command is entitled to, he then draws as much of each </seg>
            <seg id="p081">81 article of issue as is needed daily, and it is charged to him at its money value, a small issue book being used for that purpose, and at the end of each month a settlement is made, if less than the credit given him he is paid the balance in cash for the company fund; if more he must pay the excess in cash from the company fund, but this usually results in a saving to the company. No provision is made for the messing of the officers, they being ex - pected to look out for themselves; each Held headquarters generally has its mess. A great many line officers board with their companies, paying a price fixed by the company council. In this way the breaking up of an organization does not disturb the mess of the officers as it does where battalion or regimental messes are organized. I The system of field instruction, by tactical walks and field problems, very instructive, impressing the facts more clearly upon the mind i the studying of the text-books could possibly do alone. Although t time, smaller classes, and confining of classes to certain ranks, making the problems more relative to the student's rank, would have aps been more satisfactory. I The division bakery and hospital are so organized in sections, each plete in itself, that upon the division into its tactical units of the lion, these sections are able to accompany and provide for the differ - units. Kl saw several prolonged flights of the aeroplanes stationed at the camp, think they could be made one of the most valued auxiliaries an army i have for scouting purposes. I The regular officers were all very kind and courteous, always willing cplain anything not fully understood, and to answer any question that it be asked. I Such a detail would be most valuable to any National Guard officer, »g an insight into the military profession that can not be obtained in other way, and which can not be explained or set forth in a written Respectfully, CLYDE E. McCORMIOK Capt. 2d Inft. Regt., N. N. G. Armory Co. K, 2d Inft., Schuyler, Neb., July 20, 1911. ■ Adjutant General of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. K Sir— Pursuant to par. 3, S. O. No. 12, A. G. O., dated Lincoln, Neb.. 31, 1911, I have the honor to submit the following report of my tour uty with the maneuver division of the United States army, near San mio, Tex., June 12 to 26, inclusive. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 Reported to Lieut. Col. W. T. Ladd, Adjt. ■Gen., the division adjutant. Was assigned to Co. C, 11 Inft., 1st Brig. Reported to commanding general of the first brigade, who was the late commander of the Department of Missouri, stationed at Omaha, Neb., Gen. Smith. Thence to the command - ing officer of the 11th Inft., Col. Arthur Williams, thence to the command- Ing officer of Co. C, Lieut. W. C. Russell, to whose company I was attached for my tour of duty. I was furnished a tent and messed with Maj. Lee of the 1st Bat., as did also Lieut. Russell. Maj. H. A. Lee had lately been promoted from captain of Co. C to major of this battalion and was entitled to a separate ■—■, and he very kindly asked me to share it with him. The rations for his mess were drawn through the company, and the cooking was done by the company cook, but there was paid into the company fund by all officers partaking of this mess 50 cents per day per person. Ordinarily the com - pany officers messed in their own quarters, as there was no officers' mess provided for company officers. Rations are drawn for the officers from the government as other rations are drawn, but they must be paid for at the cost price to the government. And this price varies, the allowance per man per day for this month being 22.06 cents, and as I said before, the officers pay 50 cents per day for board, so the difference helps the company fund out a little. The company fund amounts to several hundred dollars in each of the companies, and this is raised from what they can save on government rations, for if they do not use up the amount credited to them they are given the difference in cash. A per cent on the post exchange which amounts to considerable, also a per cent of the receipts' of a com - pany barber, if there be one. ■ The following was the outline of drill work as carried out during my . with some modifications: Monday — Regimental — Minor Tactics. Tuesday— Company — Drill. Wednesday — Battalion — Minor Tactics. Thursday — Company — Minor Tactics. Friday — Company — Drill.

Call to Quarters ■. . . . 9 : 45 p.m. Taps, 10:00 p.m. 1 alternated with the lieutenant in taking the company out for its drills and in taking retreat, reveille, and at parade. The weather was so hot that no long hikes were indulged in while I was there, but the regular drills from 7 to 9 a.m. Then in the afternoon lectures and tactical walks were given which gave me a good chance to ■y the company administration from the standpoint of the regular. In the lectures and tactical walks I found the officers eager to aid me in every possible way to acquire as near a practical understanding of war conditions as it was possible to do. And 1 think the oftener we can be thrown into contact with such men and under such conditions the more we will learn. Saturday, the 14th, the 11th Cav. held a field meet and the regular exercises of that day were suspended so all could attend. It was very good, and I think the introduction of athletics in the regular army has had ■od deal to do in raising the moral standard of the army. The fly problem seemed to be solved In this camp. The construction of the rears were such that they were light proof, and if you can exclude light from these places the flies do not infect them, and this can be done by a little care being used in their construction and where there are cracks cover with heavy canvas. These rears are burned out every morning with ■ e oil and straw, after which they are painted with milk of lime. The kitchens were screened in carefully, and no flies left to congregate here. Open fire incinerators (an excavation lined with stone), one for each company, disposes of all garbage, both liquid and solid, as well as all street </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 ■weepings, etc. These fires are kept burning continually, the liquids poured on to the stones slowly so as to be evaporated, or suspended over the fire in a bucket and left to evaporate, while the solids are put directly into the fire as fast as it is burned up, never smothering the fire, of course. This also helps to eliminate the fly, as there was nothing left around camp to attract the fly. The urinals left in the street at night were also burned out in the morning. One of the very instructive lectures was from the lieutenant of the Machine Gun Platoon. After giving all the instruction possible as to the uses and misuses of the machine gun, in a comprehensive manner, he went further into the use of the pack mule and his place in the service. He had his packer demonstrate to us how to pack an animal and how to care for these pack animals, for it is no easy matter to load one of these animals in a way that he can carry his burden from day to day. These pack mules would be considered in infantry work where it would be impossible to pro - ceed with the wagon train any further on account of the terrain, for these ■■lea can go anywhere almost that a man can go. They are considered a very important part of the equipment. In camps of this kind the garrison ration was the ration used. The baking of bread was done on the ground by the division bakery, and it was handled very well. The commanding officers of each company, the National Guard officers, cooks, and mess sergeants, were all ordered to report at the division bakery one afternoon for instruction in baking, care of ranges, and building clay ovens. The heavy ranges such as we have are condemned on account of their weieht, yet the cooks generally like this kind much better than the light •MB recommended by the department at the present time. The new field range weighs about 200 lbs. and can be easily packed on a pack mule, and this is about all there is in its favor. Some of the army cooks have attended the cooking schools located at •one of the forts and it is a great help to them. The cook for this com - pany had attended the school at Fort Riley, and he did get up a nice meal. It is not very hard to get good service out of a soldier if he is fed well, but on the other hand, if he is not fed well he is one of the worst kickers COlng. And as this is one of the worst problems we as National Guards - men have to contend with, I think it would be a good investment to the state to send some of these men away to a cooking school. The effect, I believe, would soon be noticed in the guard. While a guard was mounted every day, a very light guard was main - tained. It was done by company, immediately after retreat or dress parade. The company designated for guard duty was broken up into ■quads by the first sergeant, and squad leaders designated, then marched out to the parade ground in the rear of the line on which they were to form, then as the sergeant major reaches his position the squads are marched up on line with him, the first sergeant leading with the first ■quad, very much the same as the old way of forming a guard by details. It was done in this way because of the number of new men, I was told. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">85 and they made a better appearance coming up to the line in this way than trying to march up in company front. The non-commissioned officer marched his squad up .on the line, dressed them, saluted the sergeant major, and reported, and then took his place in the rear, except the first sergeant, who took position at the right of the guard, and he was always commander of the guard. The reason given me for this was the lack of officers enough in the companies. In fact very few of the companies la the 11th Inft. had more than one officer on duty with them. I also noted that the old officer of the day never appeared at guard mount, and the reason given was that he might be needed in camp at that time and he was not an essential part to the guard mount. The new officer of the day would find him at the guard house usually, and together they went to the commanding officer and reported as usual. I also witnessed one regiment which is trying out the new regulations under consideration by the staff. The changes will not be great, and they seem very practical ones. I was glad to see the old "Right forward fours right" was going to be used again. The command for it will be "Right (left) "by squads," xf I understood it correctly. In closing, let me add that it is impossible for me to fully express but appreciation of the kind treatment and many courtesies extended to me by all the officers of the 11th Inft. during my stay with them. They gave me every privilege and opportunity to accomplish that for which I had been sent amongst them, assisting me as best they could, and always ready to answer my questions and aid me in every way possible. And if" I have failed to get something from them that will be of benefit to the Nebraska National Guard the fault will be mine, not theirs. Respectfully submitted, CHARLES H.

I The camp was laid out by Maj. M. J. Flaherty, Q M, and all the lable space was utilised to the very best advantage, but on account le limited grounds it was necessary to reduce the distance and inter - between organizations. ■Most of the troops arrived in camp on schedule time, and the de - ling and pitching camp was very satisfactory. ■All of the coaches and baggage cars used by the troops were left in 1 condition except the coach used by the band of the 2d Regiment.

Gen. Smith, U. 8. A., commander of the Department of the Missouri after an appropriate address, presented the above medals, assisted by Maj. Penn, U. 8. A. A problem was given each regiment, and the showing made by the officers and men was very creditable, and the solution, while different in each case, was good. ■A problem was arranged for the brigade by Maj. Penn, but on ac - it of rain it could not be carried out. On the afternoon of October 5, the brigade participated in a military parade in the city of Omaha.

Bhe general police of the camp was good, but there were many i that could have been better. IFhe latrines were constructed by civilians under direction of M*4 - . Flaherty,, and he had a great deal of trouble in getting carpenters jmplete the work. The latrines were not cared for as they should been. The medical officers assigned to the regiments seemed to ? it all with higher authority, and the medical officer assigned to brigade headquarters was absent from camp part of the time and not get in all his reports, so the matter was slow in improving. the work of the Commissary Department needs no comment, for the were provided with an abundance of good food without excessiTe se. On account of the rain the camp was badly cut up by the wagons on breaking camp, and the amp was not left in a very sightly condl- Latrines were filled by civilian detail. I Considerable trouble was experienced in the disposition of the gar - !. The plan was to have the same carted from camp and burned, some companies came to camp without garbage cans, and that fact not known until they had dumped garbage all around the kitchen. RThe battalion quartermasters could have assisted very much in this k, but there was no evidence of any assistance in this or any other termaster duties from the battalion quai termasters that I noticed. The chief medical officer recommended temporary Incinerators, bat on account of a lack of intelligent attention, excessive rain, and a lack of sufficient wood, they were not successful. The Eng. Co. then con - structed a large incinerator, and the garbage was all hauled there and burned. The brigade quartermaster assigned wagons to each regiment for the above work. Guard Duty. Guard duty, with a few exceptions, was very poorly done, and in most cases was performed in an indifferent manner, not so much, I believe, because the men did not want to do the work well, but because many of the officers were either ignorant or negligent in instructing the mem - bers of the guard. ■ In this line of duty there was no marked improvement as in others, was very detrimental to military discipline. KThe military bearing of officers and men while at drills was good, a great deal of interest was exhibited in all drills.

Very respectfully. JOSEPH A. STORCH, Brig. Gen. N. N. G., Comdg. 1st Brigade NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD, FIRST INFANTRY. / Stanton, Neb.. January 6, 1912. i rnt General, Lincoln. Nebraska. Eear Sir — I have the honor to submit the following as my report on ur of duty performed by the 1st Inft., Nebraska National Guard, at John H. Mickey, near Bellevue, Neb., September 27 to October 6, Ive: Pursuant to par. 8, General OrderB No. 15, 1911, A. G. O., I left my hone station, Stanton, Neb., on September 26, 1911, and reported to Brig. Gen Storch at the site of the proposed camp, "early in the morning of September 27," Capt. Kelso, Regimental Quartermaster, reported with me, and we found Capt. Lough, Commissary, already upon the ground. Prior to our arrival, the camp had been surveyed and staked, and latrines were then being constructed, all under the personal directions of the Brigade Quartermaster. In view of the -condition of the grounds assigned to the Bat. Headquarters of the 1st Regt., permission was obtained, and the quarters of battalion officers were removed to the line of regimental oncers, where the ground was more suitable. This removal was approved by the instructor inspector assigned to our command, and also by the commanding officer of the 1st Brigade. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">89 the 1st Regt., detrained on the Burlington railroad near the camp ground, soon had their tentage up and their camps made. Two of the organiza - tions, however, failed to arrive until after 7 o'clock, and in view of the darkness which obtains at this time of year at that hour, were unable to complete the making ot camp until the next forenoon. ■The following was the strength at camp of the organizations reporting luty: Band, 17 enlisted. Co. A, 3 officers, 43 enlisted men. Co. B, 3 officers, 46 enlisted men. Co. C, 3 officers, 64 enlisted men. Co. D, 3 officers; 40 enlisted men. Co. E, 3 officers, 43 enlisted men. Co. G, 3 officers, 41 enlisted men. Co. H, 3 officers, 40 enlisted men. Co. I, 3 officers, 45 enlisted men. Co. K, 3 officers, 43 enlisted men. Co. L, 3 officers, 46 enlisted men. Co. M, 3 officers, 47 enlisted men. ■ These, together with the field and staff officers and non-commissioned era of the regiment, brought up an aggregate present for duty to 49 missioned officers and 532 enlisted men. In view of the season of the year the time this encampment was held, the above figures are certainly deserving o( comment. It is a well-known fact that many of the members of the Nebraska National Guard are high school, college, and university students. There are also a large number of school teachers upon its rolls. The known character of men of this class is such that in case of an emergency when their services were really wanted, they can always be depended upon. They as a class, by reason of their intelligence and quickness to respond to duty, are among our most valuable men. When our encampments are held at the ordinary tlmea, they devote their vacations in part to this work, and thus it involves no pecuniary sacrifice, merely requires them to devote to the service of their country the time which would ordinarily be devoted to pleasure. To have compelled these classes to have left their studies and to have broken up their school work for ten days in camp under the conditions that prevailed last fall would certainly have been a needless hardship and would have entailed unnecessary sacrifice. Therefore, we believe the policy announced by the state of excusing those who were engaged in school work, while it undoubtedly deprived the various organizations of the services of some of their most* valuable men, is certainly to be com - mended and will in the end result in the advancement of the service. In view of those thus necessarily excused, the total of those present at this camp certainly speaks well for the loyalty and faithfulness of the mem - bers of the Nebraska National Guard, there being 49 officers and 532 mem </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 present for duty out of a strength of 50 officers and 655 enlisted men borne on the rolls of the regimental organization. Equipment The various companies were fully equipped as far as tentage was concerned. Each company was supplied with conical wall tents for the enlisted men. hospital tent for a cook tent, and the usual wall tents for officers. With three exceptions the companies' tents were all In good condition. Each company was also supplied with a field range and with the regular assortment of cooking utensils furnished with it. To this statement G Co. must be excepted. G Co. came to camp expecting to be supplied with a proper field range and outfit, but by reason of misunder - standing none had been provided for them. The deficiency was tempo - rarily filled by the purchase of tin boilers, but with the exception of this organization, the entire command was faily well supplied with all that was necessary for camp use. Bin the matter of cooks it may be said the companies were extremely nate, as in almost every instance they were supplied with excellent &gt;, and there was little complaint on the score of insufficient or improp - cooked food. K Every member of the command, with few exceptions (due to an impos - ity to obtain the proper sizes) were supplied with olive drab uniforms, ifncient number of olive drab overcoats were supplied to provide for e on duty as guards. onon I One of the serious problems which the National Guard has had to face been the extreme difficulty of getting commands into camp supplied proper footwear. We feel that substantial progress has been made big direction by the commanding officers of the companies of this nent. In view of the importance of this question we feel it but just we chronicle the success achieved by the company commander along e line*. The following detailed statement discloses the facts as to the footwear In the 1st Nebraska: K. Co., with an aggregate of 46 men in camp, had 41 properly equipped the regulation army shoe. The remaining 5 men all had good, Bub - al shoes, none of which were low cut. IB Co., with 3 officers and 49 men in camp, had 46 of them supplied the regulation army shoe. Of the 3 unsupplied ones, 1 had a substan - pair of black shoes and two were supplied with high top, tan colored, on shoes. (' Co., of Beatrice, was fully equipped, without exception, with shoes which approximated the regulation army shoe. These shoes were of two makes, a russet leather garrison shoe, manufactured by Joseph Herman * Co., and the other the E-Z Walker tan leather shoe, a shoe which, by the way, approximates the regulation army shoe. </seg>
            <seg id="p091">91 members provided with one pair of tan marching shoes. ECo. had 50 per cent supplied with marching shoes of the regulation n. An additional 25 per cent wore tan shoes, but of somewhat differ - ttern, and the remaining 25 per cent wore black shoes. IH Co. came to camp every man supplied with a good, strong pair of shoes, and of these 30 pairs were manufactured by Joseph M. Herman o., Boston, Mass., in conformity with the United States Regulation ernment army shoe. These 30 pairs were purchased at a cost of $3 per in dozen lots. ■G Co, was likewise supplied with 24 pairs of tan shoes, manufactured hp Kreider Shoe Company of Anvillt. Penn.. stock No. 2464. ■ I Co., which had just been mustered into the service, came with one - of its members shod with the regulation army shoe. IK Co. came to camp with every man supplied with at least one pair of shoes; 30 pairs of these were United States army regulation shoes, •h had just been purchased at a cost of $3 per pair in dozen lots. ECo. had about 45 pairs of bhoes which approximated the regulation n in style and make; of these 30 pairs had been purchased for senr- Camp Mickey. M Co. had no less than 44 pairs of tan shoes. I With no less than two companies fully equipped with the regulation ■s and many of the others so with very few exceptions, it certainly ks some progress in meeting this question with which the National rd company commander is always confronted. The camp, however, by reason of the heavy rains we experienced, proved to be a hard one on footwear, and the result was that tan shoes became wet and muddy and were not worn at all times. Many of the men, warned by previous experience, brought two pairs of shoes to camp. They had been supplied with but one pair of tan shoes. The result was when their tan shoes became wet they changed to the other shoes, and the natural result was that while each company were supplied as this report indicates, the tan shoes were not worn at all times. This fact was espe - cially noticeable in the marked difference of appearance of footwear of the regiment between the appearance of the regiment in camp the day previous to the day of the parade in Omaha, and the day of the parade. The day previous to the parade certainly all kinds of footwear were in evidence in our camp. The day of the parade disclosed a command made up of men, as a rule, and with very few exceptions well shod, and with a very large percentage of the regulation shoes 'in use. In view of these experiences, I would respectfully recommend that in the future Lord Wellington's advice be followed in the equipment of the National Guard, and the men be required to bring two pairs of shoes with them of regulation style and make, and not one pair only. Ee prevalence of rains and dump weather made the care of the arms serious problem. Proper cleaning materials were not issued In and many companies failed to supply themselves with them before ;. The* result was that a great deal of hard work had to be per- </seg>

However, this was not universally true, neither was it the general rule; on the contrary, many of the rifles were kept in excellent condition. I Co.

Instruction The following instructors were assigned to duty with the 1st Neb.: Cap! K. L. Hamilton. U. S. A., retired. Major on the Governor's Staff, and Capt. J. DeCamp Hall, 4th U. S. Inft.. as instructor inspector. I In addition to these the officers of the regiment were favored with the ence and lectures of Maj. Julius A. Penn, U. S. Inft., who was attached irig. Headquarters. Capt. J. Decamp Hall we found to be a gentle - of pleasant address, and he exhibited great interest in the work in I. He was constantly ready and willing to answer all proper queries &gt;th officers and men concerning the duties devolved upon them in the As usual, one day was occupied in making camp, one day in breaking camp, one Sunday intervened, and on two days the rains were so severe as to render the dispensing with all drills necessary. One day was also occupied with the parade through Omaha. Notwithstanding these interruptions, I feel it is fair to say that much good was accomplished by the time spent in camp. I As usual, nearly all the companies had a large number of newly ited men in camp, hi addition to this, Co. I had been mustered in as irganization scarcely two weeks prior to the camp. H Co. had been ntly organized, and in addition to this had experienced a second reor - zation, making it practically a new command. irherefore, from September 28 to October 2 was largely devoted to i, company, and battalion drills. One regimental drill in close order held. October 3 was devoted to a problem of attack and defense of ion. One battalion was assigned to the defensive and two to the sive. On the 4th the regiment marched out of camp and made shelter camp and established outpost on the ridge in government reservation government waterworks to government hospital Inclusive. On the he command participated in the military parade through Omaha. Bin view of the conditions that obtained, the entertainment of this regi - t in going to Omaha and its detrainment after arriving at the camp nd from that city were certainly very good. E addition to these field drills and exercises, very instructive lectures delivered by Maj. Penn and Capt. Hall, in which the subjects of s, reconnaissance, advance and rear guard, outposts and attack, and :e of positions were considered. These lectures wer£ held at the </seg>
            <seg id="p093">ADJITANT GENERAL'S REPORT 93 period which heretofore had been devoted to officers' school, and the work was so designed that the lecture preceded the practical operation of the field. One school period was devoted to a tactical walk in which the cap - tains were assigned to the instruction under Maj. Penn: 1st lieutenants to Capt. Hall; 2d lieutenants to Capt. Hamilton. On three different days instructions were given on the manual of the sword under the instructions of Capt. Hall. K While the officers were being instructed in this manner the non - missioned officers of the regiment were receiving instructions from the mental army non-commissioned officers who were assigned to duty i us. The subjects in which instruction to be given were shelter tent lins, management and care of tentage, drill regulations, guard duty, tion named drills. I Capt. Riley, inspector of small arms practice, also carried on a pistol ;e on grounds near the camp, and succeeded in qualifying a number of officers as pistol marksmen who had heretofore had no opportunities g these lines. Discipline The discipline -of the command was in general excellent, and with the exception of certain individuals, the conduct of the men in camp waa exemplary. One unfortunate occurrence took place which was the death of Priv. Earl Hahlbeck, Co. B, 1st Inft. The situation ascertained by a personal investigation made by the regimental commander was as follows: Hahlbeck and Priv. Daniel McKenzie were members of the same tent squad. At reveille in the morning of October 5, Hahlbeck took hold of the cot on which Priv. Daniel McKenzie, Co. B, was then sleeping, and turning it over threw McKenzie on the ground. McKenzie then arose, struck Hahlbeck on the body, causing his death. There had been no previous ill feeling or enmity existing between these parties. They had grown up together as friends and companions in the same town. Both had spent the night in the tent; neither had been using intoxicating liquors in any degree. At the autopsy that was held after the death no mark of external Injury could be found on Hahlbeck's body. As to what intent actuated the participants in this "rough work," whether it was done in anger or merely "horse play" indulged in by both, in view of surrounding- facts, different minds might reach different conclusions. One thing is true, there was certainly no premeditated intent to kill, and no intent to seriously harm Hahlbeck on the part of McKenzie. Whether or not it was in fact an accident which grew out of "rough sport" in which both indulged, or whether it was a blow struck in anger, were questions which under the facts surrounding the occurrence would be hard to determine. BPriv. McKenzie was thereupon placed in arrest and placed in the d house, and the authorities of Sarpy county duly notified. On the moon of the 6th McKenzie was turned over to the custody of the iff of Sarpy county upon order of the Brigade Commander. </seg>

I urther advised by the county attorney of Sarpy county that no pro - ngs whatever of a criminal nature against HcKenzie are under con - ation, and that none will be brought. Etie occurrence was certainly lamentable, and we feel in view of rcumstances that we are correct in saying that it was only the re - f an accident which might occur in every athletic contest and al - under any circumstances, and does not reflect upon the discipline company in which it occurred, nor of the camp in general. KOn the following Sunday Private Hahlbeck was buried at his home Visner, Neb., with military honors, Co. B, 1st Inft., being present in organization, and both the regimental and brigade field and staff g represented. Qver TOO people, it is estimated, testified their re - t to the deceased by their presence at his funeral. K attach to this report a certified copy of the coroner's verdict, and the report of the officer of the day, made on the day of Private &gt;eck's death. KOne feature of the program which we feel is deserving of notice le matter of competition. On Tuesday, October 3, a field day pro - 1 was carried out in the regiment. The following were the officers snated to act at the same: Judges Lieut. Col. Baehr, referee. Capt. Hamilton. U. S. A., retired. J. DeCamp Hall, 4th U. 8. Inft. Athletic Officer: 1st l.ieut D. F.

            <seg id="p095">95 Ir for that contest. In addition to these contests the matter of guard was made competitive, but unfortunately the difficult conditions un - which this duty was performed rendered proper judging it almost kssible. and as a result the money was divided between Companies L, id E. It should be stated that Co. C withdrew from this contest, ng to the fact that they were unavoidably prevented from partict - ig in the ceremony of guard mount. In addition to these contests another prize was offered, $10 as first prize and $5 as second, to the companies maintaining the best sanitation and police in their respective portions of the camp, including quarters. By agreement of all concerned the prizes were to be determined by the condition of the several companies' quarters during the entire encamp - ment and Capt. R. L. Hamilton kindly undertook the arduous duty of judging this event. His inspections were made a number of times daily, and his final report on this matter was very commendatory to all the or - ganizations in camp. The competition between several of the organiza - tions was extremely great, and so little difference was there to be found between these organizations that upon the last day Capt. Hamilton re - ported that, while he regarded the police and sanitation of all the com - panies in view of the weather conditions that had prevailed, very credit - able, yet two at lexst were excellent, and that as between these two he was unable to decide to which the first prize belonged. He thereupon announced that Companies A and K had tied for first prize. Lots were cast, which resulted in Co. K being announced as the winner of the first prize, |10, and Co. A as second prize of $5. Considerable interest was manifested in the several contests through - out, and while they have some objectionable features, yet on the whole it is believed by the commanding officer that these contests result in per - manent good, not only to the organization winning but also to all or - ganizations participating in them. Latrines. Owing to the frequency of the rains it was extremely hard to main - tain a proper police in the latrines, but if the condition of the camp be taken into consideration, including the facilities which were at hand for takng care of the same, we feel that the condition of tne latrines In gen - eral could he denominated good. They were not provided with roofs at any time; they were not provided with urinals when first erected, and we feel that a saving might have been effected and at the same time bet - ter facilities afforded had each compr.ny brought with it the condemned tent, that was issued to each organization several years ago. and used it to cover a pit provided with "fly tight" or fly proof seats. The headquarters of the 1st Regt. is certainly indebted to the Brig. Headquarters for many courtesies extended during the tour of duty.

Hamilton. t possibly may best express my personal appreciation of the person - if the regiment as it appeared at the late Camp Mickey by quoting a xk addressed to me by a former officer of the 1st Neb. Vol. InfL served with it during the Spanish-American War and the Philippine pi-, lion following, and who has remained in close touch with military ■s since '98: "Your regiment is in better shape now that the 1st Nebraska were when they left Lincoln fOT the Philippines. You have a better lot of of- Bcers and Just as fine a body of men as I ever saw. You are ready for field service, and that is what the Government is looking for." While fully endorsing this remark as applicable to my subordinates, I am not insensible to the fact that in view of the limited time which is afforded for instruction in the Nebraska National Guard, the finished product of the drill master and instructor can not be expected, and it is therefore not to be supposed that I deemed the regiment in personnel and equipment above criticism. Undoubtedly criticism was in many Instances due, and we must not forget that since January 22, 1910, the armament, organization, and disc ipline of the regular army is prescribed for the National Guard. This standard we may say in passing, even the regular troops of this department (Missouri), presumably without exception, failed to conform to during the last year. For publicly announce! in General Orders No. 64, Series 1911, Department of Missouri, we find the following language: K"That reports of Inspections of troops in this department indicate the practical training prescribed has not produced a proper degree of iency." If, therefore, the regular army, officered by gentlemen whose pro - ficiency, professional zeal, and ability is undoubted and who have the absolute and exclusive control of their men for twenty-four hours per day for 365 days in the year, is unable to satisfactorily conform to the requirements of this standard now exacted from both the regular army and the National Guard alike, much less could it be expected that we would find a substantial conformity to the same standard in an organiza - tion under National Guard officers, whose vocations are not the profession of arms, and whose men are under their control for drill and instruction less than two hours per week of 50 weeks, with not to exceed two minis under canvas annually. I On the other hand, notwithstanding the reports of inspection referred we are still inclined to believe in case of our regular army friends, under service conditions the "inefficiency" charged in the reports Id not be dlscernahle in the field, and that in the future, as hereto - tbe several organizations comprising the troops of the Department of Missouri will continue to so conduct themselves as to reflect honor i the nation whose flag they sustain </seg>

The handling to and from Omaha was well done the equipment furnished was sufficient and of good quality. I'nion Pacific. The handling to and from Omaha was close to sched - ule Equipment furnished was not sufficient or of the proper kind. In place of the baggage cars ordered, old mail cars were furnished. While these were large enough, they had small doors, and hampered the quick handling of baggage. The baggage car ordered Tor the baggage of the Band, 2d Regt., was not furnished, which necessitated their baggage being loaded in the same ear with that of the Signal Co. This caused a delay - to train at Fremont to unload the baggage. The coach for Band. 2d Regt., had no fire in it, nor was it connected up in train for steam I have been advised by the chief musician that he made every effort to obtain heat without any results ■Missouri Pacific. The movement to camp of the company from Au - i was seven hours late. As far as I can asif rtnin, the return move - t was on schedule. Equipment furnished was sufficient and proper. Organizations.

The unloading of this regiment was not as prompt as possible, due I believe, to the quartermaster of this regiment having just been appointed, and not altogther familiar with his duties. The loading for the return movement was a marked improvement, Capt. Flotree beine on the ground constantly: and although I could see no assistance rendered him by bat- </seg>

The loading and unloading of this regiment was prompt and sys- tematic I wish to take this occasion to compliment Capt. Kelso for the very able manner in which he performed the duties of his office, and thank him for the assistance given others. One further criticism to make: Battalion quartermasters of both regi- ments do not understand the duties of their office, or they willfully neg- lected them. I never saw any evidence of anything done by them either in their 1 attalions, or assisting their regimental quartermasters. Very respectfully. A. D. FALCONER, Col. Q M. &amp; Com. Genl.

Aldrich, Governor. Subject, Annual Report. MOBILIZATION. |\t the request of the War Department, a scheme for mobilization prepared as set forth in General Orders No. 1 herewith. Under this me, if a call was made, officers are assigned in advance, each to a cular duty, and each would have a packet of orders and blanks all y for his particular work. The arrangements for this scheme are not fully completed, but on the principle that an armed force, like an insurance policy, is more valuable when ready for instant use, it should be carried to completion. INSPECTIONS. I The annual inspection for the War Department was made during lary, February, and March, the total number present was 935, absent aggregate 1,274. The per cent absent was 31, as compared to 20 per in 1911. The inspection by the state, not being completed at this . detailed report on same can not now be made. CAMPS OF INSTRUCTION. Congress having appropriated money to provide for joint camps of the army and National Guard, the Secretary of War invited Nebraska to send troops to such a camp at Pole Mountain, near Laramie, Wyo , under which invitation the 1st Regt., with a detachment of the Hosp. Corps, was sent. This was really a provisional regiment, however, being made up of ten companies of the 1st Regt.. and two from the 2d., and, as a minimum strength was required in companies, where same were small they were filled by details from the 2d. This camp was a most valuable and interesting one. For full details of same. I refer to the report of Col. G. A. Eberly herewith. </seg>

The pround on which this camp was located waa good, and the camp was well conducted and profitable In every par - ticular. For details of same I refer to the reports of Col. H. J. Paul, Maj. J. M. Uirkner. and (apt Henry A. Jess herewith. ■Remarks of the Secretary of War. on the Nebraska troops in these pa, as made up from the reports of 17. S. Army inspectors, also ex - ts from the reports of inspectors, are enclosed with this. COURSE OF STUDY FOR OFFICERS. A course of study, instituted in 1911, and briefly referred 10 in my report for that year, was continued, the four subjects being: Infantry Drill Regulations, Tactical Principles and Problems. Elements of Military Hygiene, Small Arms Firing Regulations. Eif the approximately lid officers, outside of the medical corps, all this course satisfactorily excepting thirteen. The result has been neficial that a more comprehensive one, prepared by Lieut. F. C. inspector-instructor, has been adopted for permanent use, same published as General Orders No IT herewith. SCHEDULK FOR ARMORY DRILLS I This is set forth in General Orders No. 15 herewith, and was adopted the view of having all companies carry on the same worn during winter months, and thus, when the guard was mobilized, the organ - ons would be the hitter able to work together. REARRANGEMENT OF INFANTRY COMPANIES INTO REGIMENTS Kly General Orders No. 21, the companies of the 1st and 2d Regts. of try are to be rearranged, effective April 1, 1913, into two regiments, known as the 4th and 5th. This will offer better facilities for administration and mobilization. for the reason that the companies of each regiment will be in a geo - graphical part of the state as near each other as is possible. When the 1st Regi. was organized in 1881, the various companies were naturally scattered throughout the state, and when the 2d was organized in 1887, the companies were also scattered over the state and intermingled with those of the other regiment Thus, if a regiment was mobilized, some eoapanies would travel from widely separated parts of the state. In very few states has this condition existed, and such states have been criticised by the War Department for the same. While the personal pride of members and the local pride of com - munities, in a certain number of a regiment, or letter of a company, will </seg>
            <seg id="p119">119 EFected by the change, it is believed that in a few years all will t themselves to the change, and it will be seen that much good has done. E'he reason (or numbering the two new regiments 4 and 5 is that (or k'ar with Spain, the state sent the 1st, 2d. and 3d Regts., and which musti red out at the close o( the war, and all matters connected their administration closed and the organizations became matters of -y. and similar organizations should not be given the same numbers. TARGET PRACTICE. I The plan of having companies hold target practice at home station* continued during the past season, but with a less number of com - es holding practice than the year previous the number o( men firing g 254, as against 486, the year previous, and the "Figure of Merit" reduced from 29.22 to 14.80. CHANGES IX COMPANIES. For the past two years a company o( engineers had been organized at Omaha, but as funds were not available for equipment, and interest among the members became weak, The company was mustered out on February 5, 1912. Ehe band of the 1st Regt., Hloomtield. was mustered out November 12, at request of the Chief Musician, who was about to terminate Bidence there. A new band, 1st Regt., is in process of organization laha. COMPLETE EQUIPMENT FOR CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS. In the past few years a battery of field artillery, a machine gun com - pany, and an engineer company, have been discontinued for the reason that funds were not available for the procuring of equipment, and the maintenance of same fully equipped as desired by the War Department. The present equipment of the Field Hosp. and the Signal Corps is not what it should be. and the War Department is insisting that they be furnished with complete equipment. This particularly applies to the Signal Corps company at Fremont, your attention being called to the report of Capt. W. N. Michel. .U. S. Army, who inspected the company for the War Department during the past year. The War Department has offered to complete the equipment of this organization so that it may be classed as a "Type "A" Wireless Section, without charge against the state's allotment, on the condition that suit - able armory facilities are provided, proper care of the property taken, and the company recruited to 98 enlisted men. Steps have been taken to meet these armory requirements, the equipment requisitioned, and the matter is to be further investigated by an officer of the army within the next few weeks. </seg>

A system of monthly "Bulletins,' gotten out on a mimeograph by this office, was commenced April 1, 1912; these contain information and news items, not proper matter to be published in orders, which are use - ful for the National Guard to know. In a way they take the place of a military newspaper. FIRE IN OMAHA ARMORY. On the evening of April 24, IMJ. a fire in the armory at 20th and Harney streets totally destroyed the entire equipment for four infantry •MBpanies, which was property of the Federal Government, value about IM.OOO. The new metal lockers. 240 in all. with padlocks, were bo badly damaged that 40 of them, together with the padlocks for all, were a total loss, and the balance had to be taken apart, straightened and repaired, the net less to the state being $677.20. In addition the office, library, and club room furniture, property of the companies, was de - stroyed. However, that of Company (1, 2d Regt., was insured, while that of the other companies was not. The net loss to the companies ot their private property was about $1,500. I The equipment lost in this fire, which was the property of the United es, was replaced without charge against the state's allotment, and the age to and loss of state property was replaced with state funds. ARMORIES The state has never supplied companies of the National Guard with armories, although many states do, and the system is growing through - oat the country. If the state would appropriate funds for armories where cities would furnish the ground and a part of the cost of the building, the way might be opened for a start in this direction. It seems inoppor - tune, however, to push the matter of armories for single companies at the present time, although a large part of the appropriations for this department go for the payment of armory rentals. An exception, how - •rer, should be made In case of Omaha and Lincoln. In Omaha four eoapanles are quartered in one building, which is not entirely satisfac - tory, and for which the state allows $100 per month, the care and main - tenance being paid by the companies themselves. Better and more per ma oent armory facilities are much needed in this case. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">121 STATE ARSENAL AND STOREHOUSE. KThe surplus equipment and supplies are stored in several rooms in basement of the State House. A detailed report of the facilities pro - d by this are given in the report on this subject made by Ha]. J. A. i, Inspector-Instructor, copy herewith. I In the few years just past, a part of the room allotted for storage haa &gt; taken by new state departments, and this will probably continue as l.usiness of the state increases The value of this property stored in basement of the State House is approximately $40,000, and the system trdly satisfactory. Ef the state could provide a state arsenal in Lincoln, so arranged as avide quarters for the two companies there, it would be an excellent to do. and I earnestly recommend that this be done. At present per month rental is paid for the armory in Lincoln, which could be if the state owned such a state arsenal. FIRE INSURANCE. I The furnishing of motal lockers to all companies during the year , coupled with loss of some of them by fire in Omaha, leads me to test that such property should be insured by the state. The value lese lockers is about $8,000, as stated in my report for the year 1911. I The government property in the possession of the companies, and ed in the basement of the State House, of course does not belong to state, but as a general proposition, loss of same by fire will hav- to orne by the state from the regular allotments. SPANISH WAR CLAIMS FUND ICommmcing in 1905, there have been several payments made to the ?rnor by the Federal Government, of money as additional or back for certain soldiers who joined Nebraska organizations for the War Spain. Specifically this money is pay for a part of the time between date they joined and that of muster. There is today in this fund, •sited in the City National Bank. Lincoln, of the principal $6&gt; as interest credited by the bank $138.76. a total of $7,043.88. Et may be stated that our records show that a number of cli - d against tills fund have not been returned through the bank, and supposed are being kept by the pa\t«&gt;s as souvenirs. This phase of latter might in part be remedied bv making checks read void after lain date, and requiring a new claim made after such date. BThe books show that from this fund 7M men have not been paid, and &gt;' inquiry has been made to the officers and others of all compa • whereabouts have not been found. As the rolls show the place of birth, residence, and name or a rela - it is believed that by a system of letter writing and advertising some trace of these men can be found. This would entail mucn work. </seg>

            <seg id="p123">123 ing a camp ground and equipping the same for our annual camps is con - siderable. I recommend that this fund be conserved as far as possible a few years longer for the purpose stated. RECOMMENDATIONS Jn addition to my recommendation as to an armory at Omaha, a state arsenal at Lincoln, and a state rifle range (the latter from g&lt;&gt; mem funds), I recommend a state law prohibiting the wearing of ihe soldier's uniform by all persons except such. Twenty-one states now ich a law. Certain articles of the uniform, such as the hat, olive drab, woolen shirt, and the khaki coats, are so popular that it is very hard for officers to enforce the law against taking same from armories and wearing in personal use by their men. in addition to this, the uniform of the Army and National Guard has been adopted by certain educational institutions where military drill is taught, also by civir so that it is impos - sible to tell whether or not an article or uniform seen on belongs to the government or not All such schools and societies should have pride enough in their institution to adopt a distinctive uniform of their own. The state military code should be revised to conform to ' legislation by the National ('out KIN VNCES. In lilli the National Guard participated in joint maneuvers with the Regular Army at Fort Riley. Kan. The cost of such joint maneuvers are in part paid by the War Department from a special appropriation by Congress. In connection with these. 1910 maneuvers certain claims for railroad transportation were forwarded to the War Department for pay - ment, but returned with the statement that the fund of JlO.itOo allotted to the state for transportation had been exhausted in 11. other claims for the state, and this after it was too late to pay them from state funds. These claims are as follows, and have been forwarded to the Auditor of Public Accounts for deficiency appropriation.

            <seg id="p124">124 Penitentiary at the time of the mutiny in March was paid from funds appropriated for general support of the National Guard, this kind of work not being contemplated by the appropriation act. and for the reason that the fund "Support of the National Guard" is practically exhausted, and will not pay regular bills to the end of the current biennial period, the same should be appropriated to the National Guard fund as a deficiency A copy of the claims paid, with a statement as to the reason therefor. has been forwarded to the Auditor of Public Accounts for this purpose. $687 34 Owing to the increased requirements of the War Department, as to equipment carried and paper work done, it has been found necessary the past few years to incur increased expense, viz., for a permanent inspecting and surveying officer, and a storekeeper to handle the property in the storerooms in the basement of the Slate House. Also the Itata is now paying the premium on officers' bonds, and the making of physical exami - nation of all recruits necessitates the hiring of civilian physicians at points »hi re we have no medical officers. All of these items are paid from the fund for "Support of the National Guard," and there has not been lacriwued appropriation to care for MM In conclusion on Ihis subject it may be stated that the money we have to do with is not sufficient, it is less in comparison with other states having the same strength in their National Guard, and the time and expense usfd by members makes it hard to ge&lt; and keep good men.

The following information is reprinted from Circular No. 37, War Department, June 7, 1910, and the annual allowance given below will be issued to infantry companies. The use of this solution will shortly be- come unnecessary, due to a new process in the manufacture of am- munition. In a large number of instances where IT. S. magazine rifles, caliber .30, model of 1903, have been turned in to ordnance establishments for replacement, it was found upon examination that abrasive substances had been used in cleaning the rifles, resulting in diminishing their ac- curacy and generally injuring them. The bore of the rifle is manufactured with great care, in order that a high degree of accuracy may be obtained, and it should be intelligently cared for. The residuum from smokeless powder tends to corrode the bore and should, therefore, be removed as soon after firing as prac- ticable. It has been found that a deposit of metallic fouling is left in the bore of the rifle when ball cartridges, caliber .30, model of 1906, of earlier manufacture are used, and a solution for the removal of metallic fouling from the bores of small arms, has therefore, been issued by the Ordance Department • • • and is given below. ANNUAL ISSUE. For a company of infantry of the organized militia: Prico 30 ounces ammonium persulphate $0 91 15 ounces ammonium carbonate ' 21 180 ounces ammonia, 28 per centum 1 26 To 1 al cost </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 bonate, 6 ounces ammonia (28 per centum), and 4 ounces water will make KAcient quantity to clean twenty rifles. If no scales are available eighing the ingredients, they may be measured and the equivalents s follows: 1 ounre of ammonium persulphate equals two medium heaping spoonfuls. 200 grains ammonium carbonate equals one medium heaping spoonful. 6 ounces ammonia, 28 per centum pure, equals three-eights of a pint. 4 ounces of water equals one-fourth or a pint. The spoon referred to above is the spocn issued by the Ordnance Department for the mess oullit. The solution is made as lollows: The carbonate and per-sulphate should first be pulverized and mixed together and the ammonia and water added, after which the mixture should be thoroughly stirred. The solution should stand half an hour before using. The bore of the rifle should l.e plugged with a cork or wooden plug at the breech end and just below the metallic fouling. The bore should then be filled with the solution and the muzzle corked or plugged. The solution should remain in the bore for about one hour or long enough to cut the metallic fouling, after which it should be re - moved and canton flannel or other soft material run back and forth through the bore to remove the residue. Great care must be taken to remove the solution from all metallic parts, as it may start rusting in a very short time. Special care should bi&gt; used in removing it from the breech mechanism. The solution may be used several times, but after it has been once used it should be placed in a bottle and not mixed with any unused solution. This solvent is .expensive and should be u»ed economically. • • • 3. The following extracts from the Description and Rules for the Management of the IT. s. Magazine Rifle, caliber .30, model of 1903, are published for the guidance of all concerned: As the bore of the rifle is manufactured with great care in order that a high degree of accuracy may be obtained, it should be carefully cared for. The residuum from smokeless powder tends to corrode the bora and should therefore be removed as soon after firing as practicable. The following method has been practiced at the Springfield Armory for a number of years with good results: Using the cleaning rod and small patches of cloth (preferably canton flannel), clean the bore thoroughly with patches soaked in a saturated solution of soda and water. Then thoroughly dry the bore and remove the soda solution by the use of dry patches and finally oil the bore with patches soaked in cosmic oil. Twenty-four hours after this first cleaning the bore should be again cleaned as described above, a* it has been found that the powder gases are probably forced Into the texture of the steel, and will, if the second </seg>
            <seg id="p167">167 the bore may have been cleaned at first. • • • As neither ramrod nor jointed cleaning rod will be issued with the model of 1903 rifle, the cleaning rod should be carried into the field whenever practicable. » • » Many of the parts can generally be cleaned with dry rags. All parts after cleaning should be wiped with an oiled rag. The best method of applying oil is to rub with a piece of cotton cloth upon which a lew drops of oil have been placed, thereby avoiding the usp of an unnecessary amount of oil. This method will, even in the absence of the oiler, serve for the cams and bearings, which should be kept continually oiled. Any part thai may appear to remove hard can generally be freed by the use of a little oil. Bhe stock and hand guard may be coated with raw linseed oil and ed by rubbing with the hand. Sperm oil shall be used for lubricating metallic bearing and contact surfaces and in the bore with the rifles is in use. Cosmic oil should be applied to all metallic surface*, to prevent rust - ing when, arms are stored or when not used for an appreciable length of When using a cleaning rod, always insert it from the breech, never at the muzzle, because the muzzle is the most sensitive part of the rifle. 4. Care of leather equipment: To preserve the life of russet leather equipments, they should be cleaned whenever dirt, grit, or mud has collected on them. * * Climate, frequency of exposure to weather, and wear and tear due to service are so variable that no definite rule can be laid down as to the proper time for cleaning. The condition of the leather alone will determine this. So long as the leather is reasonably pliable, looks and feels well, no oil should be used, and soap or polish sparingly applied. The tendency in service is toward excessive use of soaps, oils, and polishes. In cleaning, each part should be carefully washed with a sponge moistened with a thick lather made from clean water and castile soap, and then rubbed vigorously until it is thoroughly dry. If surface polish is desired, apply thick lather made from clear water and Propert's soap, allow leather to dry and then rub thoroughly with a soft cloth. If the leather becomes harsh and dry from exposure to wet or other cause, it will be necessary to oil the equipment. This should never be done except in the presence and under the direction of a commissioned officer of the organization. Before oiling, the equipment should be care - fully washed as follows: tike a damp sponge, squeezed nearly dry, rub it on castile soap and ulate to form a thick lather, apply lather to surface of leather, and stand until dry; when dry, remove with a clean damp sponge; particularly soiled may be rubbed with a moist soaped cloth, the surface of the leather is still slightly moist from the washing. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 After the oil has been applied the equipment should be left for some time — a day if practicable — and then thoroughly rubbed with a coarse dry cloth until the surface is clean. I The treatment described above is all that is necessary to keep the pment in excellent condition. Three or four times a year is generally ■gh to oil leather under ordinary conditions of service if the equip - t is properly cared for. Under exceptional conditions of warm, moist ate or frequent wetting and drying, it should be oiled at shorter in - alB, but great care should be taken to avoid excessive or too frequent of oil. Kir a polish only of personal leather equipment is desired, the dress - supplied by the Ordinance Department should be used. Apply it Ingly to the entire surface and then rub briskly with a dry cloth. d case should leather be dipped in water or be placed In the sun to . . . 5. The following extracts from the Army Regulations, 1910, should be strictly complied with in the care and preservation of ordnance equip- Par. 292. Enlisted men will not take their arms apart except by permission of a commissioned officer under proper supervision, and only in the manner prescribed in the descriptive pamphlet of the arm issued by the Ordnance Department. The polishing of blued or browned parts of small arms, rebluing or rebrowning. putting any portion of an arm in a fire, or removing a receiver from a barrel is prohibited. The mutilation of any part by filing or otherwise, and attempts to beautify or change the finish are prohibited. Pieces will be unloaded before being taken to quarters or tents, and as soon as the men using them are relieved from duty, unUs otherwise ordered. The use of tompions in small arms is forbidden. The prohibition in this paragraph of attempts to beautify or change the finish of arms in the hands of enlisted men is not construed as forbidding the application of raw linseed oil to the wood parts of the arms. This oil is considered necessary for the preservation of the wood, and it may be used for such polishing as can be given by rubbing in one or more coats when necessary. The use of raw linseed oil only will be allowed for redressing, and the application for such purpose of any kind of wax or varnish, including heelball, Is strictly prohibited. I Par. 29J. It is forbidden to use any dressing or polishing material the leather accouterments or equipments of the soldier, the* horse pments for cavalry or the artillery harness, except the preparations ilied by the Ordnance Department for that purpose. ■ Par. 294.

Subject: "Tour of Duty," Camp of Instruction near Pole Mountain, Wyo. I have the honor to make the following report of the "Tour of Duty" performed by the First Infantry Nebraska National Guard at Camp of Instruction near Pole Mountain, Wyo., July 29 to August 7, Inclusive. The following constitute the strength of organizations comprising the First Infantry: Field staff and band, 13 officers, 31 enlisted men Co. A, 3 officers and 42 men. Co. B, 3 officers and 40 men. Co. C, 3 officers and 40 men. Co. K, 2d Nebraska Inft., 3 officers and 38 men. Co. E, 3 officers and 38 men. Co. G, (2d Inft.,) 3 officers and 40 men. Co. G, (1st Inft.,) 3 officers and 40 men. Co. H, 3 officers and 38 men. Co. I, 3 officers and 40 men. Co. K, 3 officers and 39 men. Co. L, 3 officers and 44 men. Co. M, 3 officers and 42 men. Hosp. detachment, 2 officers and 9 men Total, 51 officers and 521 men. ilt is to be remembered that in addition to Companies K and G of the ifantry, N. N. G., details have been made to various companies of 1st from the 2d Regt.. which aggregate 106 enlisted men and one nissioned officer. Thus slightly more than 33 per cent of the ag - ate strength of the regiment on this "Tour of Duty" come to ft the 2d, and in this connection, it is to be remembered that when 2d Inft. participated in the Fort Riley maneuvers in 1903, the details from the 1st Inft. aggregated slightly more than 22 per cent of the nization. i Transportation: The command was transported to Laramie, Wyo., point of detrainmeut, in two sections, one via the Union Pacific, one the C, B. &amp; Q. T"he regimental commander joined the Union Pacific ion in Fremont. This train was then in charge of Lieut. Col. W. E. hr, and he was continued in immediate command of the train until arrival at Laramie. On board this section was the regimental head - rters band. Maj. Fraser and staff. Maj. Johnson and staff, companies </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 ADJUTANT UKXEBALS KEPORT IK, 2d, G, 2d, H and L. Companies A, C, G, 1st, K, I, and M were Ml on the C. B. ft Q. The Union Pacific section arrived in Lara - it 5: 30 a.m., on tbe 30th. The C, B. ft Q. section did not arrive late in the afternoon of the same day. The Regimental Commander feels that he can not speak too highly of tbe character and of the equipment and service furnished by the Union Pacific. The cars for the men were tourist sleepers. Tbe officers were provided with a standard sleeper. The cars were kept well iced, every possible courtesy extended, and every effort was made to expedite our arrival at Laramie As a result, we arrived at our destination some five hours in advance of the scheduled time. In fact, there is no possible coirolaint to make, so far as the management by the railroad officials of the Union Pacific section was concerned. Our unexpected arrival at Laramie, however, put us under the dis - advantage of waiting for our transportation to tbe "Camp of Instruction." However, it arrived in due time and the command was detrained and took up its march to a spring in Cheyenne Canyon and there camped, for the night of the 30th. The movement to the point of bivouac was made in advance guard formation and a problem of reconnoitering Cheyenne Pass was well carried out by Companies L and G 2d. These com - panies had been assigned to advance guard on this move. The work of these organizations in this problem received the commendation of our instructor, Lieut. Frederick C. Test. The transportation was somewhat delayed, but finally arrived at the scene of the first camp. The shelter tents were then pitched for the organizations present, and preparations made to spend the night. For the benefit of the organizations which ntre expected to arrive later, wood wa: gathered and large fires made. Maj. Fraser and start were assigned to the duty of bringing into the camp companies coming on the C, B. ft Q. special. These companies ar - rived late on the afternoon of the 30th at Laramie. Some delay was ex - perienced in detrainment and night and a heavy rain storm overtook them before they had arrived at the bivouac. By the time they arrived in camp, an almost unheard of condition prevailed in Cheyenne Pass. Tbe trail leading through this Pass, ordinarily dry as powder, was very muddy. In places water was reported nearly knee deep. The storm, the high alti - tude and darkness, and the strange country, made over-land marching ex - ceedingly laborious and difficult; however, they finally reached their destination. Rations, were ixsued, and coffee prepared. The rain con - tinued. The wagon transportation was. delayed even to a greater extent than the transportation of the first section had been. It finally arrived, bringing with it tbe tents of the second section, which were then pitched and preparations made to spend the night, as comfortable as possible in a wt camp. The next morning the command took up its march for "Camp of In - struction" at Pole Mountain. It arrived at camp site at 11:30 a.m. Again there was a delay in the matter of wagon transportation until commend </seg>
            <seg id="p205">lllll'T 1VT I'L'Vt'P 1 I *&lt; IfVlMtlfT 205 had the experience of being out in several showers without protection, while the tentage was still on the road At last, the wagons arrived, then camp was quickly and creditably pitched, and the "Tour of Duty" began. I While on this subject of wagon transportation, I may add that on the rn march the command was delated forty minutes in starting from amp, due wholly to the failure of wagons to arrive. I The transportation furnished us was "contract transportation." By terms of the contract under which our impedimenta were carried, a tin price per hundred was paid by the government. The contractor tically sublet it to the drivers by paying them so much per hundred. |\s a result, the drivers provided themselves with large conveyances very small horses. They practically refused to take anything nnla— loaded. Fully loaded meant from 8.00U to 8,500 pounds per drlTer. necessitated an admixture of company property. With these over - ?d conveyances with small horse power, the up-grade, the storm, and -oads, made the pull up Cheyenne Pass trail an almost impossibility. I The wagons of the C, B. &amp; Q. section arrived late at night. Company manders had been required to leave all camp impedimenta at their e stations. No lanterns were shipped in the car that was to provide ith all camp tools, etc. When the wagons arrived, each containing the •erty of two or more organizations, the drenching rain, the inky dark - &gt;, and the lack of lanterns, furnished conditions that rendered the &gt;er care of company property an utter impossibility, and its inter - ure an unavoidable necessity. I Had each organization been provided with its own wagon, this would have occurred, and there would have been no loss of property, and in tion no suffering and inconvenience to the men. The very serious of property which occurred in our organizations, we feel is also lly due to the wagon transportation, which was furnished us. However, the sole and only criticism which we lay at the doors of our regular army friends, so far as this "Tour of Duty" is concerned, is as to the character of the wagon transportation furnished. In all other respects for the regular army officers, with whom we came in contact, we have but words of grateful commendation. And even as to the wagon trans - portation, we feel convinced that considering the transportation obtain - able, Haj. Kimball, the chief quartermaster, did the very best possible for us. In short, considering the particular instruments he had to work with, man could do no more. We are also convinced that no military organization can be copsidered s effective, or as properly equipped for field service, unless it had pro- vided for it a regulation train. It is also true that the experiences of the First Regiment enroute to Poll- Mountain was. we believe, but a repeti - tion on a small scale of the difficulties which have heretofore confronted every command that was dependent on transportation other than its own. And that the comparative failure in the matter of transportation is due wholly to the defects inherent in the contract method, and not at all to those who may be In charge of it. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 Mountain, the regMlar program of the "Tour of Duty" began. Previously In addition to problem of advance guurd which was worked out by I panies L and G. heretofore mentioned, on leaving the bivouac in Cheyenne Pass, the problem show n on Exhibit A, which is attached to this report, was handed us. This vas^sclvnl enroute. Companies B and A had been assigned (o the iidvance puard on this march, and on them fell the burden of the problem. Both organizations acquitted themselves in a creditable manner. General Order No. 11. which is hereto attached, marked "Exhibit B." outlined the general course of instruction followed. While it was modified in some particulars, it was substantially carried out. In fact, all instruc - tions were practically field work. The course of instruction included the subjects of simple patrols, squad, company, battalion and regimental movements Ceremonies were reduced to the minimum, and with the exception of the daily guard mount by company, and one muster and in - spection of the organization by con panics, there were no ceremonies whatever. The work was hard in some respects. It occupied both forenoon and afternoon. Notwithstanding the hardships which it entailed, however, the work was apparently enjoyed throughout by officers and men, more »o than any camp we have ever attended. Every one appeared impressed with the idea that tne work was serious work; that it was not a picnic, nor was it a joke. That to receive instruction was a privilege, as well as a duty. Good results natural'.}- followed. As 10 the character of the work done, and the impression it n:ade upon our instructors, I would quote the following: "At the close of the maneuver? of August 3, Col. Guilfoyle, who commanded the "Blu« s" to which the First Nebraska was assigned, commended the work ol the regiment, pronouncing it 'excellent.' " ("apt. /it, Fourth Infantry, in discussing the problem at the assembly of the officers and umpires of both "Blues" and "Reds" characterized the march, deploy meat anfi advance ol ti.«- First Nebraska as "very creditable." On the 'ast day of camp. Col. Williams accompanied by Lieut. Col. Henry T. Harris chief medical officer, and Mai. Oarie, made an inspection of the ramp of the First X&lt; -t»:iska At its conclusion QsJ. Williams, an officer of over forty years' experience in the regular army, complimented the regi'nent. its camp and its work, "from what 1 have personally observed, and from all reports of work of this regiment that have reached head - quarters." said Col. Wil'mms. "the work of the First Nebraska I consider excellent. Better could not Ik expected tor the facilities with which you have for caring for your camp, you certainly have a fine camp." I In this opinion Col. Harris and Maj. Dade concurred, and Col. Harris ?d: "In fact, we have but one criticism on your camp. Your latrines not fly proof, but as our own quartermaster's department constructed a, the defect is not chargeable to your command." HThe regiment went to Pole Mountain equipped for the field. Camp pedimenta were supposed to be reduced to the minimum. My informa- </seg>
            <seg id="p207">207 Kis that the Nebraska carried 25,000 pounds less In baggage or im - aenta than any other National Guard or organization in camp. KTo render due recognition to the valuable service rendered by the ers and men of the organization is indeed a task. In the main, all led faithfully and well. Lieut. Col. Baehr proved himself again to be a faithful and untiring worker. The battalion commander. Maj. Fraser and Johnson and his re - spective staffs, were all that could be desired. Though Capt. H. F. Elsasser, due to the absence of its major, was placed in the charge of the battalion on the field, he acquitted himself as a battalion commander in a most creditable manner. Company commanders, as a rule, left little to be desired in the matter of the hard and efficient work. The regimental quartermaster and commissary, we feel safe in saying, fully maintained to highest standard of official service that they have sot in previous en - campments. The regiment more than ever before came from Pole Mountain, an organized unit. It left Laramie on the 30th of July, twelve parts. It left the "Camp of Instruction" on. the 6th of August, a completed machine; given a new pair of shoes, and the enlisted men were capable of marching any place and going anywhere. iAt the close of the inspection of the command by a representative of regular army, in which the army standard was exacted, but five guns lie entire regiment failed to meet the approval of the inspector. Of five which thus failed to pass previous annual inspections of the or - ization in which they had been in use. So that as to these, the fault not lie with the men in whose hands the arms were inspected. Due acknowledgment should be made to Col. Williams, the com - manding officer of the camp, and to the regular army quartermaster's department, particularly Capt. Cowan, the regiment is cerainly indebted for many favors. Instruction. In the matter of instructors, there were detailed to our regiment, Maj. Julius A. Penn, our former instructor-inspector; Capt. Milton Me- Grew and our present instructor-inspector, Lieut. Frederick C. Test. What I desire to particularly commend in the plan of instruction followed was, that the officer under instruction was not relieved from responsibility, nor was he deprived of his command. The guard officer always had the first chance to make mistakes. His work was not done for him, but he was given instruction as to how he might avoid mistakes in the future. He exercised his own judgment, and had the benefit of experienced advice. As a matter of fact, 1 heard from the officer of the regiment no criticism whatever on the method of instruction followed, but only words of com - mendation and approval. Kalso desire to commend the medical detachment assigned to duties our regiment. Maj. C. K. Gibbons and Capt. Spealman certainly ren - faithful and efficient service at the bivouac at Cheyenne Pass, and </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 later by their careful supervision of the sanitation of our camp. There was an entire lack of friction, and a faithful co-operation on the part of all to make the camp a success, — a condition that is not always obtained in the experience of ihe regimental commander. It was suggested during the closing days of the camp that in view of the hard work the men had performed it might be advisable to consume more than one day on the return march to l-aramie, some eighteen miles distant by "Happy Jack" road. It was determined otherwise, however, and subsequent events proved the decision wise. I On the morning of the 6th. the regiment broke camp, crossed Pole ntain. and with a swinging, tireless step marched through Cheyenne - and arrived at the point of entrainment in five hours and forty trom the time the rear of the regiment had cleared the camp nd. This, too. notwithstanding the commanding officer intentionally yed the march more than forty minutes enroute. If the conditions be considered under which this march was made. It certainly reflects credit on the organization, and is so far as the regi - mental commander is advised, the best record for marching ever made by any regimental organization of the Guard of this state. IThe equipment received from the Adjutant General's office with the exception of the omitted lanterns, was complete in all its details and »inly in splendid condition. The new field ranges which we received lis camp assuredly constituted a decided improvement on our former pment. We certainly feel that a suitable acknowledgment is due to Adjutant General for his co-operation in making the movement of the raska troop to Wyoming a success. Not the least appreciated, it may lid, were the tourist sleepers provided for the use of the enlisted men. one serious defect, most noticeable, was the lack of marching shoes, •h existed to the extent of possibly 20 per cent of the enlisted strength. It is with pleasure that the commanding officer reports that the con - duct of the men of the regiment, notwithstanding the hardships experi - enced, was exemplary throughout, and such as to reflect credit on the name of the state, whose flag the regiment carried. And in this record of credit and of praise and commendation had. the commanding officer feels impelled to say that both regiments of our state should in justice •EXHIBIT A." PROBLEM NO.

For this reason I think care should be taken not to locate camps where just one railroad enters, as a little competition gets better service. I Had it not been tor the fact that a great deal of the tentage be - ing to this command was taken for the use of the 1st Inft., near Pole ntain. and had to be turned in to the Adjutant General's office, and 1 there shipped to Grand Island, this regiment could have pitched p and had dress parade at 5:30 p.m. of the first day.

R. U Hamilton, U. S. A., Retired, which was ved by me the day following the breaking of camp. "The time passed all too quickly and could we but have had ten days more in that camp I believe the benefits would have been apparent in all lines. However. I do not hesitate to say that the camp was to me the most satisfactory one, taken as a whole, of any I have attended since I joined the Guard. I have never attended a Guard camp where the ab - sence of liquor and its effect were more apparent than they were in your camp, and in that 1 do not hesitate to extend to you my heartiest con - gratulations." IV. Lieut. Col. Sammons proved to be a faithful and untiring worker, much of the success of this camp is due to his help. I can not say gh in praise of the Held and staff officers. Their work was all new leni, but they all took hold like "old timers" and, judging from their [, one would never know that they had not had several years ex - ■nce. To the company commanders is due most of the credit for the lemanly conduct and soldierly bearing of the men while in camp, and was N marked that it was the cause of general comment from the ens of Grand Island. VI. In the matter of instruction there were detailed to our regiment Capt. R. L. Hamilton, U. S. A., Retired, and Lieut. Frederick C. Test, U. our instructor-inspector, and the commanding officer of this regi - ment is greatly indebted to both of these gentlemen for the many cour - extended and the many practical ideas advanced by them. If the National Guard could have more such instructors as these two gentle - men it would make far more rapid advancement. K'll. The equipment received from the Adjutant General's office was good shape, and we found that office always ready and willing to I it could to help make the camp a success. There were a great many pairs of low shoes worn by the men and thi- is a defect that the company commanders should see is remedied before another camp. The men should not be permitted to bring low shoes to camp at all. </seg>

            <seg id="p219">219 IM. Company C enroute to camp showed a disposition to be slow, due, in my opinion, to lack of 'ear-irk" in that organization. The company commander could have prevented this by taking a firm stand. This company was two hours late in starting for the camp from bivouac, July 31. Company M showed lack of pride in car* of arms. This eompain failed to clean up dirty rifles. Men were hired to do the work for the company. ■ Supervision by proper officers of records and rosters, of camp police, of company messes. — Supervised by proper officers.

Uniforms, kind and condition: O. D. Service, good condition, two companies were equipped with new style uniforms. Slim ■ Two companies had marching shoes. All others had various stylet and shapes of high shoes. Four men had low shoes. Many men were noticed wearing shoes with high heels and buttons. Also, many black shoes were to be seen. An inspection of feet was made by the surgeon the last day of the camp, and about SO per cent of the men were found to have sore feet. The companies equipped with the marching shoes had only a few men so afflicted. Individual Quartermaster's Equipment Good in quality and condition. Company C equipped with nearly all old style white shelter halves. Company M had a few of these tents. Small arms, condition Sufficient cleaning material on hand in the camp.

No tents were supplied for rears, but these were obtained from the Camp Quartermaster. Kind and quantity of transportation with organization None with the organization. Quartermaster of the camp furnished contract transportation. This transportation was found to be very unsatisfactory. Company property from more than one com - pany was loaded on one wagon, and when unloaded in the dark the first night out of Laramie, became mixed and caused some lot&gt;s. In breaking camp. August 6, the wagons were late report - ing, and delayed the march of the main body forty minutes. The </seg>
            <seg id="p221">221 delay was not due to the Contractor or the Camp Quartermaster, but to the teamsters. These teamsters own their own team* and wagons, and are hired to haul a load. They are not under discipline. They were all notified by the Regimental Quarter - master on the night of August 5 that the march was to start at 6:00 a.m., and that everything had to be loaded before that hour. Notwithstanding this, they were not ready to load until € a_m., and then only through the efforts of the contractor to hurry them, did they get ready by that hour. All of this could have been avoided if a wagon had been furnished each company. Government wagons were all in use at the time, so contract transportation had to be furnished. Horses were hired for mounted men by the state, and were satisfactory. Railroad transportation was satisfactory except that the train over the B. £ M., and U. P. R. R. companies was late reaching Laramie. arriving there at 4:30 P. M. This delay caused great inconveni - ence, and some suffering in the six companies carried. If the train had arrived on time these companies could have reached the bivouac in daylight; as it was, they arrived at that place at 8:30 p.m., in the dark, and rain, with many men exhausted. Enroute to home stations, the six companies going via the U. P. and B. &amp; M. R. R. delayed the train thirty-five minutes by their slownebs in entraining.

I What is the efficiency oi this organization, considered as a whole, for field service, assuming its present personnel and increasing it to war strength and allowing one month from the time it is called into the Federal Service to the time it would be sent to a concentration camp, and bearing in mind that during the month it must do its recruiting, train its personnel, and perform the many other incidents preparatory to field service? Very good. ■ What are the weakest features of the organization for field service? 1. Lack of opportunity to drill in extended order and combat exercises. 2. Lack of appreciation by the Quartermaster Sergeants of their duties in taking care of company property and handling sup - plies on the march. t Company officers do not exercise sufficient supervision in the care and preparation of the ration, or In the care of property </seg>
            <seg id="p223">ADJUTANT (JKNKKAI.S KKI-OKT 223 In camp and on the march. This, in my opinion, can be over- come by instruction, and is thought to be due more to lack of knowledge than to other causes. ■ What are the most encouraging features of the organization? Willingness of both officers and men to learn, and the interest taken in their work. Errors are quickly corrected. The class of the personnel is very good. All men show intelligence and an 'interest in their work. Few men appeared too young to withstand hardship; only one or two were noticed. The discipline of the regiment was very good. Breaches of the same in the companies were handled by the company com - jnanders. This regiment showed great progress in field training during the short period it was in camp. Due to the change of altitude in the Camp of instruction from what the men were accustomed to. (about 7,000 feet) two days were necessary to make the march from Laramie to camp. One day was spent enroute by train. Tctal, three days enroute to the camp. Returning, one day was spent enroute to Laramie, and one on the train. Total time consumed enroute to and returning from the camp, five days. Time at the camp, five days. The sick report was very low. Many men were affected with sore feet, and a few with exhaustion, due to altitude. If more time could have been spent in the camp, this organization would have profited greatly.

These men were punished when apprehended. C Absenteeism from drills: Strength reports show absentees from drills and other instruction. Two cooks, one man in charge of quarters and one kitchen police were excused from all formations, for drill and instruction. 7. line of liquor in camp: Very little apparent in camp, although the camp was only a couple ot miles from town. 8. Conduct of men off duty in and out of camp: Good. Only a few cases of disorderly conduct reported out of camp. Disorderly conduct in camp noted under "(5)". ■ Straggling on the march or at maneuvers: Practically no straggling. 10. "Espirit" of organization: Good. 1L Supervision by proper officers of records and rosters, of camp police, of comoanv miMM' Company officers of nearly all companies did not give the neces - sary attention to making out morning reports or to police of company incinerators and kitchens. Records at Regimental Headquarters and police of camp were properly supervised. Drill and Instruction rising the Infantry Drill Regulations. 1911, as a guide: Drills: Company close order, fair.

Good. Personnel of officers and enlisted men, excellent. What are the weakest features of the organization for field service? Company officers through lack of experience do not seem to real - ise their duties require them to be in charge of their companies at all times, or in their absence to leave some one in authority in charge; to supervise all formations and the police of kitchens and incinerators; also to see that all records and reports are correct before being submitted. In my opinion this is due to lack of knowledge, and can be overcome by instruction; some of the older officers show their training in this respect is not forgotlen. Some few men appeared to be too young to withstand the hard - ship that would come in a campaign. The staff officers are new, and rapidly picked up the ditfies that they are required to perform. What are the most encouraging features of the organization? The most encouraging features are the interest and intelligence shown by all. If the camp had been for a longer period, the im - provement would have been more marked. Discipline improved as well as the bearing of the men. Drillti improved greatly. Two officers of one company appeared at the inspection in O. D. wool uniform instead of the khaki uniform prescribed. Company I was reorganized two days previous to the camp, and under a new captain it appeared to good advantage, having one of the neatest company streets at the inspection. Although it had not had any drill for some time previous to the camp, and some of the men were recruits, it progressed rapidlv When in camp, company commanders should inspect the rifles daily. The lack of a thorough daily inspection was partly overcome by the Inspector of Small Arms Practice, and the Saturday inspection. WAR DEPARTMENT.!

Attention is invited to the remarks of the Inspector contained In these reports, with especial reference to those parts which hare been underscored. 3. I am further directed by the Secretary of War to express his gratification at the very creditable showing made by the infantry or - ganizations of your State, as indicated by the reports above mentioned. In regard to instruction, conduct, and particularly sanitation. The report on the First Infantry Indicates a high state of discipline, and in both regiments it is gratifying to note that there is a realization on the part of officers and men of the necessity of having their rifles in good condi- 4. The following defects are noted: (a) In both regiments the men were not supplied with proper inarching shoes. In the First Infantry this resulted, according to the report of the inspector, in about 50 per cent of the men having sore feet when inspected by the surgeon at the end of the encampment. This per - centage was found principally in ten companies, in all of which the men were reported as having various styles and shapes of high shoes. In two companies of the same regiment where the men had the marching shoe. It is stated that very few sore feet were found. The importance of hav - ing the infantryman's feet in such condition that he can march when necessary is so obvious that comment is unnecessary. Steps should be taken to secure a proper marching shoe. t(b) It is regretted that the enlisted personnel of both regiments i weak numerically. The regulations for the Organized Militia pro - for a minimum strength of 732 men. in the First Infantry, the rt shows but 563. Of this number there were 510 in camp, with a absentee list from drills of 93. In the Second Infantry, the report shows an enlisted strength of 417, with 374 in camp, and a daily absentee list of 90. The number of absentees daily from each organization was out of all proportion to any possible camp requirement, and the number of men in each regiment who received the instruction so necessary to make it an efficient field organization was, in proportion to the authorized strength, lamentably small. While the difficulties under which the Or - ganized Militia labors in Its efforts to obtain recruits are understood by this office, it is hoped that some means may be found by which the organ - izations can be raised to at least an approximate of the minimum strength required, and that it will be possible in the future to take into camp a greater number of men for the training which is so necessary to make them efficient for field work.

Sir — I have the honor to make the following report of my tour of duty at the State Penitentiary, from March 14, 1912, to March 24, 1912: March 14, 1912. I At 2:30 p.m. I was notified to form my company; by 3 p.m. I had lty men in armory and three musicians on the street: 3:30 p.m sixty - men in ranks, wired to hold till further orders; at 4 p.m. left armory ■tate house in blinding blizzard, snow knee deep. Arrived 4:20 p.m. Ipped men with overcoats and riot amunition; took car on South rteenth for C, B. £ Q. railroad depot; from there took special engine one car for pen.; arrived at 5:30 p.m. I Upon arrival at pen. Gen. Phelps gave me orders to put the place er martial law and to kill the first convict that made any opposition, i were immediately posted on the wall and in the cell houses, as well a the yard. The reliefs were given two hours on duty and four hours West cell house more or less noisy during the night. At 6:20 a.m. I took a detachment of men and searched the cave north of prison and surrounding country, but could find no trace, as snow had drifted during, the night. Returned at 6:30 a.m. March 15, 1912. BThe remainder of the morning was put in by myself and Lieut. Gelhaar general reconnaissance of the place. Trusties were selected to run boiler room, kitchen and chapel room. I At 2:30 p.m. the noise became intense in west cell house. I immedi - r gave orders, so that all prisoners could hear, to "shoot the first man opened his face." About five minutes later six shots were fired on south side in the west and center part of cell house; upon investiga- I found that the shots were fired into the cells on the top gallery lery F). One man (colored) received a scalp wound. Noise imme - ely subsided. Evening spent in planning a general search of prisoners and prison by Gen. Phelps, Maj. Birkner, Maj. Antles, myself, and Lieut. Gelhaar. Night brought no extraordinary action. March 16, 1912. ■Convicts taken out of cells by sections, stripped, and searched, as well leir cells. All their property I had carried up Into chapel room. At 10 o'clock took Prince (convict murderer of deputy) over to bath ■At 12 o'clock p.m. blankets arrived from armory; men were forced to ? on chapel floor throughout. Afternoon spent in searching west cell house. Night spent peacefully. March 17, 1912. ■Water supply gave out. Unable to remedy until March 18, 1912, 2 ck p.m. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">233 Searching continued throughout until evening, finishing west cell At 11 o'clock a.m. two convicts placed in dungeon for back talk and profanity. March 18, 1912. Searching continued. At 8:15 o'clock a.m. sent Lieut. Oelhaar and five marksmen with order* to report to Sheriff Hyero at C. B. &amp; Q. At 5:10 p.m. sheriff, lieutenant, and the three escaped convicts arrived. Convict Morley placed in dungeon. The two dead convicts turned over to coroner. Night spent peacefully. March 19, 1912. ■Cell house searching finished; searching in broom factory and yard • es commenced. Beliefs cut down. Men more or less fatigued. All soldiers ordered he, and clean underwear was issued. Weather moderated March 20, 1912. All convicts put to work in shops and former positions. Capt. Kesterson arrived to inspect firearms of former prison guards; found to be in not only poor but in criminal condition. The captain remains until company is relieved, acting in Lieut. Gel - haar's place from March 22, 1912, on. Et 11 p.m. shots on south wall; call for the corporal of the guard; a ore shots and call for officer of the guard. Upon investigation and a i around the wall proved to be nothing of mentioning importance. Remainder of the night spent peacefully. March 21, 1912. Compete spelldown with men off duty Day and night spent peacefully. March 22, 1912. Lieutenant relieved from duty. Guard cut down twenty men. March 23, 1912. Kompany relieved. Left penitentiary 11:30 o'clock a.m. Arrived at y 12:2u p.m. K conclusion, I have the honor to make the following suggestions in nizing and putting the state prison on a sound and safe basis: 1. Work for convicts— More hard labor is necessary. 2. Food for convicts — Present ration satisfactory. I think that if the state would hire ex-soldiers of non-commissioned rank from the regular army as guards, also militiamen who have had enough service and responsibility to pass them as handlers of men, and with such guards take the better class of the prisoners, divide them into gangs and put them to work on the state roads, putting the more danger - ous prisoners in a stone quarry owned by the' state, the material from the </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 I would also suggest that a building be built across the road north of main entrance to prison for the warden and deputy, thus taking away the prison effect from their homes. Rln the winter, when roadwork is impossible, I would suggest a sort of tary drill for the more idle prisoners, this being good exercise and mak - them easier to handle at all times. E would also suggest that heavy screening be placed over all the windows on north side of both cell houses to prevent any r— "'«| cles when the windows are open. I would further suggest that the guards be required to take a certain amount of rifle practice on the range south of prison each month. KThe officers and men of Co.
