            <seg id="p005">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL To His Excellency, Charles W. Bryan, Governor of Nebraska. Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith the biennial report of the attorney general for the biennium from January 5, 1933 to January 3, 1935. It is customary in such a report to tpuch in narrative form upon some of the principal occurrences during the period and to make recommendations for reforms and improvement, in so far as the experience of the attorney general has shown the need for such reforms. ■ ■ ■'-."' 1 The record of this office during the two years that I have held office is quite fully set forth in the details of the report. It is unnecessary to repeat those details in a report of this nature. I believe that in handling the legal affairs of the State I have had, at least a normal amount of success, both in: court actions and in administrative affairs. The credit for this success should go largely to my able and loyal assistants, Mr. George W. Ayres, Mr. Paul P. Chancy, Mr. C. G. Perry, Mr. Wm. C. Ramsey, Mr. Daniel Stubbs, Mr. Edwin Vail and Mr. Wm. H. Wright. ■ • ■ ■ The demands made upon the time of the attorney general are bo exacting that it has been difficult for me to give the personal attention which I like to devote to litigation for which I am responsible. The work that has been done in this office, of a strict- </seg>

            <seg id="p008">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ly legal nature, has been done largely by the assistants above named, although in so far as other official demands permitted, I have earnestly devoted my time to litigation on behalf of the State. CRIME It is difficult to make any specific recommendations for re - form or improvements for the solution of our present extremely difficult problems in this connection. I would classify such re - commendations as I have to make under the headings of (First) enforcement officers, (Second) prosecuting officers, and (Third) criminal procedure. Enforcement Officers. There is no substitute for a capable and efficient body of enforcing officers. I would recommend that the present local enforcement of law be supplemented by a body of trained state officers, operating under the dirction of the Governor in the State Sheriff's office. The appropriation made by the legislature for the operation of this office is so woefully inadequate that the persons in charge of it have been unable to show their true ability to solve crimes and capture ciriminals. I would strongly urge that a very much larger appropriation be made, so that an effi - cient force of deputy state sheriffs could be organized to cover the State and to cooperate with the county authorities in all mat - ters of major crime, including of course, bank robbery and other crimes committed by violence or the threat of violence. ■ Prosecuting Officers. Our statutes are built upon the theory of local power and responsibility, although the attorney general is given the power in any county to do all in such county that a county attorney could do. The appropriation given to the attorney general's office is not sufficiently great so that he can organize a force of prosecutors to supplant the county attorneys, even if he should so desire. I am not recommending, under our present system, that this be done. I have loyally tried to cooperate in carrying out the system above described and it has beeen my policy never to interfere 'in a criminal matter in any county unless either </seg>
            <seg id="p009">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the county attorney requests assistance, or I am convinced that the county attorney is not doing his duty. This has been my declared policy ami I am glad to report that in no instance have I been compelled to act on the theory that the county at - torney was not doing his duty, but on the contrary, in every case in which the attorney general's office assisted in 1 the prosecution, it was at the request and with the fullest cooperation from the county attorney. It may be that the time is not ripe for the recommendation which I am about to suggest. I feel, however, that a system of district attorneys, operating under the direction of the attorney general, would make for the better enforcement of the criminal law. I would suggest that these district attorneys be appointed by the attorney general with the approval of the district judge or judges of the district where the district attorney would be ap - pointed to serve. I believe that such a method would bring about a more efficient and even enforcement of fjho law at less ex - pense to the taxpayers; and it would provide a solution of the present difficulties relating to criminal appeals. Criminal appeals are handled on behalf of the State by the attorney general's office and in practically all instances the actual trial of the case, including the information or indictment and all preliminary steps, have been prepared by the county attorney without consultation with or assistance from the attorney general's office. I have at all times been glad to render assistance to county attorneys in all such steps of their proceedings, but unfortunately this offer has not been taken advantage of in many instances where pitfalls might have been avoided had the county attorney consulted this office. Criminal Procedure. Our criminal procedure is made the target of many criti - cisms by lawyers and by laymen. It has, of course, been develop - ed out of the experienc of many generations and should not be lightly abolished. I believe, however, that the model code of criminal procedure drafted and proposed by the American Law Institute should be adopted, both because it would simplify criminal procedure and because it would give the prosecution a fair chance as against the highly technical and often obstructive tactics of the attorneys for the persons accused. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL This code was drafted by experts in criminal procedure both from the point of view and theory of practice. PARDONS AND PAROLES This subject is one in which I have taken a great interest while I have been a member of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. I am heartily in favor of the present system and T believe that a wise and careful administration thereof will assist in the reform of criminals, thereby operating to a large extent as a crime pre - ventive measure. T believe that the Board as at present organized is a splendid one and will go far toward carrying out the purpose of the parole act. The greatest care and patience is necessary in selecting those persons who should be paroled and with the eflicient help of Mr. N. T. Harmon, T believe that the Board has operated success - full}' and in accordance with the purpose of the act. It is important also to follow up all cases and keep in close touch with the persons released under parole. In some instances a longer period of parole than the usual nine monihs would be desirable, if individual attention could be given to the cases. 1 would recommend, first, that a competent psychiatrist be employed by the Board to advise the Board upon the mental aspects of the cases submitted and, second, that two or more deputy parole officers be employed to operate under the direc - tion of the chief parole oflicer and to make personal calls upon the parolee. This would involve the expenditure of more money, but as is the case of a large police force, it would be money economically spent, since I am convinced that, it would result in the reduction of the State's crime bill. NEBRASKA STATIC RAILWAY COMMISSION This office has furnished such aid and assistance to the Nebraska State Railway Commission as lias been requested by them. The time of a member of the Attorney General's force has been placed at their disposal and all requests for opinions, at - tendance on hearings, and advice on such matters as desired, have been promptly honored. This office has also undertaken to </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL (loferid in court] all litigation in which the Comni ssion has been interested nnd liiis also prosecuted ion its behalf all litigation which has boon requested. by the Commission. Amongst important litigation which lias been handled may he mentioned the Omaha tnxicab case, in which the action of the Commission in taking jurisdiction over common carrier laxicabs within the city of Omaha was sustained liy the Supreme Court. One of the most important functions of the work of the Railway Commission is the prosecution and defense of complaints before the Interstate Commerce Commission affecting interstate rail shipments. One of the most important cases in which the Commission has been interested and for which this office has furnished counsel has been the prosecution of the grain rate case, Docket 17,000, part 2. This case has just been decided by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission after several years spent in taking testimony in all parts nf the country. It involved the entire grain rate' structure of the country and is of immense importance to the producers of Nebraska. By the present decision inbound or gathering rates on grain from Nebraska points to the primary markets at Omaha and Kansas City are reduced approximately 20% on an average. This should mean the saving of many hundreds of thousands of dollars to our grain producers. In this connection ithis office also gave attention to the matter maintaining the parity of our pri - mary market at Omaha with other primary markets, particularly Kansas City, which was seeking to gain an advantage over Omaha for the benefit of Kansas producers. BREAD LAW One of the outstanding achievements during! the past two years was the affirmance by the United States Supreme Court of our Nebraska 1931 legislation relating to standard weight of loaves of bread. Since 1921 it liaR been the settled policy of the State of Nebraska to require loaves of bread to be of standard weight, thereby protecting the purchaser of bread! against short weights, and protecting the honest bakers against unfair competi - tion. The 1921 law and the 1927 law were respectively held un - constitutional. It was my good fortune to have the privilege </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL of appearing in the United States Supreme Court in defense of our 1931 legislation, and this was sustained by that court. COMMUNISTIC ACTIVITIES It has been my settled policy to foster and favor free speech, while at the same time suppressing all forms of violence. The depression has, naturally, increased the appeal of the communis - tic and un-American agitators, with the result that from time to time there have been outbreaks of violence. In each of sucli instances I have cooperated with the county authorities in speedy and vigorous prosecutions. Noteworthy in these prosecutions are those in Wilbur in the Spring of 1933 and in Loup City in the spring and summer of 1934. In each case the prosecution was successful and the outbreaks of violence ceased. In each case the violence was the result of agitation by outside agencies and not the reflection of the spirit of the community. I believe that, as a result of these prosecutions we have had a minimum amount of disorder in the state and that we have avoid - ed such unfortunate occurrences as have happened in some of our neighboring states. %* I am firmly convinced that no attempt should be made to suppress freedom of speech, which affords a safety valve or out - let to discontent; but that the authorities should at all times be ready to curb violence when it breaks out. IRRIGATION It has been my good fortune to be able to assist the Depart - ment of Roads and Irrigation in many particulars in maintaining order in the administration of the waters of the State. There have been very grave difficulties, due to the drought and the fail - ing water supply, which required the closing down of many ditches which have been operating until the present time, but a shortage of water made acute the situation which has been a dif - ficult one for many years in connection with the Mitchell Irriga - tion District; and I am happy to report tjhat the district court of Scotts Bluff County has recently held that the Mitchell Irriga - tion District must comply with our state laws and must not take water, except in the order of its priority. I believe that this decis - ion will do a great deal toward an orderly administration of the </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL j ' . waters of the North Platte River and toward obtaining the co - operation of all districts in obeying the law of priority. INTERSTATE WATER CONTROVERSIES During the time that I have held office there have been two main subjects of interstate controversy, namely: the claims of Colorado to the right to divert the head waters of the North Platte River for the purpose of irrigation in another water - shed, and likewise, the Wyoming controversy, j which is the subject matter of a law suit which I have commenced in the United States Supreme Court. With regard to the first: The claims of Colorado now seem to be dormant. I had the honor to be one of the commission representing Nebraska at conferences in Denver and in Washing - ton, in which Colorado vigorously pressed its claims. We have plot yielded an inch in maintaining Nebraska's interests and I believe tjhat in the event of any further claims on the part of Colorado, Nebraska can continue to maintain her priorities ami that they will not be ultimately diminished, provided the same watchfulness is continued that has been the policy of the Depart - ment of Roads and Irrigation for many years. In relation to Wyoming, it became my duty in September 1934 to commence a suit in the United States Supreme Court. This suit has only just been commenced and it will probably take several' years be - fore its completion. It became necessary -for the reason that the ac - tual and threatened acts of Wyoming substantially diminished the flow of the river to the detriment of many priorities in Ne - braska, which are earlier than the Wyoming ones which are now being operated and which are earlier than the Wyoming projects now being developed. There are three main objects of this suit : First. To bring about cooperation on the part of the state irrigation administrators of Wyoming so that in the administra - tion of the river they will not allow Wyoming irrigators witli later priorities to take water where it is needed in J Nebraska for priorities earlier than those of such Wyoming irrigators. Second. In order to prevent the storage of water in the Pathfinder and Guernsey reservoirs when the water is needed in Nebraska by direct flow appropriators whose priorities are earlier than the priorities established for the two reservoirs respectively. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Third. In order to prevent the establishment of a priority date of 1004 for the Casper-Aleova project which has been com - menced only within the last year. In my opinion, each of these objectives must be accomplished or Nebraska's irrigation will substantially suffer. If Nebraska were to sit by and allow Wyoming to continue to enforce its plans and its present practices, in my judgment there would be little or no water left for Nebraska. CONCLUSION In conclusion, I wish again to express my gratitude to the staff of my office which has so loyally cooperated in every respect in everything that 1 have done. I have had the most cordial relations with all departments of the State anl likewise with such Federal authorities as hare been in 1(ouch with my office. 1 have enjoyed the two years term of office. I cannot, however, conclude this report without referring to the matter of the salary. The attorney general's office must re - present the State in all types of litigation and in doing so fre - quently must oppose lawyers whose earning power is many times that of the salary of- the attorney general. The State should have attorneys who are as capable as those who oppose it in its various litigation. I feel thn.1) the action of the last legislature in attempting to reduce the salary of the attorney general to ?-l,OO().OO a year was extremely short-sighted and in the long run, if sustained by the courts, will cause loss to the State;. In - stead of being reduced, (lie salary of the attorney general should be increased to not less than §7,500.00 a year. This would be little enough in view of the tremendous responsibilities and the type of work which must be done. Respectfully submitted, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. </seg>

            <seg id="p054">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ LEGISLATURE— ELECTRIC VOTING MACHINE January 12, 1933. Hor.. George W. O'Malley, Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Paul Halpine, Jr., Chairman, Rules Committee, Senate. Dear Sirs: You ask if the use of the electric voting machines now installed in the legislative chambers complies with the provisions of section 11, article III of the Constitution of Nebraska which reads as follows: "Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings and publish them (except such parts as may require secrecy) and the yeas and nays of the members on any question, shall at the desire of any two of them be entered on the journal. All votes in either House shall be viva vocc. The doors of each House and of Committee of the Whole, shall be open, unless when the business shall be such as ought to be kept secret. Neither House shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days." I assume, as I am informed, that a vote on said machines is open and un - concealed and makes a public, permanent record of the aye and nay vote of each individual member. In my opinion the use of said machines complied with the con - stitutional provisions above quoted. The question is simply the con - struction to be given the words viva voce and it seems clear that the framers of the constitution and those who adopted it did not mean to use them in the sense of their literal translation but meant to designate and require an open, public, unconcealed vote as distinguished from a secret vote which is required under the general suffrage laws. A number of courts have had before them the question of whether or not the use of a voting machine violated the constitutional provision requiring votes at a general election to be by ballot. The courts have uniformly held that the requirement of vote by ballot could not be construed liter - ally but was intended to impose a secret vote rather than an open vote designated by the use of viva voce, and that the use of the voting machine did not violate this provision. People v. Taylor, 257 111. 192, 100 N E 534 (1912) ; State v. Green, 121 Ohio St. 301, 168 N. E. 131 (1929) 'and cases cited in 63 A. L. R., 855. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">OPINIONS . . i ■ In not one of the ten states in wliich the question has been raised did the court hold the contrary. The reasoning in these decisions is well expressed in State v. Grsen, supra in which the court said: "The basis of the decisions is that the word 'ballot' as used in the constitution, the statutes, and in political literature generally, means secret voting in contia-distinction to viva voce, or open-voting We think that the constitutional provi - sion was meant merely to relate to the essential secrecy of the indication of the vbter's choice; that this secrecy has been demonstrated to be retained and embraced by the use of vot - ing machines." Bouvier's law dictionary d&lt; fines viva voce thus, "it is sometimes oppose 1 to ballot; as, the people vote by ballot, but their representatives vote viva voce." It seems clear from th use decisions that the provision of the con - stitution referred to intendi only to impose upon the legislative bodies of the state a vote which v ill be public and unconcealed and that the use of the voting machines does not violate that provision. I would suggest, however, that if the branches of the legislature deem it advisable, that upoji declaring a vote each member orally call "yea" or "nay" as the case jnay be at the same time he records his vote on the voting machine. This procedure should remove any doubt about compliance with the s :ction of the constitution above set forth. I also suggest that the rules of the house and senate be amended to conform to the situation occasioned by the use of the voting machines. Suggestions as to new rules for this purpose are submitted herewith Respectfully submitted, PAUL F. GOOD, Attorney General. Suggested Changes in Senate Rules Rule 43.

Rule 45. A call of the senate must be seconded by at least seven mem - bers.

COUNTY-FUNDS, DEPOSITED IN BANK WHICH FAILS, LIABILITY OF COUNTY TREASURER February 7, 1933. Mr. Fred H. Richards, Jr. County Attorney, ■ ** Fremont, Nebraska. Dear Sir: j I am answering your letter of inquiry of the 4th instant. I will say that in my opinion a clerk of the district court, a county judge, county clerk, or a sheriff is legally liable on his bond for money coming into his hands which belongs to the county, but which he has deposited in a bank where it is lost through failure of the bank. I do not recall any provision of statute which authorizes any one of such officers to deposit county money in a bank, and in case he does make such a deposit, his liability, I take it, is analogous to that of a county treasurer who has deposited money in a bank without any lawful authority so to do. In the case of Bush v. Johnson County, 48 Neb. 1, the Supreme Court of this state said: &lt; "The duty imposed on a county treasurer by law, and assumed by him, of safely keeping, accounting for and turning </seg>
            <seg id="p057">OPINIONS over the public funds which come into his hands by virtue of his office, is an absolute one; and where his bond is conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of the office by him, the sureties on the bond are bound and liable in like manner and their responsibility is the same as that of their principal, and it will be no defense for either of the parties in an action on the bond to recover public funds, predicated on an alleged failure of the treasurer to account for or pay them over, that the funds have been lost or stolen without the fault or negligence of the treasurer." In the case of Northern 'Pacific R. R. Co. v. Owens, 8G Minn. 188, 90 N. W. 371, the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that: "The clerk and the sureties on his official bond are liable absolutely for the loss of a fund received by him in his official capacity, but subsequently lost by the failure of the bank in which he deposited the! same, although the clerk was without fault." In 15 C. J. at page 521 thereof, in speaking of liability of county officers for county funds in I their hands, it is said: "The general proposition with respect to the liability of such officers and their sureties for the loss of public moneys is well settled, that, where the statute in direct terms or from its general tenor imposes the duty to pay over public moneys re - ceived and held as such, and no condition limiting that obliga - tion is discoverable in the statute, the obligation thus imposed on and assumed by the: officer will be deemed to be absolute. Accordingly it has been held that the fact that such moneys have been stolen without any fault or negligence on the part of the officer will not; exonerate him or his sureties from liability on the bond, and that it makes no difference that the county has failed to provide a safe or suitable place where its funds may be kept. It is also well settled that, if funds are lost by failure of a bank in which an officer has deposited them, the officer and his bondsmen are liable, notwithstanding the fact that he was guilty of no negligence in selecting the bank, and notwithstanding the further fact that the county has failed to provide a safe place of deposit for the public fund." </seg>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL A literal reading of Section 33-137 seems to indicate that in such a case an officer may be guilty of a misdemeanor even though he is in - nocent of any intentional doing, if he fails through the inability to do so, to pay over county money deposited by him in a bank and lost through the bank's failure; but I take it that in such a case, if the officer does the best he can to turn over the money and -was not negligent in making the deposit, it will hardly be worth while to prosecute him for a criminal offense. i ■ Very sincerely, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. By Geo. W. Ayres, Assistant Attorney General. SCHOOLS — POWERS OF BOARD February 10, 1933. Honorable Rudolph Tesar, House of Representatives, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether the provisions of Section 79-2705 Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, relating to the members of the board of education of metropolitan cities and their selection may be changed by action of the school district of Omaha under Chapter 18 Article 5, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, without action of the legislature. It is our opinion that the school district of Omaha is without power to change the method of selecting members of the board of education of the same, as provided by section 79-2705 above. School districts are creatures of statute and have no powers not granted by the legislature. American Surety Co. v. School Dist. 117 Neb. 6 (1928). Article 5 of Chapter 18 above referred to does not pur - port to give school districts any authority to regulate the form or se - lection of boards of education. The powers to enact ordinances and resolutions by initiative and referendum granted by the said article are expressly limited to the subjects upon which the city or municipal sub - divisions therein named have been granted the power elsewhere to legis - late. Section 18-502 provides: </seg>
            <seg id="p059">OPINIONS "The word 'ordinance' where used in this article, shall mean and include ordinances, orders, resolves, agreements, contracts and any measure which it i* within the power of the legislative authorities, of such city or other municipal subdi - vision of this state to enact or give the force and effect of law." Very sincerely, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. By Daniel Stubbs, Assistant Attorney General. COUNTY— FUNDS, WARRANTS AGAINST, ISSUANCE OF, February, 21, 1933. Mr. Ernest Hubka, County Attorney, Beatrice, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say: "The county general fund is to the point of eighty-five per cent of the 1932 levy, and estimate for the year 1933 has been made and published. "Kindly inform me whether the county has the power and authority to approve salary claims for elected officials, deputies, assistants and persons hired by the county board, and after approval issue warrants for the same." I am of the opinion that the county board may approve salary claims for elected officials, deputies and assistants at least to the amount of 85 per cent of the 1933 levy after the January estimate has been made in cases where the statute fixes the salaries of the officers, deputies and assistants or provides the county board may fix it, and further provides that such salaries shall be paid out of the general fund in monthly or quarterly installments. I assume, in mak - ing this statement, that where the county board is given power to fix the salaries, that power has been exercised. You will note that Section 26-116 Compiled Statutes was passed in 1879 and was last amended in 1883. This is the section of statute </seg>
            <seg id="p060">.RErOKT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL which provides that no warrants shall be issued in excess of eighty - five per cent of the amount of tax levied for the current year, unless there is money in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund for its payment. At the time that section of the statute was passed, and at the time it was last amended, most of the county officers, if they were paid salaries at all, were paid out of the fees of their respective offices. To illustrate, take the case of the sheriff, who was paid out of the fees of his office prior to 1907. In that year the law was changed so as to provide he was to be paid a salary in monthly installments, payable each month by warrant drawn on the general fund. The fees earned by him are required to be turned into the general fund. It seems to me to be entirely consistent and proper to hold that the later and special provision regarding the payment of the sheriff's salary prevails wherever there is an apparent conflict over the earlier and more general provisions of statute, which direct that no warrant shall bo drawn in excess of 85 per cent of the levy for the current year, unless there is money in the treasury with which to pay it. Aside from this, the Supreme Court of this state held in the case of Austin Mfg. Co. v. Brown County, and in the later case of Central Bridge and Construction Company v. Saundcrs County, reported in 10G Neb. at page 484 thereof that: "It is not unlawful for a county board, after estimate made and prior to its meeting as a board of equalization, to anticipate the levy for the current year, and contract an indebtedness upon a particular fund within the estimate, although there is at the time no money in the treasury to the credit of such fund the payment of the indebtedness, if in contracting such indebtedness the board remains within the limits, prescribed by the constitution and the statutes." No reason occurs to me why a like rule should not be applicable in the case of the allowance of county warrants, although inasmuch as the Supreme Court has not yet passed upon that precise question, the answer may not be entirely free from doubt. ■i I Respectfully submitted, Paul F.

Swanson, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 20lh instant enclosing the "Amendment to Articles of Incorporation" of the J. W. Kerns Lumber Company is at hand. You inquire as follows: "You will note that the original articles expired by limitation on the 15th day of January, 1933, at which time the new document was drawn up; and that the intention of the parties is not clear as to whether they wished the new document to serve as an amendment to the original articles or to serve in the formation of a new corporation. "I would appreciate your opinion as to whether we should proceed on the theory that the new document is a new articles of incorporation and collect an additional fee for filing same; or whether, we should leave the matter as it now stands — that is, accept the new document as an amendment to the original articles. Also, if the view is taken that the old incorporation has expired, is it necessary that notice of disso - lution be filed in this office?" You are advised that in our opinion the articles submitted and the correspondence relating thereto clearly shows an intention to amend the original articles. Since the said amendment to said articles of incorporation was executed on the day prior to the expir - ation of the corporation, the directors and stockholders therein had ample power to amend the original articles in the respects shown. There is no statutory provision requiring such amendment to be filed prior to the expiration of the corporation. Therefore, we believe you should file same as an amendment. *■ </seg>
            <seg id="p062">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It should be noticed that the amendments include raising the paid up capital stock from $17,500.00 to $30,500.00. This amendment will raise the amount of occupation tax when it becomes due. (Section 24-1703, Compiled Statutes for 1929). You further ask the status of a corporation where the amendment extending the life of the corporation is executed after the expiration of the original articles by limitation. Section 24-220, Compiled Stat - utes for 1929 provides that on expiration of charter, a corporation may act to close its affairs but for no other purpose. In view of this section, it is our opinion that in the situation stated, the officers and stockholders are without power to amend the articles so as to extend the life of the corporation, and their acts can only be effective as a reincorporation, which should be treated by your office for purposes of determining the fee to be charged as original articles of incorporation.

Johnson, General Counsel, The Federal Land Bank of Omaha, Redick Tower, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of January 31 to the Attorney General, referred to the undersigned for answer, beg to say that we have care - fully examined the question of exemption of the Federal Land Bank of Omaha from liability for automobile registration, and also for the payment of tax included in the purchase price of gasoline purchased by it in connection with automobiles owned by the Bank and operated by its fieldmen. There can be no dispute as to the general rule regarding taxation as between the federal government and the several state governments. This rule is epitomized in 37 Cyc, pages 878-879. </seg>
            <seg id="p063">OPINIONS "The necessary independence of the federal and state governments imposes a limitation upon the taxing power of each. Neither can so exercise its own power of taxation as to curtail the rightful powers of the other, or interfere with the free discharge of its constitutional- functions, or obstruct, em - barrass, or nullify its legitimate operations, or destroy the means or agencies employed by it. in the exercise of those powers and functions." .-■.■■ - "According to this rule it is not within the power of a state to lay any tax on the instruments, means or agencies provided or selected by the United. States government to enable it to carry into execution its legitimate powers and functions - * ♦ *» We also note that in our automobile registration law (Section 60-314, as amended by Laws 1931, Chapter 107) and also in our law providing for a tax upon motor vehicle fuel (Section 66-405, C. S., 1929), there is an exemption as to the United States government, which extends in the: latter case to its agencies. The question presented here turns squarely on the proposition of whether the Federal Land Bank is an agency or instrumentality of the federal government. If it is such an agency, it cannot be subjected to the payment of an automobile license fee while in the exercise of its proper functions. On the question of the gasoline tax, if it were not for the decision in Panhandle Oil Company vs. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, and Indian Motor - cycle Company vs. United States, 283 U. S. 570, we should regard it as a very doubtful question as to whether even the government itself would be entitled to purchase gasoline tax free. In the Panhandle Oil Company case, Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, three others of the judges also dissenting. Mr. Justice Holmes says (p. 224): "To come down more closely to the question before us, when the Government comes into a State to purchase I do not perceive why it should be entitled to stand differently from any other purchaser. It avails itself of the machinery fur - nished by the State and I do not see why it should not con- </seg>
            <seg id="p064">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL tribute in the Fame proportion that every other purchaser contributes for the privileges that it uses. It has no better or other right to use them than anyone else. The cost of maintaining- the State that makes the business possible is just as necessary an element in the cost of production as labor or coal. If the plaintiff in error had paid the tax and had added it to the price, the Government would have had nothing to say. It could take the gasoline or leave it but it could not require the seller to abate his charge even if it had been arbitrarily increased in the hope of getting more from the Government than could be got from the public at large. But in fact the Government has not attempted to say anything in this case, which is simply that of a dealer trying to cut down a legitimate tax on his business because certain purchasers proposed to use the goods in a certain way, although so far as the sale was concerned they were free to turn the gasoline into the ocean, use it for private purposes or sell it again." In the Indian Motoi*cycle Company case, Mr. Justice Holmes con - curred solely because of the decision in the Panhadle Oil Company case, and Mr. Justice Stone dissented on the ground that the rule in the Panhandle Oil Company case should not be extended. We are well aware of the limits which have been set to the imposition of taxes upon national banks, and we think it is well estab - lished that no privilege or excise tax may be imposed upon such banks. National banks have long been held to be governmental agencies, established for the purpose of enabling the government to exercise its power to 'regulate the currency. (26 R.C.L. 10D). The establishment of the national bank system was undertaken to restore that control over the currency which the federal government had lost after the Bank of the United States was abolished. We suggest that this is probably one of the reasons which impelled the courts to recognize the character of the banks as an essential governmental agency, even though they might be entirely under private ownership. A case which is illustrative of the true principle which we con - ceive to underline the principle of exemption is the case of Clallam County vs. United States, 263 U. S. 341. This had to do with the right of the United States Spruce Production Corporation to exemp - tion from state taxes. This corporation was formed under a law author - izing the Director of Aircraft Production to fprm one or more corpora - tions under the law of any state for the purchase, production, manu - facture and sale of aircraft or equipment or materials therefore, etc., </seg>
            <seg id="p065">OPINIONS whenever in his judgment it would facilitate the production of aircraft, etc., for the United States, etc., "in the prosecution of the present war. Mr. Justice Holmes writes the opinion of the court and states the case thus, on page 344: "In short the Spruce Production Corporation was organ - ized by the United States as an instrumentality for carrying on the war, all its property was conveyed to it by or bought with money coming from the United States and was used by it solely as means to that end, and when the war was over it stopped its work except so far as it found it necessary to go on in order to wind up its affairs. When the winding up is accomplished there will be a loss, but whatever assets may be realized will go to the United State. Upon these facts im - munity is claimed from taxation by a State." ■ ■ . '■ The learned Justice, however, makes this very vital and illumin - ating observation (p. 345) : "This is not like the case of a corporation having its own purposes as well as those of the United States and interested in profit on its own account. The incorporation and formal e " C , tl0 "°! * " eW P" 80 ™!^ was only for the convenience ot the United States to carry out its ends." ■ The decision, of course, in the Clallam County case was in favor of exemption of the production corporation, but was based as we view it on the ground that the corporation was created only for the purpose of permitting the United States government to carry out its aims and purposes. We find, however, that the Supreme Court of the United States early recognized that the mere fact that the government might be interested in a business institution does not necessarily constitute that institution a government instrumentality. This is pointed out in United States vs. Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, where Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said (p. 907) : "It is, we think, a sound principle, that when a govern - ment becomes a partner in any trading company, it divests itself, so far as concerns the transactions of that company, of its sovereign character, and takes that of a private citizen. Instead of communicating to the company its privileges and its </seg>
            <seg id="p066">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL prerogatives, it descends to a level with those with whom it associates itself, and takes the character which belongs to its associates, and to the business which is to be transacted." This rule was applied in a case in the Circuit Court of Appeals, which went up from our own District of Nebraska, Metropolitan Sav - ings Bank and Trust Company vs. Farmers State Bank, 20 Fed. (2d) 775. In this latter case, our Guaranty Fund Commission had taken over and was operating a state bank as a going concern under the pro - visions of the Nebraska law. It was sought for that reason to exempt it from suit as an agency of the state government. This status was denied it by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal land banks are organized under the provisions of Chapter 7, Title "12", U.S.C.A., which together with the organization certificate, provided for in Section 674, evidencing an acceptance of the terms of the grant of powers made in the statute, constitutes the char - ter of the bank. It is true that under the provisions of Section 695, it is the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to subscribe any unsubscribed portion of the minimum capital of the bank, but it is not essential that the United States shall hold any particular portion of the stock, or in fact, any of it at all. It is true that by Section 701 it is provided that a land bank shall be a depository of public moneys and may also be employed as a financial agent of the government, but it is specifically provided that the bank shall give security to the Secretary of the Treasury for all moneys deposited, and further provided, that no government funds may be invested in mortgage loans or farm loan bonds. This same provision is also applicable to joint-stock land banks. Section 696 provides for the retirement of the original stock after subscriptions to the capital stock by the National Farm Mortgage Association shall reach a speci - fied amount. Section 991 is a further regulatory statute, providing for government deposits in land banks and the purchase of farm loan bonds by the Secretary of the Treasury, but is designed on its face as merely a temporary proposition to help the banks get started. The purpose that we discern from this statute is not to make the Federal Land Bank a government owned or government controlled institution, but merely to provide for government aid in establishing </seg>
            <seg id="p067">OPINIONS . . - . a privately owned institution on a sound footing so that it may accom - plish the purpose for which it is designed. However, this conclusion does not solve the question before us. We take it that the functions of the government may be manifested as well through a privately owned institution as through an institution owned and controlled en - tirely by the government. What we should look to is the object and purposes to be ac - complished. If the object and purpose of the corporation is to make money for its investors and the government is merely participating in this with them, no governmental functions are involved. If, on the other band, the government is using this means to exercise some power or duty imposed upon it by the Constitution, then the fact that the insti - tution is privately owned is immaterial. This is the doctrine to which we have before adverted, and which has been applied in the case of national banks. Of course, there is a distinction in such cases between an excise and a property tax. An excise tax which affects the right of the institution to carry on its business is a direct invasion of the powers of the federal government and may be said to hamper and impede the instrumentality which the Government has erected, whereas a property tax has no such results. If we were to consider the land bank simply as an investment banking institution, earning dividends for its stockholders, and in no way concerned with the operations of the United States Treasury with regard to currency or other fiscal matters, it might be hard to perceive any constitutional powers of the United States which are being mani - fested through their agency. If we consider, however, the purpose for which the land banks were created, a different view-point may have to be assumed. This purpose is well-know and the courts will undoubtedly take judicial knowledge of it. The purpose was to aid agriculture through providing a means whereby farmers might obtain long-time credit at a low rate of interest. We must conceive of this as a measure designed for the general welfare of the United States by means of a provision designed to bene - fit a very large class of its population, whose interests are so inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p068">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL mingled with those of the population generally that their amelioration would result in a general betterment of the condition of the people of the United States as a whole. i So considered, the act is within the purview of Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of the United States, under the general welfare clause. It follows logically that the United States in establishing this bank, and making provisions for its operation did not act solely with the idea of providing a means whereby investors might secure dividends, or whereby it might itself participate in the same, but that the main purpose was, as we have pointed out, the amelioration of the condition of agriculture and of the country as a whole. So considered, we cannot see any essential difference between the position of the Federal Land Bank and national banks generally. Considering the matter of license tax on automobiles purchased by the Bank in this light, it would seem that such a tax would be an excise on the right or privilege of the Bank to use the public highways, and would thus be a direct tax upon its right to do business, as dis - tinguished from a tax upon its property. Along with the above consideration is the express provision of Section 931, Chapter 7, Title "12" U.S.C.A., prohibiting taxation upon land banks, except as to real property. . I ' We are of the opinion that such a tax would be invalid. A much more difficult question is presented by the question of claim of the Land Bank to the right to purchase gasoline free from any state tax. As we have pointed out, that right was granted with the utmost reluctance by the Supreme Court of the United States, even in a case where the agency was a branch of the United States govern - ment itself (Panhandle Oil Co., supra). It was still followed with re - luctance in the Indian Motorcycle Company case, where the agency was a municipal corporation created by a state government. The United States Supreme Court has shown disposition to refuse to extend the doctrine of the Panhandle Oil case, and it appears to us as extremely probable that they might refuse to apply it here, on the ground that the interference was too remote. Mr. Justice Holmes said further in his dissenting opinion in the Panhandle Oil case (p. 225) : </seg>

"I am not aware that the President, the Members of Congress, the Judiciary or, to come nearer to the case, in hand, the Coast Guard or the officials of the Veterans' Hospital, because they are instrumentalities of government and cannot function naked and unfed, hitherto have been held entitled to have their bills for food and clothing cut down so far as their butchers and tailors have been taxed on their sales; and I had not supposed that the butchers and tailors could omit from their tax returns all receipts from the large class of customers to which I have referred. The question of interference with Government, I repeat, is one of reasonableness and degree and it seems to me that the interference in this case is too remote. Metcalf &amp; Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514." I - Mr. Justice McReynolds, in a separate dissenting opinion, states (pp. 225-226) : "I am unable to think that every man who sells a gallon of gasoline to be used by the United States thereby becomes a federal instrumentality, with the privilege of claiming free - dom from taxation by the State. ■ '. ■ ■ I ■ • "The doctrine of immunity is well established, but it ought .not to be extended beyond the reasons which underlie it. Its limitations were well pointed out fifty years ago in Rail - road Company v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 30, 31 — 'It cannot be that a State tax which remotely affects the efficient exercise of a Federal power is for that reason alone inhibited by the Constitution. To hold that would be to deny to the States all power to tax persons or property. Every tax levied by a State withdraws from the reach of Federal taxation a portion of the property from which it is taken, and to that extent . diminishes the subject upon which Federal taxes may be laid. The States are, and they must ever be, coexistent with the National government. Neither may destroy the other. Hence the Federal Constitution must receive a practical construction. Its limitations and its implied prohibitions must not be ex - tended so far as to destroy the necessary powers of the States, or prevent their efficient exercise.' " Again quoting from Mr. Justice Holmes, commenting upon the dicta of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, page 223 : </seg>
            <seg id="p070">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "It seems to me that the State Court was right. I should say plainly right, but for the effect of certain dicta of Chief Justice Marshall which culminated in or rather were founded upon his often quoted proposition that the power to tax is the power to destroy. In those days it was not recognized as it is today that most of the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree. If the States had any power it was assumed that they had all power, and that the necessary alternative was to deny it altogether. But this Court which so often has defeated the attempt to tax in certain ways can defeat an attempt to discriminate or otherwise go too far without wholly abolishing the power to tax. The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court -its. The power to fix rates is the power to destroy if unlimited, but this Court while it endeavors to pre - vent confiscation does not prevent the fixing of rates. A tax is not an unconstitutional regulation in every case where an absolute prohibition of sales would be one." We respectfully submit that there is every reason to believe that the United States Supreme Court would not apply the rule of the Panhandle Oil case to the instant situation. We should be glad to hear from you further in the light of the considerations above set out. Very truly yours, Paul F. Good, Attorney General, E. Vail, Assistant Attorney General.

The court held in the above case that it was not necessary for a vote to be taken separately upon each of the items so increased or added, but that it was sufficient that the bill as a whole passed each house by a three-fifths vote.

            <seg id="p073">OPINIONS Under Section 26-716 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for the year 1929 a county board is authorized to appropriate to the general fund of the county any sinking fund in the county treasury not levied for the payment of any bonded indebtedness; also, all coun - ty money, except school money, remaining on hand and no longer required for the purposes for which the same were levied. Section 26-717 of the Compiled Statutes grants the power to the county board of the respective counties to transfer any unex - pended balance, or any portion thereof, remaining in the county general fund at any time to any other county fund when the inter - ests of the county seem to demand such transfer; provided, in no case shall such transfer reduce the amount of said county general fund below the sum of $2,000. It is therefore our opinion that it would be unnecessary for any further legislative authority to be granted to county boards; that they now have the authority to transfer the above funds of the re - spective counties as they deem advisable. As to the using of the gasoline tax money for the case of the needy, such authority would require an amendment to Section 66-411 which would include an amendment to the title of this act as well as the body of the act. It is our opinion that this act may be amended so as a part of all future gasoline tax money may be paid into the general fund of the county. The act may also provide that unused gasoline tax money now deposited in the county road funds of the respective counties may be transferred to the general fund of the county, providing that contracts have not already been made against it.

In re: Taxation of Foreign Insurance Com - panies. Dear Sir: You have asked our opinion as to the right of foreign insur - ance companies to make certain deductions in computing their "gross premiums" for purposes of taxation, as provided by Sections 77-901, 77-902 and 77-903 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929. The deductions claimed are: first, of premiums returned upon the cancellation of policies before the policy becomes a contract; second, premiums returned as unearned, upon the cancellation of a policy which has partially expired; third, dividends applied in reduc - tion of premiums; and fourth, reinsurance premiums paid by the reporting company to some other insurance company to indemnify the reporting insurance company against loss on account of the risk becoming a claim. With reference to the first three items of deduction, the answer seems to be plain. I am of the opinion that the term "gross amount of premiums received by it for insurance written upon property with- </seg>
            <seg id="p075">OPINIONS in the state" (77-901) and the term "gross amount of premiums re - ceived by it during the preceding calendar year for business done in this state" (77-902) and the term "gross receipts from all business transacted in the state during the preceding calendar year" (77-903) all have substantially the same meaning and all exclude the first three items mentioned above — items of returned premiums, whether be - cause the policy was never actually in force or because the policy was canceled, and likewise dividends. Dividends are generally considered to be refunds or rebates upon a premium. With reference to reinsurance premiums paid, I believe a dif - ferent rule should be applied. The contract of reinsurance is es - sentially a contract of indemnity to the reinsuring company and the premiums paid thereon are an item of expense of doing business rather than having any relation to a return or a deduction from the premium actually received upon the business which has thus been reinsured. In contracts of reinsurance, of the class as to which this deduction is claimed, the company originally writing the insurance remains liable to the insured for the full amount of the policy; its contract with the policyholder is not in any manner affected or al - tered, and as between the policy holder and the company, the pre - mium is fully paid. If the company desires to be protected in part from loss on account of the particular risk, this is an independent matter not involving that premium as originally paid. It has been suggested that double taxation would result if the deduction for reinsurance premiums paid were not permitted. This would not be true, since the two transactions are entirely unrelated and independent. It is true that if the reinsurance were done in Nebraska, so that the reinsuring company would be required to report it as "business done in this state" or "business transacted in this state" or "insur - ance written upon property within the state", the reinsuring com - pany might be required to pay a tax upon the reinsurance premium under one or another of the sections above referred to. Even this would not constitute double taxation, within any legal meaning of the term. However, the tax under consideration is that paid by foreign insurance companies, and these foreign insurance companies neces - sarily enter into the reinsurance contract at their place of business or home office, so that for purposes of taxation the transaction takes </seg>
            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL place out of the state and would probably not be subject to the Ne - braska tax. To permit the deduction of the reinsurance premium from the gross premiums would in effect permit a portion of the gross premium to escape taxation altogether so far as Nebraska is concerned. We believe that the analysis given you in the former attorney general's opinion, under date of August 2, 1932, sufficiently covers the legal question as to whether or not a different measure of taxa - tion can be applied to foreign corporations than that which is ap - plied to domestic companies. The only argument of any persuasive force which has been brought to my attention as to the deduction of reinsurance premiums lies in the administrative practice asserted to have existed for a long period of time in connection with this deduction. This administrative practice, as a practical construction of the terms of the taxing statute has, of course, some weight with the courts. I do not have before me the precise history of the practice in the Department, but I as - sume that it is as asserted by counsel for the objecting insurance com - panies. I do not believe that such an administrative practice is sufficient ground for ignoring what appears to me to be the plain meaning of the statute. The words are "gross receipts", "gross amount of prem - iums received" and "gross receipts" in the three sections respectively. While refunds in the form of dividends, returns of unearned prem - iums, etc. could properly be considered not to be receipts, it appears to me that the plain language of the statute does not admit of the deduction of an expense of doing business such as a premium on an indemnity contract. The courts have never held that administrative interpretation of the law is absolutely binding, but it is merely persuasive, and in my opinion it should not be followed in this particular instance. I would, therefore, recommend that the Insurance Department rule that the deductions be allowed except as to reinsurance prem - iums. _ i ■ Respectfully submitted, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p077">OPINIONS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, CLASSIFICATION February 27, 1933. Hon. William B. Banning, State Senator, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Constitutional law, Classification. Dear Sir: You have requested the opinion of this office on Senate File No. 3G, particularly upon the question of whether or not the legislature is authorized to pass such a bill and whether or not the classification m:.dj therein is proper. This bill treats with the banking business and the insurance business. These businesses are both affected by public use and in - terest and therefore subject to regulation by the State. In my opinion the legislature has, under the police power of the State, authority to pass such laws regulating the conduct of the state banks and the conduct of insurance businesses as are reason - able and necessary to protect the welfare of the public. It must be borne in mind that the exercise of this power must be necessary for the protection of the public from some existing evil, and the regu - latory acts themselves must be reasonable. Otherwise the regulation would be an impairment of the constitutional rights of persons to engage in business within the state. The next question arising from this bill is, whether or not the classification made therein is legal and proper. That is, does a clas - sification of a business based upon the size of the town in which that business is operated violate the provisions of the constitution? On this point the court decisions are in serious dispute. There is strong authority to the effect that a classification made upon the basis of population of a city, wherein the law is applicable as to per - sons in cities of one size and not as to persons in cities of another size is unconstitutional for the reason that it is an arbitrary interference with the rights of persons in the former cities to engage in business and is therefore an unreasonable discrimination against these per - sons, and is local or special class legislation. </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL However, there is a strong line of cases to the contrary, holding that classification by the size of a city is a valid and' proper method, as such law operates uniformly upon all persons in all cities of the size in which the restriction applies. These decisions place a limitation upon this rule, however, to the effect that the restriction of the law to cities of a certain size only must not be arbitrary or oppressive and must apply equally to all persons similarly situated. It is further required that the ground upon which the distinction is made between cities of various sizes must be reasonable and necessary. That is, there must be | reasonable and necessary grounds for applying the law to cities of one size and exempting cities of another size from the provisions of, the law. There must be a difference in this situation existing in the two classes. i . ■ I am inclined to agree with the latter line of authorities, but wish at this time to call your attention to the fact that there is a serious dispute upon this question. In your letter you say "others contend that such: a law would be invalid because any evil connected with a banking or trust company writing insurance would apply to banks over the entire state, and would not be confined to banks operating in any particular city." If it is a fact that the evil connected with a bank writing insur - ance applies alike to all banks over the state, I am forced to agree with those persons believing the law to be invalid, for as I have set out above, a statute must apply equally to all persons i engaged in the same business and under the same conditions. There must be some reasonable and necessary reason for exempting one class from the operation of the law. The circumstances under which the exempted class operates must be different from those of the class to which the law applies before a classification can be valid. The i selection of the class upon which the law will act, must not be arbitrary but must be founded upon some reasonable and necessary grounds. Whether or not there is any reasonable ground for applying this law to persons within cities of a certain size only is not for me to say. The line dividing or distinguishing between laws which validly classify as between town or cities, and those where the classification is unreasonable, is a line or division on which no general rules are laid down by the courts and each case is decided on: its own merits. Personally, I incline to the belief that the courts would hold this </seg>
            <seg id="p079">OPINIONS to be an arbitrary and unreasonable classification, but in view of the doubt hereinbefore expressed, I would prefer not to give a postive opinion.

Re: assessment and taxation of money de - posited in post-office. Dear Mr. Gearhart: You inquire whether money deposited in the post-ofiice is ex - empt from state or local taxation, or whether it is taxed the same as money deposited in banks. I assume you speak of money placed in a postal savings account. While the answer to your question may not be entirely free from doubt, I am inclined to the opinion that such money is taxable just as money deposited in a bank is taxable. In the recent case of Leoka v. The U.

Dear Sir: We have your letter of June ."! in which you inquire whether one who delivers, as well as one who receives, gasoline during the prohibited hours may be prosecuted under the provision of H. R. 390. In my opinion, only the person who receives gasoline into a storage tank is made guillj of a misdemeanor by the said act. The bill provides: "Any person who shal *** receive or have delivered into any storage tanks or any equipment". of a dealer, any motor vehicle fuel ♦**" between 9 P. M. and 5 A M. shall be deemed guilty of a misde - meanor. The words "have delivered" apply, in my opinion, to the person owning the tanks an 1 who thereby receives the gasoline. The act is penal and must bo strictly construed and to hold otherwise requires reading additional vords into the language used. I suppose the Legislature intended to place the responsibility on the dealer owning tanks, because he can prevent the delivery of any gasoline thereto, if he so desires. Very sincerely, Paul F.

Re: Apportionment of gasoline taxes to counties under Senate File 15; effective date of new apportionment. Dear Sir: You ask our opinion as to what funds received by you from the tax on gasoline are subject to the new apportionment to coun - ties provided for in Senate File 15. Prior to the enactment of Senate File 15, one-fourth of the sums arising from the gasoline tax was apportioned to the counties. By virtue of Senate File 15, three-eights of said sums are so apportioned. Senate File 15 was approved and became law on May 15, 1933. Sec - tion 3 of said Senate File 15 imposed a tax of four cents a gallon on gasoline and the prior sections relative thereto were repealed. Gasoline taxes and the funds arising therefrom accruing prior to May 15 therefor were and are imposed and collected under and by virtue of the law existing prior to the enactment of Senate File 15, and the apportionment must be made in accordance with the provisions of the law existing prior to May 15, to-wit: one-fourth to the counties. The taxes accrued when the gasoline was imported although payment may be deferred up to the 15th of the succeeding month. All taxes collected for the month of April, 1933 represent taxes accruing prior to May 15, and should be apportioned one - fourth to the counties. During the month of May,' 1933 the funds arising from taxes imposed on gasoline imported into the state prior to May 15 should be apportioned one-fourth to the counties, and those funds arising from subsequent importations after May 15 should be apportioned one-fourth to the counties, and those funds arising from subsequent importions after May 15 should be apportioned in accordance with the provisions of Senate File 15, or three-eights to the counties.

Re: Bonds required for gasoline license: who may be sureties thereon. Dear Sir: Under date of June 1, you inquire whether members of a corpor - ation or firm may properly become sureties on the bond required for the issuance of a license tc said corporation or firm to permit impor - tation of gasoline. In the case of a corp ration, the liability for the gasoline tax is limited to the corporation. The officers or directors thereof are not liable for payment in cas of default by the corporation. A bond, therefore, on which the officers and stockholders appear as sureties subjects them personally to the payment of the tax upon default by the corporation and, therefore, creates an additional liability not theretofore existing. In the absence of express terms in the licensing act prohibiting the same, it is my opinion that members of a corpora - tion are proper sureties upon a bond of the nature above referred to; providing they are otherwise duly qualified. In the case of a firm which is not incorporated, the members thereof are individually liable for the payment of the tax above re - ferred to and no additional liability is created by their executing a bond as surety for the said firm. In such a case, I do not believe they are proper sureties on the bond referred to. Very sincerely, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. By Daniel Stubbs, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

Could it be understood that if the average of sales over the period of months amount to more than three hundred head of live - stock, as some sales might handle a thousand head one month ' and very few, if any, another month during the period of a year or a portion of a year that such places would come un - der the provisions of this Act as interpreted by the Section referred to?"

You inquire: 1. What rate of interest your office shall use in computing t.hc amount necessary to redeem from tax sales now outstanding. 2. What rate of interest will a tax sale draw, where the sale io made after the passage and approval of Senate File No. 4 which was passed with an emergency clause at the recent session of thu legislature and approved March 1, 1933? I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked : 1. In my opinion where a certificate of tax sale was issued prior to March 1, 1933, I am of the opinion that the owner and holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive, if the land is redeemed from such tax sale, the amount originally paid for such tax sale cer- </seg>
            <seg id="p087">OPINIONS - I ■ tificate with interest therein at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from the date of the purchase. Section 77-2020 as it was prior to its amendment by Senate File No. 4 recently passed provided among other things that: "The owner or occupant of any land sold for taxes, or any person having a 1 en thereupon or interest therein, may redeem the same at any time before the delivery of tax deed by the county treasurer by paying the county treasurer, for the use of such purchaser, his heirs or assigns, the sum mentioned in his certificate, with interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of purchase to date of redemption, together with all other taxes sub - sequently paid, whethur for any year or years previous or subsequent to said sale, and interest thereon at the same rate from date of such payment to date of redemption." It is laid down as a rile of law in 12 C. J. at page 1002 thereof that: "The law in force at the time a tax sale is made becomes a part of the purchaser's contract, and any subsequent stat - ute which attempts to deprive him of any substantial right secured to him by the existing law is void as impairing the obligation of contracts." It is further said in that connection that a subsequent statute is void in so far as it attempts to reduce the amount to be paid the purchaser on redemption. 2. Senate File No. 4 so amends 77-2020 as to require the pay - ment of nine per cent instead of twelve per cent interest per annum upon a certificate of tax sale and subsequent taxes paid thereon if the owner or occupant of the land redeems from the tax sale. I am therefore of the opinion that where a certificate of tax sale has been issued subsequent to March 1, 1933, that the rate of interest to be paid thereon in case of redemption is nine per cent in - stead of twelve per cent.

Whether the bond or securities given will extend to further deposits is a more difficult question. It is not clear from your letter whether the bank has pledged securities or given bond.

The ques - tion has arisen here and I am asked to get an opinion from your office as to whether the village treasurer is entitled to </seg>
            <seg id="p091">OPINIONS any extra compensation for acting as treasurer of the school district and if so who is to pay it. "Also can the village board appoint one of their own number for treasurer or clerk or either or both. Section 17-200 says 'the trustees shall receive no compensation'. .If a salary is paid to a member of the board as clerk and to another member of the board as treasurer is it legal? "As an explanation I might say that Burwell is a town of 1200 people but has never been organized as a city and acts under village government with a board of five trustees and they appoint all their officers and neither clerk or treasurer or any other officer except the trustees have ever been elected. They are paying their treasurer, who is a member of the village board, a small salary. I think it is $60.00 a year." The officers appointed by a village board of trustees are subject to removal by the president of the board, with the advice and con - sent of the trustees. Thus it is said in Section 17-208 that: "Said appointees shall hold office for one year, unless sooner removed by the president of the board with the advice and consent of the trustees." The general rule is that a member of a board is not eligible to an office to be filled by appointment by the board, unless the statute expressly states that he is eligible. Thus, it is stated at page 040 of 4C C. J. that: "It is contrary to the policy of the law for an officer to use his official appointing power to place himself in office, so that, even in the absence of a statutory inhibition, all offi - cers who have the appointing power are disqualified for ap - pointment to the offices to which they may appoint; nor can an appointing board appoint one of its members to an office, even though his vote is not essential to a majority in favor of his appointment, and although he was not present when the appointment was made, and notwithstanding his term in the appointing body was about to expire; nor can the result be accomplished indirectly by his resignation with the intention that his successor shall cast his vote for him." </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Similarly, it is said in 22 R. C. L. at page 414 thereof that: "♦♦•two offices are incompatible where the incumbent of one has the power to remove the incumbent of the other, though the contingency on which the power may be exercised is remote, and it also exists where the incumbent of one office has the power of appointment as to the other office. This rule has been applied to prevent a board from appoint - ing one of their own members to an office which is subordi - nate to such board." In this state, however, it is not settled public policy that a mem - ber of a board may not be appointed to hold some other office, by the board. Thus, in certain counties a member of the board may be appointed highway commissioner by the board. Similarly, in what is known as an Article VI school, the board of trustees of the school may appoint a treasurer and a director of the school district from among their own number, and the board of education of a city school district may appoint, as its secretary, either a member of the board or some other person; so the question as to whether members of a vil - lage board of trustees are eligible to be appointed to the office of village clerk and village treasurer, respectively, is not entirely free from doubt, although I think the better practice is to appoint out - siders to those positions. If members of the board are eligible to hold the office of vil - lage clerk and village treasurer, they may receive pay for same, for the statute expressly provides that salaries may be paid such officers. There is no doubt, under the statute, that the school district in which the village of Burwell is situated is a district governed by the provisions of Article XXV. of the school law, and as such a school district, the law provides that the city treasurer of a city situated in the district shall be ex officio treasurer of the school district. In the instant case, there is no city treasurer, but merely a vil - lage treasurer. The statute has not provided in express terms for a situation where a municipality, which forms a part of a school district and has sufficient population to become a city, has elected not to do so, but has remained under its village organization. It occurs to me, however, that it will be a reasonable and proper thing to do, under these circumstances, to recognize the village </seg>

You call my attention to the provisions of Sections 44-401 and 44-402 and the fact that under these sections an insurance company may be formed upon the assessment plan to transact the business of "fidelity insurance" which is defined by Sec - tion 44-401 as follows: "Guaranteeing the fidelity of persons holding places of pub - lic or private trust; guaranteeing the performance of contracts other than insurance policies, or guaranteeing and executing all bonds, un - dertakings and contracts of suretyship."

Dear Sir: Taxation of Natural Gas We refer to your letter enclosing copy of letter from Mr. C. II. Robinson, County Assessor of Washington County, in which he asks whether or not natural gas in transit through pipe lines is subject to taxation. It is well settled that the transmission of natural gas produced and collected in one state, into or through another by means of pipe lines consitutcs interstate commerce. (Pennsylvania Gas Company v. Public Service Commission, 252 U. S. 23; Commonwealth of Pennsyl - vania v. State of West Virginia, 265 U. S. 553; State of Missouri v. Kansas Natural Gas Company, 205 U. S. 298; Peoples' Natural Gas Company v. Public Service Commission, 270 U. S. ' 550.) It is quite well settled that no tax may be levied upon the trans - portation of gas in pipe lines, so far as the same is moving in inter - state commerce. (Eureka Pipe Line Company v. Hallanan, 257 U. S. </seg>

It follows, of course, that since transportation may not be taxed, no tax may be levied upon property which is being tranportcd. Property in the course of transportation in interstate commerce is not liable to taxation, even though temporarily detained in transit. This has been held as to coal (Susquehanna-Coal Company v. Amboy, 228 U. S. 665) ; as to logs (Champlain Log Company v. Brattleboro, 260 U. S. 366); grain (Bacon v. Illinois, 227 U. S. 504); and oil (Eastern Gulf Oil Company v. Kentucky State Tax Commission (D. C. Ky., 1926), 17 F. (2d) 394). i On this phase of the case, we are of the opinion therefore that the gas in the pipe line mains, which has been brought into this state for distribution here, or which is designed to be carried through this state for distribution in some other state or states, is not subject to a direct property tax. We would, however, in this connection call attention to the pro - visions of Section 77-801, Compiled Statutes, 1929, providing for a franchise tax upon natural gas pipe line companies. While this section does not take into account directly the amount of gas which is purchased and transmitted by the pipe line com - panies through this state, still this element must enter very largely into the other matters which are to be considered in arriving at a franchise value. For this reason, we do not think it can justly be said that this company is escaping taxation upon the gas in its pipe lines. ■ ,. You are also entirely correct in your assumption that when the gas is delivered at town border stations within this state, it loses its interstate character, and that it becomes entirely subject to state control.

St. Neb. 1929. I do not find that the last proviso in this section added in 1929 has been construed by the Court. The question is whether the cities and villages should receive any part of the county road fund. That is should the city or village receive one-half of the county road fund raised from levy on property within said city or village? "The law was well settled prior to the amendment of 1929. The last proviso in the section (39-206) was then added. This proviso says in part: 'And no part of said moneys need be paid to the townships in said counties for expendi - ture by said township officers.' " In answer to the question you ask I will say that in my opinion a city of the second class or a village is not entitled as a matter of law to have turned over to it one-half of the county road tax levy on property situated within its corporate limits. You will note that section 39-206 provides "That in counties under township organization all of said moneys collected as a county road levy shall constitute a county road fund to be expended by the county board for the benefit of all the county roads as may be deemed best and no part of said moneys need to be paid to the townships in said counties for expenditure by said township officers."

In the case of State ex rel City of O'Neill, v. Kelley, 100 Neb. 113, 189 N.

Lewin, Secretary Middle Loup Irrigation &amp; Power District, Arcadia, Nebr. Re: Right of Middle Loup Irrigation &amp; Power District to appropriation of water. Dear Sir: You have asked for our opinion relative to the rights of the Middle Loup Irrigation &amp; Power District to the appropriation of water from the Middle Loup River, particularly in reference to prior applications for appropriation of the same water which have not been completed, but which stand ahead of your appplication in the point of time of filing such applications. As I understand the matter, this prior application has been on file some six years, and to date has never been acted upon by the Department of Roads and Irrigation, but that there is a request now on file to have that application passed upon. While there is no statute requiring the Department of Roads and Irrigation to pass upon an application for the appropriation of water, within any definite period of time, the obvious intent of the irrigation </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL statute is that the public waters should be put to some beneficial use with as little delay as possible. It is also the intent of the statutes that an appropriation be granted to such applicant as will diligently pro - ceed with the work of putting the water to a beneficial use. The Department, before granting an appropriation, should be satis - fied in its own mind that an application for such appropriation is made in good faith with the intention that the water will be put to a benefical use as soon as possible. There is authority to the effect that it is the policy of the State to deny anyone who has made application from a stream the right to retain individually the first call upon the waters of the stream, while failing to apply the same to a beneficial use. Therefore, in pas - sing upon an application, the Department should take into considera - tion all matters that might reflect on the good faith of the applicant, and before granting an appropriation, should be satisfied that the ap - plicant will diligently proceed with the work necessary to use the water. If it should appear from all of the facts before the Department that the application is not made in good faith and not made with the ex - pectancy of putting the water to a beneficial use within a reasonable time, naturally, the application should be denied and the appropriation given to another applicant who will put the water to a beneficial use. The Department, however, is the sole judge of such matters, unless an appeal is taken from its ruling. Under Section 4G-504, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, it is provided: "The right to divert unappropriated waters of every natural stream for beneficial use shall never be denied. Priority of appropriation shall give the better right as between those using the water for the same purposes, but when the waters of any natural stream are not sufficient for the use of all those - desiring the use of the same, those using the water for domestic purposes shall have the preference over those claim - ing it for any other purpose, and those using the water for agricultural purposes shall have the preference over those using the same for manufacturing purposes. It is my opinion that under this section, when two or more ap - plications are on file with the Department of Roads and Irrigation, </seg>
            <seg id="p099">OPINIONS for an appropriation of the same water, the Department should first consider the application that was first filed; but before granting the ap - propriation upon that application, the Department should consider any other applications that may be on file for the appropriation of the same water. It then should bo the duty of the Department to determine whether there is ample water in the stream from which the appropriation is to be made to satisfy and supply both or all of the applicants. In the event that there is not sufficient water in the stream to satisfy all of the applications on file, it is then the duty of the Department to determine whether or not any of the applications are for a use that is, under the statute, preferred as to that to which the other applicants intend to put the water. If one of the applications is for such a preferred use, then, in my opinion, the appropriation should be granted to that ap - plication embracing such preferred use of the water. The power to determine these facts lies with the Department of Roads and Irrigation and its decision of such matters is final, unless ap - pealed from. I trust this satisfactorily explains the situation to you. In the event that any part of this opinion needs clarifying in your mind, I will be glad to write you further. Yours very truly, PAUL F. GOOD, Attorney General. * WM. H. Wright, Assistant Attorney General. LIVE STOCK— SHIPMENTS — INSPECTION OF September 27, 1933. Honorable Harry R. Swanson, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Brand inspection of live stock shipments. Dear Sir: We have your letter of September 18, wherein you ask for our opinion as to whether or not there is any state statute compelling the </seg>
            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL railroads to permit a brand inspection of livestock being shipped from Nebraska to other states. Our statute on this matter is in a peculiar condition. The 192'J Compiled Statutes, Sections 54-701 to 54-710 inclusive, provided for the appointment of an inspector to inspect shipments of live stock being shipped from the county. Under the provisions of these sections the only manner in which a live stock inspector could be appointed was upon petition of fifty or more residents of a county. Upon such a petition being filed, the County Board had the authority and duty to appoint such a live stock inspector, whose duty it was to inspect all shipments of live stock being made from that county. These sections also provided that certain cities within the state and in other states should be open markets, so long as they maintained a brand inspection under the superivision of Nebraska Stock Growers' Association, and that shipments of cattle being made to open markets did not need to be inspected at the point of shipment, on the theory that they would be inspected at the open market. There was no provision requiring a brand inspection throughout the state generally, the only requirement being that there should be a brand inspector in case the residents of the county petitioned for such an inspector. In 1931 the Legislature attempted to change the existing statute by Chapter 99 of the 1931 Session Laws. i ■ In the title of this act it is recited that the act is to amend Section 54-710 of the 1929 statutes and provide for the inspection of branded cattle shipments. This act repealed sections 54-701 to 54-708 inclusive. Although the title of the act recited that it was to provide for the in - spection of branded cattle shipments, there is nothing in this act mak - ing such provision. All this act did was to repeal the above sections and amend section 54-710 by adding penalties. As our state statutes now stand, there is no provision made for the inspection of live stock at the point of shipment. The only provi - sions that now stand on the statute books are Section 54-709, which designates certain cities as open markets, and Section 54-710 as amend - ed in 1931, which provides that where cattle are shipped to an open market no brand inspection shall be required at the point of loading, and which provides that where there is a change in the billing of cattle being shipped, that it is necessary to secure from the Nebraska </seg>

As our statutes now exist, in my opinion they are meaningless in connection with brand inspections of cattle shipments. In my opinion, before the railroads could be compelled to permit a brand inspection there would have to be a statute passed which specifically required that all shipments of cattle within the state of Nebraska should be inspected at the point of loading, or at some open market to which the shipment was made. Such a statute should also provide that its provisions should apply to shipments from the state of Nebraska to outside points. Yours very truly, PAUL F. GOOD, Attorney General. By WM. H.

BANKS— REORGANIZATION OF STATE BANKS October 2, 1933 Department of Banking:, Lincoln, Nebraska. , Re: Constitutionality of See. 8-181 Reorganization of State Bank*. Attention: Mr. George W. Woods. I have examined Section 8-181 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, with special reference to the 1929 amendment thereto, providing for a reorganization of an insolvent bank upon a plan agreed to by 85 per cent of the total amount of deposits and unsecured claims and the bank and the Department of Banking. The section provides that in case such a plan is consummated, the depositors and unsecured credi - tors not a party thereto shall be subject to the agreement as though they had joined in the execution thereof. You inquire whether this provision is constitutional in subjecting the non-assenting creditors to the provisions of the agreement. The principal objection raised is that the provisions, when enforced, impair the obligations of the contracts of non-assenting creditors. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL '.■••■• - ' The answer is that the section referred to is an insolvency statute in a field not covered by the Federal Bankruptcy Law. State banks are expressly excluded therefrom. It has long been the rule that said insolvency laws do not impair the obligation of a contract entered into after the law became effective. The reason is that such law becomes a part of the contract and is in the contemplation of all parties when the contract is entered into. Denny v. Bennett, 128 U. S. 469; Hoff v. First State Bank, 174 Minn. 36, 218 N. W. 238 (1928). The question was directly presented upon a state law similar to the statute of Nebraska above referred to in Hoff v. First State Bank, supra. The following cases are in accord therewith: McConville v. Fr. Pierce Bank, (Florida 135 So. 392, 1931; Dorman v. Dell, 245 Ky. 34, 52 S. W. (2d) 892 (1932); Gilfillan v. Canal Co. 109 U.

D.) 225 N. W. 307 (1929). Where the claim arose prior to the passage of the Reorganization Act, it is not binding on non-assenting creditors. Engelcke v. Bank (S. D.) 246 N. W. 288 (1932). If, however, the creditor or the deposi - tor makes a new contract with the bank after the passage of the .-aid Act, he becomes subject thereto. Hagen v. First State Bank, 180 iMinn. 113, 230 N. W. 267 (1930). . " • The Act is not binding on a creditor who is a non resident of the state during the time he holds the claim against the bank. Nornick v. Bank (S. D.) 227 N. W. 375 (1929); Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213. Except in the situations presented by the cases in the next preced - ing paragraph, the law is uniform that non-assenting creditors are valid - ly bound by a reorginazation plan consummated in pursuance to the above mentioned section. This particular Nebraska section was before the Federal District Court of Nebraska in Shams v. Nebraska State Bank, 48 Fed. 289 (1931). That case presented the rights of a depositor holding a certi - ficate of deposit issued prior to the enactment of said Reorganization Act, and who had not consented to the reorganization agreement. The case, therefore, fell within one of the well known recognized exceptions to the rule, and in accordance therewith the creditor was held not </seg>
            <seg id="p103">OPINIONS to be bound by the reorganization agreement. His claim having arisen prior to the enactment of the Reorganization Act, said Act could not be a part of his contract. The court points out that the law did not exist when his contract was made and that the law then existing gave him other and different remedies, of which he could not be deprived by subsequent legislation. This case, therefore, does not pronounce a rule any different than is found in the decisions of the South Dakota and Minnesota courts, where a sharp distinction is drawn between a creditor becoming such before the passage of the instant law and one who became such after its passage. It is my opinion and advice that Section 8-181 is constitutional, valid and and effective in the case of a creditor whose claim arose after the passage of the said act; and any plan formed in compliance with that section is binding upon such creditor, though he does not assent thereto.

Mr. Lee Herdman, Director of Insurance, Building. Dear Sir: Reference is made to your letter of September 20, in which you submit the question whether a fraternal beneficiary society, organized and domiciled in Nebraska, may be transformed into a mutual legal re - serve life insurance company. You enclose a copy of the constitution and laws of the society in question, being the Ancient Order of United Workmen. As you state in your letter, the statutes of Nebraska make no pro - vision for such a change. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In the case of Leininger vi. North American National Life Insur - ance Company, 115 Nebr. 801, the court approved the transformation of a life insurance company, organized and doing business on a mutual or assessment plan, to a stock basis, holding it was not such a funda - mental departure from the business for which the company was or - ganized as to prevent the change being made without the consent of all the members. It is important to note, however, that in that case not only was the change authorized by the statute, but 'the right to make such a change was expressly reserved in the articles of incorporation. On the other hand, in the case of Folts v«. Globe Life Insurance Company, 117 Nebr. 723, certain holdings of the court should be con - sidered, which are reflected in the third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs of the syllabus. "No fraternal benefit corporation, organized under the laws of Nebraska, has any power, directly or indirectly, to write insurance or issue membership certificates for profit; nor can it use its funds to incorporate an old line insurance 'stock corporation and subscribe for its capital stock to be sold to members of the fraternal, under the guise of having such stock company cooperate with the fraternal in writing a line of insurance not permitted to fraternals." ■ "Such fraternals, having surplus funds available for in - vestment in securities prescribed by its constitution and laws, cannot organize and subscribe for the whole of the capital stock of a business corporation, under the pretext that such transaction constitutes an investment." "When, as in this case, a fraternal benefit corporation, organ - ized, and carried on under the laws of the state, for the sole benefit of its members and beneficiaries, and not for profit, causes its officers to organize a stock insurance corporation, using the funds of the fraternal to subscribe for the capital stock and surplus of the insurance corporation, such trans - action is ultra Tires of its charter, unlawful, against public policy, and void."- Without unduly extending this opinion, it occurs to us that fraternal benficiary associations constitute a unique class amongst in - surance organizations. They are operated through the means of a </seg>
            <seg id="p105">OPINIONS lodge system, which selects the membership. Local lodges are main - tained which have certain social and charitable attributes. They join with the business of writing life insurance the features of fraternal brotherhood. In their inception, they were designed to af - ford a means and method of effecting insurance on their membership, which, it was hoped, by reason of the fraternal character of the organization and the absolute elimination of profit to any officer or employe, would be cheaper and more advantageous to the member - ship. That this purpose has not altogether been realized, owing to the inadequacy of the rates which were originally adopted, does not detract from the original purpose, which has, in the majority of in - stances been steadfastly carried out so far as it was possible so to 'do. The inexorable laws of mathematics have in many cases compelled these fraternal organizations to raise their rates, and because of their inadequacy in the first instance, they have, in many cases been compelled to raise them higher than they would if they had originally been made adequate. This has caused dissatisfaction amongst a large portion of the membership, and it is a matter of common knowledge that many of the fraternal organizations have lost heavily to old line companies in recent years. This would not, however, in our judgment, justify the fraternals in seeking to make themselves into purely business organizations. This would, in our judgment, be a complete departure from the original purpose of the organization. If that purpose is found to be impossible to carry out, it would occur to us that the only way in which a trans - formation could be made would be through an abandonment of the charter of the fraternal and the reinsurance of its membership in some new organization, organized as a mutual reserve life insurance com - pany under the laws of the state, or such other form of organization as the membership might desire. Dissolution, in absence of statute, would probably require unanimous consent of the members, — at least a majority could not dissolve so long as a sufficient number to maintain the organization were willing and desirous to continue. Certainly the Grand Lodge could not take such action, in the absence of delegated power. 7 C. J. 1064. Respectfully submitted, PAUL F. GOOD, Attorney General. By E.

This has always been the interpretation of the Board of Game, Forestation, and Parks.

Re: Issuance of debentures by Nebraska state bank. Dear Sir: You have asked my opinion as to the power and authority of state banks in Nebraska to issue debentures as a means of restoring </seg>
            <seg id="p107">OPINIONS their capital structure. You have called my attention to the form of debenture authorized by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, on the basis of which they will contribute to the Nebraska state banks. I have carefully examined the form of instrument which would be issued by the bank in return for the contributions made by the Re - construction Finance Corporation. This instrument contains full and complete stipulations and safeguards which prevent it from ever be - coming a liability of the bank, except as postponed to the claims of the depositors and general creditors. Therefore, except as between stockholders and the holder of such debentures, it could never be treat - ed as a liability. As I have previously informed you, therefore, in my opinion, it does not come within the limitation of Section 8-136 Com - piled Statutes, as amended by Section 25 of Chapter 18 Laws of Ne - braska 1933. You have further asked as to the legal authority for the issuance of such debentures. I do not know of any specific provision of the statute which would affect this issue of debentures one way or the other. Since it is to be treated as an obligation of the bank, in my opinion it can be authorized as a contribution to surplus by a vote of the stockholders in a meeting duly called for that purpose. The stockholders are the only persons affected by the terms of the debenture. For the purposes of all other parties interested in the bank, as depositors, creditors, or in any other way, the money so con - tributed is the absolute property of the bank, not offset by any obli - gation that 'might be taken into account in relation to such depositors or other creditors. It is obviously in accordance with principles of justice and equity that the party contributing the surplus should be entitled thereto, upon liquidation of the bank, if there are sufficient assests to justify such a distribution after the payment of all depositors and other creditors. Therefore, there would seem to be no requirement of an unanimous con - sent of the stockholders, and in my opinion a vote of a majority of the stockholders authorizing such contributions to surplus, upon the terms specified by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is sufficient legal authority to be binding upon the bank. The stockholders, by majority vote, can properly dispose of the net earnings and provide that they shall go to retire the debentures as and when the net earnings </seg>

COUNTY— FUNDS, OFFSETTING PERSONAL TAXES AGAINST CLAIMS December 6, 1933. Mr. David F. Simmons, County Attorney, Beaver City, Nebraska. Re: County funds; offsetting personal taxes against claims. Dear Sir: You say: ■■■'•■ ■ - . &gt; "The general fund of this county is exhausted and claims against this fund are being audited and allowed but no warrants are being drawn thereon. "As you are aware Chapter 12G of 1933 session laws provide for the offset of personal taxes against claims, and pro - viding therein 'and shall deduct from any amount found due upon such account or claim the amount of such tax, and shall forthwith issue a warrant for the balance remaining, if any.' "The question presented is whether or not a claimant against the county can offset his claim against personal taxes owing by him to the county where the fund against which the claim is allowed is overdrawn and no warrants are being issued against it. And if so, the procedure in the event the claim is for a larger sum than the taxes owing." I am of the opinion that a claimant of a valid claim against the county can, if it is sufficient in amount for that purpose, have his taxes paid with it, even though a warrant can not legally be drawn for its payment. </seg>

And that: "***For any such delinquent personal taxes so set off and deducted from any such account or claim, the governing body shall issue an order to the treasurer thereof directing him to draw from the same fund out of which said account or claim should have been paid, the amount of said delinquent taxes so set off or deducted, and apply the same upon the said delin- j quent personal taxes in satisfaction thereof; and the county treasurer shall, upon application of such claimant, issue re - ceipt therefor to the person, firm or corporation whose taxes are so satisfied." I am inclined to the opinion that a warrant may be drawn for the balance, if any, due claimant, although the safe plan to pursue may be not to draw a warrant in case warrants have already been issued in excess of eighty-five per cent of the tax levied for the current year and there is no money in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund with which payment can be made. . I say this may be the safer course, in view of the fact that 26-116 C. S. provides: - "It shall be unlawful for the county board of any county in this state to issue any warrants for any amount exceeding the aggregate of eighty-five per cent of the amount levied by tax, for the current year, except there be money in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund for the payment of the same; nor shall it be lawful for the county board to issue any certi- </seg>

And 26-118 provides: ''{ s&gt; "Any warrant drawn after eighty-flve per | cent of the amount levied for the year is exhausted, and where there are no funds in the treasury for the payment of the same, shall not be chargeable as against the county, but may be collected by civil action from the county board making the same, or any member thereof." Section 26-116 as originally enacted in 1879 read in part as follows: "Nor shall the county board issue any certificate of in - debtedness in payment of any account or claim in any form whatever, but all accounts agairst a county which cannot be paid by warrant as herein provided, shall be filed and' recorded and paid as aforesaid in the order of their entry upon the record, whenever a warrant can be drawn under the provisions of this section." ( Although this provision is no longer a part of the statutory law of the state, and, therefore, the county board is not required to follow that course if it does not desire to do so, I do not know of any law which forbids such action and it seems to me to be the proper course to follow, so far as the excess is concerned, where the amount due on a claim is in excess of the amount of delinquent taxes owed by the claimant, but a warrant for the balance due cannot lawfully be drawn at that time.

Re: Right to redeem under lease for school lands after forfeiture. Attention Mr. J. H. Wehn: You inquire whether a lessee of public school lands may redeem his lease from forefeiture at any time before the land is leased to another. Section 72-219 C. S. Neb. provides, among other things, that "The owner of any contract of sale or lease so forfeited may redeem the same by paying all delinquencies fees and costs of forfeiture at any time before such land is advertised to be leased at public auction." I ■ ■ . . I am of the opinion that strictly construed the holder of a lease of school land, after his lease has been forfeited for non-payment of the rent, does not have an absolute legal right to redeem at any time be - fore the land is leased to another. It is true that in the case of Hile v.

Wehn, Deputy Commissioner Public Lands and Buildings, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Irritation district taxes. Dear Sir: You inquire whether irrigation district taxes levied against state lands sold under contract remain a lien against the land in case the purchaser's interest therein is forefeited by the state because of his failure to comply with the terms of the contract. In my opinion they do not. I am of the opinion the lien of such taxes is only a lien upon the purchaser's interest in the land and when that interest is forefeited and is no longer in existence, any lien based upon it ceased also to exist. ■. In the case of Morehouse v. Elkhorn River Drainage District, 90 Neb. 406, it was held that where state land held under contract was sold for special assessments levied upon it by a drainage district, it was only the interest of the original purchaser from the state that was sold and that: "The rights of the state in the land will not be affected by such a sale." I take it that when state land, held under contract of sale, and included in either a drainage district or an irrigation district, is assessed </seg>
            <seg id="p113">OPINIONS by the district, it is only the interest of the purchaser from the state that is assessed and that when by reason of his failure to pay the price named in the contract, his interest in the land is forfeited by the state, the assessments previously made are not a lien upon the state's interest.

Smith, State Tax Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Taxation of tax snl&lt;e certificates. Dear Mr. Smith: You submit to this Department for answer a letter you have received from Rinaker &amp; Delehant, attorneys at law, in which they say: "We are disposed to concur in the opinion that a tax sale certificate independently purchased, is beyond all question taxable as intangible property. But Mr. Baker's situation is this: — The certificate about which he inquired, represents merely the payment of taxes by his Company on land on which it holds a first mortgage, and the payment of taxes is made solely to protect the mortgage. The certificate is merely evidence of payment and he holds the taxes solely as a part of his mortgage debt. In that situation would it still be your position that the certificate is independently taxable? It seems to us that it ought not to be. "A further question arises in connection with the demand made on Mr. Baker's company. The certificate is on land located in a County in this State distant from the county in which Mr. Baker's Company has its legal domicile, and where it is naturally obligated to pay its personal taxes. It seems certain to us (and we are wondering whether there is any difference between your office and ours on this point) that </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL even if Mr. Baker's Company were obligated to pay taxes on the certificate the legal taxing jurisdiction would be the County in which Mr. Baker's Company is domiciled. We shall appreciate your further reply on these points because the. matter inquired about is one of considerable im - portance." In answer to the question submitted, I will say that it was not necessary for the owner of a real estate mortgage to secure a tax sale certificate in order to protect his mortgage security. He could, if he so desired, pay the taxes and the law would give him a lien for the amount thus paid. When he paid them and took a tax sale certificate therefore, he secured a new and independent lien against the land. It was, in fact, a first lien and I know of no reason why a tax sale certi - ficate in his hands should not be taxable as well as in the hands of an - other. I am of the opinion, however, that a tax sale certificate is taxable where the owner resides, or in the case of a partnership or corporation, where its principal place of doing business in the State is located. I do not believe it is necessarily taxable in the county in which the real - estate is situated. ■ ■ ■■•■■;■ Yours very truly, PAUL F. GOOD, Attorney General. By GEO. W.

Fairchild, Insurance Department, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Insurance on county, city and school property. Dear Madam: You ask for an opinion from this Department as to what kinds of insurance companies may write insurance upon the property of coun - ties, cities and school districts. </seg>
            <seg id="p115">OPINIONS In answer to your question I will say that we have in this State three kinds of insurance companies, if classification is made according to their plans of organization. They are defined as follows: "Stock Company is one with a capital stock that charges a fixed premium and is required to maintain the reserve provided by this article. Mutual Company is one without capital stock that charges a fixed premium and is required to maintain the same reserve as a stock company. Asse»» - ment Association is one that meets its losses and expenses from assessment levied upon its members." I am of the opinion that either a stock company or a mutual com - pany may write insurance on the property of a public corporation in this state, provided their articles of incorporation state they may write such insurance, and provided further, that the plan of operation which they submit to the Department of Insurance, and which has been approved by that department, provides for the writing of such in - surance. ;■„;,.. : I ■ '■• ■ : ■' ■ I do not care to say that insurance on such property in an as - sessment association is necessarily void, but I doubt the right of the public officials of a county, city or school district to bind the corporation to pay an unknown and unlimited number of assessments. If the number and aggregate amount of assessments in an assess - ment company is limited, as it may be -under the authority given by Section 44-402, 1933 Supplement to the Compiled Statutes, I know of no reason why it may not write insurance on public buildings if its articles of incorporation of the company and its plan of operation submitted to the Department of Insurance and approved by it, provide for the writing of such insurance.

            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL RAILWAY COMMISSION— FARM GRAIN STORAGE ACT January 29, 1934. Honorable Hugh Drake, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Building. Re: S. F. 327 (Chap.4, Laws of Nebraska, 1933; Chapter 88, Article 3, Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1933.) Dear Sir: You have asked my opinion concerning certain phases of the above matter. You ask what is the duty of the commission in a case where an applicant has a corn crib upon which he wants a warehouse certificate, and the corn crib is located at such distance from the nearest inspector employee that the inspector refused to make such inspection for the amount of money the commission has, up to this time, stated it would pay for an inspection in that county. You suggest certain interpre - tations of the discretionary power given by the second sentence of sec - tion 3 of the act above referred to. In my opinion the first sentence of section 3 of this act includes and comprehends all of the cases where it is compulsory upon the com - mission to make the inspection. In my opinion, if there are ten or more farmers operating farm lands tributary to any market, any less number of farmers having at least five thousand bushels of grain and such farmers apply to the commission in writing to have their grain inspected, the commission has no option but to cause such grain to be inspected as soon as practicable. If, under such circumstances there is grain to be inspected, but the inspectors will not inspect for the fees already fixed by the commission, it is the duty of the commission to provide inspectors in some other manner, for example, employ other inspectors who -will work for the fees prescribed or increase the in - spection fee if the commission believes that to be reasonable. I do not believe that there is any authority for requiring the owner of the grain to pay mileage for inspectors over and above the amount of the fees fixed by section 4 of the act. I believe that grain owners who come within the description prescribed by the first sentence of section 3 of the act have an absolute right to have the grain inspected as soon as practicable after they have made the necessary application </seg>
            <seg id="p117">OPINIONS and, that the fee prescribed by section 4 of the act cannot be increased by charges for mileage or otherwise. I do not believe that the question of whether or not an applicant is entitled to an inspection depends upon whether or not the fee prescribed by section 4 will pay the inspection expenses of the inspection. So far as concerns the discretionary powers of the commission, I believe that the court would not interfere with the exercise of the dis - cretion in the absence of fraud, improper favoritism, or other legal im - propriety. The courts universally hold that where a statute imposes a specific discretion in an administrative body or officer, and such discre - tion is proper within constitutional limitations, no court will interfere to compel that discretionary power to be exercised one way or the other. It may well be that if it is certain that there will be ample funds as the proceeds of the fees with which inspectors of isolated storage places of grain could be paid, then all considerations of justice, equity, fairness and other considerations might lead to the conclusion that it would be proper and appropriate to make the particular inspection in the exercise of the discetionary powers. In such a case, the court would probably say that the administrative body could well make the in - spection and that it was reasonable to suppose that they might feel inclined to make it. The courts, however, are very loath to remove from the administrative body a discretion which the legislature, in the exercise of constitutional powers, has committed to the administra - tive body.

Section 16-G35 provides, however.that special taxes for paving, re-paving, graveling, macadamizing, and curbing or curbing and gut - tering may be certified to the county treasurer for collection, or not, at the option of the city. This is a special statute, applicable alone to cities of the class of Grand Island, and in my opinion will prevail over the more general provisions governing generally the collection of - special assessments made by cities whenever there is a conflict between them, but you will observe it is the city and not the county which has the option of determining whether this class of delinquent special assessments shall be certified to the county clerk to be placed on the. tax list and collected by him along with other taxes and special assess - ments. When they are turned over to him for collection I am of the opinion that he should include them in any tax sales made by him of the property against which they are levied. Sincerly yours, PAUL F.

Dear Sir: You have asked me certain questions as to the interpretation of the above act which appears as Chapter 86 Laws of Nebraska, 1933 and as Sections 70-701 to 70-715 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1933. In my opinion, the districts if lawfully created under the terms of this act will constitute public districts of the nature of a municipal corporation, similar to a drainage district or an irrigation district, or even similar to a municipal corporation such as the city, except that the district unquestionably has no taxing power whatsoever, and can </seg>

Your question particularly relates to the Loup River Public Power District (popularly known as the Columbus-Genoa project) and as I understand it, it was organized in the second manner; that is to say, by petition instead of by an initial election. This petition was required to be signed by 15 per cent of the qualified electors of each of the governmental sub - divisions constituting the proposed district. These governmental sub - divisions include cities, counties, etc. which are contained in the ter - ritorial area included in the district. I A district organized in this manner has Its original directors named in the petition. These directors must be not less than 5 nor more | than 21 in number and are to be divided into three equal groups, or equal as nearly as possible; the members of the first group to hold office until successors are elected at the first general state elec - tion thereafter, the members of the second group until their succes - sors are elected at the second general state election and qualified; and the members of the third group until the third general state elec - tion, when their successors shall be elected. Successors to the original directors are nominated and elected as nearly as may be in the same manner as nominations and elec - tions of judges of the district court are made. Qualified electors of the governmental subdivisions constituting the district are qualified electors of the district. The nomination and election is by a separate non-partisan ballot. The term of each member is six years and until his successor is elected and qualified. The general election laws ap - ply. i | Vacancies are filled by the board of directors, but members thus chosen serve only until members to fill out the portion of the terms are elected tin the next general election after the vacancy occurs.

The district has no stockholders and no private person will be able to receive any moneys from the district except as provided by the act. Salaries being limited and the books open to public inspection, it would seem that there were ample safeguards against extravagent payment to officers or employes of the district. ■ The section relating to the right of the district to fix charges in connection with electrical energy, etc. is found in section 13 of the Act, which reads as follows: "The board of directors of any district organized under this act shall have the power and be required to and shall fix, es - tablish and collect adequate rates, tolls, rents and other charges for electrical energy, water service, water storage, and for any and all other commodities, services, or facilities sold, furnished or supplied by the district, which rates, tolls, rents and charges shall be fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, and so adjusted as, in a fair and equitable manner, to con - fer upon and distribute among the users and consumers of commodities and services furnished or sold by the district, the benefits of a successful and profitable operation and con - duct of the business of the district.

            <seg id="p122">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL Since this requires that the profits of successful and profitable operation of the district must be distributed among the users and consumers of commodities and services furnished, it is obvious that the district, if any profits are made, must distribute those profits among the consumers and users of the power by lowering the rates to be charged. I am of the opinion that under this section of the act the board would be prevented from charging rates which would give any profits. The rates would necessarily be based upon actual costs, plus reason - able allowance for depreciation, and while the loan from the Public Works Administration of the United States Government was still unpaid, the district would be permitted to charge rates which would permit them to make the payments stipulated on the loan. Of course, the Board of Directors also, being elected and repre - sentative persons, would necessarily reflect in a large measure the demands of such users as were among their constituents. For ex - ample, if the city of Columbus were the user of the power, the de - mands of that city would to some extent be reflected in the action of the board of directors, which the city has a voice in naming. This would not apply in the case of sale of power in other municipalities outside of the district (and the district has the power to make such sales), but the provision in the section quoted above, requiring the rates to be non-discriminatory and fair and reasonable, would pre - vent this district from charging less in Columbus than in some other city where the power was sold, at all times having due regard to actual costs of transmission, etc. of power to some other city, and also having due regard in relation to the quantity of power actually used.

Re: Taxation of gross earnings of build - ing and loan associations. Dear Sir: You request our opinion as to the method of taxation of the gross earnings of the building and loan associations. House Roll 9, Session Laws 1933, page 592 repealed section 77-709, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, which provided for a tax on the gross earnings of building and loan associations. This repeal left no provision for the taxation of said gross earnings, and therefore, in our opinion, the gross earnings cannot be taxed as such. The gross earnings of a company do not necessarily represent any paid assets on April 1. Since only the assets of the company on April 1 are subject to tax the gross earnings of such a company should be disregarded. As we advised you in our former letter on the subject of tax - ation of building and loan associations, in so far as the personal property assets of the company represent gross earnings for the previous year they may not be taxed to the company but should be added to the assets in determining the value of the stock of said company for taxation purposes.

"Is a ballot where a man wrote the name wrong, and then drew a pencil through it and rewrote it right a legal ballot? "Is a ballot where the name is misspelled by the voter writing it but evidently intended for the man whom he wishes to vote for, legal?" My answer to your first question is yes. In the case of State v. Sheets, 227 N.

The correct answers to your other two questions are not quite so clear, as a matter of law, but in each instance I am of the opinion that the ballot should be counted if there was no intent upon the part of the voter, in the opinion of the election board, to mark his ballot for identification, but merely an honest attempt to cast the ballot for the candidate of his choice.

At that election a Senator should be elected who will hold office from the date of that election until the third day of January, 1936, at which time ; the new Senator who is to be elected at the November, 1934 election will assume of - fice. In making up the ballot at the primary and general elections respectively, separate places should be provided for voting for United States Senator for the full term and the United States Senator for the unexpired term.

Are we correct in our interpretation of the law that in the case where a ditch is in existence prior to the existence of a road, the bridge would have to be built by the county, in the event that it was a county road, but after it was built, the irrigation company or owner of the ditch would have to maintain and keep in repair this bridge?" ; ■ . - In answer to the question you ask, I will say that in my opinion it is the duty of an irrigation district to construct and maintain bridges over its ditches where they cross a public highway which was in existence at the time its ditches were dug across it, unless at the time such bridge was constructed, an agreement was entered into between the irrigation district and the county, which provided that the bridge should be maintained by the county. In the case of State ex rel County of Dawson v. Dawson County Irrigation District, 252 N. W. 320, the district was held liable for the maintenance of its bridges, by the trial court and the action of the trial court was sustained when the case was appealed to the Supreme Court for decision. Where the irrigation canal was established prior to the estab - lishment of the highway, it was held in the case of State v. Western Irrigation District Company, 118 Neb. 736, that the owner of the canal could not be compelled to construct or maintain the bridge. I am of the opinion that 39-821 Compiled Statutes 1929 Edition and 46-619, 1933 Supplement to the Compiled Statutes are to some ex - tent in conflict. Section 39-821 provides that </seg>

Where bridges have been constructed since the amendment went into effect, which was on August 10, 1933, I am of the opinion that the question of who shall construct and who shall repair such bridges is no longer a matter of contract between the county and the ditch or canal owner, but that the law places that duty upon the ditch or canal owner.

Honorable Lee Herdman, Director of Insurance, Dear Sir: Re: Taxation of fraternals under reci - procity law. You ask our opinion as to whether fraternal insurance compan - ies are subject to the terms of section 44-217, C. S. of Nebr., 1929, </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL providing for the imposition of reciprocal fees on foreign insurance companies domiciled in states charging higher fees than are imposed by the laws of Nebraska. Section 44-1235 Compiled Statutes Supplement, 1931, 1931 Ses - sion Laws, p. 227, provides that fraternal companies shall be gov - erned by the act relating to fraternal companies exclusively and shall be exempt from all other insurance laws. The reciprocity stat - ute, section 44-217, purports to relate to "every insurance company of every kind and character." This act was originally enacted in 1013 and amended in 1919. 1913 Session Laws p. 408, 1919 Ses - sion Laws, p. 586. The 1931 act relating to fraternal companies above referred to amended an act originally enacted in 1913 also. In fact both sections were originally a part of the same act. Senate File 364, 1913 Session Laws, p. 393. Article XI of that Act re - lated to fraternal companies and section 160 provided that such companies were exclusively governed by that article. The reci - procity law which has been amended to form section 44-217 above related was a part of Article II of that act. It follows that the.sec - tion imposing reciprocal fees was never intended to be a part of the laws relating to fraternal insurance and is not applicable to such companies. In Matters v. Modern Woodmen of America, 102 Neb. 672, it was decided that the- section relating to payment of attorneys fees by insurance companies' in the event of judgment against them upon "any policy of life, accident, indemnity, sickness, guarantee, or other insurance of a similar nature," (Session Laws 1913, p. 738) was not applicable to fraternal insurance companies, they being governed only by the aforesaid article. It is our opinion, therefore, that fraternal companies are exempt from the retaliatory provisions of section 44-217 above related. Yours very truly, Paul F. Good, Attorney General.

            <seg id="p133">OPINIONS INSURANCE — FRATERNAL BENEFICIARY SOCIETIES, POWERS OF STATE INSURANCE DIRECTOR May 24, 1934. Honorable Lee Herdman, Director of Insurance, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Powers of Department of Insurance in connection with fraternal beneficiary soci - eties. Dear Mr. Herdman: You have asked as to the powers of the Department in con - nection with fraternal beneficiary societies, which, in your opinion, are doing business in a manner hazardous to their members or for which you would feel justified in asking for a receiver under the terms of Section 44-204 Compiled Statutes, 1929, if they were! in - surance corporations organized upon a commercial basis. I do not find any section of statute which authorizes receiver - ship proceedings to be brought. Under the terms of Section 44-1208 Compiled Statutes, 1929, fraternal societies are exempt from the provisions relating to life insurance companies, except as specifically provided. The article relating to fraternal insurance makes no provision for involuntary dissolution, receivership or liquidation at the suit of the Department. I am of the opinion that except as provided by Sec - tion 44-1213 and Section 44-1219 the Department has no remedy by which it can compel such fraternal societies to comply with its or - ders. As you of course know, Section 44-1213 permits the Depart - ment to refuse to grant the annual permit to do business if upon examination it is not satisfied that the society is transacting its busi - ness according to law and without fraud. Under the terms of Section 44-1219 the Department is required to give notice in writing to the attorney general within sixty days after the failure of the society to make the report required by the statute; or, in case the society shall exceed its powers or shall conduct its business fraudulently or shall fail to comply with any of the provisions </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of the statutes governing fraternal societies. Upon such notice, it is the duty of the attorney general immediately to commence an action against the society to enjoin it from carrying on any business. The court then, upon proof of the facts upon which the proceedings are based, suspends the society until the report is made or the overt act or violations complained of have been corrected. The court applied this statute in the case of State v. Bankers Union of the World, 71 Neb. 622, and granted the injunction asked for by the attorney general. The court determined and pointed out the particulars in which the defendant society had failed to comply with the law and enjoined it from proceeding to carry on its business the delinquencies had been corrected. While the attorney general had asked the court to appoint a receiver to wind up the affairs of the defendant and to distribute its assets as equity would permit, the court held that it was without jurisdiction to do so in that proceeding. The court indicated, with - out so deciding, that certain of the allegations of the petition, if proved, would be appropriate in an action in the nature of quo war - ranto to oust the defendant corporation of its franchises and wind up its affairs and declined to decide that under proper pleadings and evidence such a proceeding might not be maintained. The particular matters which you call to my attention in respect of a certain society are the following: 1. That excessive salaries are paid to certain officers. 2. That the investment policy of the society is and has been such as to endanger its reserves and to create a condi - tion whereby it may become insolvent in the ordinary sense. With respect to the first point, I might point out that in the Bankers Union case above cited the Nebraska Supreme Court held that it was improper for the officers of the society to draw a larger sum than the salary fixed by the board of directors. The court stated, however, that a reasonable salary fixed by a board of directors selected as the statute requires and freely acting in the management of the general affairs of the society, would not be illegal or im - proper, and refused to pass upon the question, in that particular case, of whether the salary in question was or was not reasonable. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">OPINIONS I am inclined to think that the court would not exercise its supervisory powers in this case, unless the salary were so "grossly ex - cessive as not from any point of view to be sustainable, unless there were evidence that the board of directors was dominated by the officers receiving the salaries and was not in fact a representative body of the interests of the membership. In connection with the emoluments of the officers it is inter - esting to note that the court held that it was improper in a fraternal beneficiary society for the board of directors to allow commissions to the managing officers of the society which are uncertain in amount and are to be determined by computations from data not within the knowledee of the membership and to which the members do not have ready access. In connection with insolvency, the court held in the Bankers Union caso, supra, as follows: "The assets of such a society do not consist in cash, and tangible securities and property alone. If its plan of busi - ness is feasible and just, it may rely upon the good faith and solvency of its members. It can not be said to be insolvent when it is reasonably probable that, by its authorized assess - ments, it can provide sufficient funds to meet its just liabil - ities." This case, of course, was decided long before the 1020 legisla - tion, which appears as Section 44-1206 Compiled Statutes, and which requires the contributions by the members or the assessments levied against them to be based upon standard mortality tables. This i sec - tion of the statute also requires the maintenance by the society of the reserves required by the standard mortality and interest adopted by the association, and further provides that the funds accumulated shall be kept separate and distinct from the other funds of the as - sociation. I take it that the funds so mentioned include the reserves set up. I also take it that the maintenance of reserves contemplated by section 44-1206 would be some of the requirements of Article 12 Chapter 44 Compiled Statutes which is referred to in Section 44 - 1210, and that if a fraternal beneficiary society fails to maintain in the form of admitted assets a sufficiently large sum of money to main - tain the reserves required, it will be failing to comply with the pro - visions of the article above mentioned and such failure will be suf- </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ficicnt ground for the injunction proceeding brought by the attorney general, as required by Section 44-1219. Although the matter is not entirely free from doubt, I am in - clined to the opinion that if the impairment of reserves is very ser - ious and becomes so grave that there is real doubt of inability of the society to restore the reserves, or make good the impairment, a situation may be presented which will justify quo warranto proceed - ings by the attorney general, in which proceedings the society could be ousted from doing business and its affairs wound up. To justify such action, a situation must be presented which is actually hazardous to the members and which would make it a con - structive fraud for the society to acquire new members or to con - tinue to accept dues or assessments from existing members. For example, if the condition of the reserves is so hopeless that there is reason to doubt whether the society can carry out its contract with the members, and reason to doubt its ability to pay the death benefits when they accrue, quo warranto proceedings such as those suggested in the Bankers Union Case, supra, might be justified. If any further advice is desired, I shall be glad to furnish it; and if the situation of any fraternal society operating under your jurisdiction becomes sufficiently grave to justify any of the remedies above pointed out, I shall be glad to cooperate with you.

            <seg id="p137">OPINIONS if at all, because of section 16 of Article III of the constitution, which provides, "No person elected or appointed to the legislature shall re - ceive any civil appointment to a state office during the term for which he has been elected or appointed, and all such ap - pointments shall be void ♦ ♦•••♦» Two questions require solution; first, may the "term for which he has been elected" be terminated by resignation, and, second, is a district judge a state officer. I. The phrase "during the term for which he has been elected" has been construed in a number of states under constitutional pro - visions similar to the one above quoted.

The cases are not so numerous on the question whether the of - fice of district judge is a state office within the meaning of the con - stitutional provision above quoted. The district court is the court of general jurisdiction in Nebraska. It is created by the consti - tution. The judges thereof are paid by the state and through ap - propriation by the legislature. Their duties include holding court in any district in the state and upon the Supreme Court upon request. In Baikin v. State, 107 Okla. 272, 232 Pac. 388, (1925) a mem - ber of the legislature was held ineligible for appointment as district judge during his term of office as a member of the legislature The Oklahoma constitution, it is true, reads differently than that of Ne - braska, as follows; </seg>
            <seg id="p138">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Xo member of the legislature shall * • * * receive any ap - pointment from the governor, the governor and senate, or from the legislature, during the term for which he had been elected." Nevertheless, the spirit behind both provisions, the evils aimed at in both constitutions is substantially the same and is stated by the Oklahoma court as follows, "The above provision of the Constitution was enacted to prevent the members of the legislative branch of the gov - ernment from occupying a dual position, and to prohibit mem - bers of the legislature from deriving, directly or indirectly, any pecuniary benefit of the legislative enactments or ap - propriations made by them." District judges are paid by legislative appropriations. They are certainly state offices to this extent. The fact that their jurisdic - tion is primarily limited to only a part of the state is not conclusive- It would not be argued that Federal judges are none the less federal officers because their jurisdiction over the person is not coextensive with the bounds of the United States. I do not believe that one element of the office of district judge, either jurisdiction, pay, or authority, can be separated from all the rest and a conclusion reached upon that characterization alone that the office does or does not fall within the constitutional provision above. It is rather necessary to consider the office in all its phases bearing in mind the spirit and purpose which was aimed at by those who wrote the constitution. It is their intention which is sought and which should prevail. In this light it is my opinion that the office of district judge is a state office within the meaning of the constitu - tional provision cited. In State ▼. Fleming (Minn.) 127 N. W. 473 (1910) a municipal judge was held to be a state officer within the meaning of a consti - tutional provision, not, however, similar to the one here in question. And see City of Omaha v. Douglas County, 109 Neb. 35, 189 N. W. 639. We find further support in an opinion rendered by a former Attorney General to you on May 6, 1924, to the effect that the office of municipal judge of Omaha was a state office within the </seg>
            <seg id="p139">OPINIONS constitutional provision before us. (Attorney General Opinion, 1923 - 1924, p. 479.) The office of a district judge is an a fortiori case. It has been called to my attention that in the past certain mem - bers of the legislature have been appointed district judges during the term of their office as such legislators. These appointments were never contested so their validity must remain in doubt unless 'ex - plainable by the different wording of the constitution in force at that time. They were made prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1920. At that time the prohibition was extended only to a civil ap - pointment from the governor and senate. An appointment by the governor alone did not fall within its meaning. This is completely changed by the Constitution of 1920. Yours very truly, Paul F. Good, Attorney General.

In that case the State was compelled to issue a deed with the broad reservations to which you refer eliminated therefrom. The decision was based upon the fact that the contract for the purchase of the land was entered into before the Constitution was amended in 1920, so as to provide: "The salt springs, coal, oil, minerals or other natural resources on or contained in the land belonging to the State shall never be alienated." If the contract for the sale of the land to which you refer was made after the Constitution was amended, so as to contain the above quoted provisions, I am of the opinion that the court would hold the reservations which you enumerate were properly placed in the deed.

Tillcy, Maintenance Engineer, Department Roads &amp; Irrigation, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Use of highway ditch by irrigation company. Dear Sir: We have your letter of June 14 with the attached copy of letter from Mr. W. H. Bauman. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OPINIONS Section 46-607 Compiled Statutes 1929 gives the right to parties to construct irrigation ditches or laterals across the public highway. This section also gives the right to construct laterals along parallel to or upon one side of any 66 foot highway. Such construction must be made under the supervision of the county. We do not believe that this statute gives authority to any person or ditch company to run water down the highway ditch, for the reason that the statute provides specifically that before a person may construct a lateral parallel to the highway, he must obtain a right of way for such purpose, both from the county or the state and the adjoining land owner. From your letter I judge that no such right of way has been granted in the case you mention. Furthermore, it is required that such a lateral along the highway must not interfere with the proper drainage of such highway. The only authority for constructing a lateral or canal along a highway is contained in Section 46-607. We do not believe that section contemplates the use of the highway ditch for the purpose of carrying irrigation water. We believe that the intent of the section was that the person carrying water along the highway should construct! a proper lateral for that purpose, the construction of which is to be under the supervision of the county. In any event, a right of way must be ob - tained before the water could be run along the highway, whether carried in a lateral or in the regular highway ditch. Yours very truly, Paul F.

            <seg id="p146">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Thompson and as to the necessity of filling the vacancy at the election, for the remainder of the unexpired term of Senator Howell. The legal situation is, I believe, perfectly plain. The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which, as you will recall, was adopted for the purpose of providing for direct election of senators, provides, in part, as follows: "When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate, the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancy by election as the legislature may direct." Section 32-1705 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska provides for the governor appointing to fill a vacancy in the representation of the State of Nebraska in the United States Senate. Immediately following the sentence of this section which relates to such appointment by the governor, the following language occurs: i "The person so appointed shall hold office until the next regu - lar election of state officers when such vacancy shall be filled by the election of a senator who shall hold office for the un - expired term." The effect of this language is too clear for argument. The ap - pointment made by you of Senator Thompson was, in the language of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, a temporary appoinment until the people fill the vacancy by election as the legisla - ture directs. The legislature has directed that the vacancy shall be filled at the next regular election of state officers. The provisions of the Rules of the Senate and of the Amendment to the Deficiency Bill cannot change the provisions of the Constitution of the United States nor of the Statutes of 'Nebraska made pursuant to that constitution.

Swanson, Secretary of State, Building: Re: Protest of Vincent T. McDonough against filing of Herbert W. Rhoades-^ eligibility of district judge in Nebras - ka to become candidate for United States Congress. Dear Sir: You have submitted for my opinion the above described protest, which I return herewith. Mr. McDonough objects to the placing of the name of Herbert W. Rhoades on the primary ballot as a candidate for the Republican nomination for Congress in the 2nd district. The protest is made on the ground that Mr. Rhoades is now serving a term as district judge, and that section 27-203, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, pro - vides as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p149">OPINIONS "No judge of the supreme court, or of any district court or any county court in this state shall be eligible as a candi - date for any other office except a judicial office during the time he is occupying the office." In my opinion this section of the statute cannot apply to eligibility as a candidate for the position of member of the Congress of the United States. The provisions of the Federal Constitution, art. I, sec. 2, are as follows: ..■■■■■ _.■'.; ■••'•;. "No person shall be a representative who shall not have at - tained to the Age of twenty-five Years, and been seven years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen." In my opinion the provisions of the Federal Constitution on this subject are exclusive; it is beyond the power of any state legislature to add to the requirements contained in the Federal constitution, and any person possessing the qualifications prescribed by the Federal constitution is eligible to become a candidate for the office of member of Congress if he possesses the necessary: qualifications. 05 C. J. 1260. State vs. Russell, 10 Ohio S. &amp; C. P., Decisions, 255. State vs. Schmahl, 140 Minn. 219, 167 N. W. 481. State vs. Howell, 104 Wash. 99, 175 Pac. 569. Barney vs. McCreery, Cl. &amp; H.

In the State of Washington one of the justices in the Supreme Court became a candidate in May, 1918 for the office of representative in Congress for one of the Congressional districts in Washington. His term as justice of the Supreme Court would expire in 1921. The State of Washington had as part of its own constitution a provision identical with the provision of the Nebraska statute upon which Mr. McDonough bases his protest. The suit was </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL brought to enjoin the printing of the judge's name on the ballot for the primary election, based upon said constitutional provision. The Supreme Court of Washington denied the relief asked for, holding as follows: "The Federal Constitution art. 1, sees. 2 and 5, providing the qualifications of members of Congress and that Congress shall be the sole judge thereof, cannot be added to or varied by the state Constitution, Art. 4, sec. 15, which provides that judges of the supreme and superior courts shall be ineligible to any other office or employment other than a judicial one during the term for which they have been elected. "The fact that the state, in the absence of Federal legisla - tion can provide for primary elections, does not give it power to provide the qualifications of those seeking nomina - tion for membership in Congress at such primary elections." In my opinion this decision was based upon sound law, and would be fol - lowed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska. A somewhat careful search fails to disclose any cases to the contrary, and the authorities above cited are all exactly in line with the Washington Supreme Court decision. For another reason I believe that you are without power to exclude this name from the ballot. The provisions of section 32-1129 are in part as follows: "All certificates of nomination or nomination statements, which are in apparent conformity with the provisions of this article, shall be deemed to be valid, unless objections thereto shall be duly made in writing within ten days after the filing of the same." In my opinion any objections filed more than ten days after the filing of the nomination papers are too late to be considered. Sincerely, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. </seg>

Re: Liability of stockholders of Co - operative Credit Association organized under Section 24-1300, and following, C. S. 1929, for double liability provided in Section 7, Article XII, Constitution of Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have the letter written you by Mr. George B. Wilson, Deputy Superintendent, of date July 18, 1934, in which he says: "At the present time there are a number of Co-operative Credit Associations being organized in communities not having banks. The question is asked if the incorporators can limit the liability of its members or are the members subject to double liability on their shares regardless of what provisions they may incorporate in their by-laws." He asks: "In the event of insolvency and liquidation of the assests would borrowing members have the right of off-set of their deposits against their indebtedness to the association? ., ■ "Can the association by their By-Laws limit the liability on share to any amount less than twice the par value of the shares?" By Section 24-1309 the Legislature of Nebraska, in its 1919 ses - sion, provided for the creation of cooperative credit associations. The powers of such associations are denned in Section 24-1314 which is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL ■ . ■ _ . ■ ' ■ "Upon the filing the articles of association and the by - laws as prescribed in Section G52, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1922, the association shall have power, within the limitations of this act: (1) to adopt tind use a common seal and to alter it at pleasure. (2) To have succession for the term prescribed in its article of association, unless sooner dissolved by operation of law or under the provisions of this Act. (3) To make contracts necessary in the conduct of its busi - ness. (4) To purchase, lease, or receive by gift, bequest, or devise, and to hold, personal and real property necessary in the conduct of its business, and to dispose of the same. (5) To sue and be sued by the name specified in its articles of associa - tion, as fully as natural persons. (C) To issue shares to persons qualified for membership and to receive payment therefor and to limit the number of shares which may be owned by one member. (7) To receive money (including checks and bank drafts not drawn on Faid, co-operative association, payable at sight or on demand) from members and pay interest on the same. (8) To borrow money. (9) To make loans to its mem - bers. (10) To deposit its funds in national banks in the state, or in state banks or trust companies organized under the laws of the state. (11) To invest such of its funds as may not be required for loans to members in bonds of federal, state, local and municipal governments, in bonds issued under the federal farm loan act, or in other securities approved by the state banking board. (12) To charge a reasonable fee for the transfer of shares. (13) To impose fines upon members for failure to meet promptly their financial obligations to the association. (14) To expel members, as provided in Sec - tion C62.

(1G) To can - cel the shares of any member who withdraws or is expelled, subject to the provisions of Sections 662 and 663. (17) To exercise such incidental powers as shall be necessary for the conduct of its business." It is true that in Section 24-1309, Compiled Statutes, 1929, there is contained the following proviso: "Provided, that the filing of articles of association with the state banking board as hereinafter provided, by co-opera - tive credit associations and the exercise of any of the powers </seg>
            <seg id="p153">OPINIONS granted in the by-laws of such associations and the exercise of any powers conferred by law upon said associations shall not be construed to mean thai such associations are engaged in .the business of banking or that said associations shall be amenable to the provisions of the laws with respect to the guarantee of bank deposits or shall be under the jurisdiction and control of the guarantee fund commission." It thus appears that it was the intention of the Legislature to differentiate cooperative credit associations as provided for in these sections of the statute from corporations engaged in the business of banking. We do not, however, regard the intention of the Legislature as controlling in this matter. The question rather is how is the term banking corporation", as used in Section 7, of Article XII. of the Con - stitution, to be construed? If a corporation exercising the powers defined in Section 24-1314 is in fact a bank within the purview of Section 7, Article XII. of the Constitution, then it is immaterial what the Legislature may have provided elsewhere in the Act providing for cooperative credit associations. Stated differently, if the Constitution provides a double liability for a banking corporation, the Legislature may not avoid this by provid - ing for an institution with banking powers, and then providing further that it may not be considered to be a banking institution. We must, therefore, examine the powers bestowed upon cooperative credit associations and if we find them to be such as are exercised by institu - tions generally termed "banking institutions" we must conclude that these cooperative credit associations are within the purview of the con - stitutional provision. It will be noted that these cooperative credit associations are given the power to receive money from members and pay interest on same to borrow money, to make loans to their members, to invest the funds in certain classes of securities, and thus generally to pursue that branch of the banking business which is carried on by a bank when it re - ceives money from its depositors and loans or invests the same,— the on - ly difference being that the transactions, both as to loans and deposits are limited to members or shareholders. This, to our mind re - stricts but does not change the general nature and character of the business transacted. It is said in Western Investment Banking Com - pany v. Murray (Ariz.) 5G Pac. 728, 731- I </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "The term 'bank' implies a place for the deposit of money, as that is the most obvious purpose of such an insti - tution. Originally the business of banking consisted only in receiving deposits, such as bullion, plate, and the like, for safe - keeping until the depositor should see fit to draw it out for use. But the business, in the progress of events, -was extended, and bankers assumed to discount bills and notes, and to loan money on mortgage, bond or other security, and at a still later period to issue notes of their own, intended as a circu - lating currency, and as a medium of exchange instead of gold and silver. Modern bankers frequently exercise any two, or frequently all three, of these functions ; but it is still true that an institution prohibited from exercising any more than one of those functions is a bank, in the stricted commercial sense." Our own Supreme Court has taken an entirely similar view of this matter, and an extensive discussion of the same was had in Hamilton National Bank v. American Loan &amp; Trust Company, 66 Neb. C7. The second syllabus is as follows: "To buy and sell commercial paper, to make and negotiate loans, to receive money to be transferred to and paid at other places, to buy and sell exchange upon other cities in this and foreign countries, to receive money on deposit, and to pay the same out upon checks or orders, are each banking func - tions; but it is not necessary, in order to constitute a corpora - tion a banking institution within the meaning of section 7, article lib, of the constitution, that it shall exercise all of these functions." The court says (p. 71 to 73 inclusive) : "The question would, therefore, seem to be, was the American Loan &amp; Trust Company a banking corporation or institution within the meaning of the provision quoted, taking those terms in the ordinary and commonly accepted mean - ing. "Morse, Banks and Banking (4th ed.), volume 1, section 2, defines a bank as follows: 'An institution, usually incorpor - ated with power to issue its promissory notes intended to circu - late as money (known as bank notes) ; or to receive the money of others on general deposit, to form a joint fund that shall be used by the institution for its own benefit, for one or more of </seg>

As a further de - finition, he says: 'Practically, a bank is a place where deposits arc received and paid out on checks, and money is loaned on security. If the institution has the additional power of issuing its promissory notes to circulate as money it is called a "bank of issue." ' "Zane, in his work on Banks and Banking (section 2), says: 'A learned and generally accurate judge,* attempting a general definition, has defined a banker to be "one who keeps a place for the traffic of money; who there receives it from others and keeps it with his own, using the whole fund as his own, or remits it at request to other places; who repays it at the will and call of his customers; who furnishes money to others on the discount of their obligations, or on securities brought by them; and who buys and sells bills of exchange." ' People v. Doty, 80 N. Y., 225. "Bouvier's Dictionary defines a bank as an 'institution, generally- incorporated, authorized to receive deposits of money, to lend money, and to issue promissory notes, — usually known by the name of bank notes, — or to perform some one or more of these function:.' "Black's Law Diclior.r.ry defines a bank as 'an institution, of great value in the commercial world, empowered to receive deposits of money, to make loans, and to issue its promissory notcr, (designed to circulate as money, and commonly called "bank-notes" or "Lank-bills") , or to perform any one or more cf ihes? fsulicns.' "The Century Dictionary, in defining banks, classifies them under four distinct heads, via., national and state banks, private banks, loan and trasi companies and savings-banks. "In tha cass of Dar.h for Siv:a;s v. Collector, 3 Wall. (U. S.), -IDS, 512, Jus'.lca Clifford, in defining a bank, says: 'Banks, </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL in the commercial sense, are of three kinds, to wit: 1, of de - posit; 2, of discount; 3, of circulation. All or any two of these functions may be, and frequently are, exercised by the same association; but there are still banks of deposit, without authority to make discounts or issue a circulating medium.' "In Oulton v. Savings Institution, 17 Wall. (U. S.), 109, 1 1 6, it is said : 'Associations engaged in moneyed transactions, whether incorporated or not, having a place of business where credits are opened by the deposit or collection of money or currency, subject to be paid or remitted upon draft, check or order, or where money is advanced or loaned on stocks, bonds, bullion, bills of exchange or promissory notes; or where stock, bonds, bullion, bills of exchange or promissory notes are received for discount or for sale, are regarded as banks!" Our answer, therefore, to the question as to whether such an association can by their by-laws limit the liability on shares to any amount less than twice the par value of the shares, must be answered in the negative. As to the first question asked, whether in the event of insolvency would borrowing members have the right of off-set as to their deposit and against their indebtedness, we would say that in our judgment such rights would exist subject to the rules generally applicable as to off-sets in banking institutions.

Smith, State Tax Commissioner, Building. Re: Proposed State levy for the last half of 1933 to 1934 Dear Sir: Referring to the proposed state levy for the last half of the biennium of 1933 to '34, which is being made under the provisions of Section 77-1007, Compiled Statutes, 1922. A question has been re - ferred to the undersigned as to whether there might be taken Into ac- </seg>
            <seg id="p157">OPINIONS count unexpended and unearned balances which have lapsed into the general fund from specific appropriations. The statute provides: "The board shall determine the fixed appropriations from the general fund from the statement of the Auditor of Public Accounts as provided by Section 3157 of the Com - - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922." . The statute further provides: "The levy, together with the taxes from intangible property otherwise taxed for each year shall provide for one - half of the above appropriations for the biennium less the un - appropriated miscellaneous receipts and fees to the general fund estimated annually in advance." The State Board of Equalization is provided for in Section 28, Article IV., of the Constitution. The Board is given no other power except to review and equalize assessments of property for taxation under the Constitution itself. Such other powers as it has are statutory. Section 77-1001 is the Legislature's mandate to the State Board of Equalization and Assessment as to how the State levy shall be made. The State Board is given no discretion in the matter, and should follow the mandate of the law. In addition to this, the Legislature has seen fit to provide within this section: "The Board in establishing the levy shall not make any further deductions other than the above mentioned taxes : from intangible property and the un-appropriated receipts and fees." In the discussion which was had before the Board yesterday, and in which the undersigned participated, emphasis was laid upon the fact that there is no expressed provision of law whereby any account may be taken of such unexpended and unearned balances of specific appropriations as lapse into the general fund at the end of the biennium for which they are available. If no account be taken of these balances, the result will be that there will be a constantly mounting surplus in the state treasury, which serves no purpose so far as the taxpayes ar e concerned, and amounts to the same thing as though a banking or other corporate institution should permit a surplus to accrue without making any use thereof. It was suggested that in any private institution </seg>
            <seg id="p158">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL operating and other expenses the surplus on hand would 6e taken into account, fha\. it was undoubtedly assumed by the Legislature that this would be taken into account and it was not, therefore, uecessaiy ttvaV s^etiftc motion \&gt;a made ttveteoi wv t\ve ctvabXmg statute, since common sense would dictate that use be made of such surplus. It was also suggested that when these unearned and unexpended balances lapse into the general iund the result is the same as though they were received from fees or other sources extraneous to taxation and that, therefore, they might properly be considered as "miscellan - eous receipts" referred to in the statute. These considerations were presented to the Attorney General for his views on the matter, but the Attorney General makes the following counter suggestions: That under our present system of taxation money is Teally paid out of the treasury before it is collected in by taxation; that it is, therefore, neces - sary that a certain amount be kept in the treasury to serve as a re - volving fund and act as a surplus or buffer against possibility of over - draft that there is no accurate method of estimating the unearned and unexpended balances which they have lapsed, since no adequate sys - tem of accounting has been provided whereby the same may be ascer - tained; that it was the purpose of the Legislature to prevent the state board from depleting the general fund and causing the registration of warrants, a delay to taxpayers and payment of interest by the state by inserting the provision in question, and that this provision has this effect, that the state Board of Equalization is thereby forbidden from taking any other items into account until the Legislature shall withdraw the provision that the Legislature thus throws a safeguard over the pro - ceedings of the State Board of Equalization so that the state funds may not be depleted; that whenever the amount of moneys in the state treasury becomes excessive the Legislature may, by withdrawing this inhibition, make it possible for the State Board to take such action as may be proper in the premises. The Attorney General is, therefore, unwilling to give it as his opinion that the State Board has a right to consider unexpended bal - ances or any items except those specifically mentioned in the statute. I am authorized to say, however, that he regards the amount of beer tax collected but not taken into account in prescribing the levy last year to come within the designation of unappropriated receipts and, therefore, as proper to be taken into consideration in the present year.

He: Blanket bonds of officers of State banks. Dear Sir: You submit for our opinion a letter from the Surety Association of America relative to blanket bonds of state bank officers. The secretary of the Surety Association says that under the rules of the Association members may not issue blanket bonds running to more than one obligee. Section 8-103 Comp. Suppl. 1933, requires the bonds of such officers [to run to the bank and the state jointly. The secretary of the Associa - tion reveals that he fails to see any insurable interest in the state any - way. Of course what the rules of the association arc and how reason - able and what force they have we are not in a position to say. Under the section of the statute referred to we are of the opinion that the banking department may not approve any bond which does not run jointly to the bank and the State. We also believe the State has an insurable interest in the conduct of officers of state banks sufficient to support its position as obligee in a bond to protect against misconduct of the officers. The interest of the state is that of a representative of the creditors and depositors of a bank. The banking business is "clothed with a public interest" and as such it is subject to extensive state regulation. In regulating the banking business the state acts as a representative of depositors. In the event of insolvency the state becomes the liquidating agent. The state in its regulatory capacity and as a representative of the depositors, thereby has an interest in the conduct of the bank's business and in the enforcement of liability for misconduct of officers. This interest is sufficient to support any bond running to the state. ! Of course, th'e liabilities of a surety are not increased because the state is an obligee along with the bank. It merely gives the regulat - ing agency the right to enforce liability to protect depositors, a right which it has anyway in case of insolvency and a right to which no one should object even though the bank is solvent. </seg>

Re: Grain sold to mill or elevator under contract of sale — price to be determined later. Gentlemen: A question has been presented a number of times, both to the Commission and to the Attorney General's office, as to whether grain sold and delivered to a mill or elevator and the contract of sale so far executed that nothing remains except the fixing of the price, the same to be subsequently determined upon a future contingency, comes within the provisions of the grain warehouse law. It is provided in Section 88-219 of the 1933 supplement to the 1929 Compiled Statutes, as follows, to-wit: "Any grain dealer, person, firm, corporation or association, in this State who receives grain for storage or shipment, or </seg>

Any grain elevator or grain warehouse in which grain is hchl in Gloiage for a period longer than ten days is hereby declared a public warehouse within the meaning of this act, and any grain which has been received at any grain elevator or grain waveliou-o for which actual sale price has not been fixed within ten &lt;lv."z after the receipt of the same is hereby held in storage-" The question which arises is as to the last clause, which provides that any grain which has been received r.t any r,«..:n elevator or grain warehouse for which actual s.ilo price has not been fixed within ten days after the receipt of Ilia rcr.12 is declared to be held in storage. It is the view of the undersigned that ih.3 statute was intended to define the status of parties where grain was delivered without the price having been fixed, and without any special agreement having been made as to the nature of tho delivery. The grain warehouse law covers, of course, the matter of bailments and not of sales, and we assume that it is perfectly competent for parties by express contract to agree upon a sale rather than upon a bailment. Again, we assume that the fact that the purchase price is not fixed at the date of delivery does prevent the transaction from being considered as a sale. In the Uniform Sales Act, Subdivision 1 of Section C9-409, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, it is provided: "The price may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in such manner as may bo agreed, or it may be determin - ed by the course of dealing between the parties." We take it, therefore, that as a matter of express contract the parties may properly agree to such an arrangement as is above suggested. It would occur to us, however, that warehouse law is designed for the protection of the public as well as for the protection of those who may be the immediate parties to the sale of grain, and that any receipt issued evidencing the purchase of grain, or any other instrument evi - dencing such sale, should show clearly that the same evidences a sale and not a bailment,- and that the instrument is non-negotiable. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p163">OPINIONS suggested that in case such a transaction is had that an endorsement be placed thereon in prominent type as follows: "It is agreed between the parties that the grain involved in this contract has been sold and not bailed, and is not to he held in storage or in any way to be affected by the provisions of the Nebraska Public Grain Warehouse Act, and that this con - tract is non-negotiable, and any assignee of either party has no other or greater rights or equities than his assignor." It would seem to us that such an endorsement would define the rights of the parties and would protect any attempted assignee by advising him of the non-negotiability of the contract of sale.

Mr. Guy Laverty, County Attorney, Burwell, Nebraska. Re: Burial of paupers in Nebraska — appro - priations, etc. Dear Mr. Laverty: We are in receipt of your letter of August 29th, relative to the burial of paupers or those dependent upon the county for burial. You have asked: "Is it mandatory that a licensed embalmer or under - taker prepare the body for burial, or can a relative or some friends do that, and can the friends conduct the funeral or must it be conducted by a licensed undertaker?" It is our opinion that other persons other than a licensed em - balmer may bury a dead body where the burial is to be in the same locality of the occurrence of death. Although we have been unable to find decisions so holding, the statutes referring to the burial of </seg>
            <seg id="p164">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL dead bodies implies that other persons besides licensed embalmers may conduct burials. It is of course mandatory upon the person making the burial to obtain the certificate of death from the attending physician, and the burial certificate from the local registrar. ! .-■■ You have further asked what the commissioners or the county is required to furnish in cases of this kind, and if they set a limit of expense would the undertaker be required to perform his services for the limit set. The case of Reavis &amp; Macomber v. Richardson County was heard by the Supreme Court Commission and an opinion was filed on June 7, 1928. This case is not officially reported but the opinion states: "The obligation to provide the expense of burial rests upon the county from the moment of death." In this case the undertaker made a charge of $45.00 for his serv - ices, which the county conceded was a reasonable charge. They refused to make payment on the grounds that the body should have been sent to the State Medical School. The lower court held, and the judgment was affirmed, that the county was responsible for this expense. Basing our opinion upon this decision, we conclude that the county is liable for reasonable charges for the burial of paupers of the county. The county board, in our opinion, would be authorized to agree with the undertakers of the county as to what would be a reasonable charge and to pay a reasonable charge for burials. However, if the under - takers of the county and the county board cannot agree as to what is a reasonable charge, I believe that the county board may make ar - rangements for the buying of caskets and the burial of the dead by per - sons not licensed embalmers and pay a reasonable amount for this service. It is, of course, in the f iTst instance, the duty of a family to bury its dead, and this opinion is on the assumption that the family of a pauper is unable to pay the expense.

Re: Chap. 126 Laws Neb. 1933 Right to set - off personal taxes of assignor against assignee of claim against county. Dear Sir: I , . ' ■ : ,■• • ■ : ■ You ask whether the County Board can deduct the delinquent per - sonal taxes of claimant from a claim that he has already assigned to another, under the provisions of Chapter 126 Laws 1933. I am of the opinion that the assignment of the claim in general does not affect the right to the set-off. The assignee of a non nego - tiable chose in action has no greater rights than his assignor and re - ceives the claim subject to all defenses and set-offs which might have been asserted against the assignor. Lincoln National Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. School District, 124 Neb. 538; Lincoln State Bank vs School District, 122 Neb. 483. Therefore, at least in all cases where the tax had been an obligation of the assignor before the claim was assigned, the assignment would not affect the right of set-off. The cases above cited would both indicate that even where the tax accrued after the assignment, there might be the right of set-off still subsisting. I assume that it may be contended that if the assignment were made before Chapter 126 became effective, it might be argued that the assignment gave the assignee a right, free from the claims of set-off However Section 26-127, before its amendment, contained a discretion - ary right on the part of the County Board to require a set-off, there - fore, it would seem that such an argument would not be tenable. It might also be argued that the literal reading of Section 1 of Chapter 126 applies the set-off only to the person, firm or corporation "in whose favor the account or claim is presented". I believe that this provision is hardly susceptible of so strict a construction, and that the clear intent of the Legislature was not to permit an evasion of the act. Very sincerely, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. </seg>

Re: Election of Board of Regents for county high school. Dear Sir: ■ ■- | ■ You say: "In this county we have a county high school and two of the Board of Regents are up for election, and the following is the way that I had the ballots printed and gave orders to the election board to follow in - struction, I had ballots printed with Regents names appearing thereon and some ballots printed that did not have the Regents on and the instructions that I gave to the Election board were that they should ask the following questions and determine from the answer whether they were entitled to vote on Regents.

I am of the opinion that all qualified voters residing within a county high school district can vote for members of the board of re - gents and that the right to vote is not limited to those who have chil - dren of school age residing in the district or to tax payers or the spouses of taxpayers. Section 79-1002 reads in part as follows: * "Candidates for the board of regents shall be nominated and elected on the non-political ballot, as provided in Sections </seg>

Morgan, County Clerk Lincoln, Nebraska Re: Objections to nominating petition of Harry E. Holeman as candidate by peti - tion for office of county attorney. You have asked my opinion with reference to the objections which have been filed with you against the nominating petitions filed with you asking the nomination of Harry E. Holeman as a candidate by peti - tion for the office of County Attorney of Lancaster County, Nebraska. I understand that in view of his possible personal interest in the matter, due to his own candidacy for re-election to the same office, Mr. Max G. Towle, the present county attorney, has stated that he prefers not to give an opinion, and has referred you to this office. I am informed that Mr. Holeman's petitions were filed with you on Monday, October 8; and the ground of objection is that the filing was too late under the provisions of Section 32-1108, Comp. Stat. Suppl., </seg>
            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 1933. That section provides that such filing must be made "at least Ohirty (30) days prior to the election." The contention of the objector is that since the election is to be held on November! 6, the filing is less than thirty days before the election, and therefore too late. The contention made on the other hand, as I understand it, is that thirty days prior to the election would make Sunday, October 7 the last day for filing, and that under the terms of Section 20-2222, C. S. 1929, where the last day for performing an acts falls upon a Sunday, tkc person affected has the whole of the succeeding day in which to perform the act. I believe that it must be conceded that by the usual method of computation, the expression "thirty days prior to the election" -would bring the time designated as the last day for filing back to Sunday, October 7. This method of computation of time has many times been applied by our Supreme Court, and I believe is the accepted method, except where a statute otherwise provides. (McGinn v. State, 46 Ncbr. 427; State v. Dewey, 73 Nebr. 396.) Therefore it is clear that the filing in question was made less than thirty days before the election, and consequently too late under section 32-1108, unless the provisions of Section 20-2222 apply. I am of the opinion that Section 20-2222 is not applicable and that the filing is too late. It is settled law in Nebraska that statutory provisions fixing the time within which filings of candidates must be made, are mandatory and must be strictly complied with. (State v. Marsh, 120 Nebr. 287.) It is also settled law that Section 20-2222 does not govern over a specific statute fixing a different method of computing time. It was said by our court in Calland v. Wagner, 86 Nebr. 755 : "Section 895 of the Code (now Section 20-2222 C. S. 1929) is general in its application, and does not control where there is a special provision in a statute directing the method of computing time." This was cited wjth approval by our court in Carrett v. State, 118 Nebr. 373. </seg>

It is also a fact that Section 32-1108 is the latest expression of the legislative will in connection with this subject-matter, since the provisions in question were inserted in 1927. (L. N. Neb. 1929 P 277, Ch. 98.). The provisions of Section 20-2222 go back to 186G.J I have been unable to find any Nebraska cases precisely in point - but equally I have been unable to find any cases in any jurisdiction for which hold that where a statute requires that an act must be done within a certain period of time, it still may be done in a shorter period of time. f ■ . . - ■ It should be noted that under our statutes, which follow a long - continued custom, general elections are always held on Tuesdays - which means that a day thirty days prior to the election would always fall on a Sunday. The legislature must be presumed to have known tins and to have intended what they said. If they had intended that a filing could be made twenty-nine days prior to the election, th'ey would have said so, and would not have said that it must be made at least thirty days prior to the election. Of course the filing may be made at any length of time more than thirty days prior to the election. The general rule in other jurisdictions is the same as stated in this opinion. In 20 C. J. 130, it is stated: "If the last day for filing a certificate falls on a Sunday or a legal holiday, it must be filed, the day before in order to be in time." In 26 R. C.

Howard, County Attorney, Greeley, Nebraska. Re: Use of stickers on ballots. Gentlemen: : You have each asked for an opinion from this office as to whether or not under the election laws of the State of Nebraska written or printed stickers may be used by voters for the purpose of casting a ballot for a person whose name is not printed upon the official ballot. The intention of this would be to use such stickers in lieu of writing in the name of the person in question in the blank space provided for by Section 32-508. I am aware of the fact that my predecessor, by C. L. Rein, As - sistant Attorney General, on November 3, 1932, rendered an opinion to the effect that such a method of voting could be used (Opinions of Attorney General, 1031-1932, p. BOC). I have reluctantly come to the conclusion, however, that this opinion was wrong and that under our statutes stickers may not be used. The statutes in question, which would necessarily contain the sole authority for such procedure, are Sections 32-508, 32-514 and 32-715, Compiled Statutes, 1929. In each of these sections of the statute it is clearly indicated that the voter is to write the name in. In Section 32-508 direction is given to the person compiling the ballot that a blank space shall be provided "into which electors may write the name </seg>
            <seg id="p173">OPINIONS of any person for -whom they wish to vote and whose name is not printed upon the ballot." In Section 32-514, in connection with in - structions to voters, the following language appears: "If you wish to_ vote for any person whose name is not printed on the ballot, write his name in full in the blank space on the ballot under the proper office you wish him to hold, and make a cross in the square opposite the written name." In Section 32-715 the following provision appears: "Nothing in this article contained shall prevent any voter from writing on his ballot the name of any person for whom he desires to vote for any office, and such vote shall be counted, etc." Our Supreme Court has not passed upon these sections of the statute, but both upon reason and authority I believe that they do not authorize the use of a printed sticker. Certainly pasting in an already printed slip of paper is not "writ - ing" within any ordinary meaning of the term. Writing naturally requires that the person acting should by his own act make marks upon the paper ballot provided by the election officials, which marks would clearly indicate the intention of the voter to express his choice for a particular person. The Australian ballot law, of which the above cited sections are a part, was designed to eliminate the evils existing in the election system previously, by which unscrupulous persons were enabled to control an election through influence (frequently corrupt) upon ig - norant or compliant voters. I understand that prior to the Australian Ballot it was the custom for the candidates or some person or group acting in their interest to furnish voters with ballots which the voters cast and which were counted for the candidates named thereon. Op - posing party committees would sometimes furnish voters with stickers which were to be placed upon the ballots provided by the committee of the rival party so that a voter could cast the ballot of one party but by stickers placed over the names of certain individuals could vote for some of the candidates of the other party. Prior to the adoption of the Australian ballot, the voter was subject to the scrutiny of party representatives who could make sure that he would cast his ballot as directed, and it would be possible for reprisals to be used against that voter who did not vote satisfactorily. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Our present system of voting provided two things, namely: an official ballot which was intended to be the only paper cast by the voter, and also provided for secrecy in voting. Section 32-502 of the Compiled Statutes specifically provides: "Ballots other than the official white ballot printed by the respective county or municipal clerks, according to the pro - visions of this article, shall not be cast or counted in any election." This was clearly intended for the purpose of preventing voters from using ballots furnished by other persons and was intended to pre - vent the very evil which would be fostered by a sticker system. It would seem that the use of stickers as suggested would violate both principles. When the sticker was firmly placed on the ballot it would substantially change the official ballot provided in accordance with statute and signed by two judges of election, as required by Sec - tion 32-704. It would be exactly a repetition of the old system by which party committees furnished the voter with his ballot, except that it would be confined to one office. If, however, the stickers could be used for individual offices, there would seem to be no good reason why stickers could not be furnished covering the entire ballot — thus making it an entirely different ballot from that prepared official - ly as directed by the statute, and as signed by the two judges of election. Another reason suggested against the use of stickers is that they might come unstuck and be accidentally or fraudulently removed. In - deed, in some jurisdictions where stickers are expressly permitted by statute, questions have arisen as to whether the sticker vote in to he counted where the sticker falls off the ballot while being counted (Dickinson's case, 2 Leg. Rec. (Penna.) 103). The element of secrecy also enters into the case, in view of the fact that the person furnishing the stickers, or persons cooperating with him, can watch the voter and if he comes out with the sticker still in his hand, or if he throws the sticker on the floor, the watcher can have reasonable assurance that the voter did not cast his vote for the person named in the sticker. </seg>
            <seg id="p175">OPINIONS "■■ . The weight of authority in other states, under statutes similar or identical with our own, is that stickers may not be used where the statute only provides that the voter may write in the name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote. In the case of Fletcher v. Hall, 172 111. 427, 50 N. E. 230, 40 L. It. A. 017, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that stickers might not be used under a statute identical with the Nebraska statute. It is interesting to note tha the court held that the use of stickers invalidated the entire ballot, and ballots upon which the stickers were used would not be counted for any candidates voted for. I quote from the opinion: "It seems too clear for argument that if the practice re - sorted to in the use of pasters, as was here done, is to be legalized, the whole purppse and object of the law will be practically abrogated. There would in that case be no sub - stantial difference between the operation of the present law and the old method. Under that law, candidates, and those acting in their behalf, provided themselves with tickets often marked as they desired them to be voted, furnished them to voters, and, by persuasion, pui-chase, or otherwise, induced the voters to deposit such ballots in the ballot box. Under the method here adopted, they could furnish the ticket as they desired it to be voted, marked, or with instructions to the voter how to mark it, and, by the same methods, induce him to attach it, as furnished, to the official ballot, and then pro - cure it to be deposited in the ballot box. The manner of vot - ing prescribed by the act is thereby wholly changed, and the secrecy of the ballot entirely destroyed." .■ . This was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois in McSoriey v. Schroeder, 190 111. 09, 03 N. E. 097. In that case the court well em - phasized the opinion previously given in Fletcher v. Wall, in the follow - ing language: "It is manifest that, if pasters may be resorted to by one candidate, they may be by all, and the official ballot might become but little more than a convenient card upon which to paste private tickets printed and circulated in secret. The use of such tickets would revive the evils sought to be guard - ed against by the ballot law." </seg>
            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL This rule has been reaffirmed in Illinois as recently as 1919, in the case of Jackson v. Wyans, 287 111. 382, 122 N. E. 611. I am aware of the fact that in Minnesota, in the case of Snortum v. Homme, 119 N. W. 59, the Supreme Court of Minnesota reached the opposite conclusion. However, in 1926 the question was before the Supreme Court of California, under statutes identical with ours, and that court in the case of McFarland v. Spangler, 248 Pac. 521, followed the Illinois rule, expressly repudiating the Minnesota cases. The California court used the following language: "The use of the words 'writing 1 and 'writing in' and 'written' as applied to voting for a person whose name is not on the official ballot, is a. clear evidence of intention on the part of the Legislature to exclude other methods not specifical - ly authorized. It has been held, and may well be said to be the general rule, that: " 'If a statute so provides, but not otherwise, the electors may use printed pasters for the insertion of names not upon the ballot instead of writing them in the space reserved for their reception.' " The court also said: "Assuming, however, that a general election ballot marked with a pencil cross would be valid, it would not follow that the pasting of a paper on the ballot would satisfy the statutory requirement that the name be written on the ballot by the voter. True, the intention of the voter must be ascertained, but it is not enough to find out generally the voter's intention. Such intention must be expressed in the manner prescribed by law. People v. Town of Sausalito, 106 Cal. 500, 39 P. 937. When the method of expressing the voter's intention is pre - scribed by authority of law, such method becomes a matter of substance. 10 Cal. Jur. 78, and cases cited. In other words, the right to express one's choice of a candidate at the polls is not unrestricted. It is subject to reasonable regula - tion in the interest of secrecy and uniformity of the ballot and the fairness of the vote, etc." This is the last expression of any court that I have been able to find upon the subject, and it seems to indicate where the weight of </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OPINIONS ■ ■ ■ authority lies. It should be noted that the Illinois and California courts have both held that the entire ballot was invalidated by the use of stickers, and that the voter's choice for other offices, even though marked for one of the persons whose name was properly printed upon the ballot, could not be counted for the person so voted for, for the reason that the entire ballot had been invalidated. I would not be prepared to say that the Nebraska Supreme Court would so hold, nor that counting boards should necessarily reject all votes upon ballots which had been mutilated by stickers. There is, however, sufficient doubt of the validity of ballots cast in this manner! so that voters should be advised not to use such stickers. Sincerely, Paul F. Good, Attorney General.

Dear Sir: I have your letter of November 1st, in which you inquire about bonded whiskey warehouse receipts and the legality of their sale in the State of Nebraska. I know of no rulings which have classified these receipts as se - curities within the meaning of our blue-sky law; and I know of no rulings of any other department of the state which would afTcct the freedom of their sale. However, I have no doubt that under our liquor laws they cannot be legally handled and disposed of in this state. Nebraska has consti - tutional prohibition, which may or may not be repealed by popular vote at the election of November Gth. Regardless of the repeal of the constitutional prohibition, our bone-dry law will still be in effect, unless and until our legislature repeals or amends it. Our bone-dry law is very thorough and comprehensive in forbidding the sale of alcoholic liquors. I refer you to Section 53-102, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, which reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, keep for sale or barter, give away, barter, exchange, transport, purchase, or to sell or to barter under any pretext, any malt, spirituous, vinous and intoxicating liquors, except only certain liquors, for medicinal, mechanical, scientific or sac - ramental purposes by persons specially authorized in the man - ner and to the extent only as hereinafter provided.

Included in the uniform sales act is Section 69-433, which reads as follows: "A person to whom a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby, a.

Our bone-dry law also contains the following provision, namely, 53-107, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929: "It shall be unlawful for any person to enter into any contract for the delivery of, or to solicit, take, or receive any order in any manner whatsoever for any purchase or sale of any intoxicating liquor to be used as a beverage, or to give lo any other person, for the purpose of aiding in the violation of any of the provisions of this act, any direction or informa - tion by which intoxicating liquors can or may be secured as a beverage."

Re: Effect of constitutional amendment re - pealing constitutional prohibition. Dear Sir: You inquire as to the effect of the adoption of the constitutional amendment repealing section 10, Art.

Government as to principal and interest, are eligible for the investment of trust funds in accordance with our Nebraska statutes passed at the last session of the Legislature which provided that such funds must be invested in government bonds and municipals." ■' The statute to which you refer is Section 27-601, 1933 Supple - ment to Compiled Statutes, 1929, which is as follows: "Except as may be otherwise provided by the instru - ment creating the trust, trustees, and all guardians, exe - cutors and administrators appointed by the courts of this state, having funds for investment, shall invest the same by order of the court in the following: (a) Bonds or other obligations of the United States of America, or United States postal savings, (b) Bonds or other interest-bearing obliga - tions of any county, city, village, school district, or other legally constituted political subdivision within the State of Nebraska, provided such county, city, village, school district, or other subdivision has not defaulted in the payment of the principal or interest on any of its bonds or other interest - bearing obligations for a period in excess of ninety days within five years immediately preceding such investment, (c) Bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of any state, or of any city with a population of two hundred thousand or more located outside of Nebraska which has not defaulted in the payment of principal or interest on any of its bonds or other interest-bearing obligations for a period in excess of ninety days within five years immediately preceding such invest- </seg>
            <seg id="p182">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL mcnt or such other securities as the County Judge may ap - prove." Subdivision (a) in the above section specifies bonds or other obligations of the United States of America, or United States postal savings. It would seem that this would cover only such direct obliga - tions of the government as would naturally fall within that classifi - cation. The classes of securities concerning which you inquire are not primary obligations of the government, but are only obligations by reason of acts of Congress pledging the credit of the United States to guarantee payment. It would occur to us that the classes of obligations concerning which you inquire might well be included in this section of the stat - ute, and undoubtedly the legislature would be willing to do this if it were called to their attention. Yours very truly, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. By E. Vail, Assistant Attorney General. DIVORCE— MEXICAN, VALIDITY OF November 14, 1934. Mr. B. Frank Watson, Attorney at Law, 735 Stuart Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Re: Validity of Mexican Divorce. Dear Mr. Watson: Answering your telephone inquiry concerning the above, this office has ruled that under certain restricted conditions a Mexican divorce may be valid. It requires the residence and actual presence of the plarties in Mexico, however, before such divorce can be considered valid in the United States. In most instances, Mexican divorces for Americans, as I understand it, arc granted without residence or even physical presence in Mexico. Under such circumstances the divorce would be treated as a nullity in any state in the United States of America, including Nebraska, </seg>

Luikart, Superintendent of Banking, Euilding. Re: Transfer of building and loan from state to Federal charter. Dear Sir: You ask our opinion as to whether a building and loan associa - tion organized under Chapter 8, C. S. 192D, may change to a Federal charter without enabling state legislation and without the consent of the banking department. The authority for Federal incorporation of a building and loan associations is found in section 5 of the Home Owners Loan Act, (Congressional Laws, June 1033). Section 5 (1) of that act provides that any member of a Federal Home Loan Bank may convert itself into a Federal Savings and Loan Association upon a vote of its stock - holders as provided by the law under which it operates. In the case of banks under the supervision of the state banking department, no authority from the state is necessary to enable the bank to change from a state to a Federal charter. In Casey v. Galli, 04 U. S. C73, (180, it was held: "No authority from the state was necessary to enable the bank so to change its organization. The option to do that was ijiven by the 44lh Section of the Banking Act of Congress. 13 Stat. at L. 112. The power there conferred was ample, and its validity cannot be doubted. The act is silent as to any assent or permission by the State. It was as competent for Congress to authorize the transmutation as to create such institutions originally." </seg>
            <seg id="p184">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL .■■/■■■■■'■ i It is our opinion that the same reasoning applies in the case of building and loan associations, and therefore, the act of Congress is sufficient authority, and a change does not require any state legis - lation or state consent. Section 5 (1) of the Home Owners Loan Act above referred to does require that the transmutation must be authorized by a vote of the stockholders of the association "as provided by the law under which it operates". The change to be made is a change in the articles of incorporation. The required number of stockholders' votes to change or amend the articles of incorporation of a building and loan association in this state is controlled by their respective articles. The statutory charter contains no provision upon this subject. The stockholders' vote necessary to make the change, therefore, will be found in the respective articles of incor - poration of the building and loan associations. Yours very truly, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. By Daniel Stubbs, Assistant Attorney General. SCHOOLS — FUNDS — DEPOSIT IN CO-OPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS UNAUTHORIZED November 16, 1934. Dr. J. C. Houchin, Secretary of School Board, Beaver Crossing, Nebraska. Re: Funds of school district. Dear Sir: Complying with your oral request for an opinion upon the mat - ter, I will say that in my opinion a school district treasurer has no authority to deposit school funds with any corporation or association other than a state or national bank, and any deposit made with them should be made in order to protect him from personal liability in case of loss, in conformity with Sections 77-2525-6 1933 Supplement to Compiled Statutes, which read as follows: "That any school district treasurer or township treas - urer may deposit the money received or held by him by vir- </seg>
            <seg id="p185">OPINIONS tue of his office in some state or national bank situated in such school district or township or in some nearby city or village which has been approved as such depository by the governing body of such school district or township". (77 - 2525) "Any such banks may apply for the privilege of keeping such moneys. All such deposits shall be subject to payment on check when demanded by the district or township treas - urer. It shall be the duty of the school district board or township board to act upon such application." (77-2526) A deposit in a credit co-operative association is not authorized by law.

Lobdell, Department of Roads &amp; Irrigation, Acting State Engineer, Building. Dear Sir: Re: Responsibility of state to maintain ir - rigation structures on the state high - ways. You ask our opinion as to whether the state is responsible for maintaining irrigation structures on the state highway systems. ■ We are of opinion that bridges and other structures erected to permit an irrigation canal to intersect a highway must be main - tained by the irrigation company. There is no doubt that this is true as to county highways under county supervision. State ex rel Dawion County v«. Dawson County Irrigation Company, 125 Neb. 836. Section 4G-619, Compiled Supplement, 1933, enacted after the </seg>
            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL above case was decided, places the responsibility in the premises upon the irrigation companies. The only doubt is as to whether that section is applicable only tn county highways, thereby excepting state .highways. However, if this is true, it is also true of all other laws upon the subject, and the question is left unregulated by stat - ute. In (hat case the common law is applicable, Dawion County v. Dawson County Irrigation Co., 10-1 Neb. 137, and the common law imposes the instant duty upon the irrigation company. Dawson County Irrigation Co., supra; State ex rcl County of Dawson v.

Mr. Charles L. Whitney, County Attorney, Aurora, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We are in receipt of your letter wherein you refer to House Roll No. 175, passed by the 49th cossion of the Nebraska Legislature, which bill became known as Chapter 115 of the 1933 Session Laws of Nebraska, and which is now identified as section 12-119, Compiled Statutes Supplement of Nebraska for 1933. We have checked the 1933 Supplement to our statute with the engrossed bill which is on file in the office of the Secretary of State. We find that there is one error in the 1933 supplement, in so far as section 12-119 is concerned. The supplement reads in part: "Each sheriff in counties of less than twenty thousand inhab - itants, $10,000;" This should read, "Each sheriff 1 in counties of less than twenty thousand in - habitants, $5,000;" </seg>
            <seg id="p187">OPINIONS So far as the remaining content of this section of the Sup - plement is concerned, it is identical with the engross, d bill. There - fore, our statute requires that county commissioners or county super - visors in counties where the population is over ten and less than fifty thousand inhabit an Is, shall give bond in the sum of $10,000.00. Yours very truly, Paul P. Good, Attorney General. By Paul P. Chaney, Assistant Attorney General RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATION— TAXATION December C, 1934. Mr. W. H. Smith, State Tax Commissioner, Building. Re: Taxation of preferred stock sold by banks to Reconstruction Finance Cor - poration. Dear Sir: We have had a number of inquiries from national banks with reference to preferred stock sold to the Reconstruction Finance Cor - poration, and asking whether such stock may be assessed locally against the banks issuing the same. Our law does not tax the assets of banks directly, but taxes the shares of the stockholders, and requires payment of the amount due by the bank, giving the bank a lien on the shares for the amount of the tax. Since the Reconstruction Finance Corporation owns preferred stock in many banks, it is important to be considered whether or not the law will permit local taxation against this agency. It is a well established principle of law that the United States Government may not tax any state agency or instrumentality, nor may a state or its subdivisions tax any instrumentality or agency of the United States Government. This principle is founded upon </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Ihe fundamental doctrine that the right of taxation is capable of such use or abuse as to impair, if not destroy, the vigor of the in - strumentality in question, and may prevent it from accomplishing the purposes for which it was intended. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheaton 31G. This general proposition is often summed up in the maxim that the power to tax is the power to destroy. As pointed out, this doc - trine is exerted not only in favor of the federal government, but in favor of a state government as well. This office has recently in - voked this principle in support of its contention that the income derived from ths use of the college dormitory at the Peru Normal School, as well as at the Wayne Normal School, might not be sub - jected to federal income tax, and this claim has been upheld by the federal government. Passing to the matter under consideration, it would seem to the writer that the case of Clallam County v. United States, 262 U. S. 314, would be controlling. In that case it appears that the United States Spruce Corporation was formed under general au - ; thority of Congress to expedite the production and purchase of air - craft material. There was no element of private profit, but the corporation was conducted solely for a public purpose. It was at - tempted to tax this corporation but state authority to do so was denied. In the matter under consideration here, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is chartered directly by Congress for a public purpose of the greatest concern to the welfare of the nation as a whole. We cannot conceive that it would be held to be other than an instrumentality of the government, or that the United States | Supreme Court would permit its taxation on any opposite theory. ] We arc confirmed in this view by the language of the Congress in : enacting the law under which it is chartered, which expressly pro - vides (Act of January 22, 1932, Section 10) that the corporation, : including its franchise, its capital, reserves and surplus, and its income, shall be exempt from taxation whether by the United States ■ or by state or local taxing authorities, except as to real estate. We take it that when it was provided that the corporation . should be exempt from taxation, that this was intended to cover all of its prop - erty and assets except as exempted, and that the word "including" was •introduced merely to emphasize certain details upon which it was ! desired to lay stress. We think the conclusion to which we have come is entirely in harmony with the long series of decisions with ; respect to the taxation of shares of stock in National Banks, and, I while it would take too long to examine and collate these decisions within the scope of this opinion, reference is made to this line of authorities. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">OPINIONS While, of course, the consideration is not controlling, it should be remembered that the federal government, acting through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, is doing its utmost to promote the recovery of the banking business, as well as other fundamental business activities. Under these circumstances the state should not assert the right of taxation upon its instrumentalities without a clear basis therefor, as this might operate to impede and hinder accomplishment of the end sought, which is one in which the people of our state have an equal interest with the people of the nation in general. It will, of course, be understood that where preferred stock has been issued to an individual, and has been pledged by him to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, so that the ownership still re - mains in the individual, the above considerations do not apply so far as the individual is concerned, and he is, in our judgment, sub - ject to taxation thereon. We understand that this is the situation which exists with regard to banks chartered under our state banking laws. Yours very truly, Paul F. Good, Attorney General. By E. Vail, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
