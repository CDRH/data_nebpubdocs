            <seg id="p010">10 IIEPOIIT (&gt;!•' SECRETARY RECOMMENDATIONS In general a continuation of the present "Pay as you Go" road building: plan is recommended. It is to be noted from this report that during the present year a real start has been made in the surfacing (for the most part with gravel) of Nebraska's State Highway System. The greatly increased traffic over the past few years as shown in this report justifies in the opinion of the writer a continuation of the sur - facing program as fast as available financing will permit. It is recommended also that State' finances be made available aside from those used in conjunction with Federal Aid for use in cases where Tery light and intermittent grading is required to prepare a road for surfacing and for use in the sandhill regions of this state. In both of the above cases it is not logical or economical to use Federal Aid. This recommendation in the opinion of the writer is very important by the adoption of which a large amount of money can be saved and equally good results accomplished. Respectfully submitted, R. L. COCHRAN, December 1, 1924 State Engineer. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">DEPARTMENT OP PVBLIC WORKS 11 R. L. Cochran, State Kngineer. Department of Public Works, State of Nebraska, Lincoln. Sir ■ Pursuant to the established policy of the Department of Public Works, I have the honor to submit to you the following report covering briefly the salient activities of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges for the two years ending November 30, 1924. in so far as possible the numerous tabulations, data, photographs and discussions have been seggregated, correlated, and consolidated under the Divisions most closely associated with these activities to form a concise, comprehensive report. The scope and functions of these Divisions are rather clearly implied in their titles as. Division of Loca - tion, Construction and Maintenance; Division of Tests; Division of Design, Maps and Plans; Division of Accounts and Records. The re - ports of the Division of Equipment and the Division of Motor Vehicle Registration follow the Bureau's report. The Bureau has just witnessed the heaviest construction program in this state since the inauguration of Federal Aid in 1917. The splen - did harmony existing among the Bureau's personnel, the excellent co - operation and assistance granted by all county officials, the confidence and support displayed by the contractors and public have all combined to make possible a record breaking year in the face of an economic period when public funds were very limited and outside capital was drawing many of our experienced engineers. I can not give too much credit to the engineering and clerical forces under this Bureau for their constant untiring efforts in carrying out your policies and desires of administration. Their loyalty alone is responsible for this effort and the records speak plainly of the accom - plishments of this effort. Trusting that this report will properly serve the purpose for which it is intended and that it will meet with your approval, it is Respectfully submitted, (Signed) M. C. NOBLE Chief Bureau Roads and Bridges. </seg>

            <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 13 ORGANIZATION, LAWS AND DISCUSSIONS To better appreciate the functioning of this Bureau and to under - stand clearly the discussions and tabulations following in this report, particularly with references to State-Federal Aid construction, it ap - pears advisable to outline briefly the Department organization, also a few of the outstanding highway laws, governing policies, and types of construction caused by the demand for economy and use of mater - ials at hand. ORGANIZATION OF HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT Previous to the Legislative Session of 1919, the highway depart - ment was under the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drain - age. This Board consisted of three members, the Governor acting as President, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. This Board appointed a State Engineer who became the active responsible head of State Irrigation, Highways and Drain - age. The State Engineer, with approval of the Board, appointed a deputy, or assistant State Engineer in charge of the highway work. The 1919 Legislature adopted the Civil Administrative Code Bill which has been the law in force since that time. Under the Code, the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage was abolished and in its place was created the present Department of Public Works. The Governor who is the head appoints the Secretary-State Engineer as the active head of the Department of Public Works. The State Engin - eer with the Governor's approval appoints an Assistant as Chief of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges. The Code does not define the officers and their duties below the State Engineer so the organization is de - veloped and responsibility placed as directed by the State Engineer and Governor. The organization chart as shown on page four explains the lines of responsibility for this Bureau as established by the State Engineer. HIGHWAY SYSTEM ESTABLISHED The original Federal Aid Highway Act was approved July 11, 1916. Following the acceptance of Federal Aid as covered in this Act by the Legislature of 1917, the County Board of Supervisors and Commissioners designated a program of roads upon which they desired State-Federal Aid participation. This system was approved by the State Engineer. Later the 1919 Legislature established this system comprising approxi - mately 5000 miles under eighty-eight route numbers as the Nebraska State Highway System with the provision that as other roads were constructed with State and Federal Aid funds such constructed roads would become a part of the State Highways. In addition to the statu - tory system as originally outlined by the County Boards, the law also </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 REPORT OF SECRETARY provided that the Counties establish a system of county roads not ex - ceeding twenty per cent of the total mileage in the County, which sys - tem is under the jurisdiction of the County Board. The amended Federal Highway Act approved Nov. 9, 1921 dele - gated authority to the United States Secretary of Agriculture to ap - prove a system of highways known as the Seven Per Cent System. Each State was required to submit a map showing the Seven Per Cent Sys - tem as desired, which map was to be approved by the Secretary of Agri - culture as usbmitted or as modified under the Secretary's suggestion. Tke mileage of highways in this Seven Per Cent System, for any State, cannot exceed seven per cent of the total road mileage in the state as certified under the original highway act. Nebraska's certified mileage at that time was 80,272 miles, which permits the Seven Per Cent System to contain 5,619 miles. A careful check of all highway mileage in Nebraska was recently completed and the mileage found to be 94,633. The maps on file with the Federal Bureau show this Seven Per Cent mileage in Nebraska to be entirely exhausted so the Nebraska high- Ways which may receive State-Federal Aid funds are definitely estab - lished until the system is constructed in its entirety at which time ad - ditions may be made. I Since Federal funds cannot be expended on highways outside the en per cent system and since our state road legislative appro - ations are made to meet Federal Aid appropriations, it was the pres - administration's desire to increase the allowable mileage up to •en Per Cent of 94,633, the correct mileage for the State, in order incorporate several very important intercounty and interstate high - ys in this system. This request to the Federal Bureau was dis - &gt;roved on the basis that the Federal Highway Act particularly cified that the mileage as certified by the State under the orig - 1 act was to govern. FEDERAL AID APPROPRIATIONS AND LAWS I Federal Aid appropriations are made from the General Fund of United States Treasury. Distribution to the states is made upon the o that the state bears to the total of all States in the following « ways, area of State population of State, and miles of mail route, this manner the eastern states which contribute heavily to the eral taxes do not receive a proportionately heavy return for roads Ie the western states profit accordingly. For example Nebraska sives $4.15 for Federal Aid roads for each dollar of Federal taxes 1 for roads. The Federal Bureau participates up to fifty per cent of the construc - tion and engineering costs of a project except the engineering costs necessary on preliminary surveys, preparation of plans and estimates, and administration. The maximum Federal Aid available per mile </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 15 has varied from $10,000.00 to $20,000.00 exclusive of bridges over 20 feet clear span as noted below. Federal funds may participate on construction through cities under 2500 population, and in larger cities these funds may be expended on that portion of the road along which the houses for a distance not exceeding one mile, average more than 200 feet apart. All construction supervision and engineering must be done by the State under a State Highway Department The County Boards make formal application to this Department for State-Federal Aid funds specifying the highways upon which expenditure is to be made before any plan* are made for contracting.

Each legislative appropriation is made for one biennium so that once each two years the Department must wait several months before the program for the biennium can be established, surveys made and plans approved. This generally throws a large highway letting in late midsummer whan fewest contractors are free to bid The following appropriations by the past state legislatures. to meet Federal Aid have been mad* State Appropriations Years Covered Amount 1917 Legislature 1917 to July 1, 1919 640,000.00 1919 Legislature 1919 to July 1, 1921 3,093,262.00 1921 Legislature 1921 to July 1, 1923 2,262,750.39 1923 Legislature 1923 to July 1, 1925 1,500,000.00 Total 7,496,012.39 Deducted by 1921 special session 366,870.99 Total State Aid Road Appropriation 7,129,141.40 The above funds are raised by direct property tax.

In addition to the $1,500,000 appropriated by the Legislature of 1923, which was insufficient by over two million dollars to meet the Federal fund available, the same Legislature authorized the counties to meet as much of the surplus Federal Aid, through the State Depart- ment, as was available for their county. As a result in addition to the regular road tax the counties in the year 1923 raised $647,592 and in the year of 1924 they raised $779,702 to meet Federal Aid whereas in the previous three bienniums or six years all the local or county funds raised totalled only $513,853.00. A most unfortunate condition arises under the present State-Fed- eral Aid laws in a few of the western counties. In these particular counties traffic is very light and standard highway construction is </seg>

In these counties state funds should be frea to use, independent of Federal Aid funds, so that the occasional bad spots in the .sand hill trails could be improved and many mile? of additional highways made useable rather than following- federal requirements in the construction of a high type sand day road. Such construction means very little progress can be made with the meager funds available so that the improvement is Of Very little Ser- vice to the public. Such counties would benefit greatly if state funds in excess of those appropriated to meet Federal Aid were available so that strictly State Aid funds could be used at least in counties under 4000 population.

            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF SECRETARY 22 The State Aid Bridge and State Institution Paving appropriations and expenditures are shown under their headings later in this report. These funds need not be expended on the State-Federal Aid system bui IB the event that they are so expended they may be used in conjunction with Federal Aid funds. Any county may make application for one-half the cost of any bridge spanning a stream the width of 100 feet or more. Application may be made by either county on a county line bridge and if approved by this Department the structure may be built and one-fourth cost collected from each county. In the event of dispute between two counties on the location of such a bridge, the State Engineer may cast the deciding vote. Counties expending over $100.00 in any one year on Ptate Aid Bridge repairs under the direction of the State Engineer may be re-imburseU for one-half the cost of repairs from the State Aid Bridge State Institution Paving appropriation is applicable for fifty per cent of the excess costs over the special benefits assessed provided the iostitution making application to this Department is located more than one-half mile and not exceeding three miles from a railroad unloading track Or permanent highway leading to the railroad unloading track. OTHER HIGHWAY LAWS A few of the highway laws which affect State and Federal Aid construction are mentioned here very briefly. I Contracts — Construction work involving State Aid Road funds rt be advertised in the official county paper for three consecutive ies not less than twenty days. Such notice must state that the us and specifications may be inspected at the office of the County rk and Department of Public Works and must also state the date I the hour when the receiving of the bids shall close, at which e they must be publicly opened before any bidders or their repre - tatives. The details of a typical highway letting are related later this report. t State aid bridge notices must be advertised four consecutive weeks, all state aid or federal aid construction the contracts are signed tly by the County and State. On strictly county bridge construction law requires the advertisement to run four consecutive weeks and be sd upon plans and specifications prepared by the Department of Pub - works. The counties must advertise all bridge work estimated to over ?500 but may let annual contracts covering all work for year or if bids are rejected the counties may purchase material employ labor for the construction and repair of all bridges for the r. All bridges must be painted white above the floor system for at t twenty feet from either end. Maintenance — AH maintenance funds are derived from the motor vehicle license tax. The collections are made by each county on vehicles </seg>
            <seg id="p023">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS within that county. All funds remain in the county where collected except three and one-half per cent which is transmitted to the State General Fund a portion of which if appropriated is used for motor vehicle and state highway maintenance administrative purposes. Once a year a representative of the Department of Public Work3 with the assistance of the County Board prepares a maintenance budget listing the funds needed for the maintenance of State Highways in each county. This budget is certified to the County Treasurer who sets aside from the motor vehicle license collections the amount of funds shown by the budget providing such amount doe3 not exceed seventy-five per cent of the Motor Vehicle taxes collected. The balance of the Motor Vehicle collections not taken in the budget or in the three and one-half per cent transmitted to the state or not otherwise taken is credited to the county road dragging fund. Generally less than fifty per cent of the collections are budgeted in the Maintenance (State Highway) Fund. When the county adequately maintains the state system to the satisfaction of the Department they are reimbursed the actual cost of such maintenance by claims upon the State Highway Fund approved by this Department. If the maintenance is not satisfactory the Depart - ment may upon thirty days written notice take over complete control of such maintenance and pay all costs from the State Highway Fund of said county. This has never been done to date although several warnings had to be issued to improve the maintenance. The mainten - ance of the state system in each county is directly under a County Highway Commissioner who is appointed each year by the County Board of Commissioners or Supervisors. The county board may appoint as County Highway Commissioner one of their own members or anyone else regardless of residence. Invariably the class of maintenance reflects directly the ability of the Highway Commissioner and his degree of co - operation with the State Department. Motor Vehicles — Motor vehicles include motorcycles, and all vehicles propelled by any other power than muscular power, excepting traction engines, road rollers and vehicles which run only on rails or tracks. Trucks include all vehicles equipped or used to carry anything other than passengers. Numbers are assigned to vehicles consecutively (from number one up' in each county) at the time the license fees are paid. Each county is assigned a key number designating the order of the coun - ties in which the larger number of vehicles have been registered as for example a Douglas County car with number 227 would carry 1-227 since Douglas County has the largest registration while a car with th» same number in Hooker County with the smallest registration would carry 93-227. Numbers must be carried on front and back of the ve - hicle a minimum distance of sixteen inches from the ground. Certifi - cates of registration showing ownership must be carried in containers in tl e car subject to public inspection. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">RKPOItT OF" RECRETAHY 24 (Registration fees are dependent upon the weight of the vehicle as ws: motorcycles and two wheeled trucks weighing less than one sand pounds $5.00, motor vehicles less than two thousand pounds K) with fifty cents additional for each one hundred pounds over two sand pounds provided that upon vehicles equipped to carry more seven passengers the total weight shall include the vehicle loaded ipacity with persons of 150 pounds' weight. Public owned motor :les are not taxed. Registration year extends from January 1 to mber 31 with 50 per cent reduction in fees on vehicles registered after 1. Foreign cars may stay in the state 30 days without purchasing ense. KThe maximum speed limit is 35 miles per hour on highways but does apply to emergency calls of police, fire vehicles, doctors and ambu - es, except when governed by city ordinances. I Lenses must be tested by this Department for a fee of $10.00 and approved lenses may be used. This Department is authorised to • rules and regulations governing lights and lenses. I The following size and weight limitations are placed upon the ration of motor vehicles upon public highways: Width maximum feet, height maximum 12 feet, 600 pounds maximum per inch width tire, 7000 pounds maximum on one wheel. I Signs — The Department has authority to mark the State Highway em from State Highway Funds (the 75% budget of motor vehicle tax maintenance). No other signs are permitted on the State Highway t-of-way except where permit is granted by this Department. One nit has been granted this biennium for an individual sign and per - 3 a dozen has been granted in previous bienniums, only one of which a state wide permit. Permits cannot be issued for signs larger i ten square feet surface. Signs can not be placed within 300 feet of ilroad crossing or highway intersection. IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS In addition to legislative appropriation funds the law provides sev - eral means of improving highways by various methods of assessing property benefitted under improvement districts created by the County Boards upon application of the districts. These laws are bulky and de - tailed but a few are summarized briefly here for general information. I Douglas County Paving Bill — applying- to counties having popula - in excess of 150,000 provides that districts may be established, ap - ied and assessed as per benefits received. t Lancaster County Paving Bill — applying to counties having popu - n of 40,000 to 100,000 provides that property over two miles from i can not be assessed over 10% of the total cost Six zones arc ed bearing percentage of cost as follows: 50, 25, 10, 5, 5, 5%. Sarpy County Paving Bill— applying to counties having population of 9000 — 11,000 provides that property may be assessed half way be- </seg>
            <seg id="p025">DEPARTMENT OK PUBLIC WORKS 25 tween any two state highways but not over a distance of two miles. Exclusive of state and federal aid funds which may be available, the county at large is assessed twenty-five per cent of the remaining cost and fifty per cent assessed on front footage of the property and twenty-five per cent to balance of property. State Paving Bill — applying to counties under 40,000 population pro - vides that assessments shall be made upon four equal zones not exceed - ing two miles on either side of the highway in the following percentage of cost. 25, 20, 15, 10%. Precinct, Village.Township or County Bonds — may be issued for improvements by petition vote of special election or unanimous order of the County Board but such issue in some instances can not exceed two per cent of the assessed valuation of the district. A tax is generally levied on the district sufficient to pay interest and five per cent of principal on bonds. There are many methods by which the subdivision rf State Government may form improvement districts and be bonded as a unit but under the constitution the state can not be so bonded. TYPICAL HIGHWAY LETTING It is of interest to many to know how a highway letting is handled at a time when several hundred bids are received with over a hundred bidders present besides many other interested parties and spectators. This department took heed this summer to the demand of the gen - eral public that the projects be made smaller so the smaller or new contractors could participate in the bidding. As a result all previous records for numbers of bids and numbers of contractors at a single let - ting were repeatedly broken. At one letting of fifty-five projects to- U.lling less han one million dollars there were ninety-nine different bid - ders with as many as thirty-four bids filed on a single project. Out of a mailing list of 250 contractors, eighty-four were successful in receiv - ing contracts in 1924. When this idea was first put into practice the Department was freely advised that they would have many failed con tractors and incomplete*! projects with bonding companies on thei hands, but the records prove the contrary to be true. Conditions in this respect have never been better. The following chart shows the plan of one of these lettings with Department employees represented by numbers from one to twenty-one with the exception of number three who is a represntative of the county. Th notice to contractors definitely stipulates the hour at which the re - ceiving of bids will close. Most of these bids are personally handed to Department representative within fifteen minutes of the closing time. When the hour for closing bids arrives the Department employees take places as shown on the chart. At table one employee No. 1 has received all proposals and grouped them under their proper project num- </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 REPORT OF SECRETARY « bers as shown on the sealed envelope. No. 1 cuts the sealed envelop, opens and passes the bid to No. 2. No. 2 calls the chairman or repre - sentative of the County Board No. 3 to the stand to witness the opening and reading of the bids. No. 2 reads aloud the county, project number, contractor's name and address, amount of certified check, and all items and bid prices submitted together with any special conditions or provis - ions the contractor may have inserted and passe? the proposal to No. 3 vho after inspection passes the proposal to No. 4. No. 4 lists the certi - fied checks for permanent record and passes this record and proposal to No. 5 who is in charge of table five. Three tabulators are stationed at table No. 2 who tabulate all bid prices as they are read aloud by No. 2. These tabulators Nos. 6, 7, and 8 \-ith previously prepared pheets tabulate independently as a check. When all bids on a project are read and tabulated the tabulated sheets are passed to No. 9 in charge of the computing and checking squad Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 at table No. 3. No. 9 extends all items, check* and circles low bidders on each item, group, or permissable combination of groups as covered in the specification or stipulated in the contractors' proposals. He reads one tabulation sheet aloud which is checked by Nos. 10 and li holding the second and third tabulated sheets. As No. 9 reads the quantities and bids aloud they are computed mechanically by Nos. 12 and 13 checking each other and results read back by No. 12 to Nos. 9, 10 and 11 for recording. The final addition of all quantities to determine low bidder is made by No. 14 on a mechanical adding machine. Employees of the clerical and accounting division are seated at table No. 5. General information to bidders and the press is passed out </seg>

Nos. 16, 17, 18 and 19 copy and prepare contracts for signatures of the County Board, contrac - tor and bonding companies. Most of these signatures are obtained before the parties leave to avoid delay through the mails. No. 5 transmits the tabulation sheets which have been completed to show low bidders as in - dicated by No. 9 to table No. 4 in the awarding room. At this table sits No. 20 awarding contracts with No. 21 taking a record of all minutes, and No. 3 representing the county board. All tables are active at the same time so that as table No. 1 is reading bids, table No. 2 is tabulating, table No. 3 computing, table No. 4 awarding, and table No. 5 signing contracts and bonds. If the letting is small about twelve employees are used and all bids are read before the awarding starts. Under the above system of awarding contracts, from fifteen to twenty average highway projects, each with from one to five separate contracts carrying the u.-ual number of road and bridge items with ten to thirty-five bidders on each project totalling several hundred thousand dollars can easily be read, awarded and contracts signed be - tween the hours of 10 A. M. and 5 P. M. The larger lettings are usually spread over two, three or four days so that a bidder who is unsuccessful one day may try again, using his same certified check the succeeding days. GRAVEL ROADS The present Highway Department is a strong advocate of gravel roads for Nebraska. Consequently a vigorous yet quiet campaign for such type of surfacing was started in 1923 which bore fruit quite forcibly in 1924. No definite surfacing program had been started previous to this year, however with the gravel campaign well under way it is be - lieved that the public will authorize a program which will insure and protect the road grade? previously completed as well as to surface the future construction. Nebraska is taking exception to the accepted facts claimed by her neighboring eastern states relative to the life of gravel roads. When Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, or other states advise that an eight inch gravel road can withstand economically only 400 vehicles per day Nebraska admits the fact as it applies to these states but replies tha in general within Nebraska half that depth of gravel will withstam satisfactorily three times that much daily traffic and will continue to do so without replacement for several years. Few people except the native Nebraskans who have travelled such roads for the past four years are ready to agree to such a statement. Further when such a Nebraskan with the aid of a pencil, a spare moment, and Nebraska contract prices figures that seven per cent interest on warrants for pavement averaging $30,000 per mile is $2100 annually and that this same $2100 will nlace at least two inches of gravel surfacing on a mile each year, this same Nebraskan is mighty slow to vote pavement bonds, because he knows </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OP SECRETARY 28 from experience that considerably less than two inches of gravel annual - ly will insure a splendid highway. So long as the gravel surface can carry the traffic satisfactorily twelve months of the year without ex - rsive costs for maintenance or gravel replacement it is not economical pave, but when these maintenance costs assume a proportion out of line with engineering estimates on pavement costs, then these surfaces must be protected by pavement. This department and the people realize that some portions of the State require pavement on the main highways for economy, but this is not a general state wide fact as in the neighboring states on the east. The eastern engineer immediately asks, why? The reply as follows re brief. The neighboring states on the east have about 50% more rain - fall and a much heavier soil. The Nebraska soil is generally a lighter sandier loam which dries quickly while the neighboring soil is a heavier clay gumbo which holds on to water tenaciously when once absorbed. The damaging effects of more water on a much heavier soil under high - way traffic is great so it is this difference alone that makes the above statement relative to Nebraska a general fact with of course a few ad - mitted exceptions. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 29 Saunders County State Highway No. 9 The above view shows a gravel highway that has formed a better riding surface than the average pavement twelve months out of the jear for the past five years. This is Federal-State project No. 27 soutn cf Wahoo. The gravel was started in the late fall of 1919 and completed in the early summer of 1920, thus giving five years service up to the present time. Another remarkable fact about this road is that 6.5 miles was surfaced with gravel four inches deep and 4.5 miles surfaced two inches deep. The maintenance cost on these sections has been slightly less than the maintenance on the adjoining state dirt roads and no money has been expended for gravel replacements. The four inch section is in wonderful condition today after five years service and is apparently good for several years to come without the addition of more gravel while the two inch section must be scarified and two inches more added •t once to produce a suitable road.

A four inch gravel surfacing has been the maximum for Nebraska with the exception of one contract recently let, using 6 inches of local poor grade gravel but many miles of two inch and three inch depths have been constructed, only one of which to date needs replacement The following table shows the gravel surfacing placed by this Department.

The larger part of the gravel used in Nebraska is pumped from the Platte River and screened according to specifications. This gravel is very hard and so fine that engineers are inclined to speak of the material as sand rather than gravel. Outside engineers, after reviewing the Nebraska specifications, comment that this state has no gravel roads but rather a sand-clay type of construction. Nebraska does have a sand-clay type or road construction but it is much different from the so-called gravel surfacing. The general screen analysis for gravel surfacing is as follows: passing one inch screen — lOOTc, retained on No. 4 sieve not less than 10%, retained on No. 6 sieve not less than 32 T, retained on No. 10 sieve not less than 707c. To obtain IIm above analysis, from 20^ to 89% of the pumped gravel is screened out as fine ~:'nd. This analysis i.&gt; occa - sionally modified to meet the conditions found in suitable dry gravel deposits. The pumped gravel when delivered upon the road is absolutely clean and void of any silt or clays so that the fini.-hed surface should depend upon the gravel producing its own binder by pebbles pulverizing under traffic into stone dust cement which forms the best possible binder fol- </seg>

Traffic is not in the mood, however, to await this period for compaction necessitated if the gravel forms its own so a satisfactory but less permanent binder is supplied by adding t mixture of the subgrade in the gravel after placing. This subgrade has been incorporated in the gravel the past five years by the following methods: scarifying, discing, harrowing, blading shoulder slopes and ditch cleanings over the gravel surface, and by placing the gravel in thin layers under traffic which beats the gravel into the subgrade or brings up a small part through wear. The application of thin layers under traffic as rapidly as traffi ccompacts same has proven to be by far the most satisfactory method since a good percen - tage of stone dust binder is produced and traffic is not hindered. In lat« fall or prolonged dry seasons a light scarifying or discing has proven desirable to hasten the incorporation of the gravel, but in gen - eral scarifying is a dangerous process. A new gravel road receiving too much scarifying compacts quickly, forms a good surface quickly but wears out quickly, due to the addition of too much low grade binder ana for the same reason such a road is badly rutted and cut up following a rain. tThe beginning of a graveled speedway through the rich agricultural icts of Seward County on Project 134-A, the D.

This process does not hinder traffic and does not require very many weeks' time to compact the three inches except during very dry periods when it may be assisted by light discing or scarifying. Above views show the result of .spreading too much gravel across the roadway at one time causing traffic to follow a single deeply rutted track. Views also show new guard rail used in Nebraska for first time.

This construction must be followed by intensive heavy maintenance during the heavy rains, not several hours or days after the rain, although continuous maintenance on dry graveled roads carrying a thin layer of loose gravel is essential. Such maintenance avoids chatter bumps, or cor - rugations, and keeps a thin film of loose but not objectionable gravel evenly spread over the surface. Nebraska's fine, hard, clean gravel with all stones over one inch diameter removed, compacts solidly and does not ravel. Too much natural clay content or the addition of a high per cent of local soil binder destroys the life of the road. Larger stones, if permitted, tip and rock under traffic, causing a small hole. The impact of traffic soon produces a large objectionable pot hole where once lay an oversized stone. One pot hole forms another particularly easy in the presence of objectionable foreign matter as lumps of earth, sod, or pieces of cloth used to plug leaky freight car? in shipment. These details are watched by the De - partment's inspector to insure a good gravel highway SURVEY OF ROAD MATERIALS IN NEBRASKA Road materials used by the Highway Department must comply with certain specifications, must be suitably located with respect to the roads on which they are used, and must exist under conditions suitable to economic production. Sand and Gravel. Most of Nebraska's sand and gravel is pro - duced from mantle rock deposits. But a small portion is derived front the bedrock formations. These sources of gravel in Nebraska range in geologic time from the Pennsylvania Beds to the Dakota For - mation, the Arikaree Formation, the Ogalalla Formation, an unnamed tertiary formation, glacio-fluvial deposits, glacial drift and alluvium. Among these the most important are the alluvium of the Platte River, the Aftonian Sand Plain and gravel bodies occurring at the base of the Dakota Formation. I Pennsylvania Formation. The Pennsylvania Beds outcrop in the counties of the state. Sand is found only in a few 4t such as those outcroppings at Peru and south of Falls City. </seg>

            <seg id="p036">36 Here the sand is too fine to be of value as a road material. Dakota Formation. The Dakota Formation consists mainly of a buff to a rusty brown sand stone heavily stained with iron. At the base of the formation lying uncomformably on the Pennsylvania rockx are lenticular beds of sand and fine gravel. The sand is too tine for construction work but the gravel is very good for road surfacing. These deposits occur quite extensively in the vicinity of Louisville. The gravel ranges from 10 to 20 feet in thickness and contains a great many clay balls, large boulders and often a small body of fire clay. There is also in the same vicinity a buried gravel body which is glacio-fluvial or a stream deposit of cretaceous time. The deposit extends in a generally southeasterly direction from Cedar Creek to south of Richfield and is about ten miles in length. Sand is produced from this deposit at several places. Arikaree Formation. The Arikaree Formation outcrops over a large area in northwestern Nebraska. The sands are grayish and generally of fine texture. In a few places it contains deposits of coarse gravel suitable for construction work. Ogalalla Formation. The formation is the bedrock in a large portion of the southwestern counties of Nebraska. It outcrops along the Republican River from below Franklin westward to the state line, and in the Lodgepole and North Platte Valleys. It contains a vast amount of sand and gravel some of which occurs as a friable sand stone conglomerate. The particles are made up of rounded grains of material loosely cemented by a calcareous cement. Sand of the Late Tertiary Age. Beneath the loess of much of central Nebraska and extending eastward under the western edge of glacial deposits is an unnamed tertiary formation which carries vast quantities of sand interstratified with layers of clay and silt. This formation forms nearly a continuous sand plain from 25 to 100 feet thick, outcropping along the Missouri River in northeastern Ne - braska as in KnoN and Cedar Counties and in the valleys along the Republican River in the southwestern counties. The extent of this said plain is not known nor what its geologic relation to the drift .sheet may be. Much of the sand is too fine for use but a portion of it may be utilized as a surfacing material for roads. It is too dirty for concrete work, containing not only clay and silt but also an iron cement. tThe Glacio- Fluvial or Af Ionian Sand Plain. This plain lies be - n the Nebraska and Kansas drift sheets and has a thickness of i 10 to 70 feet. The sand varies from dirty to clean and from sand to coarse gravel. It contains boulders, cobbles and large balls which were undoubtedly carried to their present positions the north, by streams, during the glacial time. Just what </seg>
            <seg id="p037">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 37 caused these streams to drop their heavy load in eastern and central Nebraska is not known. This sand plain extends through much of the upland of the loess hill and drift areas of Nebraska and is re - ported also in southwestern Iowa, northwestern Missouri and north - eastern Kansas. Sand is produced commercially from this source at Fairbury, DeWitt, Ulysses, Wahoo, Superior, Nelson and Hebron from the same horizon. As a surfacing material this gravel is one of the best in the state. It is of suitable size and quality and has a good binder of clay and iron oxide. When this gravel is laid upon a road and subjected to the impact of traffic it forms a surface which is ex - tremely hard and durable in either wet or dry weather. There will undoubtedly be a great many miles of road surfaced With gravel from this source in the future. GlacUI Drift. The drift of the Kansas sheet covers approximately the tier of the eastern four counties of Nebraska. It is evidenced On the surface by large boulders of many kinds of material, by rounded pebbles in the soil or by a heavy red day. The deposits occur in pockets which contain material grading from extremely fine sand to large boulders. At the base of these deposits the material is usually clean but is badly stained with iron, making it a poor mg - gregate for concrete. Either for construction work or surfacing material drift SUldS are poor at best, and the supply is so limited that at the present time it seems inadvisable to utilize it. Dune Sand. Dune Sand is the prevailing surface formation of the well-known sand hill region. It is too fine for any road use and offers a serious problem to road construction wherever it exists. Alluvium. The alluvial deposits of sand and gravel in the state are by far the most important sources of road material. These de - posits OCcur in the valleys of the Platte, Loup, Elkhorn, Blue, Re - publican and Missouri rivers. The alluvium of the Platte is very Coarse in the western part of the state, becoming finer toward the east, due of course to the action of the water upon the material. That of the Loup and Elkhorn rivers is almost too fine for road use. The Big and Little Blue carry material derived from the Aftonlan Sand Plain, tertiary sand and glacial drift Much of the sand is used commercially. The alluvium of the Republican Valley varies «. peat deal in size and quality depending upon the region. That of the Missouri grades from very fine sand to clay and is seldom used. In the alluvium of the Platte, Nebraska has an unlimited source of road material. This alluvium ranges from twenty-five to 100 feet ill thickness and extend* the full width of the Platte Valley through - out its coarse. It grades from fine sand to coarse gravel and is very hard and durable. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OP SECRETARY 38 State Owned Gravel Land. The gravel land near Ashland pur - chased by the State in May, 1920, is located in Sections 30 and 31 of Township 13 North, Range 10 East, Saunders County. It is on the main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad between Lincoln and Omaha. There are a great many reasons which enter into the fact that Platte Valley land in the vicinity of Ashland is almost ideal for trravel production. The Platte valley is about 1% miles in width at this point so the river has had neither a chance to change its course appreciably nor has it lost any of its velocity. There are no tribu - tary streams flowing into the Platte which might carry finer ma - terial immediately above this location and the river has not meandered enough to appreciably change the alluvium, as originally deposited, below a depth of about ten feet. There are 62.8 acres of deed land in the tract purchased. With this the State received title to thirty-four acres of accretion land. The tract has 2100 feet of trackage on the main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. It is possible to produce from this land approximately 500,000 cubic yards of road gravel or 1,000,000 cubic yards of concrete gravel and the supply from the river is unlimited. The land is protected on the south from overflow by the grade of the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad and on the east along the river front by a dike thrown up by the railroad company which facts are indeed an advantage. The gravel on this tract when analyzed, tested from forty to forty-six per cent retained on a No. 10 screen with the exception of a small area of about twenty-seven acres which has about ten feet of fine sand deposited on the surface. To date it has been un - necessary to open this pit to secure proper gravel prices from the various commercial companies. Since freight rates greatly reduce the area that might be served from any gravel pit, it may prove advisable to acquire additional ground for sources of gravel supply in various parts of the state, particularly along the Platte and Republican rivers. Survey Methods. The survey of road materials in Nebraska has been conducted for several years by the State Conservation and Soil Survey, however, when the Federal Aid program was enacted a more detailed survey of certain areas became necessary which was carried en by the Department's engineering forces. The most important road materials surveyed are deposits of sand, gravel, clay and stone suitable for road construction. For the bene - fit of county officials and others interested in general road work, a few general statements will be made regarding methods used. The problem of testing sand deposits is divided into distinct phases; first, that of testing alluvial deposits, and second, that of testing bank deposits. These will be treated separately as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p039">DEr.MJT.MKXT OF PUBLIC WORKS 39 Alluvial Sand Testing. The economic side of the production of gravel enters so thoroughly into the situation that the quality Of gravel possible to produce is often necessarily disregarded because of economic features. A site must be chosen not only with regard to the possibility of producing gravel of good quality, but also with regard to distance to the road upon which it is to be used, with regard to shipping facilities, and the purchase price of the land. Having decided upon a plot of land which is suitably located the detailed examination of that particular deposit is made. All alluvial gravel lies either practically at or below the water line, therefore it is necessary to procure such equipment as will work under these conditions. A casing four or six inches in diameter is sunk and the sand is removed from within this easing by either a sand bucket, a sand pump or a trap auger. The pump is often times mechanically inefficient, and the sand bucket gives a false impression as to the exact stratification of the sand. The trap auger is the most certain and effective tool for this work. It removes the gravel ex - actly as it occurs in the ground, taking out the fine and coarse ma - terials in their exact relationship. It is much slower than either of the methods mentioned above but one may be certain of the results obtained. After several test holes have been put down evenly distributed over the plot of ground and samples have been obtained at different depths in these holes, the results are averaged and the quality of gravel possible to produce from the certain plot of ground determined. Next, quantities of material present must be figured. An easy way of doing this in the field is to figure the area of usuable ground in square yards, multiply this by the depth to which the gravel may be worked and make a correction for the material to be wasted by screening. This will give approximately the number of yards of gravel in a given area. It then becomes necessary to map the ground as to the best possible location for trackage, driveways, buildings and the pits, so aa to give the largest areas possible to gravel production. Classify the ground as to the number of trees or stumps to be pulled, the amount of stripping to be done and the nature of the material to be stripped, and evaluate the land to be purchased. Bank Pits. The location of a dry land pit is much more compli - cated and uncertain as to results than is that of the alluvial pit. The material in these bank pits is derived from the sand plains, from two unnamed tertiary deposits and glacial pockets and because Of the manner of their deposition great care must be taken in their sui - vey. These deposits are not consistent as to thickness, quantity, </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 quality of geoligic relation to other formations making: deductions very uncertain. If seeking' to locate a pit in. an area where only bank pits will be possible, trace up the drainage ways in the vicinity, looking for a stream or intermittent drainage which carries gTavel. If such a stream is found, follow this until the gTavel body is located. Then determine the elevation of this layer of gravel and trace it by the use of a level and surface indications until a suitable location for production is found. Proceed by putting down test holes and by the methods stated previously, determine the exact quantities of gravel tClay. Clay as treated here is used as a surfacing material on roads and as a binding material on sand-clay roads or sand - roads to be surfaced with gravel. In nearly all places in the s where gravel roads are constructed the road soil and gravel has sufficient cementing quality to bind the gravel together a hard wearing surface, but in some vicinities where sand clay s have been built additional clay must be added to insure a suit - foundation and binder for a gravel course. JClay is used frequently in the sandhill regions as a surfacing terial where it not only binds together the fine particles of d but also forms a hard crust-like surface that will stand the wear the traffic. The problems involved in the location of suitable deposits of day for either binding or surfacing material are fewer than those of E cation of gravel deposits because of the fact that most of the ties of the state have been thoroughly surveyed with respects ie soil existing. This work has been done by the U. S. Bureau of and the Nebraska Conservation and SoH Survey. »When seeking a suitable deposit of clay the soil survey maps consulted and the location for clay made with respect to the road which the material is to be used. A sand clay or gravel clay road is constructed most effect - ively when the sand and clay are mixed in proper proportions. These proportions are not purely arbitrary but are determined by definite testes of the material to be used. These proportions are determined in the field by tests known as the slacking and flouring tests. A sample of the clay to be used is dried and sieved through a 100 mesh sieve. This clay is then mixed with the sand in many different proportions, a little water added and the mixture molded into briquettes and allowed to dry. These briquettes are then given the slacking and flouring tests which indicates the best proportion </seg>
            <seg id="p041">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 41 Gravel Deposits The Platte River Valley is the most impor - tant source of sand and gravel in the state. There are 30 com - mercial producing plants located at different points along this stream within the limits of Nebraska. Practically all of the aggregate for concrete work, and 60% of the gravel for surfacing on our Federal Aid roads is secured from this source. Outside the limits of the Platte River Valley, the most impor - tant commercial sand and gravel producing plants are located at the following towns: Long Pine, Burwell, Norfolk and Cowles. During the last two years there has been a growing demand for gravel surfacing on the State Highway system. This has led to an increased interest in local deposits that might be suitable and available for surfacing purposes. Much exploration work has been done by the State Highway Department and by the local road authorities. This is especially true in sections of the state, to which freight rates are extremely high from Platte River pits. Many de - posits have been uncovered and utilized, in places where previously there was little idea, that gravel existed in pay quantities. During the construction season of 1924, gravel from local bank pits has been used for surfacing in Otoe, Saunders, Furnas, Chase, Perkins, Cheyenne, Kimball, Morrill, Boyd, Cedar, Sioux and Dixon counties. The total yardage amounted to 134,000 cubic yards. From local alluvial pits 133,700 cubic yards of gravel has been produced for surfacing in the following counties: Jefferson, Garden, Red Willow, Madison, Coif ax, Merrick, Hall, Buffalo, Dawson and Kearney. By utilizing these local gravel deposits many thousands of dollars have been saved to the tax payers in freight charges alone. Below are shown three typical Platte River gravel producing plants: </seg>

There are very few stone deposits of commercial value in the State The quarries located at Louisville and Weeping Water are the most important. A large deposit of sand stone, located near Indianola has been tested and found suitable for concrete aggregate. It is proposed to lay an experimental section of Macadam road from this material, which although slightly soft should give reasonably good service. Portland Cement. This State has one cement mill located at Superior. This mill has a daily capacity of 3000 barrels.

Through group conferences monthly with the District Engineers and by occasional field trips usually with District Engineers, or Testing Engineer, the Chief of Bureau is enabled to keep in close contact with all field work. Such monthly conferences, where the problems and accomplishments of each District Engineer are discussed and future policies established, result in a very great benefit to the individual Engineers and the functioning of the organization as a tEach District Engineer has established permanent headquarters :rally located with reference to highways and railroad service his district to best serve the purpose of the office. The ten standing duties of the District Engineer follow, together with lief explanation of each duty. , Location II. The District Engineer is largely responsible for the location the highways. Too little power is granted this Department in location of highways and too much is granted to the local county icials who although competent are often times seriously em - rassed by their constituents unfair demands upon them relative a location benefiting a town or private interests at the expense the state as a whole. Through engineering influence and with the of the Federal Engineer at the time of inspection the District srineer can obtain a reasonable location for the highway or recom - nd the postponement of construction. 2. Preliminary survey parties are under the direction of the District Engineers. The Preliminary Engineer is shown the general alignment to be surveyed and reports direct to the District Engineer. The funds available this biennium as in all past bienniums has been too meager to permit the Preliminary Engineer to do justice to the necessary field investigation which would insure proper and economic highway location, design and construction. E£ Through cooperation with the County Boards of Commissioners Supervisors the District Engineer obtains resolutions required by ite locating highways, requesting state-federal construction pledg - funds for various purposes such as right-of-way, materials, con - •tion and maintenance. 4. The District Engineer makes the plan-in-hand inspection upon which the final plans are made previous to contracting. Upon receipt </seg>
            <seg id="p045">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 45 of tentative plans from the Office Engineer, the District Engineer and Federal Engineer in company with the County Board make an inspection over the route laying the proposed grade line and recom - mending adequate surfacing and drainage structures. Construction 5. The District Engineer has direct supervision over all construc - tion on the state highway system and all state aid bridges re - gardless of their location. Frequent inspection trips are made over all work to insure adequate engineering, satisfactory progress by the contractor and proper completion. 6. The District Engineer is responsible for the engineering par - ties in charge of construction. Such parties consist of a Project Engineer, generally in charge of several projects together with in - strument men, inspectors, rodmen, and chainmen. The Project Engin - eer reports direct to the District Engineer. 7. The District Engineer checks and approves all payrolls, expense vouchers, changes in construction plans, agreements, progress and final estimates submitted by the Project Engineer. Maintenance 8. The District Engineer prepares a budget for each county at th« beginning of each year of anticipated expenditures for maintenance on the state highway system and submits this budget to the County Board for their approval. Patrol sections are designated, equipment purchased, and patrolmen hired in accordance with the approved budget which can not exceed 75% of the automobile license col - lections. All claims for expenditures for maintenance are approved by the District Engineer before payment is made by the County Treasurer. The District Engineer prepares maps of the patroled sections, showing types and lengths of patrols, and checks and approves all cost records and distribution sheets from which are prepared the annual maintenance costs and distribution sheets. Occasional trips are made by the District Engineer over the state highway system, inspecting the maintenance over which he has gen - eral supervision. Following each trip, recommendations and crit - icisms are made to the County Highway Commissioner calling at - tention to conditions as observed. Miscellaneous 9. The markings of the state highwal system and placement of advertising signs are also under the supervision of the District Engineer. During the past biennium the Department has removed the </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 REPORT OF SECRETARY I highway numbers, which numbers totaled eighty-eight leading ■here in particular, and has replaced them with about one-third t number which are continuous across the state or lead into te through highway. This has been a great boon to tourists, but lack funds has prevented the purchase and placement of a thoroughly ndardized system of markers which have been under study for le time. The Department has authority to approve advertising signs upon the highway but is extremely reluctant to do so. In fact only one ap - proval has been granted this biennium and this was for an individual sign. Some counties have wisely started an active campaign for the removal of all signs not approved by this Department. 10. The District Engineers are frequently called upon to address meetings, discuss matters with various delegations, and to represent the Department at different times. For this reason considerable responsibility is placed upon District Engineers in promoting co - operation between various organizations, units of government, and the public.

About forty per cent of the mileage improved by State and Federal Aid is located in the hilly portion of the county and the remainder in the more level section. The County Board has adopted the policy of using all available state and federal funds to bring their state highway system to a permanent grade, and are extending county money to match funds raised locally for the purpose of meeting Federal Aid, not met by the state, to construct gravel surfacing. In 1924 about ten per cent of their system has been graveled by this method of financing. The county supervision of the maintenance of the state highway system is divided between the County Board mejnbers. On a part of the system the results obtained average with the best obtained in District One.

This help from the county, together with the nature of the topography of the county, which makes light con - struction feasible has made it possible to obtain so much improved highway. tin 1924 the first gravel surfacing placed on public highways in county was on the D. L. V. highway, and extends across the ity in an east and west direction, with an exception of three miles »-een Harvard and Sutton. As soon as additional funds are avail - ;, this short piece will be surfaced with gravel, together with some the K. N. D. highway, which crosses the county from south to Fillmore County The topography of Fillmore county is quite similar to that of Clay county, except that the state highway system crosses a few more lagoons in Fillmore than in Clay county. Contracts awarded in 1924 jointly by the County Board and the Department of Public Works constitute about twenty per cent of the mileage improved with drainage structures and brought to grade on the state highway system in Fillmore county. The 1924 work lays east of Fairmont and consists of grading and drainage structures. It involves a change in location between Friend, in Saline county, and Fairmont which will eliminate from the state highway, when all por - tions of the project are completed, four crossings of a main line rail - road and two of a branch line, leaving only two crossings of branch lines at grade. Formerly there were five grade crossings of main line tracks and three crossings on branch lines. The Fillmore County Highway Commissioner has designed a re - movable culvert headwall post, which has been approved by the U. S. riu of Public Roads and the Department of Public Works. This first used on the 1924 work in Fillmore county.

            <seg id="p051">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 51 Gage county is favored with the location of two of the primary inter-state highways within its borders. The Golden Rod Highway crosses it from east to west and the Cornhusker Highway crosses it from south to north, with the intersection of the two at Beatrice. In addition to these, they have a secondary highway located across the northern portion of the county, through Clatonia, which, when con- structed, will connect the county seats of Nemaha and Fillmor* counties. Hamilton County The State Highway System in Hamilton county is located through terrain which, is flat or gently rolling. The highway north of Aurora crosses lagoons; at one place the roaci is subject to inundation in time of extra heavy rains for a distance of about 1.75 miles. This has required the construction of side drainage across farm lands and along side roads to natural drainage courses. On the Platte river bottoms in the north part of the county it has been necessary to place heavy soil on the natural soil in the sub - grade before gravel surfacing could be applied. When the balance of the system is constructed to a permanent grade and surfacing ap - plied, two other locations will be encountered where this type of con - struction will be required. The funds for the first gravel surfacing placed in Hamilton county were obtained from the city of Aurora, Hamilton County, and Federal Aid. Following the construction of this project in 1924 from the city limits north to the Cemetery. The County Board made ap - plication for gravel on the S. Y. A. highway from Aurora to the York county line. Jefferson County During the first few years of State and Federal Aid road con - struction in Nebraska, the Golden Rod Highway was constructed to a permanent grade ami drainage structures built across Jefferson County. This constitutes about 70% of the mileage of the State System as now laid out in the county. After interviews with the Department of Public Works and local people interested, the County Board decided to make application for the expenditure of available funds to construct gravel surfacing east and west of Fairbury, the work to extend as far as available funds would permit. Contracts were awarded on this work and carried to completion in 1924, u.-ing State and Federal Aid Road Funds. The gravel for this project was pumped from the Little Blue River within about 500 feet of the highway. Other local deposits of material were considered by the contractors, but it was decided that </seg>

Pumping plant mounted on boat in Little Blue River delivering gravel to storage bin, Johnson County. Highway construction in Johnson County is more expensive than in the average counties of District One, on account of the heavy clay and loose rock encountered in some of the hills, and also on account of the heavy drainage encountered. The topography of the county is mostly hilly and rolling; and the surface soil is of a loose nature which washes badly during heavy rainfall. This condition presents problems in highway construction not met in some of the counties. For the 1924 construction program the County Board and the De - partment of Public Works selected the worst place on the system in Johnson County, and have built two miles of road west of Sterling, using State and Federal Funds.

Highway graveled from the pavement at Emerald to the Seward County line and the S. Y. A. graveled from the end of the pavement northwest of Lincoln to Wood - lawn. This work has been done with State and Federal Road Funds. In addition to the above, the highway south from Bennett to the Gage County line was completed in 1924. This improvement con - sisted of grading ami drainage structures, including one concrete arch bridge, one concrete girder bridge and two concrete slab bridges, and all was paid from County and Federal Funds. In 1923 a thirty foot loadway bituminous pavement was laid on East O Street and in 1924 the same kind of pavement with eighteen foot and twpnty-four foot roadways was laid at College View. The combined length of these is 1.47 miles and both were financed with Improvement District, State and Federal fund?. In 1923 a concrete arch bridge was built on the S. Y. A. west of Woodlawn and in 1924 a four span concrete girder bridge 200 feet long was placed under construction on the Cornhusker Highway across Salt Creek north of Havelock, using County and Federal Funds. , Nemaha County Nemaha County joins Johnson County on the ea^t and the road problems in the two counties are quite sim lar in regard to grades, materials encountered and drainage. Nebraska Federal Aid Project No. 2, from Kansas line north through Falls City to Nebraska City, crosses Nemaha County through Auburn. It was constructed during the early period of State and Federal Aid Road development in Nebraska. During 1923 the project from Auburn west to Rohrs was completed and in 1924 it was ex - tended west to Johnson. The improvement consists of standard grad - ing and drainag? structures built from State and Federal Aid Road Funds with County Funds used on the larger drainage structures. Also in 1924 The Sheridan Cemetery Association and the County provided funds to meet available Federal Aid and constructed 0.59 miles of eighteen foot roadway concrete pavement which joins the city pavement with the Cemetery west of Auburn. The City of Auburn has attained what many of the smaller cities of the state aspire to atttain, namely, to be located on an important highway. Entering Auburn from the north the traveler observes the "W (Washington Highway), C. R. (Capitol Route— Follow the Ducks), K. T. (King of Trails), G. R. (Golden Rod), Nebraska 3 and Nebraska 5.

This was later carried to com - tion and the improvement consists of a permanent grade with suit - e drainage structures to replace those in poor cndition, leaving in ce such structures as did not require replacing at that time. After completion of the grading the county placed a light application of al gravel on about the two north miles of this project with gratify - results. In 1924 the last gap of the State Highway from Nelson south and east to the Thayer County line was brought to permanent grade and drainage structures constructed, using available State and Federal Aid Road Funds. This improvement involved a change in location which shortens the route between Nelson and Hebron two miles and elimin - ates two railroad crossings at grade. I The 1924 project from Superior southwest to the Kansas line con - i 1.33 miles of eighteen foot roadway concrete pavement and 0.47 s of sand-clay surfacing. It was necessary to select pavement for improvement on account of the flooding of land, joining the high - , by the Republican River and on account of the sandy soil, lty, State and Federal Funds were used in this improvement. It ie longest .single paving project built in District One, outside of orate limits, in 1923 and 1924. No Federal or State money has been expenden on the Golden Rod Highway between Superior and the west county line, but the County has bladed up a roadway and people interested in the highway have donated money and labor to haul local sand gravel on about eight miles of this with the result that they now have a road which will permit speed and comfort. Otoe County Since the State and Federal Aid Road program began in Nebraska, about eighty per cent of the laid out highway system in Otoe County has been brought to permanent grade. This County does not have a mileage of laid out State Highways in excess of their funds available to construct and maintain same, which is true of some of the coun - ties of the state. I The major improvement in Otoe County has been made in 1924 by construction of 0.68 miles of eighteen foot roadway concrete pave - t and 27.38 miles of gravel surfacing. concrete pavement skirts the south and west borders of &gt;r Lodge, the newly acquired State Park at Nebraska City which presented to the state by the heirs of J.

Otoe County Project No. 214 — Concrete Pavement at Arbor Lodge The gravel surfacing extends from Nebraska City south to the N'emaha County line, from Nebraska City west to Dunbar and from the end of the pavement at Arbor Lodge to the Cass County line. The entire gravel program was carried out using County Funds to meet Federal Aid. State and Federal Funds were used to build the concrete pavement. Platte River gravel was used on 1.75 miles north of Arbor Lodge and local gravel was used on the remainder of the road surfaced in 1924. In order to make the local gravel meet specifications for grad - ing of sizes, it was necessary to run the pit-run material through a portable crusher. There is a small amount of clay in the local ma - terial which act; as a natural binder, causing the gravel placed on the road to compact rapidly and form a good surface. </seg>

            <seg id="p060">60 Pawnee County The inhabitants of Pawnee County are proud of the one State High - way which traverses their County from east to west through the county seat, connecting Falls City with Beatrice and towns west in the south tier of counties. In 1920 and 1921 about 40 per cent of this highway was brought to a permanent grade and drainage structures built, using State and Federal Aid Road Funds on the grading and smaller structures, and County Funds on the larger structures. I The constructed road is east and west of Pawnee City. The high - west of Lewiston and east of Tcble Rock encounters heavy es, when the latter is built, loose rock will be encountered in ral of the cuts. Since this road was laid out at a State Highway placed under patrol maintenance in 1920, a very good surface been developed as the result of the County's maintenance forces. j have done considerable clearing along the right-of-way, have ilt with County Funds the poorest drainage structures, and east able rock have removed much of the rock from the surface of the tway. Richardson County Richardson County lies in the southeastern corner of the State and the flood waters from Counties north and west of them pass across the State Highways of this County. This condition makes bridge build - ing one of the most important features of highway construction in this County. At present Jhey have one highway across their County from Kansas through Falls City towards Auburn brought to permanent grade and drainage structures built. This is known as the Wash - ington or K. T. The Capitol Route also crosses the County from Kansas through Dawson towards Auburn. The third highway is in the central part of the County and runs from the K. T. west through Humboldt to connect with Pawnee City and towns west. The 1924 construction consisted of building one 100 foot span steel truss bridge on the Capitol Route north of Dawson. It is planned that the balance of the 1923-24 apportionment of State and Federal Aid Road Funds will be used to build other bridges on this route and the next available funds will be used to build bridges on the highway through Humboldt. Saline County The major part of the State Highway System in Saline County is located through flat or gently rolling country. About 40 per cent of their system has been brought to permanent grade using State and Federal Funds on the grading anc! smaller structures and County Funds on the larger structures. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">DEPARTMENT r&gt;F PUBLIC WORKS 61 The 1923-24 construction consisted of building 0.69 miles of bi - tuminous pavement near Crete using: local funds to meet State and Federal Aid; the completion of the grading between Friend and Crete, the building of five steel and concrete bridges between Wilber and Western, the grading and building of drainage structures between Friend and the Fillmore County line, using State and Federal Aid Road Funds; and the placing of gravel wearing surface between Friend and Dorchester, and east of Crete, using County, State and Federal Funds. The gravel at Crete was placed four inches deep, four miles of the gravel between Friend and Dorchester was placed 2 inches deep and the remainder is 3 inch gravel. The grading west of Friend connects with the projects in Fill - more County east of Fairmont, which constitute a change in location, made in order to eliminate crossing the main line of the Burlington at grade four times between Friend and Fairmont. Sarpy County The primary highway from Kansas City to Omaha crosses the east end of Sarpy County and the D. L. D. Highway crosses the north - western portion of the County. In addition to these they have a sec - ondary State Highway connecting from the D. L. D. through Papil - lion, the county seat, with South Omaha as well as with the Kansas City road, and the Bellevue Boulevard in the extreme eastern end of the County. Also there is a connection from Gretna north to Douglas County. The topography of the County is rolling and hilly, making the construction of drainage structures a very important item in road building. The apportionment of State-Federal Funds to Sarpy County is small on account of the size of the County. The traffic on the primary State Highways in the County is very heavy on account of being principle feeder highways in Omaha. To date the principle portion of the State-Fedem! Funds expended in the County has been on the D. L. D. Highway, only one bridge having been constructed on any portion of the secondary system in the County. About two years ago the people of the County began to realize that if they ever obtained any improvement on their roads, they would have to finance the greater portion themselves. Since that time two Precincts, Pa pillion and Gilmore, have voted a total of $110,000.00 to grade and gravel 19.7 miles of road within the two precincts. About 7.5 miles of the improvement will be on precinct roads and the re - mainder on secondary State Highways. On a part of the State High - way a small amount of Federal Aid will be available. Of the total, 14.2 miles have been placed under construction and will probably be ccmpleted before the end of the year. </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 REPORT OF SECRETARY Under the Hughes Improvement District Law three districts were formed on the Bellevue Boulevard between South Omaha and the Village of Bellevue, comprising 0.75 miles of grading and brick pave - ment and 3.47 miles of grading and gravel surfacing-. All of this is under contract to be completed by the end of this season. Two other districts were formed on the Omaha-Kansas City road for the purpose of meeting Federal Aid in the construction of 0.58 miles of brick pavement and 4.3 miles of gravel surfacing, including grading on both, between South Omaha and the entrance to Fort Crook. This work has not yet been placed under contract. One district was petitioned covering four mile? of gravel surfacing north from Gretna, but this has not been consumated because it has been thought that it might be possible to organize a precinct bond Imposition which would accomplish more miles of improvement three ways from Gretna. Seward County Seward County has expended County Funds jointly with State and Federal Funds until now they have 70 per cent of their system brought to permanent grade and gravel surfacing placed on approximately 30 per cent of this mileage. The heaviest grading in the County has been completed. » During the season of 1924 the County has met Federal Aid on one foot span girder bridge north of Seward and on the grading ami inage structures on the cut-off from the D. L. D. Highway to the Y. A. Highway east of Sewanl, and in addition have made pay - ments on the gravel surfacing on the D. L. D. Highway between Mil - ford and the Lancaster County line, meeting Federal Aid and State ap - portionment available. In 1923 the County placed gravel on about 1.5 miles of the S. Y. A. across the river bottom west of Seward. Thayer County In Thayer County the road builder encounters a variety of con - ditions ranging from hilly topography to flat table lands, and from heavy clay to light sand. Nevertheless the traveler usually finds the Thayer County State Highways in exceptionally good condition. kThe State Highway System of Thayer County includes Nebraska iway No. 4 (The Meridian), and Nebraska Highway No. 3, which ects with the Golden Rod at Fairbury and Superior. I In 1923 the project leading west from Hebron was completed and 1924 Highway No. 3 has been brought to permanent grade and inage structures built from Deshler west to the Nuckolls County </seg>
            <seg id="p063">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 63 As yet a gravel surfacing project has not been constructed in Thayer County, but it is expected that in places local surfacing gravel can be procured, which will make very cheap work when such a pro - gram is entered upon. York County On account of the gently rolling or flat land of York County, the grading of the State Highway to permanent grade has not been very expensive and as a result the Meridian Highway and the S. Y. A. Highway have each been brought to permanent grade. One gravel project has been built from York north to the Polk County line. On this local gravel was used from a pit near York. Other small deposits are available for portions of the remainder of the State Systems when gravel surfacing is placed. The 1924 construction program consisted of building a three span I Beam and concrete bridge with concrete post and rail bannisters at the south entrance of the Meridian Highway into the City of York. State, Federal and County Funds were used in the construction of th« bridge and the City furnished lighting fixtures placed on concrete posts at each corner of the structure. In addition the City widened the pavement to meet the wide roadway of the bridge and also placed gravel surfacing on about one block of the highway leading south from the bridge.

            <seg id="p064">64 REPORT OF SECRETARY Boone County The roads comprising Boone county system of State highways includes Highway No. 14 extending from north to south and Highway No. 32 extending eastward from Albion. All of No. 14 has been constructed with Federal and State Aid funds and one mile adjoining the city of Albion has been graveled with maintenance funds of the county and donations from the commercial club of Albion. A project five miles in length is being constructed at the present time east of Albion on Highway No. 32 and when completed will eliminate the only bad piece of highway within the County. The soil on No. 14 for the most part is a silty clay which washes badly necessitating the highway to be reconstructed and shaped a number of times during the biennium. The county is actively interested in good roads and show this interest in splendid cooperation with the State Department. The maintenance forces have tsken care of the snow removal in the past by keeping the roads open and passable at all times. No grade -ing elimination is contemplated at the present time. Burt County tThe highways maintained in Burt county include Highway No. 5, nding from north to south across the county. No. 5-B, which s No. 9 with No. 5 west of Oakland; No. 5-C which begins at imah and extends to Decatur, an inland town in the northern of the county, and a river crossing, and No. 9 extending north - and westerly in the extreme west part of the county. I The system as laid out affords all points in the county an outlet every town of importance can be reached on one of these high - t&amp;. The soils for the most part are loess with an occasional hill heavy clay, but it has been found that a coat of gravel on this ,■ changes the aspect of this material and affords a surface sur - sed only by paving. The entire system has been constructed with eral, state aid and maintenance funds from the county and has n well maintained during the past biennium. The regular patrols ibined with the necessary teams and laborers have taken care of snow removal satisfactorily. In the northern part of the county, at the Latta Ranch and near Decatur and Tekamah pood gravel deposits over fifty feet deep have been found by the state. Since this deposit is a desirable road gravel • project involving federal and state aid has been formed to surface the highway from Decatur to Tekamah. Fortunately for this county there exists no bad railroad grade crossings and no improvement is contemplated at present on the only one that exists. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 65 Butler County The highways under state jurisdiction in Butler county are High - way No. 15 and Highway No. 16 crossing each other at David City. Highway No. 15 extends from north to south and Highway No. 16 extends from east to west across the county and each has a variety of soils ranging from sand gumbo in the bottoms to loess and plastic ciay in the hills. A series of low lagoons prevail to the west of David City and these at times rise high enough to soften the road bod, but in general the road materials are such as to require no extraordinary methods to maintain them. Highway No. 16 has been constructed from the east line to the west line of the county. That part of Highway No. 15 from David City north to the Platte River has been constructed with Federal and State aid funds. In addition an overflow pavement has been con - structed adjoining the state aid bridge, south of Schuyler. This paving serving as a flood way for Bone Creek has taken care of the ice gorges and flood waters of the Platte. The entire system of highways maintained with truck and trac - tors has been practically reconstructed during the past year. The patrol forces, equipped with snow plows and heavy tractors work on snow removal during the winter months. During the past year the county has added to and improved the garage so that all the re - pairing of the trucks and tractors of the state as well as the county has been done without private garage assistance. One mechanic's time is spent entirely on the equipment. A careful study has been made both by the state and the county of the possible locations of gravel for surfacing but as yet none has been found except at the Platte River bottoms which is too long a hau to be of immediate benefit except to the roads near the river. No railroad facilities are available for this supply and any materials for surfacing will probably have to come from the Platte River east o Butler county. Owing to the fact that none but branch lines traverse this county no railroad grade crossing eliminations are contemplatet at present. Colfax County The highways included within the maintenance program for Col - fax county include No. 6 extending east and west and paralleling the Union Pacific railroad and Highway No. 15 crossing the county north and south. Highway No. 6 lying in the Platte River bottoms has a diversity of soil ranging from loose sand to heavy plastic clay, each in themselves a poor road material, but in proper combination with each other they form an excellent road. Highway No. 15 passes through the Platte bottoms with soil conditions identical with No. 6, </seg>
            <seg id="p066">66 REPORT OP SECRETARY then on to the loess hills of the bluffs further north. Highway No. 6 has been constructed from the Dodge county line to the Platte county line. That section from Rogers to Schuyler has been surfaced with gravel and from Schuyler west to the town of Richland the entire strip of highway has been surfaced with gumbo. The graveling has been paid from federal and state aid funds and the surfacing from maintenance funds of the county. Highway No. 15 has been con - structed to a temporary grade for the most part although a few of the heaviest grades have been reduced to a maximum of seven per cent. All of the expenditure for this improvement has been paid from the maintenance fund. On the extreme south end of this road crossing the Platte River bottoms, overflow paving has been con - structed with state and federal funds thus eliminating the worst sec - tion of highway in the county. For days after a rise in the Platte River this section was impassable before the improvement but at the present time no time is lost even when the Platte is out of the banks. The down stream side of the paving has been ripraped with stone and covered with soil to prevent wash. This protection has proven satisfactory. ♦ I Considerable attention has been given by the county board to ide crossing elimination and with the contemplated improvement the Lincoln Highway, two dangerous grade crossings will be elimin - d. Each of these changes of alignment will take the highway ay from the towns of Schuyler and Richland but the change is Snow removal is carried on each winter by the regular patrol forces with success. With the purchase of additional snow fence, no Es trouble is anticipated. The patrols have not only kept the highways in good shape but also the detours incident to con - ion.

No. 9 is loess except he hills contiguous to the Elkhorn River, which are very sandy No. 15 is loess throughout. Most of the sandy stretches have surfaced and an extensive gravel project has been completed een the city of West Point and the city of Wisner with Federal State aid funds. The maintenance of the highways have been carefully taken care </seg>

The county through the main - tenance fund has constructed a large part of Highway No. 9 and Highway No. 15 and at no time during the last year has there been any bad sections of highway within the county. Valuable deposits of gravel have been found in the western part of the county which has been used on the highways and streets in the neighboring towns. These deposits have been worked commercially for some time but the most valuable deposit found is yet to be opened. This deposit has been offered to the state and county on a royalty basis at an ex - tremely low price so the county board will this winter start graveling the four mile stretch contiguous to the west county line. No grade crossing elimination is contemplated at this time as only one crossing exists which is an open, clear crossing. Project 230-A, West Point east. Dodge County The highways maintained by the state in Dodge county include No. 6 extending east and west through the county; No. 8 extending westerly and northerly; No. 9 extending north and south; and No. 30 beginning at Fremont and extending easterly to connect with the Washington highway. All of these highways are nationally known highways which carry besides the local traffic a very heavy tourist traffic. The traffic census of the last year has shown that these highways are the most heavily traveled roads within the state not only from a pleasure standpoint, but as a commercial trucking route to the Omaha markets. The soil is for the most part very light and sandy with occasional strips of gumbo in the bottoms and loess in the hills. Dodge county during the past year assisted in building a paving </seg>

These pits owned by private concerns but furnish the major part of the el for construction in the county. Know removal has been taken care of successfully by county supplanted with such team and man power as is needed. At no time during the past two years has the highways been closed ex - cept for a few hours after an unusual snow storm. The county has purchased a large amount of snow fence to be placed as needed and the difficulties of the past will, to a great extent be overcome. Several (Trade crossings are under consideration for elimination but no definite stand has been taken as yet to eliminate them. Merrick Oounty I The highways under state control in this county are No. 6 and 14, both of which are of state wide importance. Highway No. 6, Lincoln Highway, traverses the county from east to west and 14 from north to south. Highway No. 6 lying entirely within the te valley, is extremely sandy in spots while in other stretches very heavy gumbo is encountered, each of which makes a very poor road but in a combined state makes an excellent surface as well as a good foundation for gravel surfacing. A greater part of this road lies only a few feet above the normal level of the Platte River so capillary attraction has previously caused endless troubles at differ - ent points on the highway. By building intercepting ditches parallel to the river the county has been able to overcome this to a great extent. The section of No. 6 from the Hall county line east has been worked to a grade and two federal aid projects have been constructed between Chapman and Clarks. Highway No. 14 traverses a series of low lagoons for several miles north of Central City and then enters into a sand plain which extends to the Cedar valley. During the dry season these low lagoons afford an excellent road surfacing material which has been utilized on many stretches of the road. Underlying the entire valley and ex - tending westward extensive deposits of gravel have been commercially developed. The contractors have taken advantage of this deposit by producing their own materials from road side pits at a reasonable cost. The county also expects to take advantage of this deposit so they are contemplating buying a pump and using their tractors for power to pump each year the amount of gravel necessary for their use. On Highway No. 14 the entire section was brought to a grade with federal-state aid and county maintenance funds and thus revert - ing a trail into a well maintained highway. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 71 Five patrol crews work the roads at all times. In addition to the lighter maintenance equipment, these crews are supplied with a heavy tractor for construction work so the highways for the past two years have been in excellent shape. Nance County Three state highways pass through Nance county. No. 13 extend - ing from the Piatte county line on the east to Greeley county on the west; No. 14 extending from the Merrick county line to the Boone cunty line; and No. 13- A extending from the city of Fullerton to the city of Belgrade. That part of state Highway No. 14 from the Merrick county line to Fullerton and from Genoa to the Boone county line and all of Highway No. 13-A have been constructed with federal and state funds.

Large canyons have formed back in the hills contiguous to .-ay No. 13-A and the patrols are continually menaced with the d sand and silt. The highway ditches become filled frequently II as the drainage structures and it has been extremely expensive ep all the drainage structures functioning. Special provisions been made to take care of this condition in placing a spillway i point of maximum flow and steepening the grade of the outlet s of the darinage structures, but this has not been entirely sat- The streams in this section are a serious menace to the highways, due to steepness of the drainage area and the great amount of debris that is carried. A water power dam with dykes has seriously men - aced the roads adjoining Fuilerton and at times has diverted the water across the road in a number of places. The highways have been well maintained during the last biennium but the item of reconstruction has been the most expensive part of the maintenance program. Adjoining the Loup River in an old stream bed, an extensive bed of good road gravel has been found which at a later date will be used to surface the highways. Snow removal was carried on successfully with the patrol forces during the winter with ordinary equipment. Owing to the fact that only branch lines of the railroads pass through this county, no attempt has been made as yet to eliminate grade crossings but with a few minor changes in align - ment practically all will be illiminated at a later date. Platte County Piatte county has three state highways to maintain. Each are of more than local importance, centering the traffic in the city of Col - umbus and distributing it in all directions. Highway No. 5 traverses the county north and south; No. 6 east and west and No. 13 affords an outlet to the north and west. The soil of the valley is typical of the Platte and Loup Rivers which is very sandy while in the hills loess and heavy plastic clay predominate. The entire system of highways within the county has been constructed except a small stretch beginning at Duncan and ex - rng to the Merrick county line. This section being devoid of clay been ay expensive and undesirable piece of highway for some time. The county contemplate removing this highway to the south .&lt;-i&lt;le of the Union Pacific railroad thus eliminating two railroad cross - ings.

The Loup River bridge adjoining Col - umbus on the south has been refloored from county funds with tar macadam resting upon creosoted wood base. This construction ia new and is the first time in the state that this particular type haa been used on a state highway. Each highway has been successfully maintained during the past biennium with truck and tractor patrols. Snow removal has been more or less successfully carried out and with the extensive purchase of snow fence of the slat type. It is believed that no trouble will be experienced during the coming winter. Urged by the commercial clubs and the traveling public, the county board have taken action toward the immediate removal of all grade crossings west of Colum - bus. These crossings, each one with dear vision have caused numer - ous accidents, many of which have been fatal. Polk County The highways under state control in Polk county are Highway No. 4, the Meridian Highway, and Highway No. 16. The Meridian Highway extends from north to south across the county while No. 16 extends from east to west, both serving the local farm to market traffic as well as an extensive tourist traffic. No. 16 will increase in tonage as soon as the Yutan bridge is built and will have a tendancy to divert part of the traffic which now congests Highway No. 6 from Central City east besides opening up the contiguous territory for direct line traffic to Wahoo and Omaha. The soil conditions on each of the highways are excellent and the roads are very easy to maintain but, due to a series of low lagoons, they are subject at times to overflow. These lagoons are for the most part without an outlet so the highway must be thrown up higher than is usual in other localities. Three federal and state aid projects have been constructed in this county, each of which have been carefully maintained. The county through its maintenance fund has reconstructed considerable of the highway along the Platte River bottoms, has installed a spillway ad - joining Clear Creek and widened the Clear Creek bridge to take care of the floods that occur in the early spring. The county has widened all the narrow culverts to a standard of twenty-four feet in width and have constructed to a temporary grade all the state highways not otherwise constructed. No gravel deposits have been found in the southern part of the county but in the north on the river bottoms extensive deposits have been explored and the county is figuring on installing a pumping plant in the south channel of the Platte River to pump gravel for all the highways within economic haul. Saunders County The highways included in the maintenance program for Saunder.s </seg>

Highway No. 9 which extends from north to south across the county and Highway No. 16 extending from the Yutan Bridge site to the west county line. All three highways are of national importance. With the completion of the Yutan bridge over the Platte River to the south and east of Yutan, this highway will relieve the congested conditions of the Lincoln and D. L. D. Highways and give the central part of Saunders County an outlet to the Omaha markets for their farm and dairy products and also shorten the dis - tance slightly between the county seat and the eastern points of the state. Highways No. 7 and No. 9 have been constructed with Federill t State Aid funds. The entire section of No. 7 has been surfaced all except about six mites on No. 9 has been graveled. Six i of No. 16 has been graded within the county with Federal and i Aid funds but the major part of this highway has been bladed with county maintenance funds. The maintenance in this county has been carried on with truck and tractor patrols and these in turn take care of the snow removal in the winter. Their work has been entirely satisfactory, so that at no time during the biennium have the roads been closed. Extensive deposits of good road gravel have been found at Wahoo and Ceresco and this has been used on the State Highway No. 9. The county has through its local funds, contributed to Federal Aid on a bridge across Wahoo Creek, south of Wahoo, also graveling projects in the southeastern part of the county and the purchase of local gravel pits to further the maintenance of the gravel roads. The county too has obligated itself for one-sixth of the cost of the Yutan State Aid bridge, the balance of the expenditure being borne by the State Aid Bridge fund, Federal Aid funds and Douglas County. Stanton County The highways maintained in Stanton County consist of Highway tK which extends from east to west across the county and No. 15 extends from the Colfax County line to Pilger. The soils of ! two highways are varied and consist of sand, gumbo and loess, each of which demand different treatment in maintenance and con - struction. On Highway No. 8 west of Stanton, the highway skirts the clay hills which are underlaid with sand and gravel and the wash from this deposit has caused much trouble with silting up the ditches and the drainage structures. All of Highway No. 8 has been con - structed with Federal and State Aid funds and Highway No. 15 has been constructed to a temporary grade with maintenance funds. The county has constructed all the bridges on the state highways of sufficient width that two vehicles can pass with safety. Owing to </seg>

Some of these have been worked commercially but up to the present time the county has no gravel roads, although they contemplate the use of this material in the near future. In the eastern part of the county, west of Wisner on the "Oscar Thompson Farm" a deep and valuable deposit of course gravel has been found recently and offered to the county or contractors at a very reasonable price per load at the pit. The maintenance has been carried on with tractor and truck patrols. Their work has been exceptionally good so the road has at all times been in a satisfactory condition. Snow removal has been carried out with the patrol forces with the ordinary equipment and has been a means of keeping: the highways passable during the winter months. Washington County The highways included in the state maintenance program for the past biennium include No. 5 extending from north to south across the county; No. 30 extending east and west and No. 31 extending from the Douglas County line in a northerly direction and connecting with No. 30. This system of highways which affords an outlet to the markets not only within the county but also to the Omaha markets is very heavily traveled by trucks as well as pleasure cars. Highway No. 5 has been constructed across the county with Federal and State Aid funds. A part of No. 5 has been graveled. Highways No. 30 and No. 31 have been bladed and shaped with county funds into an exceptionally good road. The soil on Highway No. 5 is for the most part loess combined with silt and washes badly while Highways No. 30 and No. 31 are of loess entirely and requires no special effort or method to maintain. Typical of the Missouri River bluffs large erosions occur which are at times very difficult to check. During the past biennium the largest items of reconstruction have been at these places, especially south of Blair, Nebraska. At the present time, the county is framing a creosoted wood trestle at a point one mile north of Nashville, this being the first sructure of the type in the division. The county through its maintenance fund has contributed to the gravel surfacing on Highway No. 5 from Fort Calhoun northerly towards Blair and contemplates further improvement in surfacing this coming year.

            <seg id="p077">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WuKK-S 77 Antelope County. Antelope County has been at all times very progressive in the development of its roads both State and County. They have followed a very consistent plan of completing one route before starting another as they have felt that the road was only as good as its poorest part and they have endeavored to make one route complete rather than start several routes which would have left weak links in all. The Blue Pole Highway which is coincident with Highway No. 8 in this County is now completed across the entire County, the last six mile* from Clearwater to the County line being finished this year. In a similar way the County each year has a construction crew at work on its feeder roads and this outfit completes each feeder before another is started. As a result this County is gradually and surely building a fine net work of roads, and while completing their through routes, they are opening up their market roads so that each thickly settled farming community has its outlet. Fortunately local gravel deposits are available within easy hauling distance of the State Highway and it has been the policy to gravel consistently as a part of the maintenance program. This has been carried on very economically due to the nearness of material and already twelve miles have been surfaced. It is expected that another year will find all Federal Aid construction surfaced with gravel. Maintenance has been carried on systematically under the direction of an experienced maintenance supervisor and the results have been excellent as well as comparatively economical. Trucks and tractors with multiple blade maintainers and heavy drags form the principal maintenance equipment, though two team patrols were used where the soil was light. All roads are well marked in a very neat manner with the Standard Nebraska Highway marking and particular attention has been given to marking bad railroad crossings, dangerous curves and narrow bridges. Excellent cooperation from the County Board of Supervisors and all County officials in carrying out a definite program is the real basis of the successful biennium just passed. Boyd County. Boyd County, so situated that it is bounded on one side by the Niobrara River, barring travel to the south, and so situated that its long east and west highway is crossed and recrossed by the Ponca Creek, which carries a torrent of flood waters at certain seasons, has found it necessary to spend most of its money and efforts to date on the construction of bridges. A State Aid bridge has been built at Red Bird crossing the Niobrara and this year a </seg>

This bridge is a :rete arch structure and is the gateway from Boyd County and its in South Dakota and the Black Hills to the South. Beside e two large structures several bridges of about one hundred span have been built across the Ponca Creek, one span being pleted this year. This County has constructed only one short road project due to its expenditures for bridges which reduced its funds. This project, being number 110- A, which was in controversy for over a year and practically impassable during that time, is now complete and graveled with a four inch thickness. It is in excellent condition and a source of joy to both local and through travellers who used to rthis hazardous Ponca Valley before the construction of this pro - was completed. the important bridges out of the way, this County now 3 to concentrate its attention on the construction of Highways 8 and No. 12.

Excellent and abundant deposits of gravel in the provides an economical material for permanent construction. I At present there are only eleven miles of unimproved roads, all rest having been constructed to temporary grade with a blade er making a very fair road for travel. Two truck maintenance ols fully equipped with also a tractor and grader outfit for shouldering and reconstruction has taken care of the maintenance in a very good manner. Through close cooperation of the County Board during the past season very good results have been obtained and it is expected that this County so rich in natural road material will soon take a foremost place for good highways. Brown County. With only a small fund to work with and nearly sixty-eight miles of highways, this County has made excellent progress with one-half of the roads in an improved condition. The soil varies from sand and sandy loam to gravel. To date eight and one-half miles of Federal Aid road have been constructed and promptly graveled by the County. EWith a heavy gang maintenance outfit putting up temporary de where soil permits and when funds are available, this County gradually working out an improved system of highways, both te Highways and feeder roads, that is of great benefit to the inty at large. </seg>

Another project which will be an extension to this in the direction of Ainsworth is now being advertised for letting:. The hearty cooperation and progressive spirit of the County Board and County officials in this County has been commendable. Cedar County Cedar County is favored for the most part with good soil con - ditions and under proper maintenance the Highways has been kept in very good condition particularly during the past season. Patrols have been kept regularly only on Highway Number 15, which is about fifty-two miles long through this County. Highway Number One has been partly constructed by the County and has received intermittent maintenance. Highway Number Four is still unimproved in this County. A new bridge across the Missouri River at Yankton adds greater importance to both Highways Number 15 and Number 4, since both these roads lead to Yankton, South Dakota. Formerly a ferry crossing was the only means of getting into South Dakota at this point but with the opening of the bridge in October, 1924, a much heavier traffic is expected over both Highways. This County has many gravel deposits which have made gravel surfacing of the Highways quite an economical improvement. The road from Laurel to Fordyce is now gravelled with a three inch thickness making an excellent road between these points. The gravel used contained just enough natural binder to cause good compaction of the aggregate. The construction outfit which put on the gravel worked twenty-four hours a day. No stops were made for meals as the drivers of the trucks took their meals in shifts of three to flTB at a time thus keeping the loading equipment busy at all times and causing no loss of time. A belt conveyor carried the material to rotary screens and hence to a loading bin. Twenty trucks ranging in capacity from one yard to four yards did the hauling. Only two pits were opened to gravel the entire distance from Laurel to Fordyce. The extreme haul at any time was about twelve miles. Three shifts of inspectors were necessary due to the night hauling. Inspection was especially difficult due to the fact that the gravel deposits varied from specification material to very fine material necessitating frequent tests. Screening was found to be impossible doe to the clay content which clogged the screens preventing the removal of the fine material. In lieu of screening, extra material was added to replace the fine sand. In some cases it was necessary to add as much as 45 f/ r . All Federal Aid construction in the County is now graveled except for about seven miles. </seg>

LThe state of improvement in Cedar county is well above the ave- Highway No. 1 will probably be constructed next year. Cherry County I Cherry county, commonly thought to be the real home of sand i, is rapidly coming into it's own and a study of this county shows t its road building- possibilities are not quite so desolate as they ear. This county boasts of one hundred and thirty-four miles of « federal aid roads, one hundred and twenty-five miles being; on ■hway No. 1, east and west across the county. Many consider the ding of roads across this sandy stretch to be an endless task, a first class start has already been made and at the present e another twenty-two miles of clay surfaced road is being added take away the terrors of a trip across this long county. The entine to Sparks project, now complete, is in excellent condition upon the completion of the present project this winter, approxi - ;ely one-half of the distance across the county will be finished. t Construction consists of grading up the sand and covering it clay, magnesia, loam, or top soil, depending on the material able. The difficulty is to find the surfacing material but ex - ■nce has shown that perseverance in this case generally wins, etimes the material is found in the most unlikely places and re - ; are only obtained by boring everywhere until success attends, etimes a scarcity of good heavy material causes the use of what is :d to be rather light and risky substitute but curiously enough light material often gives first class service and surprising re - :. Of course the traffic is not particularly heavy. About twenty-three miles of road have been constructed on temporary grade where soil conditions permitted and many short grades have been built up through maintenance, taking care generally of the low marshy places. The patrols, all but one of which are team patrols, spend their time claying, grading up low places, haying the hills, and dragging where possible until at the present time a very fair trail road with occasional good stretches is available across the county and can be traveled without difficulty. A truck patrol maintains the project from Valentine to Sparks. I The county board has been very progressive and the maintenance very ably handled in a systematic manner making possible the at improvement that has been made against great odds. </seg>

Dakota County This county, with thirty-six miles of state federal aid roads, has its grading construction about one-half completed. Two federal aid projects have been constructed here and a gravel surfacing placed on about three and one-half miles. Two miles of this, between Dakota City and South Sioux City has a four inch course while the other which was placed under maintenance has about two inches. t Construction has been completed now on Highway No. 5 across entire county; this is known as the Washington Highway. Future truction will be done on Highway No. 1, known as the Antelope I and Grant Highway.

Because of this, maintenance has been very difficult, for it has been found that the earth and gravel roads can - not withstand the loads they are daily subjected to when in a district receiving the heavy rainfalls common in northwestern Iowa and this part of Nebraska. The maintenance forces have consisted of two well equipped tractor patrols, with extra help moat of the time, and though these patrols have worked diligently, only fair success has resulted against such great odds. It is considered that more expensive construction will be necessary particularly adjacent to SiOUX City. Dixon County Dixon county with excellent road soil, nice to construct and easy to maintain, justly boasts of its good roads. With Project 31, from Poncft to Allen, and Project 57, from Allen to Wakefield, both complete, Highway No. 9 is complete across the county. A contract has been awarded for graveling about ten miles of Project 31 starting at Ponca and running south. This particular piece of road consisting in part of black gumbo and running through some low bottoms was the poorest part of a very good road and the graveling of this stretch will be very beneficial. With Highway No. 9 finished, future construction will be carried out on Highway No. 1, east and west through the county. Maintenance in this county has consisted of two truck patrols fully equipped, and with two men to each patrol. Both patrols worked on Highway No. 9, while the county with county patrols took care of No. 1. Excellent cooperation and understanding on the part of the county board and Other county officials has made for progress and has been a definite factor in carrying out a successful program. Holt County Because there is a definite and well defined difference in soil conditions the farther west one goes in the Elkhorn valley, it might well be said that Holt county is "where the west begins," for it is in this county that the real change in soil conditions is consumated and we find all through this county difficult sand hills to cope with.

Because of this it is intended to use many creosoted timber bridges in order to bring the expense within reach of the finances available. In addition to the federal aid projects, a state aid bridge wtih fill approaches has been built at Pischelville. On account of the great mileage, opinion of county officials has been divided as to location first to be improved but a very consistent and equitable system has been followed. Five tractor patrols and one team patrol take care of the main - tenance in this county with good results. Madison County Madison county has a large mileage on the state and federal aid system and this county is rapidly bringing their roads into good con - dition. Already approximately one half of the system is built to permanent grade, while more than a quarter of the system has been graveled. All of the system not built to permanent grade has been constructed to a proper cross-section with temporary grade through the medium of heavy maintenance crews and light construction crews. This county firmly believes in a permanent type of construction consistent with existing conditions and have adopted gravel surfac - ing because of the nearness of the material which makes this type of construction the most economical. It has been found that the soil is well adapted to take a gravel surface and the twenty-five miles already constructed have been a real success. Maintenance costs have been cut preceptibly wherever the gravel has been put on. Heretofore the graveling has followed the grading after a period of two or three years and it was found that considerable expense was necessitated to put the grades in condition to gravel. For this reason it is probable that as a matter of further economy this county will follow all earth work immediately with a gravel surface. t Madison county is seventh in number of automobile licenses sold the maintenance fund has been large enough to permit con - able heavy maintenance and surfacing: to be done by means of ty-federal aid. ■ It is further to be noted that Madison county has been consistent their construction in that they have followed a policy of continuous construction, completing one highway before another is started. In their gravel surfacing they have followed a similar policy with the Elt that a continuous system is being constructed with no un - tructed gaps. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">DEPARTMENT (&gt;!• PUBLIC Works 89 Pierce County Pierce county has fifty-four miles of state and federal aid high - way. Approximately twenty-eight miles is on the Meridian Highway, which is an International highway 3,100 miles in length, extending from the city of Winnipeg, Canada, to the City of Mexico. This i.= an important north and south highway across the United States. The other twenty-six miles is on Highway No. 1, a through highway across northern Nebraska which promises to become an important route. About one-third of the highways in this county have been con - structed to permanent grade, while all the remainder except for ten miles has been brought to proper cross-section on temporary grade, making travel easy and enjoyable. Regular maintenance patrols are employed to take care of the upkeep of all the improved roads and good results have been ac - complished. Construction north and south through Pierce county has been rather expensive due to the lay of the country, which has presented formidable drainage problems. On all projects a great number of drainage structures have been necessary, including numberless bridges, box culverts and pipes, together with many overflow pavements and Pierce County I*rojrc1 No. l.'K-B, earth road, smooth as i table ami joy to drive upon. </seg>

This county has kept their construction continuous with a view to completing one road before another is started. About eight miles remain to complete the Meridian Highway and this doubtless will be built nur.t season. ltuck County iRock county, laying in the very heart of the sand hills with ctically no material of which to build roads, has ninety-two miles state and federal aid roads. With nature and financial conditions erse, this county has a real problem to face. It is this county ich every traveler used to dread because it was noted in Nebraska hway history as having the "sandiest sand road" possible. This d from Newport to Bassett in the dry weather was practically &gt;assible and many a vehicle has, in the old days, turned back or ayed stuck" because of its sandy condition in spots alternating h bottomless lake beds in other spots. t Today a road is built between these two points — a high dragline de where needed and surfaced with clay hauled long distances. s road is now again the talk of the travelers who remember it old, because it is now a wonderful improvement in defiance of are. The driver who dreaded his trip in the old days now drives forty miles per hour over this road making the distance in per - is one-tenth the time formerly required. Because of its location in the valley with the water from the surrounding country draining to it from all directions, it has been a very difficult road to keep up. At times the ditches which are four to five feet deep run full of water for weeks causing no slight damage and making a terrific strain on the very meagre maintenance fund. However, perseverance has conquered in both the construction and the maintenance and a very good road encourages this country to carry on against odds. A state aid bridge has been constructed across the Niobrara river at Riverview and about one mile of grade has been constructed in the high bluff on the south end of the bridge, this also being done by state aid. This makes a connection and an outlet from Spring - view to the railroad at Bassett and is much used for marketing Because of the limited funds only the seventeen miles of con - structed road are maintained regularly although the sand trails are kept hayed so that traffic may get over them without great difficulty. These seventeen miles constructed can not long stand the present traffic unless funds are obtained to add a gravel surface. </seg>
            <seg id="p091">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 91 On the whole, with natural resources, finances, and location against it, this county has made a very perceptible progress. Thurston County With only about twenty-seven miles of state highways to con - struct thi3 county is comfortably fixed. To date all but seven miles of the system has been permanently graded. All the permanent grading was done on Highway No. 5 and this highway was com - pleted across the county this year. Another season will see all the state highway permanently graded and attention will then be turned to graveling. Three regular and fully equipped tractor patrols take care of the maintenance which is excellent most of the time. Favored with good soil for road construction, thi3 county is not so fortunately situated for drainage conditions as it is crossed and re - crossed by many streams and dry creeks which in time of flood or freshet do great damage, often inundating the roads in the bottom land and on one occassion flooded the town of Homer, causing ex - tensive ruin. Due to this condition many large bridges are needed. Because there is so much Government land on the Indian Reserva - tion in this county, the total taxable property is not great and the fund for bridge building is very small, making it difficult under the circumstances to keep the streams bridged. There are two Indian Reservations located in this county, the Winnebagos and the Omahas both being located here, and one inter - ested in Indian lore may find much to interest him. Wayne County Wayne county, though it has only thirty-six miles of state federal aid roads, four miles of which are on the county line but maintained by Wayne county, also maintains regularly other important roads in the county, making the total miles under constant maintenance about one hundred. This maintenance is paid for from the state mainten - ance fund. Wayne county has been exceptionally progressive in building up its county roads and feeder roads. Most of this work has been done with a heavy blade outfit although low bottoms subjected to flood conditions have been elevated or put up with teams and fresnoes in many places. It is particularly to be noted that this county provides excellent drainage for all its roads including even the temporary grades. Permanent drainage structures are put in as soon as any improvement is made, this being considered good economy as none of the structures have to be removed when permanent grades are laid. This county is also conspicuous for its many concrete bridges. Good </seg>

'With the grades to maximum six and one-half per cent and curves either elimin - or widened, this road has meant a great deal to the entire ty. The part of the road not in the canyon had to be surfaced day. As a farther improvement the county has surfaced this two inches of gravel. All future improvement will be expen - as the entire north part of the county is in the sand hills. Hall County Hall county was one of the first three counties in the state to surface with gravel. Each year since 1920 all available funds have been invested in gravel surfacing until there is now 52.75 miles of gravel on the state system. It is worthy of note that the Grand Island Chamber of Commerce has cooperated with the county and tHall county gravel pumped and screened and deposited ready for itenance crews to haul whenever spare time is found.

On account of the flatness of the country it has been a problem to properly drain the highways. Soil in the vicinity of Grand Island is light and it is difficult to find suitable binding material that will stand up under the heavy traffic. Four bridges across the Platte river south of Grand Island tiara been built from federal, state and county funds. These consist of two bridges with three eighty-foot steel truss spans each; one bridge eighty-foot steel truss; one of six eighty-foot steel trusses. The abutments are built of reinforced concrete resting on forty-foot wood piling; the piers of reinforced concrete resting on forty-five- foot wood piling. The total length of bridge, 1,040 feet. Howard County The road from St. Paul to St. Libory on the road to Grand Island undoubtedly was as bad as any in the state as it was little better than a sand hill trail. Since this stretch has been graded and surfaced with clay it now ranks with the best of federal state aid earth roads. The heavy traffic and wind has worn the clay surfacing to such an extent that gravel surfacing will have to be placed in the near future to save the clay binder. Another feature of improve - ment is the elimination of two railroad crossings at St. Libory.

            <seg id="p094">94 REPORT OF SECRETARY Probably in no other county has federal state aid been of more benefit. The entire length from east to west is through low country adjacent to the Flatte river with soil varying from sand to clay and gumbo. With the exception of nine miles there is now a graveled surfaced road across the county. The paving of two and one-half miles from North Platte to the State Experimental Farm created quite an engineering problem as the road was through low, wet ground. Through the swampy por - tions gravel was placed on the subgrade in order to overcome capil - lary action. Loup County Loup county has no railroad entering it so has to depend entirely upon its highways. South of the Loup river the soil is good, but 1'rom Taylor north through to the county line the soil is practically all sand. Clay deposits, however, have been noted along this road which will cut down future road improvement costs considerably. Fourteen miles of this road has been graded and hayed. On account of lack of funds maintenance in this county is a problem. Logan County This is one of the sandhill counties and suitable road improve - ment consists mainly of clay surfacing while many miles must be covered with hay or straw to make traffic possible. Another biennium should see the completion of the east and west state highway. McPherson County This county can boast of only one short state highway but most of this highway has been built by state federal aid funds. This being another county in the sandhills all projects with little excep - tions have had to be built with clay surface. Sherman County. Soil and topography are of two kinds. Along the Loup river valley Project 37 is built on light soil through comparatively flat country. Other project?, 92-A and 92-B and 212, are through a very hilly part, necessitating heavy grading and large drainage structures. Except along the Loup river the soil is fine road material. Features on Project 212 are the three channel changes and propesed overhead bridge crossing the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. tracks. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 95 Thomas County Practically every mile of state highway will have to be surfaced. Good clay is difficult to obtain. County has hayed a good portion of the highway but is handicapped by lack of funds for maintenance. As stated under Blaine County this county needs a revision of the present highway laws. Valley County A problem in this county on the road which runs from North Loup to Ord is drainage. Federal Aid Project 85 is built along the foothills. Flood water which comes down the canyons carries silt which is deposited on the flats in ridges causing the water courses to change before reaching the road. Old, well denned water courses have been filled up rendering some of our drainage structures prac - tically useless. Overflow pavements have since been installed and appear to have solved the trouble. Project 193, from Ord to Arcadia is built through the worst hills in the county. Fourteen per cent grades have been cut to seven per cent and bad curves eliminated and flattened. This road will be of great benefit to ttie county as heretofore there was practically no road connecting the southwest part of the county with the county seat.

            <seg id="p100">100 III-: TOUT OF SECRETARY Cheyenne county contains two state highways, the Lincoln High - way and a north and south highway connecting with the Colorado system south of Sidney and leading north through Bridgeport, Al - liance and Chadron to the Black Hills. The Lincoln Highway, as in many other counties carries a very large tourist traffic while the 'north and south road provides a means of marketing the large wheat crops typical of the table lands lying north and south of Sidney. The north and south highway has been constructed from the Colorado line north to Gurley, about twelve miles north of Sidney. Seven miles of this road are under contract for graveling, and many miles of the remaining portion are through natural gravel soil making the addition of surfacing unnecessary. Gravel lies in abundance throughout the county making hard surfaced roads inexpensive. tBut seven miles of the Lincoln Highway in this county have improved under state and federal aid, but the remaining portions come in for their share of improvements in the future. Cheyenne county prides herself on her roads and at most times they are surpassed by none in the state. Dawes County Dawes county is traversed by the Blue Pole Highway and a north and south highway leading through Chadron to the Black Hills. The only highway to receive any state and federal aid is the one south of Chadron. This road leads south over Pine Ridge, a range of pine covered hills in which is located a Nebraska State Park. Those who have seen this county, state that it has some of the finest scenery in Nebraska. Dawes county is very unfortunate in having very serious drainage problems with which to contend. The topography on the whole is very rough, this feature making road construction dif - ficult and expensive. It contains some of the best as well as some of the poorest road building material. Gravel for hard surfacing is almost unknown. Denel County tDeuel county is traversed its entire length east and west by the oln Highway. The Colorado or Denver branch of this highway &gt;s the main highway at Big Springs striking Colorado at Jules - .

            <seg id="p102">102 KEPORT OF SECRETARY Hooker County Hooker is one of the sand hill group of counties, but from the road standpoint in a way is more fortunate than some of the others on acocunt of having a class of material which make a very good surfacing for the sand. This clay lies in large quantities along the middle Loup river. As well as having the distinction of having some of the best road material found within the sand hill section, this county contains some of the most objectionable sand along the Potash Highway. Grant County This is another of the sand hill group, not however as bad as some of the others. No extensive program has been carried on here, but sufficient work has been done on the Potash Highway by the county and state to make a very passable road through the county. It does not take as much or as good a road in such a country to satisfy the local people, their first desire being to have a road which can be traveled at all times in safety. Their highway has been im - proved to the point where it is termed by some "a high gear road." In a class with many other western sandy counties, Grant county would greatly benefit by legislation permitting the expenditure of strictly state aid road funds independent of federal aid thus allowing a lower type of construction to meet the needs of the locality and traffic. Garden County The Platte Valley Highway running east and west through Garden County is the only one of which they boast. It parallels the Platte River and affords very fine scenery as well as providing a means of marketing their principal crop, the sugar beet. A large percentage of the highway mileage in this county lies in sandy land, and construction has not reached the point where a very large por - tion of their highway has been improved. Eight miles have been built west of Oshkosh and seven miles are npw being graveled east of Oshkosh. The remaining mileage is in some places but little better than a trail road, all of which will require clay and gravel surface. In addition to the Federal and State work on the Highway system, the County has voted bonds for three permanent type bridges across the Platte, one of which is now under construction.

            <seg id="p103">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 103 from the Platte Valley, with the exception of the Lincoln Highway. A great percentage of the remaining mileage of the State System lies in sandy soil. A great portion of the Platte Valley Highway which leaves the Lincoln Highway, has been constructed by the State and Federal Government, and some work has been done on the Lincoln Highway. On account of the very adverse road conditions, but a small percent of the, total highway mileage has been improved. The Lincoln Highway is next in line for improvement, and it should be but a short time until a greater portion of this highway will be improved. Gravel deposits lie along the Lincoln Highway in abundance and it will be an easy matter to surface its entire length with this material. Kimball County Kimball County is traversed by the Lincoln Highway as well as a highway which branches off at Kimball leading to Scottsbluff. About 22 miles of the total highway mileage has been improved, some of this having been graveled from pits within short distance of the road. Gravel deposits lie in abundance along both the Lincoln Highway and the Kim - ball North road and it will be but a short time when their entire mile - age will be graveled. The natural materials from which the roads are graded contain in many places sufficient gravel to make excellent roads. The greater part of the heavy grading work in the county has been completed, there remaining only the highway which traverses practically level land and on which the construction costs will be comparatively small. It can be safely stated that graveling this county can be done for one-third the cost in eastern counties. Morrill County Morrill County is not so fortunate in her road program as are many other counties of the State. In spite of the fact that she claims 23 miles of the best highway in the State, .she has mile after mile of road on the State system which at times are fairly impassible. The most serious problem confronting Morrill County is the construction of a road north from the Platte River to Alliance. The construction of such a road will necessitate the expenditure of considerable sums of money in making a highway through these sand hills lying between the river and Alliance. Sufficient funds have not as yet been available to make a start on this piece of construction. Eight miles east and west from Bridgeport have been graded and graveled, and this is being extended westward toward Bayard for a distance of seven miles during the present season. At this time also a 700 foot span steel truss bridge is being built on the Platte Valley High- </seg>

ScottsblulT County The east and west highway through Scottsbluff conuty follows the North Platte Valley, being not more than 3 miles distant from the river at any point. It traverses some of the most fertile farming districts of the North Platte Valley, and offers a very good view of the Sugar Beet industry for which the Valley is famous. The north and south road in the county starts at Scottsbluff, cross - ing the North Platte River between Scottsbluff and Gering, leading thence to the Lincoln Highway meeting it at Kimball. A 600 foot span concrete bridge has been built over the river by the State and Federal Government. At the south county line lies what is known as Stage HilL The road at this point crosses a very rugged range of pine bearing hills over which a very fine highway has been constructed. This provides a very scenic drive for local and tourist traffic. Scotts Bluff County is fortunate in having an abundance of gravel, both in the Platte River and gravel bearing hills. This feature helps materially in the cost of permanent improvement, and enables the County to have some of the best highways in the western part of the State. </seg>

            <seg id="p108">108 Adams County This is the first County in Southwest Nebraska to complete all of the grading and structures on the State road system. The last gap, from Hastings north to Hall County was completed in October ,1924. In addition, the State road East and West across the County, as well as the road North of Hastings, have received a two inch application of screened gravel, which was shipped by rail from Cowles, Kearney, Grand Island, and Central City, unloaded by machinery, and hauled by trucks. This gravel has given excellent satisfaction to the Adams County tax payers, and has served as a model for other Western Counties. The County rnow has two main desires; (1) to gravel the road South of Hast - and (2) to extend the State road system to reach other parts of the County. Maintenance with tractors and trucks has been satisfactorily and economically handled except following snow-falls. To overcome this situation, anil to keep the roads open during the winter as well as other seasons, a big double rotary snow plow has been purchased. The highways right of way have been kept mowed, and have been kept clear of advertising signs. Structures have been painted white, and as a result, the highways have always been in good shape, and have looked clean and neat. Cooperation with the County Board of Super - visors and other officials has been entirely satisfactory. Dundy County In the previous biennium, construction was started with State Fed - eral funds from Haigler West to the State line of Colorado. Due to the fact that the road was not included in the new "seven per cent" system, and due to the cancellation of the contract by the contractor on struc - tures, this project has remained in an uncompleted condition for over a year. There has been a steady and strong demand for gravel surfacing by Dundy County people and the County officials in line with the strong campaign for gravel roads by the State Department, and it is expected that this demand can be satisfied next year. This County has had insufficient maintenance funds to have regular Srolmen in sufficient numbers to properly maintain the State system, previous years debts were incurred and some of these old debts are I unpaid. Very limited maintenance funds have caused insufficient 4. In 1923 were numerous protracted floods that caused much dam - age. Again in 1924 were damaging floods. These damages to bridges and grades were repaired as well as funds permitted, but not as well as County and State road officials desired. Results in counties like Dundy are hampered by lack of funds. There are no more enthusiastic and efficient county road officials in the State than in Dundy County. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">DEPARTMENT OF PrRLIl" WOKKS 109 Chase County . Chase County has received four projects this last year from State- County-Federal funds. 1. The long expected and much needed improvement of the sand trail from Imperial to Champion. The transformation in this road by grading, confining the blow-sand with magnesia, and surfacing the mag - nesia with gravel, has led to the following expressions: "The best road in the State." "Now that this road is completed, there is no need of a railroad to Champion." "The State should buy and open magnesia pits, and ship magiMsfe wherever there are sand roads." The magnesia on the road resembles concrete in color, and under good maintenance is very hard and smooth. Chase County Project No. 206 showing magnesia surfacing on a light sandy soil. 2. Two and one-half miles of gravel North West of Imperial, which has completed the gravel surfacing on Project 95-A. 3. The narrow light capacity bridge at Wauneta was replaced by a twenty ton, twenty foot roadway, Nebraska Standard bridge, with a four foot sidewalk, and four lamp posts. 4. The old bridge at Champion, on which two wings had collapsed, was replaced by a sixty-three foot creosoted, twenty ton, twenty foot roadway, Nebraska Standard bridge. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 REPORT OF SECRETARY Maintenance has been uniformally good and very satisfactorily and economically handled by an efficient highway commissioner. The entire State highway system was completely regraded in 1924. Co-operation with all County officials has been excellent. Frontier County I One of the heaviest grading jobs in the State was completed in 1923 een Curtis and Maywoou. This assured a good all-weather road een these two towns, eliminated a dangerous C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. sing, and saved two miles of distance. It is of interest that the first M&gt;ted timber bridge in Southwest Nebraska, and one of the first in State involving State-Federal funds was the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad head crossing on this project. The C. B. &amp; Q. railroad paid a quar - &gt;f the cost of this bridge. After advertising for bidders, bids were rted as too high, and the C. B. &amp; Q. were awarded the bridge work stimated costs, thus saving nearly two thousand dollars. Taxpayers were well pleased with this work, and have insistently demanded that grading be continued from Stockville East to complete the East and West Highway across the County. This road has been surveyed and will be under contract in 1925. This road East of Stock - ville to Gosper County line, 22 miles in length has been blade graded, and considerable improvement has been made the past two years by placing many pipes, box culverts, straightening the alignment, and doing tnuch heavy team work. The topography over which this highway passes is almost a continuous series of deep canyons and very steep hills. I Maintenance has been good. Cooperation with the County officials I the public has been satisfactory. Maintenance work has been done h tractors, trucks and teams. A new patrol shed has been erected lots furnished by the City of Curtis, and is used for storage, repair p and service for the County equipment. Franklin County Following the completion in 1921 of the heavy work from Franklin West 12 miles with State-Federal funds, there was no State-Federal work this biennium. A survey has been made preparatory to more State-Federal work in 1925 East of Franklin. Maintenance work during 1923 was difficult, and results were only fair, due to numerous floods and delayed work. Maintenance work in 1924 has shown a very decided improvement, due to the active interest of the County Clerk and County Supervisors. Cooperation between the State and the County has been exceptionally good this last year. Hie patrolmen have taken a great personal interest in their work, and results have pleased the taxpayers. </seg>
            <seg id="p111">DEPARTMENT OF PLBLIC WORKS 111 The good roads and good roads boosters of Franklin County suc - ceeded in attracting two National Highways to enter Nebraska from Kansas. The old winding trail South of Franklin has been widened into a fair road, and will be further improved next year. The highway north of Franklin to Minrien has been constructed and maintained from mainte - nance funds so that except for a few hills and a short sand stretch, it is equal to a State-Federal project. From Franklin East maintenance has been good. A large frame building for a patrol station, with a well equipped work shop and yards has been built at Franklin, and is used for winter work. Trucks are used exclusively on maintenance work. Furnas County The Furnas County Board has been very aggressive in obtaining construction projects, and has cooperated well with the State. The Board has also been successful in bidding in grading and gravel work .on the following projects in 1924: 1. Project 67-A. 4.5 miles of gravel surfacing East of Cambridge. 2. Project 30-B. A channel change and fill south of Arapahoe, to provide a new outlet for the Muddy Creek into the Republican River. 3. Project 194-A. Two and one-half miles of clay surfacing South of Oxford. During the construction of this job, an unusual condition was found, when a pocket of quick sand about nine feet deep and 140 feet long was encountered, 11 feet under the surface of the top of a high clay hill South of the River. The sand was removed and placed in the bottom of the fill and the cavity filled with clay. The successful completion of these projects showed the results of a good organization, and splendid management by the highway com - missioner, who personally handled the supervision of all construction and maintenance work. Maintenance on the D. L. D. Highway across the County has been only fair. The heavy floods of 1923 caused many washouts in every mile and almost a year was required to overcome this damage. Satisfactory maintenance is prevented by lack of funds, and the location of the highway at the foot of continuous hills and across long canyons, and is not due to lack of effort. This condition is not generally understood by the traveling public. Heavy construction and many structures are needed across the County, so that maintenance can be made effective. The results of maintenance on other roads have been good. Trucks and tractors have been used for power. A small patrol shed and yards hare been established at Arapahoe. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 Gosper County 1923 saw the completion of the 28 miles of East and West State Highway across Gosper County, 20 miles by State-Federal funds, and 8 miles by maintenance funds. The transformation of narrow winding canyon roads and prairie trails to standard width highways has started a road system in Gosper County that has been the envy of neighboring Counties. The County officials now desire the completion of the road system from Elwood North to Lexington and South to Arapahoe. The heaviest floods for nine years did much damage to the fresh fills West of Elwood in 1923. The restoration of washouts and the in - stallation of ditch checks occupied the patrol crew until the Fall of 1924. The fills have now become seeded down, and maintenance has become a matter of surface and shoulder work, rather than replacing hundreds of feet of washed out shoulders. A patrol shed and yards have been established at Elwood. Patrol work is almost exclusively done by tractors. Harlan County Three good, permanent bridges have resulted from State-Federal construction work this biennium at the following locations.: 11. Republican City, on State Highway No. 3, gained an ornamental useful forty foot, twenty ton, reinforced concrete girder with twenty - foot clear roadway, and four concrete lamp posts. A neat little forty foot 'concrete girder bridge and approaches nearing completion on Harlan County Project No. 71-B. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 113 2. Orleans received a new forty foot span, twenty ton, twenty foot roadway, and two four-foot sidewalks together with four lamp posts, of the same type as Republican City bridge, to replace a steel wood bridge built ten feet off center line about twenty-five years ago. 3. Oxford acquired a new entrance into the City by the construction of a fifty-five foot steel skew bridge opposite a C. B. &amp; Q. railroad subway at the East edge of the City. This permits the traffic on State highways 3 and 7 to pass under the tracks and completed the elimination of a dangerous railroad crossing. Maintenance on State roads in Harlan County has been uniformly satisfactory due to a hard working experienced patrol organization under a very capable highway commissioner, and an interested efficient County Board. Maintenance results have been economically obtained with the use of tractors and trucks. A small patrol shed with work shop at Alms is used by all road crews. A well maintained Harlan County Highway near Alma — Earth road Project No. 71. During this last year, meetings were held at Republican City, Alma, and Orleans, to attempt to obtain gravel surfacing, of which there is none in the County. When more funds are available, and the urgent grading needs West and Northwest of Orleans are satisfied, gravel will be used extensively. Plans have been prepared for a grading project in 1925 from Orleans to Oxford. Travelers report that the heaviest grades from Denver to Omaha exist on the D. L. D., Highway No. 7, in Harlan County.

I Maintenance in 1923 was poor due to lack of funds and equipment. 1924 by dividing the cost with County funds, a big engine and 12 foot de grader outfit was purchased. This is the first workable equipment ich the County has owned. The entire State road system was graded 1 put into shape this year, and the State roads have baen in better idition this year than ever before. Due to their big mileage and all funds, regular patrol crews cannot be employed constantly so atic results are obtained. Some places the surface is good, and some ces very poor. The County officials are willing and anxious to co - •rate, but as they are actively engaged in farming and live many es from the State roads, the highways suffer from a lack of a prop - y supervised organization with a responsible head.

            <seg id="p115">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 115 Hitchcock County Hitchcock County has the largest mileage of State roads in South - west Nebraska, requiring regular patrol work, and has the smallest funds for maintenance. Through no lack of cooperation by County offi - cials, but through lack of funds, and lack of equipment, road conditions have been only poor to fair. Poor soil conditions have also greatly hampered maintenance work. Construction work for the biennium has included two short projects, 68-C, 4 miles East of Culbertson; and 68-D, 5 miles West of Culbertson. The results from these two projects have not been as satisfactory as they should be, due to lack of funds for maintenance and also due to the fact that these two jobs are at the outlet of a long irrigation system and have been frequently damaged by improperly controlled irrigation water. During the early part of 1923, a sand storm in the Southwest corner of the County deposited about twenty-four inches of blow sand on a mile and a half of State road, and has made this almost impassable. Later in 1923 came many floods and washed out many bridges and fills. As a result of the above conditions the County and State have received an endless amount of undue criticism. Some law should be devised to aid Western Counties like Hitchcock, and sustain a better condition on the State Highways, by a more even distribution of maintenance funds.

            <seg id="p116">116 RKPiiRT OF SECRETARY Kearney County The use of Platte River gravel for road surfacing has been the greatest activity in Kearney County during this biennium. In 1923 the grading and structures on the Minden-Newark road were completed, and four inches of screened gravel applied ever clay surfacing in the sand hills. The success of this gravel work encouraged the local demand for gravel on the Harding Highway, State Highway No. 7, so a contract from State-Federal fu?v!s was entered into for two inches of gravel sur - facing from Minden East 17 milas, to meet the gravel surfacing in Adams County. Half of this was completed in 1924, and the balance will be placed early in 1925. The County Board has requested construction from Axtell North to the Kearney bridge, and also from Minden West to Phelps County. I On a level County like Kearney, with well graded roads, and good I, and plenty of maintenance funds, there are few problems in mainte - lce work. Cooperation has been satisfactory and maintenance has n uniformly good throughout the biennium. Tractors have been used surface work, and a truck has been used on the gravel for hauling clay and gravel for patch work. Patrol sheds and yards have been ablished at Heartwell, Minden and Axtell.

There were no road sisms or turn markers to show the stranger which pair of ruts belonged to the State Highway. During the previous biennium, a complete trans - formation took place. One State-Federal project of 16 miles of sand - clay construction between Grant and Elsie was completed, and trans formed a winding sand trail to the "Boulevard of the Sandhills." The County purchased two large Holt tractors with grading outfits and bunk houses from the State Department, and they have built real roads quickly and economically. The entire State system has been graded. (They have also graded most of the main County roads. Excellent co - operation on the part of all County officials has been the keynote of this County's success. ** t During this biennium, good maintenance has been the rule. In order to preserve the clay surfacing between Grant and Elsie, which was be - ginning to show need of repair after three years service, a gravel project was let. The County was the low bidder. Gravel was very scarce in Perkins County and it was necessary to remove fourteen feet of very hard magnesia, much of which had to be blasted in order to uncover the gravel. About one-half of the pit product could be used. The County set up and operated a gravel loading and screening plant, and after many delays and breakdowns, succeeded in completing their contract within the contract figures. The gravel has given good results and much more gravel has been demanded for next year. Phelps County Following the completion of the Holdrege-Elm Creek highway in 1921, there developed a demand by the County officials, and taxpayers, to arrange for improving State Highway 7 across the County. Follow - ing several conferences between the County Board, Holdrege Community Club, and State Department representatives, plans were prepared and contracts let in September, 1924, for grading, structures, and two inches of gravel surfacing from Kearney County line through Funk ami Hold - rege to Atlanta. The grading and structures were completed in 1924 from Holdrege East, and it is expected to complete the entire project early in 1925. Following th start of work on State Highway 7, the Board asked for similar work on State Highway 23 to Loomis, and plans are being prepared for this work. Maintenance on the State road was only fair in 1923. In 1924 due to the fact that the County Board took an active interest in road work with good cooperation, and due to purchase of additional equipment, a decided improvement in road conditions has taken place. Maintenance work has been done with tractors and occassionally with teams. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF SECRKTAHY 118 Red Willow County En 1923, Red Willow received the worst floods since 1915. These i rendered the roads West of McCook impassable for days at a and increased the demands for a good highway from McCook West, summer of 1924 was spent in the construction by State-Federal ; of Project 68-B, from McCook West, which includes a half mile ving and 8 miles of gravel. It is extremely interesting an:l important to record that unlimited quantities of the best quality of washed gravel for concrete and road surfacing have jnst been discovered and used in the vicinity of McCook fron* the Republican River Valley. It was generally believed that there was no good gravel in the Republican Valley, and the discovery of this gravel came in a unique way. On a feeder road on the D. L. P., 1 1-2 miles west of McCook, the farmer users of this feeder road donated $1,100.00 to improve the road, and the business men of McCook donated a like amount. The work was done under a committee with the engin - eering donated by the State Department of Public Works. In grading this road, the ditches were deepened, and gravel was found near the surface, under about three feet of clay. Soundings were made by the County at this point and other points, which revealed from ten to sixty feet of good gravel lying in water. r gravel pumping and screening plant being installed in Red Willow County at Perry. I The County and State have purchased and are operating a six-inch ping outfit and are satisfying the very strong demand for gravel icing. Why this gravel was not used prior to 1924 is well expressed </seg>
            <seg id="p119">DEPARTMENT OK PUBLJC WORKS 119 by the remarks of the man on whose farm the pit was found: "Yes, I knew there was gravel there, but I never knew there was any other way to get it out except by slips, and never paid any attention to it." Another discovery this last year is of a hard native stone South of Indianola. Due to lack of funds, no attempt has been made to open a ■quarry for this material. It is the desire of the County and State De - partment to start crushing operations on a small scale and build a mile of paved road with this material next year. The nee&lt;l of road surfacing: material is more urgent each year, due to wearing out and blowing away of the light soils, and constantly increasing traffic. Webster County No construction from State-Federal funds was done in Webster County this biennium. Gravel surfacing was projected from Red Cloud North to Adams County line, but due to more urgent needs for grading and drainage structures from Red Cloud East, the County Board can - celled the gravel project after bids were opened. Plans are being com - pleted for a project East of Red Cloud to Guide Rock for next year. Although no State-Federal funds were used on construction there have been some marked improvements made on the State roads. The County Board has taken an active interest in the State roads, and has built four new standard steel concrete bridges on the State roads from their bridge funds. State maintenance funds have been used to good ad - vantage on the Golden Rod Highway, State Highway No. 3. This mainte - nance work West of Red Cloud has been of sufficiently high class so that this highway will be in shape to be surfaced with very little extra expense on the subgrwle. East of Guide Rock as a result of the united efforts of Guide Rock citizens, the State road has been greatly improved. Very heavy grading, and several new bridges^will be necessary to reduce the steep grades on this road. The Board has readily cooperated with the State. Each Board member has outlined the general plans for State road work in his district, and in cooperation with the highway commissioner, regular and steady work has been the rule and maintenance has been satisfactory. When the "Red Cloud North" gravel project was postponed, the County officials decided to use local prison labor on this road.

This includes Portland cement, sand, sand - el, gravel, crushed rock, concrete, steel reinforcing bars, concrete corrugated pipe, oils, asphalts, tars, and paving materials. In addition to analyzing and testing recommendations are made as to the advisability of using such materials. Reports and recommenda - tions are made to the Chief of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges for his consideration and action. Analysis of all tests are mailed at once to the Federal District Engineers' office. No materials are used that do not meet the requirements of the Standard Specifications of the State and Federal Government. This testing is done under an agreement between the Department at Public Works and the State University by the terms of which the University furnishes the equipment and personnel for making tests. Payments are made for these tests by the Department direct to the University, such payments being based upon an agreed price for each test. I The principle object in view in the testing and analyzing of materials il. or proposed to be used in the construction of State and Federal Aid ds and bridges is for the purpose of determining their suitability for i use. The materials are tested to determine whether or not they ?t with the requirements of the specifications. Due to lack of funds research is carried on except such as can be gained from a study of records of tests and work under construction. The methods used for conducting all of the tests and analysis of materials are as provided by the American Society for Testing Materials. On account of the lack of a sufficient quantity of good commercial rock to be used as concrete aggregate, it has been necessary to design a concrete marie of sand-gravel aggregate. Nebra»l a has a larpr" number of deposits of this material, which when of the right analysis, makes an excellent aggregate for concrete. A large number of tests have been made on the sand-gravel aggregate. This determines those particular chajracteristics which it must have in or.ler to t.ake the best con.-rete. These tests are being continued with a view toward usinir a leaner mix with a better grading of aggregate. In parallel with kha sanri-'gravel tests, trvo concrete cylinders siv inches in diameter and twelve inches ling are mou'iiei! in cyl-o-con paper moulds for each day's run of concrete lave-vent, concrete pavement base, concrete curb and gutter mixtures, and concrete bridges, Records are kept of the compressive strength of tlie^e concrete cylinders at the ages </seg>

Taprether with these test* are re - corded the complete physical test for the Portland cei lent and sand gravel aggregate used in the mixt'jr; on tiie job from which the con - crete cylinders are taken. All of the laboratory testing an.i a n'v^in-* is mail? In the enirin - eering laboratories at the University of Aeliraska, except when certain paving projects have a large number of materials to be tested. In such cases a temparary laboratory is set up for that purpose near the work. Very often tests are made at the manufacturers plant on gravel and cement materials being shipped to numerous projects. This method U highly desirable and very economical when the shipments are large. On many projects the inspector makes his own tests on gravel supplying the Federal Bureau with copies of the analysis direct. This is also an economical method with great saving in time. Owing to the difficulties and delays in testing paint and creosote for generally small jobs and the difficulty in determining definitely that the proper materials are being used even if a supposedly representative sample has been tested, this Department is seriously considering the plan of furnishing the contractors direct with paint and creosote for all state work. Under this plan the Department would purchase the estimated years supply in advance, have delivery made in advance, have test* made on these deliveries and furnish these supplies to all contractors practically at cost.

DIVISION OF DESIGN, MAPS AND PLANS. t Under this Division the Chief of Bureau holds the Office Engineer lonsible for the preparation of all standard and special designs and is for state and federal aid construction as well as standard plan? county bridge construction, standard county bridge specification- and « Federal Aid highway and bridge specifications, supplies and pment for office and field engineers and all records of field surveys. Steps to a Federal Aid Highway. The first step in the establishment of a Federal and State Aid road is the passage of a resolution by the County Commissioners giving a description of the road and requesting Federal Aid for its construction. This resolution is presented to the State Department, and after an in - vestigation of the conditions, if found favorable, it is approved. Upon approval by the State Department, a project statement is compiled and submitted to the United States Bureau of Public Roads. This statement contains a map showing the alignment of the proposed road, an estimate of the approximate cost, the source of funds available and all other data necessary to inform the Federal Bureau of the most important factors. Preliminary Survey is then made of the project by the State. The surveying party usually consists of three, project en- </seg>
            <seg id="p132">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 131 gineer, rmlman and chainman. This survey establishes the status of the road in respect to alignment, drainage, and all essential defects or needs are determined. The notes taken by the engineer in the field are then reduced in the office by the draftsman, and platted in plan, profile and cross sections. The plan of the road indicates the location of trees, fences, drive ways, houses, telephone poles, and entire alignment. It is in fact an exact chart of the road showing the position of every landmark and structure which is contingent. The profile of the road is plotted to show the elevation of the center line of the road throughout the entire length Cross sections of the road are plotted wherever they have been taken by the engineer in the field. These sections are taken every hundre&lt; feet anil at intervals between these hundred foot stations whenever the profile of the road changes abruptly enough to warrant it. Two drafts men will complete about three miles of plotting in one day. A tentative grade is then laid on the profile, by the draftsmen in the office who studies the profile and establishes a grade which approxi - mately balances the cuts and fills, making the road conform as nearly as possible to the desired standard. These plans are then sent to the Dis - trict Engineer, who in company with an Engineer from the Federal Office, makes a plan-in-hand inspection of the road. This inspection covering the whole project, includes recommendations for all surfacing, grades and drainage structures. The plan-in-hand inspection notes are then sent into the office and the former plan is revised. Using the plan-in-hand inspection notes as a working basis, a balanced grade is laid utilizing the dirt that has been obtained from hills and ditches in raising the low places and bringing the road to the desired grade and cross section. Earth work quantities are computed from the cross sec - tions and an estimate of the required yardage is made. Drainage struc - tures are designed according to the plan-in-hand inspection and esti - mates are made for the new project. These plans and estimates are then submitted to the Federal Gov - ernment and after their approval, the State is at liberty to advertise and award contracts for construction. After completion of construction a final survey is made of thq road as built. This survey is made over the same stations as preliminary, the notes being plotted over the pre - liminary cross sections and the actual yardage of excavation and em - bankment determined. The completed project is inspected by Federal engineers and after their approval the final plans and estimates are sub - mitted to the Federal Bureau for approval and payment. The following charts are self-explanatory showing cross sections, progress of construction anil expenditures together with financial status of counties. </seg>

            <seg id="p153">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 151 STATE AID BRIDGES The State Aid Bridge law has made it possible for counties to build permanent structures across the larger streams in this state. Without State Aid it would be an unjust burden to the.se counties. The cost on these larger structures should be borne to some extent by the State at large thus relieving the local community unfortunately situated. The law originally provided that the minimum width of stream over which a bridge under which State Aid could be allowed was 175 feet. The 1921 Legislature reduced this length to 100 feet so that more coun - ties could avail themselves of this aid. The following tabulations show all State Aid Bridges completed to date, and those contracted this Biennium, also expenditures for repairs this Biennium and applications remaining on file. Lack of county fund* to meet State Aid when State Aid was available is the reason why many applications have remained on file for several years.

            <seg id="p166">164 REPORT OF SECRETARY The Platte River is peculiar in several respects. As Mark Twain so ably described it, it is during several months of tho year "A mile wide ami an inch deep." At flood periods the discharge may exceed 35,000 cubic feet per second. The river bed is fine sand and gravel. This gravel bed generally extends down far below any depth desirable for piling sup - port with an occasional seam of sandstone or hard clay through which a piling will penetrate. Experience has proven that the river varying from a quarter of a mile to a mile in width can be bridged satisfactorily without undue hazard with 500 feet to 1,200 feet of bridge. The balance of the river is spanned by a sand fill surfaced with clay and gravel, and protected against wave action or stream wash by rip rap and jetties. A rather careful study is being made to determine the most economical type of bridge design for general use on the Platte as conditions across the State are much the same varying only in width of stream or natural is'and formations determining the location of spans. The following pictures are indicative of the general types of State Aid Bridges placed ovc-v the Platte River. The present tendency of de - pijrn is toward steel truss or transverse joist type with concrete floor and foundations in place of the heavier multiple concrete arches. Consists of twelve 50 foot concrete arches, 24 foot roadway, and 4 foot sidewalk on one side. Overall length 644 feet with about 2600 feet of earth approach fills.

This bridge replaced a concrete arch design built sev - eral years ago but which failed following a record breaking flood. The two original abutments were used in place for the new bridge. This same type of bridge is now being constructed over the Platte River as state Aid projects at Yutan near Omaha, Nebraska, at Cozad, Nebraska, and at Brady, Nebraska. The Yutan Bridge consists of 24 50-foot steel spans transverse joist through girder, 20 foot roadway, concrete floor, pier and abutments on steel piling 50 feet to 55 feet long with 2,000 feet of earth approach fills. The Cozad bridge consists of 15 63-foot steel transverse joist through girders, 16 foot roadway creosoted gum wood floor, concrete piers and abutments on steel piling 55 feet long with 2,200 feet of earth approach fills.

For the purpose of controlling expenditures, this Division takes the various appropriations made by the Legislature for the Department of Public Works and subdivides them into quarterly estimates. These quarterly estimates are then distributed among the various accounts in each fund and a careful check made each month to see that the expendi- tures are not being made in excess of the appropriation. Under the existing system of financing the Department of Public Works, the appro- priations of the Legislature control the funds available, and all work is carried on with that fact in mind. Following is a list of the appropria- tions made by the Legislature for the use of this Department during the biennium of 1923-24: State Aid Road — Administration and Engineering H.

R. 672 710 State Equipment and Material Fund, estimated 660,000.00 Functions of This Division The functions of this Division as a part of the Department of Public Works group themselves as follows: (a) Relation to the contractors (practically all construction work is done by contract). (b) Relation to the Federal Government (the larger part of the con- struction work, is carried on with the assistance of Federal Aid Funds.) (c) Relation to the employees of the Department (the State pays all engineering costs and all engineers are employees of the State), (d) Clerical work, requisitions and cost data work. Sec. A. Notice to Contractors are mailed from this office and arrangements for the legal publication of the same are made. At the time of the letting of the contracts, all tabulations of bids are checked by this Division, the contracts checked and the Minutes of the Meeting taken. These are checked, one against the other and the following copies are made and distributed: four copies of the Minutes, four copies of the tabulation of the bids and ten copies of each contract As there are often five contractors receiving contracts on one project, it means as high as fifty copies of the contracts are made on a project. The handling of the certified checks and arrangements for bonds are mad« in this office. Estimates on construction work are sent in by the Project Engineer each month, after they have been approved by the District Engineers and the Chief of the Bureau, they are presented to this Division for pay - ment. These estimates are placed on vouchers that distribute the cost of construction as it appears on the estimate and are sent to the Con - tractor for signature. On some estimates, this requires as many as six vouchers. After these vouchers have been properly signed by the con tractor, they are placed on file and as funds become available, this Div ision requests the Finance Department to pass them through for p«y ment. All details of payment such as claims against the contractor, the assignment of funds due him and etc., are handled by this Division. See. B. When the Department desires to make any piece of con - struction a Federal Aid project, a Project Statement is made up and three copies forwarded to the Federal Government, together with the necessary copies of preliminary estimates and all information required by the Government before they will approve a project and sign a Project Agreement with the State. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">KKPiillT &lt;&gt;K SECRETARY 172 The estimates handed in by the Construction Division are marie the basis of a voucher to the Federal Government in which the Federal Gov - ernment's share of the cost of construction on that particular project is claimed. On each project, the Federal Government enters into an agree - ment with the State as to the extent that they will participate in the cost thereof, this is known as the Project Agreement. Accompanying the Project Agreement j s a Project statement ami estimate, or as it is called, a PS&amp;E. Thi.s FS&amp;E limits the extent to which the Federal Govern - ment may be vouchereri as to the various items of construction on the project. If an overrun is necessary in the cost of the construction, a mollified project agreement is requested from the Government. Whenever a Project Agreement is entered into with the Government, it is necessary to show that funds are available to meet the balance of the construction costs, that are not to be paid by the Federal Govern - ment. This is usually met by the appropriation of the State Legislature known a? the "Appropriation of State Aid Construction to Meet Federal r' however, in some cases, the Counties and various sub-divisions of State affixes to furnish the necessary funds to meet Federal Aid. In cases such as these, this Division bills the county and collects the share of the cost of construction that is charged to the county. Sec. C.

The Equipment Division "Temporary Help" payrolls are paid twice a month and are paid on an hourly basis. Preliminary Engineering payrolls are made up from Daily survey cards of Preliminary- Engineers and their helpers. Project Engineers and helpers payrolls are made from monthly reports of the Project En - gineer and charged to the different projects worked on. Division Engineer payrolls are made up from weekly reports. All salaries are figured on a monthly basis. Project Engineers and Perliminary Engineers and helpers are allowed in addition to their salaries a subsistence allowance. Project Engineers hand in monthly statements known as R19s, showing distribution of their time and expenses. These are combined on, what is known as the Distribution sheet and this in turn is made the basis of a payroll voucher, which is passed through for payment of the COSt Of the engineering on the various projects. Heads of the different Divisions while away from Headquarters are allowed a flat subsistence rate, covering their meals. Receipts are not required to cover same.

I Cost data of maintenance done by the counties on the State High- System throughout the entire state, is kept by this Division. This is kept separately for each patrol in the different counties. All miscellaneous expenses as light, heat, rent and supplies of all kinds are vouchered and paid for through this division. During the year 1924, the Department of Public Works placed under contract over four million dollars worth of work. There is every indica - tion that this amount will increase rather than decrease, and along with it, the duties of the Department. In order that the Department may function economically, a unified system of the accounts and records is a necessity. This should include a continuous audit of accounts, reveal - ing expenses and costs in detail to be used as a working guide in keeping the various items of expense to a minimum, together with a comprehen - sive and intelligent set of records that could be used as a basis for plan - ning work in the future. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">175 REPORT OF THE DIVISION OF ROAD EQUIPMENT On February 28th, 1918, Congress passed an amendment to the original Federal Aid Road Bill designated as Section Seven which pro - vided for the transfer by the Secretary of War of all surplus war equip - ment materials and supplies not needed by the War Department, but suitable for use in the improvement of highways, to the highway de - partments of the several states, to be used on roads constructed entirely or in part with Federal Aid Funds; such distribution to be made upon s value basis, the same as provided for by the Federal Aid Road Act. The Department, realizing the importance of such equipment in building and maintaining roads, immediately gave definite instructions to the War Department for shipment of Nebraska's share, and at the same time organized an Equipment Division which should have direct control and supervision of such materials. The Equipment Division's store room, garage, and general equip - ment yard is located at Sixth and South Street, Lincoln, Nebraska, where all supplies are stored, issued, and shipped. The yard, covering eleven acres, is fenced and a spur railroad track, used for loading, runs the full length of ane side. A large "A" frame derrick which facilitates greatly the loading of cars stands on this track. The store room in which all parts are kept is located in the garage building. Doors are locked except when storekeeper is shipping or re - ceiving supplies. As equipment parts are received they are placed in bins or on shelves, with quantity, description, and location entered upon store record cards, which give detailed information concerning each article. A system of duplicate receiving and shipping tickets has been installed as a check upon all supplies on hand. Shipments are checked in on the receiving sheets, the duplicate being kept by the storekeeper fend the original filed in the office. The shipping tickets show the con - signee, quantity, and description of the article, and just how the ship - ment is made. The duplicate of this form is sent to the consignee, but the original is filed. Before securing a piece of equipment, a requisition must be made to the storekeeper on a standard requisition form, the classes of requisition are: (1) The shop for repair and overhaul; (2) From the yard for gas and oil; (3) From thd office for state or office use. After filing a re - quisition, the storekeeper changes the store record card to register the parts sent out and the balance remaining in stock. By this method a perpetual invoice is kept and may be had at all times from the store record cards. During the past several years gasoline has been purchased in car - load lots and delivered into the ten thousand gallon storage tank in the general equipment yard. Lubricating oil and transmission grease were </seg>

Much o( the equipment received from the Government was in very poor condition, and it was necessary in most instances to overhaul, re - pair and provide new parts in order to properly place them in first class mechanical shape. When this equipment is repaired to first class con - dition, it is sold to the counties at cost plus handling charges. Each piece of machinery is stenciled with a State number, the serials Starting anew for each different type of equipment. A daily time record is kept for each man, and the time spent in improving each separate piece of machinery is noted, all labor, costs, gas and oil being: charged directly to the repaired car, truck or tractor.

            <seg id="p191">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 189 REPORT OF CHIEF, BUREAU OF IRRIGATION, WATER POWER AND DRAINAGE Bridgeport, Nebraska, November 30, 1924. R. L. Cochran, State Engineer, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I have the honor of submitting herewith the report of matters transpired in the Bureau of Irrigation, Power and Drainage during the past biennium. Water Supply. Irrigation needs have been amply met during the past biennium in the 1-A watershed. The White River and tributaries in north - western part of the State were extremely short of water during the season of 1924. Barely enough for stock by closing canals. The con - ditions experienced were nearly as bad on the Republican and French - man Rivers. The South Platte River discharged, into Nebraska at Julesburg, 648,922 acre feet in 1923 and approximately 1,100,000 acre feet in 1924. Notwithstanding the greater amount of water in 1924 there was an insufficient supply, during July and August, for the Western Irrigation District. No projects in Colorado, having subse - quent rights to the Western Irrigation District, diverted any of the natural flow during that period. The discharge records of the river at North Platte are more com - plete and cover a period of twenty-nine years. The mean annual dis - charge of the river at North Platte for that period is 2,294,000 acre feet. The annual discharge of the river for 1923 is 93 per cent of the twenty-nine year mean and 95 per cent for 1924. A slight in - crease notwithstanding that the season of 1924 was an unusually dry one. During the months of July, August and September, 1924, 626,141 acre feet, 29 per cent of the annual discharge, passed North Platte and 432,997 acre feet passed during the same months in 1924, or 19 per cent of the annual discharge. During the same months 450,000 acre feet, 28 per cent of the annual flow, passed Bridgeport in 1923, and 433,000 acre feet, 20 per cent of the annual flow, in 1924. Ap - proximately the same ratio of discharge as at North Platte. Com - paring the flow for the same months in 1922 with 1924 at Bridge - port, 251,000 acre feet, 25 per cent of the annual flow, passed. The twenty-nine year (1895 to 1924) mean flow of the river at Bridgeport for the months of July, August and September was 384,000 acre feet and at North Platte it was 400,00 acre feet. The fourteen year (1895 to 1908) mean flow for the same months at </seg>
            <seg id="p192">190 REPORT OF SECRETARY fh Platte was 339,000 acre feet and the sixteen year (1909 to ) mean was 448,000 acre feet, 32 per cent increase. The thirteen (1896 to 1908) mean flow at Bridgeport for the same months 296,000 acre feet and the sixteen year (1909 to 1924) was 455, - acre feet, 54 per cent increase. In the latter part of August and the first two weeks of Septem - 1922, all canals in the 1-A watershed, having priority dates later October 18, 1888, were closed against diverting the natural flow, rainfall throughout the North Platte Valley, during the irriga - season, was 116 per cent greater in 1923 than in 1922 while the m 1924 had only 3 per cent more rainfall than in 1922. In other s, the rainfall in 1922 and 1924 was practically the same and no Is were closed in 1924. The graphs, published elsewhere in this •t, showing the loss and gain between Whalen, Wyoming and Lex - n, Nebraska, on the North Platte River for the seasons of 1922 1923 should be studied. If these graphs can be accepted as ap - imately correct it would seem to indicate that rainfall exerts a : influence on the gain or loss. I The water supply of Chadron Creek during the summer of 1924 rather critical. The average discharge of the stream above the rvoir owned by the City of Chadron was 1.95 second feet during months of July, August and September and only 0.50 second feet *r the intake of their water system. The City has two direct appropriations, aggregating 5.50 second feet from Chadron Creek no storage appropriation. The eppropriators on this stream have considerable conflict over the distribution. There are riparian ts as well as domestic uses to be recognized. The Department lowed the application, filed for 4.50 second feet, by the City of Iron for the reason that the stream was over appropriated for :t flow appropriation and not dependable for the intended purpose in lieu thereof, recommended a storage application. The City ap - ed to the Supreme Court and a decree was rendered ordering the irtment to grant the direct flow appropriation application. The e inadverdently failed to appear before the Supreme Court in case. Projects Developed. Since the publication of the fourteenth biennial report of the State Engineer two projects have been practically completed. The Whitney project, reclaiming 9,792 acres with water diverted from the White River west of Whitney, Nebraska and the Northport project, reclaiming 16,000 acres, with water from the North Platte River. Irrigation Districts. Considerable interest was manifest in district organization the itast year. However, not all were successful. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 191 Petition signed by eighteen land owners comprising 9,995 acres was filed with County Commissioners of Dawes County and hearing before said board was held November 8, 1921 for the formation of the Whitney Irrigation District. Final action of the board cut the area to 9,945 acres. Election held and votes canvassed December 12, 1921. Twenty-three votes cast, nineteen for and three against. $390,870.00 bonds voted to meet construction cost and first year's in - terest. Before bond election, 153 acres were set out of the district by the Board of Directors leaving 9,892 acres in the district. Con - tracts for construction were awarded June 1, 1923. 29,564 feet of pipe line were constructed from a diversion dam in the White River to the reservoir site at a cost of $163,532.00. The Whitney project was not completed in time to store the spring flow of 1924, hence only a small supply was available in the reservoir. Probably one - fourth of the irrigable area was watered in the 1924 season. Project was 95 per cent complete October 31, 1924. The diversion dam cost $9,223.00. The Northport project was completed and ready to receive water in 1923 for the entire area of 16,000 acres. This project cost $1, - 050,000.00 including complete lateral system to each farm unit. Attempt to place the lands under Docket 687 and 667 into dis - trict organizations in the spring of 1923, for the purpose of taking over and rehabilitating an old canal failed and the appropriations were cancelled August 13, 1923. Attempt was made to form the lands under Dockets 621 and 624, known as the Farmers and Platte River projects respectively, but without success and cancellation of the appropriations is pending until hearing can be held on the Daw - son County project. The Gaslin Irrigation District was organized from the lands un - der Docket 666, sometime in December, 1923 and an election to vote $443,000.00 bond issue was held January 21, 1924. The bond issue failed to carry by a vote of eleven for and thirty against. On Feb - ruary 5, 1924 the appropriation was cancelled for non-use. An election was held by the land owners under Docket 681 on May 1, 1923. The formation of district carried by seventy-nine votes for and seven votes against. County Commissioners, on May 14, 1923, declared the Gothenburg South Side Irrigation District duly organized. On January 28, 1924 the Department approved an estimate of cost to rehabilitate the old canal, amounting to $382,618.00 to be submitted to the voters of the district at a bond election. The District Court disapproved the bond issue and rendered a decree which reads in part: "IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED, ADJUDGED AND DE - CREED that the canal and water appropriation described herein, and described in the proceedings organizing said district, and described in </seg>
            <seg id="p194">192 REPORT OF SECRETARY I proceeding at which said bonds were voted, has been abandoned forfeited, and had been so abandoned and forfeited many years ' to the organization of said district or the voting of said bonds, that said irrigation district, gets nothing by the pretended pur - e of said pretended canal, water rights and franchises; that the ion at which said bonds were voted, was for the reasons hereto - stated, null and void, and that the bonds voted at said election are rise null and void, and of no force and effect, and the petition of ioners herein is dismissed at petitioners cost, to all of which said ioners except, and forty days are allowed from the rising of the court to prepare and settle a Bill of Exceptions. Supersedes as re - quired by law." Farm Loans. Irrigation districts bonded indebtedness is viewed by Loan Com - panies in such manner as to give a difference without a distinction when compared to taxes for other indebtedness. Invariably the bonded indebtedness covers construction cost of projects. This indebtedness is repaid by taxes levied each year by the board of directors of the district. County Commissioners, City Councils and School Boards levy a tax to repay bonded indebtedness to cover the cost of bridges, Court Houses, City Halls, School Houses and other public improve - ments and money is loaned without giving that indebtedness any thought. But, a tax levy to construct a system of carriers of water to make lands much more productive is "different"' for no apparent reason. Water Administration. The water supply in the 1-A watershed, during the 1923 and 1924 seasons, was not difficult to administer. Plenty of water being available. Water Commissioner, O. M. Finley of Scottsbluff was active in the performance of his duties and was very satisfactory. Water Com- E ioners, C. E. Strong ami P. M. Whitehead have always presented ;r difficult problems to be solved in the administration of water ibution along the Frenchman and Republican Rivers. However, have performeil their duties with fairness. The problems of administration along the White River and Nio - brara are not so difficult. However, they do require the constant services of the Water Commissioner and Superintendent throughout the irrigation season. John D. Heywood, Superintendent and F. A. Hood, Water Commissioner, have been able to handle the situation .-atisfactorily. Hydrography. Stream measurements have been carried on the past two years covering all streams in Nebraska in 1923 with three hydrographers </seg>
            <seg id="p195">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 193 and on the principal streams with one hydrographer in 1924, with an exception of two months. During July, August and September two hydrographers were employed. From September 30, 1922 to Sep - tember 30, 1924 the number of gaugings made are as follows: Results of stream measurements are published elsewhere in this report. Record of canal discharges will not be published but will be kept in the files of the Department for reference. Hearings. Hearings were held on a number of projects that failed, for many years, to put to beneficial use the water appropriated. Some of the hearings resulted in cancellation of the entire appropriation and others in a partial cancellation. The cancellation proceedings of the Dele ware- Hickman project in the Republican Valley was appealed to the Supreme Court from the District Court of Dundy County by the State. While nearly all hear - ings before the Department have been conducted in the past without guidance by representation from the Attorney General's Department, it would seem better practice for the Attorney General to attend all the hearings in the interest of the State. By such practice the ap - pearance of the Department setting as judge and prosecutor would be avoided. Cooperation. Cooperation of projects with the Department has not been car - ried on to the degree of satisfaction that was desired. There will always be occasions when the records of water used will be needed for some purpose or other, perhaps in a law suit. It is further necessary to have cooperation in order to administer the distribution of the water supply intelligently. There has been, and will be again, seasons with demands ex - ceeding the supply. It is then necessary to have records for refer - ence by the Water Commissioners. It is impossible for the Water Commissioners to administer the available water supply with any degree of equity unless a complete record is at his disposal, supplied by all project managers through cooperation with the State. At this time the rights of Nebraska to the use of the water Of the North Plattte River are now in the hands of a Commission rep - resenting the United States, Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska.

            <seg id="p196">IlEPORT OF SECRETARY records of the use of the water, by projects in Nebraska, from this interstate stream are much needed by the Commissioner from Ne - braska. The more complete the records are the better equipped will be the Commissioner to protect the rights of the water user. I wish to thank State Engineer, R. L.

            <seg id="p197">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WUKKS (2) The actual measurements and daily discharges of all stream* in Nebraska, as well as other hydrographical data, should be published in book form, as this material has not been published since 1914. There is now considerable data of value for water power and future irrigation studies on file which should be condensed and published for distribution. There have been constant calls for this data which re - quires considerable work to copy the records. An appropriation should be ma&lt;ie by the next legislature for this purpose. (3) Hearings coming before the Department effecting the dis - posal of public water of the State, should have the legal guidance of the Attorney General to protect the economic use of this resource of Nebraska for her citizens. (4) Requests have been made frequently for records of stream measurements covering long periods. Two Or three hyilrographers are needed in the summer months to gauge all streams in the State.

Dear Sir: t There has not been a great deal of work for the Water Commis - ler in this territory of late years, on account of the abundance rain, and the advantages of irrigation have not been felt by those a have been in position to secure it. I A great many projects have fallen into disuse and abandoned and s have been washed out and not replaced aa the rainfall has been cient for ordinary crops. The Whitney Irrigation District, while it is not yet fully com - pleted and in operation, supplied water to some users about the first of August, and two crops of alfalfa were raised after that, whereas the fields up to that time were barren. The wonderful possibilities of irrigation are now demonstrated and dry land farmers are acquiring small tracts of this land for the purpose of insuring an adequate supply of hay. I While this tract has more streams of water than any other part he state, the stream flow is not sufficient during the season to ily those who could use it for irrigating purposes, and the lem, or rather the program should be to augment the supply by ting numerous storage reservoirs along the creeks. These woul 1 care of the flood waters, minimizing damage and loss from that ce, and would stabilize and increase the regular flow, so that the r could be applied to beneficial use. Bs year has been exceptionally dry in this district, and nnmer - nplaints have been made that water was being unlawfully from the creek, so that stock water was not available, nplainants were unable to show just where the water was iverted, and our investigations the two previous years failed il any diversion, and it is our opinion that the shortage of tras due to natural causes. tThe opportunities for irrigation here are numerous, and this has demonstrated its value. It will be our purpose to stimulate people to action that they may secure for themselves the bene - of water used instead of wasted. Respectfully submitted, F. A. HOOD, Water Commissioner. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLJC WORKS 197 REPORT OF WATER COMMISSIONER, DISTRICT NO. 1, DIVISION NO. IB Culbertson, Nebraska, November 30, 1924. R. L. Cochran, State Engineer, Lincoln, Nebraska, Dear Sir: The irrigation systems of the Frenchman and Republican Valleys are situated peculiarly. Here the rainfall is often quite enough to grow excellent crops without the artificial application of water. This has been the case for the last two seasons. I understand there was not a ditch which exercised its prior right to water during the year 1923 and during the current year there has been but one ditch which has demanded more water than it was getting. The Culbertson Canal twice dropped below its carrying capacity. The first demand for additional water resulted in the dos - ing of one small ditch for about a day when a freshet supplied the shortage and the closed ditch was enabled again to take water. The second time two or three small ditches were shut off for about a week when nature again supplied the need. This has brought about re - sults inimical to a satisfactory handling of the needs of the water users. So far as the Water Commissioner knows there are but two ditches which are continuing to maintain automatic recording water gauges. A couple of ditches have their intakes and rating flumes badly clogged with sand and mud. One rather large appropriator has had its rating flume washed away, at least one has no visible means for closing its intake and for one of the best equipped ditches in the district no acreage was reported for the current year. Perhaps more adequate returns for production will put an end to this laxity and indifference and when a season of shortage comes make the problem of distribution more simple.

            <seg id="p201">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 199 REPORT OF CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS ON THE CENTRAL NEBRASKA SUPPLEMENTAL IRRIGATION PROJECT* W. W. BURR and J. C. RUSSEL. 'Department of Agronomy. University of Nebraska In this report are discussed some of the agricultural aspects con - cerning the feasibility of supplemental irrigation in the area known as the Central Nebraska Supplemental Irrigation Project. This report does not concern itself with the engineering features of the project, which involve the type, manner and cost of construction of laterals, canals, and storage.t Obviously the construction cost is big i actor in determining the feasibility of the proje:;. The investigations covered by this report were undertaken at the request of Mr. C. W. McConaughy, President of the Central Neb - raska Supplemental Water Association and Mr. A. Lincoln Fellows, of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, the latter having been assigned by the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare a report for the Secretary of the Interior, setting forth the feasibility of irrigation in this district. The distinctive feature of this irrigation project is the clear recog - nition that the rainfall of the district is generally almost sufficient, but seldom quite enough, for the satisfactory production of crops and that what is needed is a supplementing supply that will tend to insure more certain and profitable production. The early contemplation of the project was to meet the deficiency of rainfall thru the storage of water in the subsoil. This project is therefore a departure from the usual custom of establishing irrigation projects under strictly arid con - ditions. Furthermore the land in the proposed district is not new, but for many years has been under private ownership and much of it has been under cultivation for upwards of fifty years. The main questions considered in this investigation of the project were, first, the probable average deficiency of rainfall for the satisfactory production of crops thruout the district and, second, the possibilities of meeting this deficiency thru the storage of moisture in the subsoil or by direct application of water in the growing season. LOCATION OF PROJECT This project is located in South-central Nebraska, comprising portions of Adams, Kearney, Phelps, and Gosper Counties.

It is bounded on the North by the breaks of the Platte River which are irregular, more or less sandy, and unirrigable; on the South it is bounded by a highly dissected and eroded plain, locally known as Canyon land. On the East it expands into a comparatively level plain of rather heavy textured soil. It is approximately 65 miles in length, east to west, and from 10 to 20 miles in width, and contains some 500,000 acres of irrigable land. Topography. The project lies on an extensive unpland table, the surface of which is flat to very slijrhtly undulating. Natural drain - age is fairly well established in the eastern portion of the area, but in the western portion the natural drainage is toward depressional areas or basins, which as yet have established no drainage outlet. Elevation. The elevation is from 1900 feet above sea level in the eastern portion of the area to 2600 feet above sea level in the western portion of the area, the slope to the east being approximately 8 feet per mile, with a less abrupt slope southward, to the Republican River Valley. Present Development. The land under the proposed project is now thas been for many years under private ownership. The farmers already on the land which is held in units largely ranging from acres to 320 acres in size. Probably 90 per cent of the land is r cultivation. It is generally quite well improved as to buildings es, etc. The farmers have the horses and machinery necessary for ting; the land under the present system. There is already in - ?W in this area a tremendous amount of capital, largely resting with farm owners. The area has splendid transportation facilities, both as to rail - roads and highways. There is a highway on almost every section I?, generally kept in fairly satisfactory condition. Shipping poinU i close, no farm having more than a few miles to deliver its ■ducts to a shipping point. The area lies relatively close to sever - important primary markets. It is within 200 miles of Omaha; with - 700 miles of Chicago; and within less than 400 miles of St. Joseph 1 Kansas City. These primary markets afford a ready outlet for agricultural products. CLIMATE. The project lies in what is known as the sub-humid area of the United States, between the humid and arid districts. Of the several climatic factors that influence crop production the rainfall alone thru - out this area makes crop production hazardous. Drought, resulting either from an insufficient total supply of rainfall, or from a very un - favorable distribution of the rainfall that does come, is of frequent occurrence. These periods of drought, coupled with the loss of considerable portion of the virgin fertility of the soil, combine to </seg>
            <seg id="p203">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 201 grive quite generally low yields of crops. The crop record for the put 20 years shows that only in one year out of five are satisfactory crops produced. The temperature ranges from a mean of 24.4* for January to a mean of 75.9° for July, with rare extremes as much as 40* below and 110° above zero. The growing season or frost free period, is suffi - cient for the production of all crops common to the general territory. The wind velocity is a little higher and the relative humidity a little lower than in eastern Nebraska, which tends to decrease somewhat th» efficiency of a given amount of rain. However, it is only during 1 periods of drought and hot winds that these three factors, — tempera - ture, relative humidity and wind velocity, become injurious to crop production. During such periods they combine to greatly increase the rate of transpiration and the consequent demand of the crop for water. If, during such periods, the soil is lacking in moisture, injury results, — the amount of damage depending upon the dryness of the soil and length of time such unfavorable conditions obtain. Precipitation. Rainfall is the one great limiting factor to crop production within the area. Not only is the total amount generally insufficient for good crop yields, but the distribution is uncertain and frequently very unfavorable. Droughts, of greater or lesser severity are frequent, occurring almost every year, and in the main during the past twenty years have resulted in unprofitably low yields. While the rainfall is probably as favorable as formerly, there has under cul - tivation been a gradual loss of organic matter from the soil, which has made the rainfall less efficient and has resulted in a gradual decline in crop yields. The difficulty of putting the land to grass or legumes under a limited rainfall makes the maintenance of the organic content of the soil almost impossible. Annual Precipitation. The mean annual rainfall during the last 20 years — 1904 to 1923 — at Holdrege, Minden, and Hastings Gorern - ment Weather Stations is 23.35, 24.05, and 25.42 inches, respectively, an average of 24.27 inches for the three Stations. The annual rain - fall together with its monthly distribution for the Holdrege Sta - tion is shown in Table 1. While Minden and Hastings have a little more rainfall, its distribution is much the same as for Holdrege. The average annual rainfall is not a dependable normal, as it var - ies greatly from year to year. For example, the record at Holdrege shows that during the 20 year period it has varied from a minimum of 13.67 in 1920 to a maximum of 40.73 in 1915. During that time the annual rainfall has been below the average 13 years and above the average 7 years. For six consecutive years, 1909 to 1914, every year was below the average, giving a large accumulated deficit. The average annual rainfall is little more than an index of the probable </seg>

It is recognized, of course, thtt if the total is so low as to preclude any possibility of crop production tion is not an important factor, since an insufficient total be so distributed as to meet the crop requirements, but within broad limits distribution is more important than the total annual The annual rainfall, yearly variations, and average for Hastings, Minden and Holdrege, are shown graphically in Figure 1.

If the precipitation is to be most effective, it must be sufficient in amount to penetrate deeply enough in the soil to reach the feeding; zone of the plant roots. This is especially important in the Plains country where the rate of Figure 2. Average monthly distribution of rainfall at Hastings, Minden and Holdre&amp;e </seg>
            <seg id="p207">DKPARTMENT OK IU'BLIC WDKKS 205 evaporation is high and where a light shower that merely moistens the surface inch or two of soil is quickly lost thru evaporation. Such light showers have very little importance so far as the plant bong able to utilise them is concerned. They are beneficial in that they tend to hold down the temperature of the soil and make the atmosphere more humid and consequently reduce the direct transpiration from ihe crops. It is probable, however, that during the warm summer months when the surface of the soil gets very hot that there is little if any feeding roots in the upper surface of the soil. Consequently if a rain is to be highly beneficial it must be sufficient in amount to penetrate several inches into the soil. On the whole it is rains of a half inch or greater that make up most of the effective rainfall. Heavy down - pours of rain, however, are apt to puddle and clog the surface and re - sult in a considerable loss thru runoff. In this particular district where the soil is quite level, there should be a little loss thru runoff. In so far as the character of the rainfall is concerned it is much the same thruout the entire area. In Figure 3 is shown the char - acter and distribution of the precipitation at Holdrege, Nebraska. This is based on the entire 20 years under study. The chart also shows the summer and winter distribution. During the winter months, — October to March inclusive, the rainfall is rather evenly divided in the various sizes. The winter rainfall is never as useful as the summer rainfall because a great deal of it may come when the ground is frozen and consequently does not get into the soil, or it may fall as snow and be blown off of the land so as to give very uneven distribution. At Holdrege 78.6 per cent of the preci - pitation comes during the six summer months and during that period 13.6 inches of the total 23.35 inches, falls in rains of over half an inch. Frequency of Drought Periods. One of the peculiarities of the rainfall of the Great Plains area, where this project lies, is the fre - quent occurrence of more or less prolonged dry periods, during which little or no rain falls. As above mentioned, these periods of droir are the greatest handicap to successful crop production. Quite fre - quently such periods are terminated by a succession of heavy rains, which makes the average of the rainfall appear favorable, whereas the individual seasons may have been disastrous because of one or more prolonged dry spells. The periods during which crops are most affected by shortage of moisture may be described as follows: 1. April 1 to May 15. During this period are apt to occur high winds which drift the loose dry soil and uproot small grain crops, and which are often responsible for reduced yields even tho the remain - der of the growing season may be favorable. The germination of spring sown small grains may be more or less seriously affected by </seg>

It is generally during this period that the corn is planted. An unfavorable germination is liable to ob - tain unless there is reserve moisture in the soil. 3. July 1 to August 21. High temperatures can he expected dar - ing this period. Hot winds which usually occur only during periods of drought may do serious damage to corn when it is tasseling or silking, unless there is sufficient reserve moisture so that the crop can obtain water rapidly. At such times corn is making its greatest growth and the demand for water is large. A good growth of corn will use a quarter of an inch of water a day during its periods of maximum demand. A dry period at this time may ruin the corn crop unless the soil has sufficient water stored in it to carry the crop thru. 4. August 21 to October 2. During the first part of this period the land is being prepared for winter wheat. Dry weather may seriously interfere with such preparations, generally resulting in de - laying' the work and frequently having a poor seed bed for the wheat. Where the soil has been thoroly dried out it is often neces - sary to postpone all preparations and consequently delay the seeding beyond the proper time. Furthermore, it is important that there be sufficient water in the soil to give a fairly good fall growth and to carry the wheat crop during the winter. It is generally during the dry winters that winter-killing of wheat is serious. During any of the four periods mentioned above, an interval of thirty days or more during which little or no rain falls may be disasterous unless the soil be well filled with water to a depth of several feet. In this area periods of thirty days or more coming between April 1 and October 31, (luring which no rain at ail falls, are not common but thirty day periods where no effective rain falls occur in about one year in two As mentioned above, an isolated shower or small rains of less than a half inch, falling on a dry surface, will hardly penetrate into the soil deeply enough to be used by the crop. During a dry period of weather such a rain would not be sufficient to relieve the crop. In this section periods of thirty days or more during which there is less than one inch of effective rainfall arc frequent. In fact there has not been a single year in the last twenty years at either Hastings, Minden or Holdredge, in which such dry periods have not occurred from one to four time between April 1 and October 31. Tables 2, 3, and 4 have been prepared to show the frequency of such dry periods at Hastings, Mindjen and Holdrege.

The distribution of these dry periods is shown graphically In Figures 4, 5, and 6. These figures also show graphically the yield of corn and wheat during the period of twenty years. The seriousness «f a dry period of over 40 days will depend upon the moisture con - ditions of the soil at the beginning of the drought and the time when the dry periods begin and end. However, when such dry periods come, as frequently they do in central Nebraska, it is probable that some crop damage results from them almost every year. It was to over - come the seriousness of such periods of drought by having water stored in the soil, which would maintain the crop thru the dry period, that this irrigation project was conceived. Inadequacy of Rainfall for Corn Production. That period of drought, coming between July 1 and August 21 may ruin a corn crop, is well known to farmers in Central Nebraska. That such a disaster may be avoided or at least mitigated to con - siderable extent by adequate moisture up to July 1 may not be so well understood. Statistical studies of corn yields and rainfall in Phelps and Adams Counties during the last 20 years offer convincing proof that abundant rain and consequently moisture in the subsoil on July 1 tends to offscft dry spells of weather after that date. The evidence indicates that if the subsoil is well filled with water on July 1 as would be the case if rainfall during the preceding- spring and fall had been heavy, a fairly good crop of corn can be expected. Only extreme drought or other abnormal conditions would bring about serious damage. In the last 20 years the yields of corn, as reported in Nebraska crop estimates, has varied from 42.3 and 38.3 bushels per acre in Phelps and Adams County, respectively, in 1905 0.5 and 3.6 bushels per acre in 1913. This wide variation in yield has been d* almost entirely to rainfall. I In attempting to correlate the yield of corn with rainfall, only the IS of over .50 inch falling during the preceding fall months,— aely, September, October, and November, and the spring months, — ril, May and June, have been considered. Much of the corn in the tion is planted in corn land, and the preceding crop is using water to September i. Where corn is planted in stubble land, the weeds the fall before generally use moisture up to September 1 or later. M the attempt at correlation is to show only the value of stored «r, rainfall during July and August of the crop year should not included. Table 5 shows the correlation between the effective rainfall </seg>
            <seg id="p217">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 215 up to July 1 and tfcte yield of corn in Adams and Phelps Counties, since 1905. The data is arranged in descending order of yields, not chronologically, and in groups of comparable yields, each group being averaged. The same correlation is shown graphically in Figure 7. While there are many discrepancies, the data as a whole show clearly a correlation between the yield of corn and the effective rain - fall up to July 1. There are three exceptional years, — namely 1907, 1913, and 1918, when moisture conditions up to July 1 were generally favorable for good yields, but unusually poor yields were obtained. In the case of the latter two the poor yields were due to unusually hot and dry weather in July and August. Table 5 also shows the effective rainfall during July and August. The suwment ha&gt;- been made (5 p. 151) that it is the rainfall during these two months that determines the yield of corn.

In the 32 normal d years given in the Table, 16 show yields over 24 bushels per s, averaging 32.5 bushels. In this group are found only thre. - rs which had less than the average effective rainfall up to July 1, 8 years are found which have less than the average July and rust rainfall. The other 16 years average 16.9 bushels per aci*. this group is found only one year with effective rainfall up to f 1 greater than the average, but 5 years are found with July August rainfall greater than the average. Omitting the three exceptional years, 1907, 1913, and 1918, com has averaged 24.7 bushels on 10.81 inches of effective rain to July 1. The highest yield group shows an average of 39.7 bushels of coir with 19.56 inches of effective rainfall to July 1, and the lowest yield group an average of 13.8 bushels of corn with 5.69 inches of effective rainfall to July 1. During the 32 crop years, there are 11 years when the. yield of corn has been above 30 bushels per acre, averaging 35.4 bushels; ten years with y:e!ds between 20 and 30 bushels, averaging 23.8 bushels; and 11 years with yields below 20 bushels, averaging 14.7 bushels per acre The effective rainfall up to July 1 for these jthree groups was 16.54 inches, 9.51 and 6.26 inches respectively. The effect - ivfc July and August rainfall is 6.47, 4.76, and 4.08 inches respectively. I Considering the 32 crop years the yield is very close to 2 bushels corn for 1 inch of effective water before July 1. Projecting curve of average yields and effective rainfall in Figure 7 would cate that 12 inches of water added to the average supply will ease the yield of corn 20 bushels per acre over the present average. Inadequacy of the Rainfall for Wheat Production The yield of wheat in the last 20 years in Adams, Kearney, and Phelps Counties has varied from 25.2 bushels per acre in Adams County in 1906, to 5.0 bushels per acre in Phelps County in 1923. For com, the variation in yields was simply and conclusively shown to be correlated with effective rainfall. In the case of wheat correlation of the yield with effective rainfall during the spring and preceding fall is much more complex than for corn, and cannot be shown on a graph similar to Figure 7. Two seasons must be taken into con - sideration in the case of wheat. First, the fall during which the peed bed is being prepared, the seed is being sown and early growth is being established. With the hazards of this season should also be included the hazards of drought and wind blowing, up to the beginning of flie growing season about April 1. Second, the spring, including April and May. If the fall season be unusually dry, the </seg>
            <seg id="p221">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 219 yield may be low in spite of an unusually wet spring. On the other hand if the spring be unusually dry, a low yield may result in spite of a wtet fall. The fall and spring seasons must work together if a good yield is to be obtained. A complete analysis of wheat yields and rainfall in Adams and Phelps Counties which will not be presented here shows that low yields are obtained when either or both the fall and spring seasons are dry, and high yields are obtained when both fall and spring are wet. Medium lo high wheat yields, averaging 18.6 bushels have been obtained in ninp cases in ten when the total effective rainfall in fall and spring was 12.66 inches, distributed a? approximately 4 inches in fall and 8 inches in spring, or vice versa. Low to medium yields, averaging 10.6 bushels have been obtained in nine cases in ten when either the fall or spring rainfall varied from less than 3 inches in fall with a spring rainfall of over 8 inches, to more than 8 inches in the fall with a spring rainfall under 2 inches. The quantity of water required to supplement seasons of such types of inadequate rainfall and convert them into seasons of adequate rainfall where the chances are nine to ten that yields will be 8 bushels better, is approximately 4 inches. Thus it appears for wheat, jut as for corn, that for each inch of sup - plemental water applied in season, approximately 2 bushels of wheat can be obtained. Years in which either fall or spring precipitation or both are inadequate and will require supplemental water to proiluce an average yield of 18.6 bushels per acre, have occurred approximately half of the time during the past twenty years. Supplemental Water. Supplemental irrigation is the practice of adding to the soil sufficient water to carry the crop thru periods of drought and to make up the difference between the crop requirements and the rainfall. The water may be applied either before the crop is seeded and held in storage in the subsoil, or as a direct application when the crop is growine. The fact that the deficiency of rainfall can in a large measure be met by water in storage was first observed by the farmers themselvfes. They noticed that in those years when they had a considerable carry-over of water from the previous year, or when spring rains wet a considerable column of soil, they were much more certain of satisfactory yields than in the years when the seeding period found the entire soil dry. This has been the experience of all farmers in the Great Plains region. The protection against drought thru water in storage in the soil has been further borne out by the experience of the fanners who are practicing what is called "Dry Farming," when they summer-till and store water in the soil. At North Platte Experiment Station (3), it was found that an "abundance of water in the subsoil is a great </seg>
            <seg id="p222">220 REFORT OF SECRETARY protection to the crop against drought. The protection to the crop against drought is in almost exact proportion to the total available soil water within reach of the crop." This was found particularly true for the small grains in the drier years. During the 16 years that the Station has been under operation the water stored by summer-tillage has more than doubled the yield of winter wheat as compared with winter wheat following small grain. Many years during the 16 only enough water was accumulated to moisten two or three feet of soil. It is not claimed that water in storage will completely produce a crop, but it will tend to carry it thru a drought. There aite very few years when there is not sufficient rainfall so that with moisture in storage in the soil satisfactory crops tie Obtained. L. L. Zook, in Nebraska Experiment Station Bui. 192, (8, p. 2.) says: "Average yields per acre of all crops were higher on fallow than under any system of continuous cropping. Yields of grain on fallow were frequently more than double those of grain after grain. Of crops grown on fallow the largest gains were made by winter wheat and the smallest by corn." In Circular No. 72, Kansas State Agricultural College (4), George S. Knapp reports: "Experiments at the Garden City Branch Experiment Station, covering a period of five years, have shown that sufficient water can be stored in the soil by winter irrigation alone to produce good crops of corn, kafir, milo, and certain row crops. The soil on which these experiments were made is a deep silt loam, representative of most of the upland in the western part of the state. Good yields have been obtained each year with all crops grown on the winter irrigated land. At the same time with the exception of the wet season of 1915, unirrigated land produced prac - tically nothing." Abundant evidence as to the value of water either stored or as a direct application, might be presented but it seems hardly necessary to do it in view of the fact that It is now so generally recognized E water is the limiting factor in crop production in the area •n as the Great Plains. The question now comes whether or not soils of this particular area have the ability to hold the water iently when it is applied. Soils of the Area. The soil of the proposed irrigation area is all of loessial origin. The loess material below the line of soil development is Of general uniform composition and texture and extends to a depth of 100 feet or more without any faults such as rock strata, hard pan, or gTSYfel seams. It lies upon a bed of water bearing sand, which seems to underlie the entire loess plains. Below the sand is the Pierre Shale of Cretaceous age. The only variation thruout the depth of the loess </seg>
            <seg id="p223">221 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS is a red formation called red loess, which is not essentially different from the buff or drab variety. Soil Types. Four soil series comprise the irrigable land of the area. These are designated by the Bureau of Soils as Grundy, Holdrege, Colby, and Wabash. (6). Grundy. The Grundy series is characterized by a brownish black surface soil 10 to 12 inches deep, underlain by 6 to 10 inches of slightly lighter brown subsurface a little heavier in texture than the surface. At a depth cf 16 to 22 inches this changes quite abruptly to a heavy textured, tenacious, brownish black to brownish drab subsoil. This layer is usually from 9 to 12 inches thick and passes again quit* abruptly into a drab colored, floury, friable parent soil material which extends to considerable depth without change. The topography is flat to slightly rolling and the drainage is usually well established. The only Grundy type in this area is the Grundy loam. It occupies the extreme eastern end of the proposed irrigation area, not extending any further west than Juniata and Prosser. The mechan - ical analysis of a representative sample is shown in Table 6,— Hansen TABLE NO. « M»k»l«l Aulyal* »f the 8*11 at Five R&lt;-*r&lt;-«&lt;-«t«tt»e Point* Over the Proposed Areas. area.

This grades at varying depth of 30 to 42 inches, into &gt; colored, friable, floury, parent soil material. The Holdrege series srs from the Grundy in that it has a deeper surface layer, less spicuous subsurface, and a less perfectly defined heavy textured son. The topography is flat to slightly rolling. Drainage is not well established as in the Grundy, and depressional areas are ■er and more numerous. I The Holdrege series covers approximately 70 per cent of the able land of the proposed irrigation area. It extends from Jthe ity of Norman on the east to Bertrand on the west, southward to Canyon Land, and northward to its transition into the Colby us at a distance of about two miles from the Platte River breaks. s comparatively uniform thruout, no wide variations in texture g found Either in surface or subsoil.

The clay content of the i foot runs from 13.8 to 17.0 per cent. Colby. The Colby series is characterized by a brown to light brown surface layer 6 to 8 inches deep, underlain by a light brown to drab subsoil passing into floury light drab or buff colored parent soil material at about 36 inches without any distinct occurrence of a heavier textured stratum u in the Grundy and Holdrege series. The topography may be hilly, a dissected plain, or flat, but an undulating or hummocky topography is more characteristic of this section. This soil seems to be of more recent aeolian origin than other loessial soils, as is indicated by its lighter colored and shallower surface, and its freedom from a heavy textured horizon. In many places the soil classified as Colby series seems to be a comparatively recent material drifted over a soil already more or less completely formed. In the vicinity of Kenesaw such a situation exists. A mantle of very fine sandy loam of a thickness of 2 to 5 feet overlies an old soil profile probably continuous with the Holdrege loam to the south and west. At Kenesaw .the profile shows a very fine sandy loam subsoil down to 36 inches. At 36 inches a second profile is struck having the same black layer, subsurface and subsoil as is found at Norman »nd Minden. Table No. 6 shows the mechanical analysis of Colby very fine sandy loam at Hartwell.

A characteristic feature of the topography from Norman on the past to Bertrand on the west is depressions of a few acres up to one or two square miles in extent. These lie at an elevation of a few feet up to 20 feet lower than the surrounding land. The surface drainage accumulates in these areas and in wet seasons they are filled with water, tho in dry seasons they are usually all dry. Except in the interior of the larger areas, this land is generally all farmed. This soil is classified in the Wabash series. It is a black clay loam at the surface growing heavier and more tenacious in the second or third foot. L* usually it changes in the fourth or fifth foot to the friable silty-like material of the loess. The origin of this is sedimentary. The finer clayey or silty material of the sur - rounding land has been carried in by the runoff, and deposited. No mechanical analysis has been made of any of this soil but the hygro - scopic coefficient and the moisture equivalent of some typical samples are shown in Table 1 1. According to the Phelps County Soil Surve) about ten per cent of the Plains land in that country consists of sucl depressions. Soil Studies. The information concerning the soil.-; of this area was obtained first hand thru field examinations, and laboratory studies. In addi - tion there i; available for correlation the Soil Survey of Phelps County (6), a reconnaissance map by the Department of Conservation and Soil Survey, and studies by Alway et al (1) on this portion of the loess region. In connection wXh this report numerous trips were made over one portion or another of the area. Three hundred and twenty-six soil samples were collected at different points. Hygroscopic coefficient determinations were made on all of the samples, moisture equiva - lents on 206 samples, mechanical analysis on 30 samples, nitrogen on 17 samples, weight per cubic foot, to six feet, at 5 points and profile examinations to six feet in all important soil types. Critical studies on the probable tilth of the soils were made on 25 samples. Weight per Cubic Foot. In order to convert the moisture data in per cent shown in later tables to inches of water, it is necessary to know the weight per cubic foot of the different soil types in the area, accordingly this determination was made. The "pit method" was used, the six foot pits which were opened being useful in studying the roil profile. The soil was removed in 6-incJi section- with a rigid thin walled 4-inch brass cylinder.

When water is added to land, either as rain or thru irrigation, a portion of it is drawn into the TABI.K NO. 7. — W right prr Cable Foot Ba.ra Ob Valaca T.kf. fr.— Carre. Average Norman Foot Hastings Norman Holdrcge Bertrand Holdrege Kenesaw -=oil by capillary forces. Another portion may spread over the surface us runoff and immediately a portion is lost thru evaporation. Obviously these amounts vary with each and every factor that affects them, the pnncipale ones being the type of soil and the rapidity with which the water is applied. After the water is in the soil there is always some loss thru direct evaporation, the water escaping as vapor. If there is sufficient water present and no impervious strata in the soil, some' water may penetrate so deeply into the ?oil that it will be beyond recovery by plant root?. Another portion is held within the soil by the forces of capillarity and is, under ordinary conditions, lost largely by being drawn out of the soil by growing vegetation. It is from the water held by capillarity that the plants obtain their supply for making growth. Not all of the capillary water however is available for crop use. As the soil becomes drier a point is reached when the force exerted by the plant to obtain water is no greater than the capillary power of the soil. The amount of water below this point is non - available and is quite frequently spoken of as hygroscopic. These moisture relations of soils are important in the present study and the factors determining them are quite constant for a given type of soil. in the proposed irrigation project three questions concerning wmter relations of the soil are of primary importance. First, — how rapidly will the soil take in water and how effectively can water be spread over a field? Second,— how much water will the soil retain? Third, — how much of the water retained by the soil can be utilized by growing plants? 1 2 i 4 5 &lt; Ive. 73.8 78.6 82.0 78.4 7C.« 77.2 77.8 80.1 83.6 MJ 88.7 81.7 80.0 84.2 84.* 89. t MJ 84.7 82.4 82.C MJ MJ MJ MJ SO. 8 86.6 MJ MJ Bertrand 81.2 MJ MJ 88.7 83.6 81.1 MJ Sl.i I </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF SECRETARY 226 Saturation Plats Studies. In order to determine accurately the water holding capacity of the soils and to note the rate of water absorption, small plats of land were saturated at a number of points. Duplicate plats were established at Hastings College, Ingleside Nor - man, Holdrege and at the Swedish Mission northwest of Hoidrege, and single plats at Bertrand and Kenesaw. These points are satisfac - torily representative of the soils of the area. The plats were constructed by building a dike around them with soil taken from the outside of the* plat. In each case approximately 15 inches of water was added. Where plats were in duplicate one of them was covered with a mulch usually of straw, in order to check rapid surface evaporation. It was thought that the mulched plat would more nearly represent the actual condition from fall irrigation since in the fall and winter the rate of evaporation is relatively low. Composite samples were taken in the immediate vicinity of the plats in order to determine the amount of water already in the soil at the beginning of the test Rate of Water Absorption. The rate at which a ?oil will absorb water is of practical importance under irrigation. It has a direct bearing on the possibility of spreading water over the land. All soils of this project were found to take water at a rate entirely satisfactory for irrigation purposes. The time required for the soil to take in 5 inches of water varied from approximately 40 minutes to a little more than 80 minutes, depending largely on the soil type and the initial dryness. Field Carrying Capacity. The field carrying capacity of a soil Is that water which it will hold after excess gravitational water has percolated away and the water content has come into equilibrium with the capillary forces of the soil. If more water h added above the amount that will be held by capillary forces, it is free, and will move downward by gravity. This condition was obtained by flooding the soil and by mulching to prevent rapid surface evaporation until equilibrium had been obtained. It was planned when the saturation plats were established to sample at the end of 2, 5, 10 and 30 days; however, so much rain occurred during the spring and early summer that it was impossible to follow this plan and rather irregular samplings were obtained. Plats from which the field carrying capacity data were obtained were flooded April 18 and 19 and the sampling on June 25 taken as repre - sentative of the field carrying capacity of the soil. At that time none of the plats had received more than' one inch of rain for a period of ten days, the heaviest being a rain of .82 of an inch on June 22nd at Hastings. In the third and fourth columns of Table 9 is shown the total field carrying capacity of the soil in both percentages and inches of water. </seg>
            <seg id="p229">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WliKKS 227 Hygroscopic Coefficient. The hygroscopic coefficient of a soil is the amount of water that an absolutely dry soil will absorb from a saturated atmosphere. It is not available for plant growth and represents quite closely the lower limit of available moisture. Table 8 shows the relation of the hygroscopic coefficient to field dry ness in fields sampled April 18, 1923 For the three alfalfa fields at least, the crop during; the preceding: fall had probably exhausted the soil mois - ture to the very lowest limit, and as the precipitation during the winter and early spring had been very little, only the upper foot or two had become moist to any degree. The table shows that th« subsoil moisture had been exhausted down to or slightly above, the hygroscopic coefficient. It seems safe therefor in this region to use the hygroscopic coefficient as the lower limit of availability.

Available Water Capacity. The available water of a soil is that portion of the moisture content which can be utilized for plant growth. The available water capacity is obtained by substracting: the hygro - scopic or nonavailable water from the field carrying capacity. The amount of available water a soil will hold is the important factor from a cropping standpoint. The amounts of available water that various soils of this project will hold in each foot section, together with the averages, are shown in the last two columns of Table 9. The available water is shown in both percentages and inches of water. Moisture Equivalent. The labor involved in establishing saturation plats and the difficulty of getting sufficient water for saturation limited the number of such studies. It was desirable, therefor, to use some laboratory method for making studies of the field carrying capacities of soils in other regions than those where the saturation plats were located. For this purpose the moisture equivalent of the soils was used. Table 10 shows the relation by foot sections between the moisture equivalent of a soil and the field carrying capacity, as determine* from samples taken from the mulched saturation plats. This relation - ship is shown for each foot section of soil. It will be noted that the moisture equivalent is always less than the field carrying capacity for the surface foot, but more than the field carrying capacity for the sections of soil below the first foot. The average field carrying capacity for the upper six feet of soil was found to be 91 per cent of the average moisture equivalent of the same samples. While this might not hold for an individual foot section of soil, it does hold within practical limits when the upper six feet are considered. In order to get data on the moisture holding capacity in various parts of the area, samples were taken on representative soil types thruout the whole project. (See Map 1) Moisture equivalent and hygroscopic coefficient were determined on each foot section of these 1 2 a 4 5 6 MJ MJ 91.8 90.8 86.6 84.6 IX. » MJ 12.0 104 ».« ».7 Brrtra*d ■M 24.4 U 21.2 MJ 21.0 4.42 4.87 J.74 3.70 J.48 3.42 17.1 11. » •.X 10.8 ll.l 11.3 I Ive 86.S U.O 23.* 181 11.9 urn </seg>

From these determinations there is shown the calculated field carrying capacity of the soil and the available water capacity in inches for the total six feet. The determinations made thruout the area show that the soils have a uniformly high water holding capacity. The total water capacity in the upper six feet is 22.86 inches. Of this more than half. — 12.28 inches, — would be available for the use of the crop. This is a high available water capacity. It means that on the average TABLE NO.

The Feeding Depth of Crop Plats. It will be noted that the water carrying capacity of the soil was determined for a six foot column of soil. This was done in order to include the root zone for the common farm crops.

The development of plant roots depends upon the character of the soil and plant and moisture conditions during- tl»» growing season. Where sufficient water is not obtained by the plant near the surface most agricultural plants will root more deeply, providing they can find available water in the subsoil. Investigations by Miller, Weaver, Bun-, and others show that the six foot depth represents the practical feeding zone of most of the farm crops in this section and on this type of soil. Alfalfa is an exception as it feeds much more deeply. If the lower subsoil is dry so that the plants can obtain no water from that region the roots will not be extended into it.

Percolation does not take place except when there is free water, which is only present when the amount it greater than the field carrying capacity of the soil. The loss thru direct evaporation may be as high as 3 or 4 per cent, or even higher for the first foot section of soil, but there is very little loss below the first foot It is well recognized that during the winter months the rate of evaporation is relatively low and that the loss is not great. This is borne out by consideration of both Figures 9 an&lt; :c. Figure 9 shows the soil well filled with water at the time o the fall sampling and shows further that there has not been a great loss up to the sampling of April 21, the following year. Figure 10 is a composite or an average of 5 years' results. Taking the las sampling in the fall as showing the maximum accumulation of wate by summer tillage, we find on the average that the soil has been filled with watev to 6 feet. The spring sampling Joes not ihow any loss having occurred during the winter. There was, however, some loss from the first foot and perhaps a little from the second foot. Out of the 5 years, three show a loss of 2 to 4 per cent in the fir - foot and two show a small loss in the second foot. In two of the 5 years spring rains came that completely covered up the loss as shown in the average, it is safe to assume therefore, that on this type of soil there will be very little loss of water during the winter, the greatest loss being in the first foot section. Water can be applied to the land in the fall and carried thru the winter if desirable. Fertility. The question of soil fertility is everywhere of vital importance to crop production. Under irrigation it is especially important because maximum efficiency of water cannot be realized unless the fertility of the soil is maintained.. If the fertility of the land is low, attention must be given to crop rotations, legumes and barnyard manure, in order to obtain the best use of the water. Virgin Soils High in Fertility. A complete study of the fertility of the soils under this particular project has not been made, except - ing on the virgin soils. Of the fertility of the virgin soils of the proposed irrigation area there is no question. Farmers who have lived in the area for years know that the virgin soil is capable of producing big yields of all adapted crops when rainfall is sufficient. Chemical analysis bears out this experience. Table 12 shows the chemical analysis of the soils at Hastings and Holdrege. These analyses are by F. J. Alway, et al. (1) The samples analyzed were composites of ten cores in each of five virgin fields in the vicinity of the two cities mentioned. (See Map 1 for location of Dr. Al way's samples.) The phosphoric acid and potash contents are as high as are found in </seg>
            <seg id="p236">234 any section of the loess region in Nebraska. The lime content is high. Inorganic carbonates, i. e., calcium carbonate, is practically absent in the first two feet of soil at Hastings and in the first foot at Holdiejfe, but the surface soil is not acid, and an abumlance of calcium carbonate is found at both places below the second foot. Liming is not required for the successful growing of legumes any - where in the proposed irrigation area. Table 13 shows the nitrogen content of the virgin soils from representative points in the proposed irrigation area. The organic content has not been determined, but it is roughly twenty times the nitrogen content. With the exception of the soils of the Colby series, the nitrogen content may be considered adequate. The Colby series are generally below the average in nitrogen content.

Fertility of the Cultivated Soils. While the fertility of the virgin soils of this region is ample for a large production, yet not more than ten per cent of the irrigable land is at present in its virgin state, either as meadow or pasture. Ninety per cent of this land has been cultivated for 20 to 50 years and during this period the virgin fertility has been greatly depleted, as is evidenced by the experience of farmers in the region.

Organic matter in addition to being the carrier of soil nitrogen and the food of bacteria that make nitrogen available to plants, has profound physical effects on soil. It makes soil more porous and spongy and makes it take up water readily. It keeps the soil from baking, cracking, and clodding and therefore facilitates the formation of a mulch which conserves water. It provides easy tilth and makes for the most effective work with moisture conserving machinery. It binds the soil together and keeps it from blowing. All these functions are highly important in any region like the proposed area where moisture is a limiting factor in crop production. As organic matter has decreased, the problem of moisture conservation has become more acute, the effectiveness of the rainfall has become less and the general level of yields has declined. Nitrogen is an organic element, the supply of which is closely correlated with the supply of organic matter in the soil. If the nitro- Krprr*entatl«e I l'..i int ta in the Area.

The most means of maintaining both the organic and nitrogen content the soil is thru proper rotation of crops, the growing of legume* and the application of barnyard manure. On account of moisture con - ditions in this section the growing of legumes has met with many discouraging failures and is not widely practiced. Furthermore, the use of manure has frequently resulted in decreased rather than increased yields,— due directly or indirectly to shortage of water. Where the manure is plowed under it often leaves the land so loose that it dries out quicly and furthermore the stimulation due to increased fertility frequently starts more growth than there Is moisture to maintain later in the season. The practices for maintain - ing soil fertility under humid conditions are far from satisfactory under conditions where rainfall is the limiting factor. Under such conditions the problem of the maintenance of soil fertility is still unsolved. With a sufficient water supply as is generally available under irrigation, the maintenance of fertility on a soil inherently productive is not a serious question. With the big problems of water supply removed, adequate systems of rotation including the growing of more leguminous crops and the keeping of more livestock with the con- Bent production of a greater amount of barnyard manure can be y put into effect. Instead of continuously decreasing yields th« land can be brought back a long way toward its virgin fertility. Alkali, In every irrigation area the prospects of alkali sooner or later arising either in irrigated fields or in lower lying adjacent lands thru seepage, must be taken into consideration. Table 14 shows the water soluble constituents in soils from Hastings and Holdregc, tfrom Lincoln, Nebraska, for comparison. These data are by n and Calvin (7) and are on the same samples collected by y. The possibility of alkali developing in irrigated fields of this area seems to be remote; indeed the possibility of alkali developing at Holdi-ege and Hastings would seem from analyses to be even P remote than the development of alkali on the uplands at Lincoln, ermore, water has been draining into and evaporating from the ssional areas or basins in Phelps and Kearney County for , yet no alkali has seemed to accumulate, and salt grass or other indicating vegetation are not found.

They have machinery and imple - ments for cropping systems which run largely to cereals. However the water holding capacity of the soil, the character of the subsoil, and the soil fertility are incl cative that the supplemental water requirement in this area will be rather low for cereal crops, but higher for alfalfa. With favorable distribution the dependable precipitation of the proposed area is sufficient to produce satisfactory yields of corn and spring small grain. Unfavorable distribution, however, frequently causes extreme dryness of the soil early in the planting season that results in delayed germination and thin stands. Furthermore, hot winds and prolonged dry seasons during critical periods, as when corn is tasseling or in the milk, are frequent — in fact a common occurrence. While water in storage in the soil will probably quite satisfactorily meet the requirements of small grain, experience indicates that it it not complete insurance against damage to a corn crop. A small amount of water available at the right time seems to be all that is required for corn and spring sown cereals. Mr. A. Lincoln Fellows, in a detailed report on this project, has recommended 12 inches of supplemental water, as the necessary amount to meet agricultural requirements. While the cereals and corn will seldom if ever require this amount, the full amount WOUld be required for such crops as potatoes and sugar beets and perhaps even more than that amount for alfalfa, making an average of a 12 inch supplemental water requirement. t Effect of Irrigation.. -The question may arise as to what will be the set of irrigation on the agriculture of this area. The effect, of fse, is problematic, depending largely upon the degree of intensity the agriculture that would follow irrigation. It is safe to assume fever, that a more permanent and profitable form of diversified {culture would follow irrigation than is possible without it. I It was mentioned above that the organic content of the soil is be - depleted and that there is a consequent decline in yields. Organic ster, while not itself a plant food, is essential to proper soil con - ons. A sufficient supply of organic matter makes the soil more ?ptive of water from rains and makes all tillage operations ier. It is the greatest factor in the fertility and management of soil. The lower yields and increased labor co-incident with the letion Of the organic content of the soil have made farming less I less profitable.

While theie is no question as to the permancy of some form of agriculture in this section, it is evident that a far greater development can be brought about with additional water. Mr. Fellows suggests that production in general should be doubled in tie district by the application of direct flow water to the extent of supplying the entire root zone, once annually, with the full field carrying capacity of water. Summary. In summary, we found that the soils of this area have a high water carrying capacity, not only in total water, but in the water available for crop growth. The soils run remarkably uniform in pro - file. There is nothing in the soil profile to interfere with water penetration and with its recovery thru the development of the plant roots. The rate of penetration is satisfactory on all of the soils and unless water is applied very rapidly there should be little loss thru runoff. There is nothing in the soil profile to indicate that there wil be much, if any, lateral seepage, as frequently occurs in soils tha have an impervious layer not far distant from the surface. Drainage problems therefore, will be confined largely to those originating from surface water. There is no evidence that alkali formation will ever become a problem in this area. The surface soils are generally o: friable nature and easily tilled and experience has shown that in their present state of fertility they are capable of producing large crop when there is sufficient available moisture and climatic conditions in general are favorable.

            <seg id="p243">DEPARTMENT OF PCBLIC WORKS 241 ORIGIN OF SAND HILL LAKES By O. E. CONDRA Director of Conservation A Survey Division, The University of Nebraska The sandhill lakes of Nebraska are causing much speculation regarding: their origin and fluctuation in depth and in area. The ranchmen are deeply concerned. Those interested in fishing, duck - shooting, and trapping are asking about the future of the habitats of the animals on which these activities are based, and the irrigation farmers along the North Platte especially, believe that the lakes have some relation to the return flow of the river. The Conservation and Survey Division of the University has studied and mapped more than one thousand sand hill lakes during the past fifteen years, and other studies of the lakes began at an earlier date. Inquiry has been made of ranchmen who lived in the region since the Texas trail days, so considerable information is available upon which to base the conclusion reached in this paper. The lakes change markedly in area and depth. They invade hay flats and grazing land. Most of them are bordered in whole or in part by marsh areas. Trails, hay producing and grazing areas shift posi - tion with the appearance and disappearance of the lakes. There an a good many fishing lakes where hay was produced; duck ponds occur where potatoes were grown, muskrat houses and fences stand in water which has invaded dry land. This change has affected the economics of the sand hills. Popular Assumptions Several theories have been advanced to account for the lakes and their appearance and growth during the past few years. Some of these theories are based on faulty observation. About all they do is correlate some phenomenon with an observation made at the lake*. A good may people suppose that irrigation in the North Platte Val - ley is in some way the cause. Some of them think that irrigation has caused an increase in rainfall, and others believe that the Pathfinder Dam, big canals, and the storage reservoirs of Scottsbluff County had some effect. A study of the rainfall data shows that there has been no appreciable change in precipitation since the installation of irriga - tion in the North Platte Valley; also, irrigation cannot have a direct bearing on the lake problem because the Pathfinder Dam is built be - tween granite walls from which there is very little leakage. The water being released from the reservoir flows on the bed of the Platte to near Nebraska where it is diverted through canals and reservoirs which are at a lower elevation than those parts of the sandhills which which would receive intake from the irrigation water.

            <seg id="p244">242 RETORT OF SECRETARY noted also that a comparatively impervious formation, the Brule clay, forms the lower sides and slopes of the North Platte Valley and that it holds the irrigation water within the valley, i. e., the water of the canals and reservoirs cannot escape to the sandhills. In fact, the water tables slope from the hills to the valley and determine the direc - tion of undeflow. It has been claimed that the lakes are fed by shallow underflow rthe mountains, and with more water than formerly. There is of foundation for such claim so far as it pertains to the shallow water of the sand hills. The Brule clay and other impervious layers are exposed in the valleys both north and south of the sand hills and their outcrop areas join in Wyoming west of the sand hills, which means that the surface run-off west of the sand hills is directed to - wards tl.c Piatte, Niobrara, ami Cheyenne valleys, as is also the com - paratively shallow underflow. Only small, high-lying table land drainage is tributary to the sand hills and most of this is by Snake Creek of Box Butte county. It has been claimed too that the sand hill lakes are fed from deepseated sources, i. e., from water originating in the mountains. Three things seem to discredit this claim. First, the sandhills and the Tertiary beds below them are underlain throughout by impervious shale formations which prevent the upward movement of water from the older beds. Second, there is not enough pressure to force the water to this height, third, the composition of the lake and shallow ground water is different from that in the deeper horizons. It is observed, however, that the shallow flowing wells in the lake region tap the Tertiary beds which overlie the shale formations. A few poorly informed oil and gas promoters have claimed that the new lakes were caused by heavy pressure of gas below. This has gained some credence among the ranchmen, especially where scum resembling oil is observed on the seepage sides of the lakes. A little thought concerning the nature of oil, gas and water and their mode of occurrence will serve to show the fallacy of this claim. Gas escapes through water and does not press it to the surface as lakes. Then too, the problem is to account for the water in the lakes. So far »s the scum in concerned, it differs from oil in chemical composition. All told, the above named suppositions, postulations or theories are not very satisfactory. They are weak on the fact side and we are forced w&gt; look for a technical explanation of the lake phenomena which will relate to climatic, drainage and ground water conditions as they actually maintain in the region. Physical Conditions The general surface of the Sandhill Region stands quite high above the Platte and Niobrara valley bottoms. Sandhills proper oc- </seg>

At most places much of the soil and upper part of the bedrock is formed of loose-textured sandy materials extending; to a depth of 100 to 500 feet. Next below are formations of silty clay and shale, the upper part of which is near or above the elevation of the Platte and Niobrara floors. The region is saturated or nearly filled with ground water above the clay-shale beds. This saturation is broken in its lower part by relatively im - pervious layers, making zones of ground water having enough pres - sure at places for flowing wells. Above this, however, is the general water table which comes to the surface in many basins and valleys. tThe water table has considerable relief. Its contour is somewhat that of the topography of the region but flatter. The general ! is eastward and southward but with many steeper gradient? rd the lakes and drainage ways. The surface drainageways of country are poorly defined. They have been nearly obliterated laces by drifting sands. Parts of the valleys have been choked or ned with these sands, leaving stretches with live streams and rflow, but the main drainage valleys have remained open. The e of the drainage pattern has been obliterated at some points. ■e are areas of considerable size where all the dainage is under- Origin of Ground Water and Lakes. The topographic position and the structural relations cited above show that the primary source of this water cannot be from deep - seated sources, from irrigation systems, or from shallow underflow ori - ginating in the mountains, A small amount of it drains to the hills from table lands of Box Butte and north eastern Sheridan county and is lost to the underflow. There are many small drainages like these, but they can account for only a fractional part of the water in the region. In fact, many times this amount is being lost to drainage from the region. So, from the physical nature of the region and as a matter of observation, there is only one primary source of water supply — the rainfall. The sand hill region is a broad and comparatively deep ground water storage area underlain by thick impervious beds. The rainfall is nearly all absorbed at once by the sandy soil and loose bed rock next below. The underlying impervious layers prevent the loss of water to deep-seated formations. Most of the water is stored in the ground and not on the surface of the land. It is being lost to streams, also generally by evaporation as on hay flats and lakes especially. Loss of water from storage is continuous and somewhat variable in quantity although the frequency and distribution of the rainfall is rather irregular. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLJC WORKS 245 The rainfall finds its way to the ground water storage. The water table thus becomes more elevated ai times of heavy or protracted rainfall. Then during the weeks and months following there is a slow adjustment or flatting of the water table. The general water level of the sand hill region changes little, but in relatively small areas it fluctuates twenty feet or more after a period of heavy rain - fall as at Haney Lake northeast of Hyannis. In places where there is no outward surface drainage, lakes of considerable size are formed, especially where water drains to them from large hay flats. In gen - eral, however, the elevation of the lakes and of the water table is limited by natural drainage or by artificial drainage. Elsewhere it is determined by a slow adjustment between rainfall, underflow and evaporation. The lakes vary much in shape, size and stage of development, depending upon the nature of the surface on which they are formed and upon the fluctuations in elevation of the water table. They expand rapidly on hay flats, but become deep and bordered by steep slopes where formed in basins. So they are changing all the time— from new to old stages or towards their disappearance in which for a time at least only a dry basin is left subject to wind erosion. Furthermore, these changes affect the plant and animal life of the lakes, also the economic relations. The lakes do not all rise and fall at the same time and at the same rate throughout the region. Those of one area may rise and expand while those of another may drop and contract. The direct and most noticeable cause of this is the unevenness of rainfall, but the structural, topographic and drainage conditions are the most impor - tant factors and would require too much space to explain in this paper. Although the lakes as a whole have during the past four or five, years reached their highest known stage, a period of recession probably has set in at least in some areas. If history repeats itself, we may expect them to go through cycles of water stage elevation in the future, and through other corresponding changes as in the past, unless artificially controlled. This is the third time since the early settlement in Nebraska in which the lakes of the sand hills have developed marked features. Although most of the sand hill lakes are largely developed from ground water, those surrounded by heavier soil and fairly hard land receive a considerable amount of surface run-off. For example, the Robert Graham lake of Horrill County was greatly enlarged in this way after a single heavy rain fall in 1919. Later ,it was further en - larged from the ground water, after which it has decreased some - what in area. </seg>
            <seg id="p248">REPORT OF SECRETARY 246 Relation to Run-off and Irrigation Streams heading in the sandhills have a very uniform flow com - pared with those on hard lands. There is some variation with sea - sons and it has been observed that the small streams carrying water from the areas at or near the lakes may have become a little larger the past few years. Blue, Ash, Birdwood, Pine and many other creeks are among those which seem to show a higher stage at this time. The change in the streams, if there is such, has resulted from the in - creased gradients of the water table, but probably should not be regarded as permanent because the run-off should fluctuate between the mean and maximum. Some of the water used in irrigating the broad benches and slope land of the North Platte Valley has percolated through the soil and subsoil to the saturated zone and thus contributed to the elevation of the water table under those areas. This has been manifest by the development of seepage along the edge of the flood plain proper and along the small tributaries. It is the source of the return water proper. Although this return water has resulted from irrigation, there are places from Morrill County eastward in which it has been aug - mented to some extent by the increased discharge of the sandhill streams and through underflow from the sandhills as described above. To evaluate the amount of return water proper and what has increased from the sandhill sources along this lower course of the North Platte will call for further investigation. Conservation Problems. The more permanent lakes are bordered more or less by marsh - land vegetation. They also have the lower forms of plant and animal life that serve well as fish and game feed. They form a good habitat for muskrats and have more importance than the less permanent lakes for hunting. To further determine the possibilities of the principal sandhill lakes and what means and methods should be used to hold them to th-? desired stages, to decide which of them can and should be drained in order to use the land for agriculture, and to work out a plan for the utilizations of them for other purposes is a very big conservation problem. This will require much additional investigation and Study. </seg>

The Guernsey Dam is one of the features of the North Platt* Project which has been under consideration for over twenty years. It was one of the important items which were investigated at the initiation of the North Platte Project in 1903 in connection with the Goshen Hole Division of this project. Then it was intended to function as a diversion dam for the so-called Highline Canal which it was proposed should divert from the North Platte River in The Narrows about one mile above the Town of Guernsey. The earlier preliminary surveys showed that this portion of the project would have to give preference in point of time to more acceptable proposi - tions such as the Interstate Division and later to the Fort Laramie and Northport Districts. In 1910 the Board of Army Engineers made a careful study of the possible project extensions, particularly with reference to further development on the south side of the river. Preliminary surveys were under way at the time this Board made its inspection trip and after carefully viewing the topography and soil conditions, the location of the canal, and the various construction features connected therewith, the Board recommended strongly that the Fort Laramie division should be given preference to the proposed Highline Canal in point of time. The question of the sufficiency of the water supply for this Highline Division was also a serious desideratum, and it was recommended that this feature be given further study and determination before under - taking the construction of the Fort Laramie Division. Altogether, the reasons were compelling; for the postponement of the Guernsey Dam at that time. In later years, it developed that the diversion duty on the Interstate Canal was such as to cause apprehen - sion and it was decided that the building of the Guernsey Dam as a storage feature presented a problem that would have to be met sooner or later. In addition, there are as yet a number of private canals which are not protected by any supplemental storage and the time may arrive when it will be necessary to provide for these to avoid shortage and crop losses. It is also known that there occurs occasionally a succession 01 short run-off years when the storage will be entirely depleted an&lt; consequent shortages and crop losses may result. At any rate, the provision for further storage appears to be a needful measure to take care of such contingencies as will doubtless arise in the future in connection with the further development of the irrigation interests in the valley. Primarily the Guernsey Dam is a storage feature. For this pur - pose, it is strategically located in a narrow canyon about two miles above the Town of Guernsey.

It has been estimated that a combination might possibly result in a total overflow of ximately 100,000 second feet. The storage capacity of this reservoir is estimated at about 70,000 acre feet. This represents only a part of the annual savings that may be effected by this reservoir because of its strategic location which enables it to serve as an equalizing reservoir and, as such, it may be filled twice or more in any year depending upon seasonal conditions. In connection with the storage feature, it has always been plannea to develop such power facilities as the situation may offer and justify. No definite figures can be given at this writing concerning the size of this power installation more than to state that it is planned to supply the neighboring towns of Guernsey, Wheatland, Fort Laramie, as well as Hartville and Sunrise and the C.

Power service has also been furnished for the past three years to the several valley towns east of Lingle, Wyoming, down to and including Mitchell, Nebraska. It is proposed to inter - connect this plant with the Lingle plant of the Reclamation Bureau whereby suitable exchange service may be established and the effi - ciency of both plants thereby greatly increased. For example, the water passing the Guernsey Dam through the entire summer season will carry whatever load may be developed in the vicinity of both ".he Linerle and Guernsey plants, thereby making it unnecessary during such part of the year to draw upon the Lingle plant, thereby utilizing the entire canal flow for irrigation during such period. Con - versely, during the winter months when the flow is necessarily low, l*)th plants may be operated and thereby their combined capacity </seg>

Such lease shall be upon forms prepared by the department and the time of such lease shall not run for a greater period than fifty years, and for the use of water for power purposes, the applicant shall pay into the State Treasurer, on or before the first day of January each year Ten ($10.00) Dollars for each one hundred horse power for all water so appropriated. A failure to comply with any of the pro - visions of such lease and the failure to pay any of the fees herein specified, the Department of Public Works, shall cancel such lease and such appropriation. Upon the expiration of any lease, the value of improvements made thereunder by any lessee shall be appraised by the Department. From such appraisement the lessee shall have right of appeal to the district court The value of said im - provements as finally determined shall be paid to the lessee owning them by any subsequent lessee. Practically all applications, filed during the past two years, were for permits to appropriate the waters of the Big Blue River. Projects between Beatrice and the Kansas State Line have all been completed, and the only feasible improvement left on that portion of the river is the dredging of channel below plants now in opera - tion, applications for which were filed in the Department by the owners of plants where this type of improvements is feasible.

            <seg id="p350">REPORT OP SECRETARY 348 STATE EX REL CLARKS, v. GERING IRRIGATION DISTRICT Opinion filed February 15, 1923. No. 23028. * 1. An irrigation district is a public corporation; its funds are derived from the taxation of all land within the district, and the main purpose of its organization is to furnish water for the purpose of irri - gation to all the land owners within the district upon fair and equi - table terms and conditions. 2. Lateral ditches are often necessary portions of the irrigation works of an irrigation district, and, where necessary, should be provided, maintained and supervised by the district, in order that a just appor - tionment of water to each land owner may be made. t3. Owners of land within the district may provide and control laterals themselves, if the district fail to do so, and they car. e among themselves as to the proper upkeep of the laterals JUlf1 equitable division of the water. (i. If, in the case of such a lateral constructed by the land-owners, ; not kept in repair, and contentions arise between such land ire, some receiving more water from the lateral than their just », and others little or no water, when entitled to the same, the owners who are deprived of water may, by writ of mandamus, tel the directors of the irrigation district to take such steps as to ide them with their just share of the water and to supervise distribution of the same. L Heard before Morrissey, C. J. Letton, Flansburg, Dean and ich, J. J. Troup and Raper, District Judges. LETTON, J. The relators are land owners living within the boundaries of the Gering Irrigation District. Their land is situated toward the lower end of a lateral, known as Lateral No. 2, and deriving its supply of water from the main canal belonging to the district. The lateral is about three or four miles long. The lateral was not constructed by the irri - gation district, but by the land owners whose lands it was designed to water. For a number of years the land owners toward the lower end of the lateral have been unable to obtain their porper share of the water taken from the main canal. The upper water-users took so much of the water in times of scarcity that little or none could be had near the lower end of the lateral. They also had trouble during a number of years, both with regard to washouts, when there was an excessive flow in the main canal, and scarcity of water, causing loss of crops in some seasons. A number of years ago the owners of lands toward the lower end of the lateral took steps to form a corporation </seg>
            <seg id="p351">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 349 and to take over and control this lateral, but the effort proved abor - tive and the troubles have continued. Relators have demanded relief from the directors of the irrigation district, asking that the district take over and control the distribution of water along the lateral, bat this request was refused. They thereupon brought this proceeding in mandamus, for the purpose of compelling: the board of directors of the district to make immediate provision for the repair and enlarge - ment of lateral No. 2, so as to render its capacity sufficient to furn - ish them their pro rata share of the water, and to require the district, through its superintendent, to supervise and measure the distribution of water through the outlets of the lateral, so that *ach water-user should receive his pro rata share. The respondents ueny that the lateral is any part of the irriga - tion works of the district. They admit that the district has never attempted to maintain or keep the lateral in repair, or supervise or control it; they allege that Highland Lateral Co. No. Z, is the owner of the lateral; that the plan of organization adopted by the district does not include the construction or repairs of any lateral, but only the delivery of water at the bank of its main canal; that it is not required to deliver water to the respective landowners, but complies with the law by delivering water from the main canal at the bank into the laterals, and that no provision has ever been made for delivering water at any other place; that eai:h land owner has built ami maintained the necessary laterals for the conveyance of water from the main canal to his individual lands, and that rela - tors and their predecessors in ownership have for more than 20 years acquiesced in their said plan; that the district has exhausted its tax lovy and has no funds with which to perform, and no law authorizing the raising of funds for such a purpose. The farts alleged in the petition as to the condition of the lateral and the deprivation of water supply to relators are un&lt;t : sputaoiy es - tablihed, an. I in fact, not seriously controverted by respondent*. Since the &lt;efen*en made are legal in their nature, it becomes necessary to examine the statute to ascertain tne duties and .jowers of the dire.tois of an irrigation district, and the riirht* of the land owners in the disiirct with respect to the distribution and apportion - ment of water. Is the lateral a part of the irrigation works of the district, and dose the fact that the district has never construed a lateral excuse its failure to furnish water to residents? Section 2865, Comp. St. 1922, makes it the duty of the directors of irrigation districts "to make all necessary arrangements for right of way fot laterals from the main canal to each tract of land subject to assessment, and when necessary the board shall exercise its rights of eminent domain </seg>
            <seg id="p352">350 REPORT OP SECRETARY to procure right of way for the lateral and shall make such rules in regard to the payment for such right of way as may be just and equit - able." This evidently contemplates that the district shall procure the right of way for the necessary laterals "to each tract of land subject to assessment.'' That the district has not heretofore furnished water except at head grates upon it main canal is no defense. The fact that it has neglected a plain duty for many years is no reason why it should continue to neglect it That the plan of the district did not contemplate the construction of laterals is also no defense. If the plan was defective and failed to accomplish the statutory duty of the district to furnish water to each land owner in the district, in Section 2866 it is provided; "The board, its agents and employees, shalll have the right to enter upon any land within the district, to make surveys any may locate the line of any canal or canals and the necessary branches." This language presumes the necessity of surveys and the location of canals and necessary branches after the formation of the district, and assumes that "branches" or laterals may be necessary to carry out the purpose of the organization. I By Section 2865 it is made the duty of the board to "establish [table by-laws, rules and regulations for the distribution and use nater among the owners of said lands, and generally to perform such acts as shall be necessary to fully carry out the purpose of article." This section further provides that water shall be appor - ed ratably to each land owner upon the basis of the ratio which the assessment of said owner for district purposes bean to the whole i assessed by the district An irrigation district is a public corporation. Its funds are derived from the taxation of all land within the district. The very purpose of its organization is to furnish water upon fair and equitable terms and conditions to each and every landowner within the district Comp. St. 1922 Sees. 2857-2946. This, in the case of some small districts, may perhaps be done by supplying water direct to land - owners from the banks of one canal. But this can seldom be done in districts embracing many acres. In such cases there must be laterals to carry the water to the ultimate user. Such laterals are necessary portions of the irrigation works and should be provided, maintained and supervised by the district, so that a just and apportion - ment of the water may be supplied to each land owner therein. It would be manifestly unjust and unfair to assess a land owner whose property is situated several miles from the main canal without pro - viding him reasonable facilities to obtain the -water for the furnishing of which he is taxed. To sustain the position of the respondents would be to hold that the owners of land adjacent to the main canal are entitled to receive water without further initial outlay, while at the same time other land owner?, who are also taxed according to </seg>
            <seg id="p353">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 351 valuation, shall be compelled to build and maintain expensive works and furnish supervision for such works in order to obtain that which is supplied without such expense to others who have no greater right. This would be clearly inequitable, unfair and unjust, and such con - struction of the statute aught not to be adopted. Of course land owners may provide their own laterals if they desire, bat where there is more than one water-user taking water from the same lateral, and any dispute arises between the users, the district board should regulate the supply, as in the case of other users of water. Water is as essential to successful and profitable agriculture in arid regions as blood is to the body, and its distribution is as necessary to raeh pursuit as the circulation of the blood is to animal tissue. The statute, both by express direction and by implication, provides that all powers reasonably necessary to carry into effect the object and purpose of the organization, are possessed by the board of directors. That the petition does not show that the district has sufficient funds on hand which can be utilized for the purpose of repairing the lateral, is not a sufficient defense under the circumstances proved in this case. The evidence shows that, upon several occasions during the years in which there has been trouble over the water in the lateral, the presence of a ditch-rider who could and would control the quantity of water withdrawn from the lateral by the upper owners would have allowed the water to which the lower owners were entitled to flow - to their lands. Furthermore, the writ did not compel instantaneous action, but only required the board of directors to make provision for the repair and enlargement of the lateral and for its supervision in the future. The refusal to perform the duties requested was never placed by the directors on the ground that they had no funds with which to perform, but their refusal has always been upon the ground that the district had no authority to construct, maintain and supervise the laterals, their duty ending with the opening of a head-gate upon the main canal; and this is the real and substantial issue in this ease. The respondents argue that Section 8462, Comp. St. 1922, provides: "Any owner or person in control of any ditch for irrigation purposes shall construct necessary outlets in the banks for the delivery of water to all persons who are entitled to the same," and that this is the measure of their duty. This section is no part of the irrigation district act, and does not effect the duty of the district to furnish water. If applicable at all, it only prescribes upon whom the duty to construct outlets rests. Similar questions as to the rights of water-users, have bean presented to the supreme courts of California, Utah, and Idaho, and they have taken the same view. Jenison v.

Booker, Neary Corpeney, and Arthur Sollers, were legal electors and qualified to vote at said election. The Court further finds that Harry Miles, Newton, McKim, Mrs. William Harkness and Martha Harkness, Alta Peckham and William Sollers, were not qualified electors of said district and were not entitled to vote thereat, and that said persons all voted for the issuance of said bonds, but that the said illegal votes cast did not change the result of said election. The Court further finds upon the other issues joined between the petitioners and the objectors, generally for the objectors and against the petitioners. The Court especially finds that the purpose of the organization of said district was to purchase the canal works, rights, and franchises of a concern known as the Gothenburg South Side Irrigation Canal which included its water appropriation of 357 14-100 cubic feet per second of time, with priority dated September 26, 1894, and to build a canal to carry the water to be obtained from and under said alleged water right. The Court further finds that at the bond election the $408,000.00 Irrigation D'strict Bonds were voted for the purpose of purchasing the works of the Gothenburg South Side Irrigating Canal including its canal, franchises, water appropriation, and property, which was to be obtained by purchase and constructing a canal which should try the water obtained by, through, and under said appropriation the lands included in said Irrigation District. I The Court further finds that it was represented to said electors and before said election, that said water right was a valid water fit, and had a priority dated September 26, 1894, and was for 357 I 14-100 cubic feet per second of time. tThe Court further finds that at the time of said election that electors voting for said water right, relied upon said reports and ved that said water right was a valid and subsisting water t, having a priority of September 26, 1894, and was for 35? </seg>

That they relied upon said representations and many of them would not have voted for said bonds had they known that said water right had been abandoned, and that they acquired no rights thereunder. ■ The Court further finds that said report was untrue, and mis - leading, that at the time said district was organized and at the time of said bond election when said bonds were voted, said water right was dead, and of no force and effect, and said canal and water right had been abandoned for many years prior to said election. The Court further finds that said purported water right was sold by A. G. Wolfenbarger, to another person for which no consideration was paid, and that if said water right was a valid and subsisting right it would be worth thousands of dollars The Court further finds that said Irrigation District has, at this time, no water right, and that there is no un-appropriated water in the river, except flood waters, and the Court is loath under this state of facts to validate these bonds, and impose the enormous debt of $408,000.00 upon said district when it is shown that said bonds were voted under a misapprehension of the facts and upon a reliance of" the representations made that the said water right to be purchased was a valid and substisting right for 357 and 14-100 cubic feet per second of time of water, with a priority of September 26, 1894. It is argued with much force that this Court has no jurisdiction in the matter to determine whether or not said water right is a valid and subsisting water right, but the Court finds that under the Statutes auhorizing these proceedings it is authorized to investigate and decide any question touching the validity of said bonds.

            <seg id="p358">356 REPORT OF SECRETARY ■ RE APP. FOR PERMIT TO APPROPRIATE AND STORE WATERS. CITY OF CHADRON v. CARD. Opinion filed January 13, 1922. No. 21965. Lower riparian proprietors who knowingly, without objection or protest, permit a city to adopt plans, to vote bonds, to let con - tracts, to create indebtedness, and to expend money in an effort to increase the municipal water-supply from unappropriated waters ot a stream, may be estopped to object to the granting of permission to use such waters. Heard before Morrissey, C. J., Aldrich and Rose, JJ., and Hobart and Paine, District Judges. ROSE, J. This is a proceeding before the State Department of Public Works, Bureau of Irrigation, Water-Power and Drainage. The city of Chadron is the applicant and is seeking permission to increase its water-supply. It installed a system of water-works in 1892, and has since kept the plant in operation, using water from Chadron Creek. Owing to the growth of the city of Chadron an increase in the supply of water for public and private uses is imperatively demanded. To this end additional water-works are in course of construction or have been installed. The present application, as indicated by the prayer, is for a permit. "To impound and apply to such uses all unappropriated waters flowing in said stream, and all storm and flood waters, and all seepage, subterranean, underground and percolated waters, sub - ject to the disposition of the state, in the said valley of the Chadron creek, and to impound any and all waters not otherwise appro - priated." Some of the lower riparian proprietors are defendants. They filed objections to the issuing of the permit on the ground that under it, if granted, the city of Chadron would interfere with their water rights. A reply to the objections contains a plea ol estoppel, to the effect that defendants, with knowledge of the facts, without objection or protest, sat quietly by and permitted the city, in furtherance of its purpose to improve its water-works and increase its water-supply, to pass ordinances, to adopt plans, to vote bonds, to let contracts, to create indebtedness, and to expend money. Upon a trail of the issues the proceeding was dismissed, and the city has appealed. IThe estoppel pleaded by the city is conclusively established by evidence and prevents defendants from successfully interposing </seg>

REVERSED. IN RE APP. BLACK BROTHERS FLOUR MILLS. BLACK BROTHERS FLOUR MILLS V. UMPHENHOUR. Opinion Filed November 26, 1923. No. 23487. 1. In an application by a riparian owner to the Department oi Public Works, for the sole purpose of procuring a record of a prior appropriation of water, that department has no power or jurisdic - tion to determine the height to which the applicant may erect and maintain a dam across the stream from which the appropriation was acquired. 2. If the Department of Public Works has no jurisdiction to pass upon a question submitted to it, an appeal from their decision does not confer jurisdiction on this court to determine such question. Heard before Morrissey, C. J. Letton, Rose Dean, Day and Good, J. J., Shepehrd, District Judge. DAY, J. On November 4, 1922, Black Brothers Flour Mills, a corporation, hereinafter called "applicant" instituted this proceeding before the Department of Public Works for the purpose of securing a formal adjudication of its claim to use, for milling and power purposes, all the waters flowing in the Big Blue river at a designated point, being in block 68 of the original townsite of the city of Beatrice. The purpose of the application was not to secure a new appropriation of water, but rather to have a public record made by the Department of Public Works of the applicant's prior right of appropriation. The applicant claimed a priority of appropriation of 350 cubic feet of water per second for milling and power purposes by virtue of a special act of the territorial legislature of Nebraska passed January 11, 1860, giving a perpetual and exclusive right to applicant's pre - decessors in interest to keep a mill dam across the river at that point, not to exceed, when finished, 12 feet in height, and by having </seg>
            <seg id="p360">358 used the water for a beneficial purpose for many years; and by prescription. Notice was given by the Department of Public Works to all persons interested in water appropriations from the Big Blue river and its tributaries, to appear on a day certain to protect their rights and to submit evidence in support of and adverse to the adjudication of the water right claimed by the applicant. But one appropriator of water appeared, and it waived all objections to the allowance of the appropriation claimed by applicant. A large number of persons, property owners in the city of Beatrice, residing below the dam, and a few riparian owners residing above the dam, appeared and filed objections to the construction and maintenance of a dam 12 feet high at the location in question. In substance the objectors urged that the applicant had maintained a dam approximately 9 feet high for a period of years; that a few weeks prior to the commencement of this proceeding the applicant had increased the height of the dam to 12 feet; that prior to the increase the applicant had never owned, possessed, or used the right to flow water of a depth of more than 9 feet above low water level in said river; that it is unsafe, danger - ous and threatening to the safety of life and property to have the said dam built and maintained to a height of more than 9 feet; that by reason of the course of the river and the slope of the land a permanent dam 12 feet high would, especially in times of high water, subject their property to great damage from overflow. At the outset of the hearing the secretary of the department before whom the testimony was taken announced that the question of damages to the objectors could not be considered or determined by the department, but that testimony would be heard to show the amount of water the applicant and its predecessors had used, the head which had been maintained, and the different dates that the head had been raised or lowered. At the conclusion of the hearing the depart - ment determined that the applicant had the priority of use of all of the water in the river at the location in question, being approximately 300 cubic feet per second, sometimes more and sometimes less, for milling and power purposes; that applicant's priority to the use of the water was based on an act of the territorial legislature passed January 11, 1860; that applicant's predecessors in interest had erected a milldam at the place in question soon after the right was granted, and ever since have maintained a dam at the location in question at various heights, and have used the water for milling and power pur - poses; that prior to July, 1895, the date on which the irrigation law of the state became effective, the applicant's predecessors had not erected a dam higher than 9 feet and 6 inches above tail-water; that the applicant's right to priority in the nse of all of the water was limited under a head of 9 feet and 6 inches.

T&gt;T*TJT T C lUnDITQ It was evidently the theory of the department that the applicant's rights were limited to the height of the dam built by its predecessors prior to July, 1895, which the department found to be 9 feet and 6 inches above tail-water. It is not clear whether this was based upon the ideas that the dam was "finished" within the meaning of that term as used in the act of January 11, 1860. or whether after July, 1895, their rights should be determined by the law as it stood on and after that date. The record shows that on January 11, 1860, the legislature of the territory of Nebraska passed an act granting authority to J. B Weston, his heirs and assigns, to erect and establish a dam across the Big Blue river at the location now in question, and that the applicant succeeded to that right. The act granted a 'perpetual and exclusive right to keep a milldam across said stream at the place designated; • * * Provided, said dam when finished shall not exceed twelve feet in height above low water mark, so as to propel mills or any other machinery that J. B. Weston, his heirs or assigns, may want to erect." Laws 1860, p. 202. In 1895 the legislature of the state passed an act embodying a comprehensive scheme regulating the appropriation and distribution of the waters in running rivers and streams of the state, and placed the administration of the law in the hands of a board of irrigation. By subsequent legislation the adminis - tration of the law was placed under the control of the Department of Public Works. The act became effective April 4, 1895, instead of July, 1895, as found by the board. The act of 1895 covers many printed pages, and it is not practical to give an epitome of its provisions. Among other things, it declared: "The water of every natural stream not heretofore appropriated * * * is hereby declared to be the property of the public, and is dedicated to the use of. the people of the state, subject to appropriation as heretofore pro - vided." Laws 1895, ch. 69, Sec. 42. The act of 1895 also contained a provision, now Section 8411, Comp. St. 1922: "Nothing in this article contained shall be so construed as to interfere with or impair the rights of water appro - priated and acquired prior to the fourth day of April, 1895." It appears that, soon after the passage of the act of 1860, the applicant's predecessors in interest constructed a dam across the river at the location in question, erected a mill, and ever since, except at short intervals occasioned by washouts and fire, have maintained the dam and operated a mill. The first dam constructed was very crude as compared with modern methods of construction, and consisted mostly of brush. It was about 2 feet high. From time to time, as needs required, the dam was heightened and rebuilt with stronger and better materials, until in 1895 it was a concrete construction which with "flash-boards" was approximately 9 feet and </seg>
            <seg id="p362">REPORT OF SECRETARY 360 6 inches high. A short time before this action was instituted the height was increased to approximately 12 feet. tFrom the express provision of the act of 1895 it appears that ■as not the intention of the legislature to in any way interfere prior acquired rights. It was the intention, however, to ascer - the extent of prior appropriations, and to make a public record ie same in order to carry out the provisions of the law respecting equent appropriations. The department very properly found that the applicant and its predecessors had appropriated all of the water in the river at the point designated prior to the act of 1895. The correctness of this finding is not seriously questioned by the objectors. The main contention relates to the height of the dam. A number of questions are presented in the briefs which we do not deem necessary to Upon the oral argument the point was urged by the applicant that the department had no authority to pass upon the height of the dam; that its authority was limited to a determination of the amount of the appropriation to which the applicant was entitled; and the priority of use. Commencing on an early day in the history of our territorial legislation, an act was passed January 10, 1862, which authorized abutting property owners upon streams to construct dams for milling and machinery purposes, and prescribed the method to be pursued in assessing damages to adjacent property owners by the overflow. This act with some modifications has been continued to the present time, and is now Section 3377, Comp. St. 1922. In 1911 there was added to this act as it then stood a proviso to the effect that before proceedings could be commenced permission should be obtained from the board of irrigation (now the Department of Public Works) to use the water for such purpose. While it was within the province of the department under this application to determine the amount of water which the applicant was entitled to use by virtue of the prior appropriation, we do not think that, under the circum - stances presented by the record, the height of the dam was a matter f«.r the department's determination. This was not an application for permission to build the dam. No plans were submitted to the depart - ment for its approval. The amount of appropriation was the only question at issue. In this discussion we are not unmindful of Section 8446, Comp. St. 1922, requiring plans for proposed dams to be submitted to the department for approval before construction of a dam is commenced. The provisions of this statute, however, do not apply to the proceed - ings submitted to the department for determination. </seg>

The judgment of the department, in so far as it determined the amount of water the applicant is entitled to use and the date of ita priority, is affirmed. That part of the judgment regulating the height of the dam is reversed upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction. AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART. IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF DUNDY COL NTY.NEBRASKA.

State of Nebraska Contestant, vs. Delaware-Hickman Ditch, Contestee. Now on this 8th clay of February, 1923, this case coming on to b* heard upon its regular order upon the docket, was submitted to the court upon the transcript of the files before the Department of Public Works, .and the evidence, it beinp stipulated that the trans - script of the evidence taken before the Department of Public Works should be considered by the court, together with such additional evi - dence as either party may desire to offer. After the evidence was submitted it was agreed by the parties hereto that the presiding judge should view the irrigation works and grounds in question, and that the case should be submitted on the written briefs and argu - ments of counsel. Thereupon, the works and grounds in question were, on the same day, viewed and examined by the presiding judge In company with counsel for both parties. There was considerable delay in the submission of briefs, so that the record and the last of the briefs were not received by the court until the convening of this present term. Now, on this 5th day of June, 1924, the same being one of the days of the regular May, 1924, term of the District Court of this county the court being now fully advised in the premises, proceeds with the consideration and determination of said case. While it has been urged by counsel for contestee that the reports of the Water Commissioner, upon which the notice to show cause was evidently based, are not sufficient in substance to give the board jurisdiction or authority to issue the order or cancel the water right, and there is possibly some merit in such contention, but proceeding to considera - tion of the case upon its merits, the court finds from the evidence and the observations made at the examination of the works and </seg>

            <seg id="p365">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 363 Heard before Letton, Rose, Redick, District Judges. and Dean, jj., Blackledge ana BLACKLEDGE, DISTRICT JUDGE. This is a proceeding under the law of eminent domain seeking the condemnation of rights for the overflow of lands caused by thfc erection and maintenance of a dam across the Blue River, which is being constructed for water-power purposes. There are two apper involving the same issue which will be treated as one case. The petition was filed November 26, 1920. It alleges the cor - porate capacity of the plaintiff, that it is the owner of three irregulai tracts of land in Section 34 and 35, Township 7, Range 4, Saline County, containing an aggregate acreage of 20.85. It it a' alleged. "That the Blue River runs through and across the above des - cribed tract of land; that your petitioner has been duly authorized to construct a dam across the Blue River upon said real estate to the height of sixteen (16) feet for water power purposes; that your petitioner duly submitted a plan of its proposed dam to the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage of the state of Nebraska, for examination and approval, and that said State Board duly ap - proved the same March 2, 1918, and authorized its construction to a height of sixteen (16) feet; that your petitioner is the Owner in fee simple of both side of said river where said dam is being constructed as aforesaid and has the legal title thereto, that said dam 1s in the course of construction and nearly completed and said water-power plant will be ready for operation within a few days. "Your petitioner alleges that there are no lands below the site of said dam that will be overflowed or injured by reason of the construction of said dam or the operation of said power plant. 'Your petitioner further alleges that the real estate hereinafter mentioned and not owned by it, sit - uate in township 7 North, of Range 4 East of the 6th P. M. in Saline County, Nebraska, and hereinafter specifically described, are lands situated above the site of said dam and through which said Blue River flows, which are probably will be overflowed or injured by reason of the construction and erection of said dam and the operation of said Power plant". It then gives 19 separate descriptions of land owned in which rights are sought to be acquired by condemnation. One description is : "That Frank Hronik is the owner of the N. E. VI of the N. W. M. of Sec. 35; the S. E. % of the S. W. K of Sec. 26; all of the S. W. 14 of the S. W. V t of Sec. 26, except a tract of land at the south end thereof lying south of the channel of the Big Blue river and contain- </seg>
            <seg id="p366">364 R about 4 '2 acres more or less; also that portion of the S. E. Vi of S. E. V* of Sec. 27, lying east of the channel of the Big Blue River and containing 2% acres more or less, of which tract about 41.67 acres will be taken, overflowed or damaged; and that Bessie Hronik is the wife of the said Frank Hronik." It is further alleged that the petitioner has not been able to agree with the several owners and parties interested touching the compensation and damage that will be sustained by the construction of the dam and operation of the plant, and prayer is made for the appointment of appraisers to ascertain the damage and determine the compensation to be made. A Summon was issued on the same date to the sheriff requiring him to summon certain appraisers to appear at or on the lands tmber 10, 1920, at 10 o'clock A. M., "To severally appraise the iges sustained by the parties hereinafter named to the lands hereinafter described." There follows a description of lands as in the petition. A Notice containing the same description was issued on the same date by the petitioner and served by the sheriff notify - ing the owners that the petitioner was about to complete the construct - ion of a dam for water-power purposes across the Blue-River at or near the south line of the northwest quarter of the Northwest quar - ter of section 35, Township 7, Range 4, and that appraisers would proceed on the lands December 10, 1920, at 10 o'clock A. M., to determine and assess the damage. December 9 and 10 certain objec - tions were filed by some of the owners, and on December 10 a sup - plemental petition was filed which seeks to bring In a new party and other real estate not before described in the petition. Also, a motion to amend each description in the petition by inserting the acreage was filed and a motion to amend the summons to conform to the petition as amended and the supplemental petition. The objec - tions of the owners were all overruled. The amendments asked by petitioner were all allowed. I December 14 a report of the appraisers was filed and thereupon ■eals were perfected both by the petitioner and by the owners the district court. In this district court the owners, as appellants one case and appellees in the other, renewed the objectum made them before the county judge, and upon hearing in that court the ections of the owners were sustained and a judgment entered missing the petition and annulling all proceedings had thereunder; m which judgment the power company has appealed to this It is stated by counsel for both parties that two questions are presented by the appeal; first, whether the prcoeedings were prop- </seg>

Second whether the petition of the power company, the summons and notice were suffi - cient to confer jurisdiction on the county judge or the county court to proceed in the matter. It is stated in argument that the district court held the proceedings to have been properly had under the provisions of the Statutes desig - nated and that its judgment was based upon the ground of the insuffi ciency of the petition and proceedings; but the judgment as entered is a general one, not designating the ground upon which it is based, so that both propositions are here presented for review. Without entering into a detailed consideration of the matter of statutory authority, we think it is apparent that much proceedings may properly be had under the provisions of the statute designated. The act of 1889 (Laws 1889, Ch. 68) was entitled "An act to pro - vide for water rights and irrigation, and to regulate the right to the u.se of water for agriculture and manufacturing purposes." The amendatory act of 1893 (Laws 1893, Ch 40) was entitled "An act to promote the development of water-power for manufacturing and other industrial purposes." And the act of 1895 (Laws of 189o, Ca (it 1 ), which is in substance our present law, was entitled, in pan: "An act prescribing regulations for the appropriation, distribution ar.d use of water in the construction and maintaining of canals, -litc'.es anil storage reservoirs for the purpose of irrigation, evaporation and vater- power." It is true that at that time the need primarily considered was the matter of irrigation, which was then in its early development in this state, but we think it equally clear that the purpose of the act was to establish a code for the regulation of the use and application of the waters of the State which were made sub - ject to appropriation, and that it was intended to be complete for that purpose. It contains ample provisions for the acquisition of sites, right of way and other matters incidental to the use of water, provides for the institution of condemnation proceedings by Sections S4ij2, 8453, Comp, St. 1922, and that the subsequent procedure shall be according to the provisions of law for the condemnation of rights of way for railroad corporations. The act provides that canals and other works constructed for irrigation or water-power purpose.-*, or both, are declared to be works of internal improvement; am 1 , with reference to the priority of rights, that the use of water for domes - tic purposes shall have preference over those claiming for any Other purpose, and those using the water for agriculture purposes shall have preference over those using the same for manufacturing pur - poses. While it is insisted that what is known as "The Mill DaTO Act," Rev. St. 1913, Sections 3974 Et. Seq. (Comp. St. 1922, Sees. 3377 Et Seq), should be followed, we do not think it necessary to deter- </seg>
            <seg id="p368">366 REPORT OF SECRETARY Ei that question. Nothing is pointed out with reference to the sought to be followed in this instance wherein it is not suffi - ; or adequate in all respects to protect the rights of the parties afford means for determination thereof. We therefore iiold that proceedings may properly be had under the sections of the ite to which reference is made, and now appearing as sections et seq, Corap. St. 1922. Upon the other branch of the case, it is strenuously argued that the petition and proceedings were not sufficient to give juris - diction, and this position is grounded, principally, upon the propositions that the proceedings is not a judicial proceeding and that in his »cts in reference to it the county judge was a ministerial and not a judicial officer; that the petition did not sufficiently or accurately describe the works of the petitioner then being or about to be constructed, nor the land to be taken; that there was no authority for allowance of the amendment to the petition and summons whereby the amount of acreage in each description, which had previously been left blank, was inserted, and that the amendment could not rolate back so as to affect the notice to the landowners or cur the summons to the appraisers which had already been issued more than ten days Upon the other hand, it is as vigorously asserted that the peti - tion was sufficient, the amendment authorized, and that the allega - tions of the petition were such that they could be made certain, in that a skilled person, such as a surveyor, could thereby determine the quantity and location of the land to be overflowed, and there - fore were sufficient. In support of its argument and of the petition, the appellant relies upon the cases in this court of Fremont E. &amp; M. V. R. Co. v. Mattheis, 39 Neb. 98, and Dettman v. Pittenger, 89 Neb. 825, 132 N. W. 407. These cases, we think, do not control the instant case, and the reasons therefor will be stated in connection with our con - sideration of other cases by which we think it is controlled. The statute under which the proceeding is had requires that the petition in such cases shall (1) describe the lands to be crossed, (2) state the size of the ditch, canal or works, (3) state the quan - tity of land which is required to be taken. In Matheis v. Fremont, E. t M. Y. R. Co., 53 Neb. 681, this court held that the proceeding for condemning real estate for right of way of a railroad is not instituted in nor conducted by the county court; That it is con - ducted by the county judge, the sheriff and the appraisers selected by the former, That these constitute a tribunal not to try a civil action but simply to assess the damages, and that the powers confer - red upon the county judge, and the duties required of him, are not </seg>
            <seg id="p369">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 367 judicial but are purely ministerial. There is little, if any, conflict in the decisions of any of the courts with respect to the fact that the petition by which such proceedings are instituted must accurately describe the property sought to be taken and that such a description is necessary to confer jurisdiction. This in our judgment does not mean meticulous accuracy, but substantial accuracy, that certainty by means of which a reasonably competent person could take the instrument and therefrom, aided by such inquiries as it suggests, locate the identical property. In Omaha &amp; R. V. R. Co. v. Rickards, 38 Neb. 847, considering condemnation proceedings wherein the property had been described by governmental subdivisions only, and although it was vacant and unoccupied land, but had previously been laid out in lots and blocks and was within the corporate limits of the city, it was held that such description was insufficient and the railroad company acquired no title or rights thereby. In the more recent case of Daily v. Missouri P. R. Co., 103 Neb. 219, wherein a variance in the petition consisted in a misstatement of the depth of the property sought to be condemned, it being stated as 115 feet when in fact it was 140 feet, was such a substantial inaccuracy as to render the proceedings void. In the earlier case of Fremont, E. &amp;. M. V. R. Co. v. Matheis, 39 Neb. 98, which was a rehearing of the same case reported in 35 Neb. 48, the decision was undoubtedly right upon the facts on which it was based. In that case there was in addition to the des - cription written in the petition, a plat annexed thereto in and by which the property was designated with sufficient certainty that it could be accurately determined. In the instant case there is no reference to any plat in the petition and none appears in the record. It appears to the writer that' in this sort of case a properly drawn plat is the most accurrate and illuminating method of description that could be adopted. The surface of the ground is necessarily uneven and the outlines of the land which will be overflowed, it seems, could be more accurately and plainly shown by means of a proper plat than in any other manner. The petitioner must have had the information at hand which would enable it to supply such a desig - nation, else it would be unable to compute the acreage itself. Upon the question of acreage we do not think that the amendment aided the petition to any appreciable extent. In the description herein - before quoted there was designated four separate 40 acre tracts, and it is said in the petition as amended that about 41.67 acres will be taken, overflowed or damaged; which would furnish little, if any, information to the owner as to the location or form of the part of his land to be taken, or whether it was all in one body or in a number of tracts. It made a material difference to the landowner as to the exact location of the submerged portion in respect to his </seg>
            <seg id="p370">368 REPORT OF SECRETARY land and his improvements of all kinds. It is said that the petition is sufficient because a surveyor or skilled person may take it and ascertain the lands; that we have failed to discover how such a person, however skilled, could take this petition and make any defi - nite ascertainment. There is to be a dam to the height of 16 feet across the Blue river somewhere upon the 20-acre tract of land owned by the petitioner. A great deal may, and doubtless does, depend upon the particular location of the dam and of each end thereof and its direction and length as to the overflow that will be produced thereby. The petition shows that certain lands for the distance of more than four miles upstream are to be overflowed and affected by this dam. It follows that a very little difference in the land to be overflowed. The skilled person who would determine the exact location of these lines must mave a starting point, and we fail to dis - cover one in the petition. The dam is said to be 16 feet high. From what point does the measurement proceed? Is it from the low water mark or the bed of the stream? And, if the bed of the stream, is it the lowest part thereof or is it what is sometimes called the flow »e, and how determined or how may it now be found ? The dam shown incomplete in its construction and therefore the top of it as actually constructed cannot be ascertained from the petition. In other words, where is the base point or bench mark from which the surveyor must start in order to determine his course, distance or levels? The petition gives no information which the Statute requires as to the size or location of the works, -which in this instance is the dam, and the body of water which will be impounded thereby. Neither does it give any information as to the particular tracts and locality of the land to be taken from the different landowners so that they might determine, not only the land itself, but how adjacent land of im - provements might be affected by the overflow, and the addition of the term "about ten acres," when applied to a 40-acre or an 80-acre tract gives no definite information. Now, if a condemnation proceeding fully completed, because it described vacant, unoccupied land by governmental subdivisions, when it has been laid out in lots and blocks, or because it made a variance of a little less than 20 per cent, in the depth of certain property, is so fatally defective that no rights were acquired thereby, it must necessarily follow that, when objection is made in the inception of a proceeding that the description is so indefinite as that contained in the petition here, and as incapable of being made definite by anything therein stated, it is likewise fatally defective and insufficient to con - fer jurisdiction. It follows from these considerations that the judgment of the district court was right, and it is AFFIRMED. </seg>
