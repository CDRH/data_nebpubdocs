Sik: In compliance with the requirements of subdivision ») ( Bn 2 of the Railway Commission Act, we have the honor to t herewith our Seventh Annual Report, covering the year end- ing November 30, 1914. Very respectfully, Henry T. Clarke, Jr., Chairman Thomas L. Hall, Commissioner H. G. Taylor, Commissioner </seg>

            <seg id="p007">GENERAL REVIEW ORGANIZATION The Nebraska State Railway Commission is organised as follows: Henry T. Clarke, Jr., Chairman; Thomas L. Hall and H. G. Taylor, Commissioners; A. B. Allen, secretary; U. G. Powell, rate expert and accountant; O. D. Boyer, assistant rate clerk; W. L. Gregory and C. W. Spears, clerks; Violet M. Martin, filing clerk and sten - ographer; Delpha M. Taylor, assistant reporter and stenographer; Mary E. Sheehan, recording clerk and stenographer; Emma J. Hedges, reporter. Commissioner Thomas L. Hall was elected last November for a term of six years, beginning January 7, 1915, to El himself. He is just now completing three years of service, been elected in 1911 to fill out the unexpired term of W. H. 1, deceased. The Commission frequently finds it necessary to ipecial studies and investigations of pending cases, and at such additional help is often required. Such extra help is employed ision demands. Ehe personnel of the engineering department, having charge of ■s pertaining to physical valuation, is as follows: B. E. Forbes, engineer; H. S. Kinney, assistant engineer; Guy Barnes, Grace M. Steward, stenographer. Engineer B. E. Forbes also large of the Commission's "Blue Sky" department. LEGISLATION OF 1913 BEARING UPON THE WORK OF THE RAILWAY COMMISSION Ileference was made in the Commission's Sixth Annual Report number of laws passed by the legislature of 1913, having to do the work of this body. In view of the fact that the legislature 15 is about to begin its labors, it is perhaps pertinent to again to the laws passed by the previous legislature, in which the nission is directly interested. f louse Roll No. 57 — Provides that a light engine, running from ivision point to another, outside of yard limits, must be manned a crew consisting of engineer, fireman and conductor, and places the State Railway Commission the duty of enforcement. ■But one complaint has been filed under this law. That corn - it (Informal No. 3457) was based on the fact that the C. St. P. k O. Ry. Co. ran a light engine between Florence and Oakland, </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 manned by a crew consisting of an engineer and fireman, but with - out a conductor. The question was as to whether or not such action was a violation of House Roll No. 57. The Attorney General was asked for an interpretation of the law, especially as to the mean - ing of the phrase, "from one division to another division," it appear - ing on the face .of the law that unless the under-manned engine crossed a division line there would be no violation of the statute. In an opinion handed down by the Attorney General under date of November 30, 1914, he holds that "there must be a full crew where a light engine is run from one division to another division outside of the yard limits, but not necessarily a full crew where the run is merely between stations in the same division." (Opinion in full appears in Part IV. of this report.) Based on this opinion, it appears that the complaint referred to did not constitute a violation of the law, as the under-manned engine did not pass from one division point to another. It is manifest, therefore, that the law is weak, in that a viola - tion can only occur when a light engine passes over a division line. In other words, an under-manned engine may be run within the boundaries of a division without infringing upon the law, and such movements may include practically all the work of the operating crew. It is only when the engine with a light crew crosses over a division line that the law would be applicable, and such movement might cover a journey of but a few miles. If there is merit in the idea which the law is intended to emphasize, the statute should be so amended as to cover movements of light engines, both between points in separate dhisions and also between points in the same I House Roll No. 172 — Confers upon the State Railway Com - on authority, in its discretion, to order in gates for protection, e three or more railroad tracks cross a street in cities of less than thousand population, such gates not to be operated on Sunday i no trains are run on that day. I Several complaints have been filed under this statute. On mal Complaint No. 2977, reported on pages 168-170 of the Annual Report, the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. was ordered to locate gman at the intersection of its main line of road with Main ue in the city of Chadron, Dawes county, and said order was lied With. In Formal Complaint No. 216. John M. Doyle v. C. B. &amp; Q R. R. Co., a hearing was held, following which a stipulation was entered into between the city of Holdrege and defendant company, in which the latter agreed to provide electric gongs or bells at cross - ing in controversy, which provision of the stipulation was complied with. Defendant company was further ordered by the Commission to construct and maintain railings or guards, on either side of cross - ing approach, or in lieu thereof to widen said approach. The order in full nDnp&amp;rs in Part I of this renort </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 I mother case was presented in Formal Complaint No. 239, City &gt;rk v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., in which an order was prayed for •ing defendant to maintain a watchman, and to install and ain suitable gates for the protection of persons crossing de - nt's tracks on Lincoln avenue, city of York. This case was i out of court by stipulation entered into by complainant and House Roll No. 174 — Provides for caboose accommodations for passengers and shippers of live stock who make use of freight trains, said accommodations relating to seats, toilet, drinking water, heat, ventilation, etc., and further provides that a printed copy of the Act shall be posted in every caboose, and that the State Railway Commission shall enforce the provisions of the law. Under date of January 17, 1913, just prior to the passage of the above law, the Commission issued its General Order No. 27 (see Part III. of the Sixth Annual Report), covering all the provisions of the statute referred to, copy of which order was served upon all the carriers operating in the state of Nebraska. Our observation is that this order has been complied with, and the fact that no com - plaints have been filed would seemingly bear out the above conclu - sion. Several protests have been filed, however, especially in the matter of the arrangement of caboose seats in passenger car style, which arrangement, under certain conditions, the law requires. These protests could not be considered by the Commission, for the reason that the law is mandatory and leaves no discretionary power with this body. House Roll No. 178 — Places the general control of irrigation works under the State Railway Commission, except where they are under the control of irrigation districts. But one complaint has been filed under this law, namely, Formal No. 209, McCook Irrigation &amp; Water Power Company v. Pauline Hurtless et al. The prayer of this complaint was for an order au - thorizing petitioner to publish a charge of $2.00 per acre under water right contracts, including the year 1913, being an increase of rate of $1.00 per acre per year. After hearing the Commission entered an order, under date of November 13, 1914, granting the petition. Copy of said order will be found in Part III. of this report. The case has since been appealed to the state supreme court and is now pending before that body. House Roll No. 21 -Provides for the compulsory physical con - nection of telephone systems, toll messages to be routed as per request of the patron. Also provides that in the case of an eliminated exchange the long distance connections formerly given by such ex - change must be continued by the absorbing exchange. The fees earned, after allowing 15 per cent to the originating company and 10 per cent to the destinating company, shall be apportioned on air line basis in proportion to the line mileage owned by the con - tributing companies, unless there is a contract to the contrary, and upon failure to agree to an equitable distribution it is made the duty / * L -.

            <seg id="p010">10 The Attorney General has held that the above law relates to physical connection on toll business only. (See Attorney General's Opinion No. 49, Part IV., Sixth Annual Report.) Several complaints have been filed under this statute. One has been settled by agree - ment of parties in interest. (See Informal Complaint No. 2950, Blair Telephone Company v. Nebraska Telephone Company, Part II., Sixth Annual Report.) In Formal Complaint No. 214, Hooper Telephone Company v. Nebraska Telephone Company, the Com - mission rendered its opinion and order requiring compliance with the law, from which decision the defendant company appealed to the state supreme court. In an opinion rendered under date of May 15, 1914, the supreme court affirmed the order entered by this Commission and remanded the case for further consideration. (See text of supreme court opinion in Part IV. of this report.) House Roll No. 328 — This law relates to telegraph companies, and fixes a minimum charge of 25 cents for ten-word messages from any point in the state to any other point in the state, and applies the old rate for each additional word. The State Railway Com - mission has power to raise the rate if, after trial and hearing, it is found to be non-compensatory. Immediately upon the approval of this Act the Western Union Telegraph Company applied for an injunction in the federal court against the enforcement of the reduced rate. The court refused to assume jurisdiction, and referred the case to the State Railway Commission for consideration as per the conditions of the law. The company then applied to the Commission for authority to increase its telegraphic rates over and above the statutory provisions (Appli - cation No. 1792). Upon this application a conference was held September 8, 1913, at which time the applicant indicated its willing - ness to publish and make effective the schedule of rates established by House Roll No. 328 for a given period of time, to be determined upon conference between its representative and the Commission, for the purpose of testing the reasonableness of the rates. The test period has not yet been closed, and the application is still pending. Meanwhile, the people of Nebraska are enjoying the rates provided by the statute above referred to. (See Application No. 1792, Part II., and also order of the United States circuit court, denying tem - porary injunction, Part IV. of the Sixth Annual Report.) E Senate File No. 4 — This enactment is commonly known as the ue Sky" law. It is intended to protect the public from the loitation of worthless, or doubtful, securities. It does not pertain real estate operations, excepting where the transactions concern is outside of the state, in which case the state conservation and survey commission shall, upon request, make investigation and prt any fraudulent operations to the Attorney General for prose - ion. Enforcement of this Act is committed to the State Railway n mission. The administration of the "Blue Sky" law has been committed by the Commission to Mr. B. E. Forbes its engineer. His report of </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 the operation of the law in detail will be found in Part VII. of this report. (See also Attorney General's opinions Nos. 48, 50, 51, 5_ 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, Part IV. of Sixth Annual Report. REDUCTION OF CLASS RATES Kn August 5, 1914, the Commission issued its final order in al Order No. 19, establishing a schedule of reasonable class governing Nebraska traffic, supplemented by a complete sched- Iof distances between all points in Nebraska on all roads. The i became effective September 6, 1914, and since that date have in full force and have been observed by the carriers. The s have appealed to the supreme court from the decision of the imission in this case, and the matter is now pending before that Sbunal. However, the appeal does not affect the application of the ;es pending decision. The Commission considers that the issuance of General Order No. 19 is the greatest work it has ever performed during the seven years of its existence. In fact, it is doubtful if any state commission has ever accomplished an undertaking of greater magnitude or one having greater influence upon state traffic. The labor incident to the issuance of the final order covered a period of approximately seven years. The work was begun in the early part of 1908, as a result of the issuance of preliminary Circular No. 22, and several hearings were held in the months of March, April and May of that year. The work of general investigation was interrupted by the litigation in - cident to the enforcement of the express, two-cent fare and commod - ity rate laws, passed by the legislature of 1907, the entire time of the Commission's rate and accounting experts being consumed in preparing the evidence necessary to the defense of these measures. The successful outcome of the trial of the cases mentioned is public knowledge and is a source of gratification to the Commission and a justification of its course in suspending further action at that time in its class rate investigation. I No further action was taken until July 6, 1909, upon which date Commission issued its General Order No. 19, which presented a mum distance schedule of class rates for "distributing stations," a provision that the rates for all other stations should be 10 -ent higher. The carriers were ordered to show cause why the named were not reasonable. Hearing on this order was set for mber 1, 1909, but was deferred pending the decision of the al court in the Minnesota rate cases. Respecting this litigation the part played in it by Nebraska, the Commission says: "Certain of their rate laws had been enjoined, and the validity of all were being contested. The progress of the litiga - tion in that state and similar litigation in Missouri and other </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 lass rates at that time in addition to the passenger and commodity ate reductions of 1907 in this state might result in an injunc - ion from the Federal Court, enjoining not only any class rate eduction but also the 1907 rate laws, which were then in effect and were of more importance to the people of this state than ny class rate schedule that could reasonably have been adopted, "he report of the Master in the Minnesota cases, filed October 0, 1910, and affirmed by the court, speaking through Judge Sanborn, April 8, 1911, are common knowledge. The resultant injunction of all Minnesota rate reductions, the legal principles therein announced, and the methods used in arriving at their conclusions, not only afforded ample justification of the Com - mission's conservative course in proceeding with its investiga - tion, but rendered useless further proceedings pending a final Setermination of the cases in the Supreme Court of the United tates. "The Commission thereupon made a careful study of the ecord in the Minnesota cases, and contributed one-third of the brief of three hundred eighty-nine pages, filed by the commis - ions of eight western states as amicus curiae, attacking the egal doctrines therein announced and the formulae and bases upon which the Master and Judge Sanborn arrived at their onclusions. That the arguments therein submitted by this Commission contributed in no small degree to the final successful outcome of that litigation, has been freely admitted by Chairman 'home of Iowa, who was in charge of the Commission's brief, and others who have taken the time to study the briefs sub - nitted and the Supreme Court's opinion, reversing Judge San - &gt;orn, which was rendered June 9, 1913." EOn September 13, 1913, under Circular No. 42, the Commission n announced further hearings, the first being called for October Hearings were then held on October 9, 1913, February 23 and March 24, 25, 26 and 27, and April 13, 1914, at which times the imission received and heard all evidence and arguments offered by iers, shippers and interested parties. I Subsequent to the hearings in October, 1913, the Commission, need by arguments advanced at previous hearings, and as the ! of further independent investigation, modified the schedule &gt;sed in General Order No. 19, by increasing the percentage onship of fourth class from 55 per cent to 60 per cent, and class from 40 per cent to 50 per cent, and further changing the of progression by carrying the added one cent per cwt. every miles to a distance of 300 miles, thereafter one cent per cwt. f ten miles. ■The Commission states that it has gone somewhat into detail in history of the investigation in order that those disposed to ;ise because of the seeming delay might know the reasons there - and to demonstrate that its sole purpose has been not only to re a class rate schedule which, in its judgment, was fair and &gt;nable, but one which would become effective when promulgated. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 Distance Tariff The Commission then proceeds to discuss, in its opinion referred to, the method of constructing a rate schedule commonly known as a distance tariff, quotes the present Nebraska distance tariff and points out that it applies between stations, neither of which is a terminal or jobbing station, unless the long and short haul clause under a terminal or jobbing tariff would determine a lower rate to an intermediate station. It says that the present distance schedule was put into effect by the carriers in 1887 as a compromise measure with the old Nebraska Board of Transportation. Because of its irregularities in construction it is said to be "fearfully and wonder- fully made." In pointing out how a proper distance schedule could be con- structed, the Commission says: L" Three elements are always used in the construction of ' Dis - nce Tariff' schedules: 1) Mileage rate of progression, or same rate zones (2) Money rate of progression for the increased distance. (3) Percentage relationship of each class to the first class, or base rate. "1. (a) The mileage rate of progression carries in different distance tariffs' and usually there is a difference in the mileage jrogression in the same tariff; that is, the first one or two tundred miles may be divided in five-mile rates of progression, len beyond two hundred miles the rate of progression may be ated for each ten or twenty miles. The idea being to so divide ip distance for which the tariff is made up, so that the rates o two stations, say five miles apart, will be reasonably uniform nd without sudden raises in the rates which would tend to ive one of two neighboring towns the advantage over another n the transportation charge on any commodity or article ol ommerce. Let us assume that the 'Distance Tariff' promul - gated in this order was made up in 100-mile rates of progres - sion; then in that case the first class rate would be stated thus "From the above it will readily be seen that two towns located, say one, one hundred miles from a wholesale or jobbing city, the other located one hundred and five miles from the same jobbing city, could not compete for business on a fair basis. The town located one hundred miles away would have a 20 cents per cwt. advantage on first class rate over the other in the transportation charge. The average distance between all stations in Nebraska is approximately seven miles. In the eastern or central portion of this state the average distance between stations is less than in the western part of the state. For this reason, the first two hundred miles of the ' Distance Tariff' herein promulgated is stated in five-mile rates of pro - gression, and beyond two hundred miles in ten-mile rates of progression. "2. (a) The charge for the different distances for first 1 to 100 miles, 33 cents per cwt 100 " 200 " 53 200 " 300 " 73 300 " 400 " 83 400 " 500 " 93 " " " </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 the 'Distance Tariff' schedule is constructed and the amount of the first class charge is always, or at least should be, based on the mileage rate of progression. Manifestly, the charge for five miles should not be the same as for one hundred miles in a tariff constructed for the purpose of distributing merchandise, so that if it be determined by the rate-making body that 33 cents per hundred pounds of first class freight is a reasonable and just charge for a haul of one hundred miles, the question of what the charge shall be for each five miles from one to one hundred miles becomes important. b"In all properly constructed 'Distance Tariff' schedules ere should be an initial charge for the service rendered by e carrier at the two terminals, i. e., points of origin and destination. This terminal charge should be arrived at without regard to how far the shipment is to be transported. "This Commission's investigation of terminal costs has een most extensive, and will be spoken of again later on in this eport. The question of what items of cost of performing the ervice should be included in the terminal charge and what ems should be considered in the haulage costs, is a much ebated question, and is at the present time being carefully nd extensively investigated by state and federal commissions. L fter the two-terminal cost has been determined, the amount of be charge which shall be added to the terminal charge as a taulage cost becomes important and should be made with re - ard to the conditions under which the transportation must be conducted. A haulage charge should be greater in a mountain - us territory than in a level or non-mountainous country. In he Distance Tariff herein adopted these questions have been arefully considered by the Commission. i"3. (a) This question will be more fully explained in other ortions of this opinion. In formulating a correctly constructed istance tariff this question is very important, and possibly the ardest of a correct and scientific solution. The relationship f the less than carload and carload traffic is so close, being fre - uently carried under the same class in the 'Classification,' that lie question becomes very complex." For purposes of comparison the final order of the Commission in re General Order No. 19 presents the so-called prouty Iowa- Nebraska scale, the Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska distance sched - ules, a composite of the so-called Nebraska terminal or jobbing tariffs, and the new distance schedule just adopted. For the purpose of laying a proper foundation for its conclusions, and to determine the character and volume of traffic involved, the effect of any proposed reduction in the carriers' intrastate earnings, etc., the Commission had caused the carriers to file for each station in this state a monthly station report, commencing July 1, 1907. A summary of these reports for a year is given to illustrate the nature and value of the information thus obtained. As a further aid in arriving at the reasonableness of the rates involved, the Commission conducted an exhaustive investigation into the operating costs of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Rail - way in Nebraska. The data so obtained, together with reports filed </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 ■initiation of the direct operating cost of both passenger and it traffic, subdivided as between state and interstate, through local. To make the investigation still more complete the Commission made an abstract of every waybill covering the movement of in - trastate traffic on the C. R. I. &amp; P., C. B. &amp; Q. and U. P. for a period of four months and the C. &amp; N. W. for a period of two months. This portion of the inquiry involved the handling of ap - proximately a million and a half of state and interstate waybills, the transcribing of the intrastate shipments onto permanent records, filling sixty-two volumes of twenty thousand pages and containing approximately seven hundred thousand entries. A sample page of this record, showing shipments of sugar, groc - eries, building material, etc., is made a part of the opinion. So far as the Commission is advised, no such searching and far-reaching investigation of this character has ever been attempted by any rate-making body. The amount of labor involved in the analysis of such a compilation can hardly be appreciated by one not engaged in the same or similar work. As an illustration of the great value of the information thus secured, the Commission cites the conference with Commissioner Prouty, of the Interstate Commerce Commission, relative to the construction of the so-called Prouty tariff. Among the matters considered was the relationship, or percentage, of the fourth class rates to the first and fifth class rates. Under the "Prouty scale," fourth class is 50 per cent, and fifth class is 40 per cent of first class. When it was made clear to Mr. Prouty, as it could be from this data, that the bulk of the jobbing traffic in this territory moved inbound fifth class carload, and outbound fourth class, less carload, and that this Commission's analysis of the traffic movement of intrastate shipments showed that only .57 of one per cent of the carload traffic moved fourth class carload, he frankly admitted his fourth class relationship was too low. ■Upon consideration of all the evidence and arguments presented, the results of its own investigations, the Commission finds that existing Nebraska distance and terminal or jobbing class rates unreasonably high, unjust and discriminatory, and that the scale ites set forth under the heading "Adopted No. 19" are just and &gt;nable. Speaking of the application of the new schedule, the mission says: "Competitive conditions are such in this state that a different scale of class rates on different lines is hardly practical inasmuch as competitive conditions arising from the paralleling and intersecting of the various lines of railroad would determine the rate, and while a lower schedule than the one adopted might be justified on the more prosperous roads, it would in - directly work a hardship on the weaker roads, the results of which would ultimately affect the shippers and the traveling public on the weaker lines, in the shape of a more limited service and inadequate and poor facilities." </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Equalization The new schedule, in addition to providing for a distance tariff, includes an equalization of the various jobbing centers of the state. The opinion deals at considerable length with the present equalized adjustment in the state, explaining just how it is affected. The Com - mission finds that the sentiment against the establishment of a rigid distance tariff was almost unanimous and quotes statements to that effect from representatives of Beatrice, Grand Island, Fremont, Kearney, Lincoln and Omaha. As a fitting comment on the opera - tion of the rigid distance tariff in Iowa, the opinion of the Com - mission of that state, expressed in a rate case, is quoted. The low* Commission says in substance that the basing of a schedule on dis - tance alone makes the scale inelastic and inflexible. It throttles competition. The inflexible rule of distance forbids the Commission from considering any question except that of a reasonable rate to be applied to every mile of railroad in Iowa, regardless of conditions. No other state except Iowa is so fettered. 8 The Commission is unanimous in its opinion that to establish a maximum and minimum distance tariff would be disastrous to jobbing and manufacturers' interests of the state, in which mil - of dollars have been invested, and years of labor consumed in lopment. It would tend to restrict the territory of these in - ries and to the extent of the restriction would reduce com - ion, with no benefit to the ultimate consumer. S'he carriers urged that the Commission establish a distance sufficiently high as to permit them to formulate the jobbing beneath it. This suggestion was rejected on the ground that uld not remove existing abuses, and in the belief that it was lary for the Commission to prescribe the rates in order to ain a fair equalization. The opinion sets forth in detail the method by which the equali - sation is accomplished. The plan adopted is a striking departure from that invariably followed heretofore, in that a large portion of the equalization is formulated above the distance tariff, rather than below it. In other words, the rate per ton per mile out of the centers equalized is higher than prevails to and from towns between which the traffic moves on the distance tariff. Under the prior adjustment the terminal or ' jobbing rates were about 20 per cent lower as an average than the distance tariff rates. The new plan secures to the towns affected and to the public all the advantages flowing from an equalized adjustment, and at the same time preserves to all points in the state the opportunity to ship in and out on an equal basis with all other points.

In conclusion the Commission says: "We do not maintain that the distance schedule adopted is the last word, or sum mum bonum, of distance schedules. Experience will undoubtedly disclose wherein we have failed to reach that much to be desired result. It is to be hoped, how - ever, that the carriers will exercise the same spirit of fairness which has characterized the Commission throughout the course of this investigation, and accept the schedules herein established without delay." In general it may be said that the issuance of the Commission's final order in General Order No. 19 has had the effect of reducing class rates on intrastate traffic to the extent of 19 per cent. A care - ful compilation, prepared by Rate Expert Powell, shows that the reduction on state traffic will aggregate $611,000 annually, and that the corresponding reduction of interstate rates will increase the sav - ing to Nebraska shippers to approximately $750,000 per year. The jobbing towns of the state have been placed upon an equalized basis, the purpose being to preserve present commercial conditions, so far as it is possible to do so, without continuing present inequality or abuses. The rates apply to that part of the traffic which moves under Nebraska Classification No. 1, and cover about ten thousand items, including all merchandise, groceries, agricultural implements and many manufactured products. The tonnage affected is about 15 per cent of the total intrastate traffic, but the earnings from this class of freight amount to 30 per cent of the whole. IAs an indication of the manner in which the final order in G. io. 19 has been received by Nebraska shippers, we append a few nents received from various parties who have addressed the mission upon this subject. A Lincoln shipper writes: "We just bought two copies of your General Order No. 19, and want to congratulate you upon this work. It is very com - plete and shows a great deal of painstaking work on your part. Every shipper in this state should appreciate the work you have done, and also the great help the reduction in rates will be to them." A Beatrice shipper writes: !"In going over the schedules, in so far as Beatrice is con - erned I must say that our jobbers and manufacturers are very luch pleased with the work of the Commission. So far as we ave been able to go into this tariff, we find that you have let the situation on a fair and equalized basis, enabling us to lace our goods on the market in competitive territory at an qualized cost of transportation with the other jobbing centers of he state. The manner in which this tariff is made up is above reproach and too much praise cannot be given your Mr. Powell for his commendable work in this tariff." </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 • One of the big manufacturing concerns of Wisconsin says: "From a hasty examination of the work, it appears to be backed by great common sense, which item is frequently omitted in rate-making. It also differs from a majority of tariffs by its simplicity, and the readiness with which a rate can be lo - cated. It is not a jig-saw puzzle, as many other tariffs are. The fact is that many of the billing clerks in railroad offices do not understand their own tariffs and are consequently making blunders. The Nebraska State Railway Commission's final order in G. O. No. 19 is a model." A shipper from Superior adds his testimony as follows: "We have received copy of the class rates established by your Commission under General Order No. 19. We wish to compliment you on the splendid work you have done in com - piling this tariff. It is certainly a great credit to the State Railway Commission and to the state of Nebraska." A Cleveland, Ohio, business concern writes: "I have read with a great deal of interest your final order in G. 0. No. 19 and it is certainly most interesting, instructive and one of the most logical decisions that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I believe that your Commission is cer - tainly entitled to a great deal of credit for the apparent untiring energy that must have been expended in arriving at your final conclusions in this case." An Omaha wholesale house says: "Upon examining the tariff we cannot fail to realize the tremendous task your Commission has performed in solving the problem of dealing fairly with all concerns. In view of the large variety of interests involved, which you were necessarily obliged to consider, and of the perplexing problems you were required to contend with, we believe that the result attained should and will meet with the approval of all of the shippers in the entire state, and we heartily congratulate you on your success." The entire cost of preparing and printing the final order in G. O. No. 19, including all expenses incident thereto from the time of first consideration, is approximately $23,000. The Commission had 3,500 copies of the order printed, that item of expense alone being about $7,000. The Commission has fixed a price of $1.75 for each copy of the order, no free distribution being made. About 1,100 copies have been disposed of, leaving 2,400 copies now on hand. There is a constant demand for the publication. The order has now been in force about three months and the saving to the shippers of the state during that period has been approximately $187,000, figured at the rate of $750,000 per year. While the initial expense incident to the issuance of the order was considerable, probably no one will contend that the money was not well «p«nt. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 FREIGHT CLASSIFICATION Nebraska Classification No. 1 was issued October 31, 1911. This is a circular relating to minimum weights and classification of various and sundry articles moving by freight within this state. Circumstances from time to time require that there should be certain amendments and corrections made to said Classification, and for that purpose the Commission holds hearings twice a year, at which time shippers are privileged to press their claims for adjustments, changes and additions to the present schedule. By this means the Classifica - tion is kept up to date, and is made to fit the necessities of the shipping public. PHYSICAL VALUATION The annual report of the Commission's physical valuation and engineering department will be found in this volume under Part VI. Mr. C. H. Gerber resigned his position as chief of the department, effective May 1, 1914, and Mr. B. E. Forbes was appointed to fill the vacancy. The force has been engaged during the past year in making special studies and valuation reports concerning various applications and complaints pending before the Commission, and in making necessary additions and corrections to the valuations of car - riers previously made in order that there may be included the neces - sary amounts incident to the building of extensions, additions and betterments. The force is much smaller than it was when the valua - tion work was first undertaken and is only sufficiently large to properly take care of present necessities. CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION The following is a list of cases which were filed with the Inter - state Commerce Commission during the past year: KL petition was filed, requesting the suspension of Item No. A, Supplement No. 18 to Circular No. 1-J of Western Trunk , I.

LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED There has been much comment of late in the public print upon the great loss of life and injury to person resulting from trespassing upon the tracks and rights-of-way of railroad companies. In Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p023">23 braska, during the year 1913, 54 trespassers were killed and 134 in - jured. From reports received from such state commissions as keep a record, it appears that the total number of trespassers killed in 1913 was 4,354, and the records further show that the loss of life from this cause is increasing from year to year and equals in number that of passengers and employes combined. The National Association of Railway Commissioners has recommended that each state adopt a law making it unlawful "for any unauthorized person to walk, ride or travel upon or along the tracks or within the right-of-way of any railroad company operating its lines within this state, or to cross such tracks or right-of-way at any place other than at a public or private crossing." The Nebraska State Railway Commission recom - mends the passage of such a law with the necessary exemptions in favor of railroad employes, etc. The legal work of this Commission is increasing very rapidly. We have now a number of cases pending before the Interstate Com - merce Commission and also a number before the supreme court. It requires much time to prepare for the defense of these cases, the preparation of briefs and argument. Some assistance has been re - ceived in the past from the Attorney General, but the work of the Commission is so constant that it could profitably employ the entire time of the state's legal department, but that, of course, is impos - sible, as other state officers must receive due attention from the Attorney General's office. The Commission has in the past managed, in the main, to handle its own legal cases, but the burden has become so heavy that it seems impossible to continue to do so with the present force. It is therefore recommended that the legislature make provision for a commerce counsel to be assigned to the State Railway Commission, subject to its direction, and that adequate compensation be provided. Section 6042 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for the year 1913 provides that "when any person owns land on both sides of any railroad, the corporation owning such railroad shall, when required so to do, make and keep in good repair one causeway, or other adequate means of crossing the same." By inference the statute re - quires that gates shall be provided in the right-of-way fence on either side. The attention of the Commission has been called to numerous instances where persons receiving the benefits of this statute have failed or refused to keep the gates closed in the right - of-way fence, thus making it possible for stock in adjacent pastures to wander onto the tracks, to the menace of human life, of property, and to the detriment of service. The section referred to should be amended so as to require the owner, his tenant or lessee, to keep such gates dosed when not in actual use, and a penalty should be </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Btem B, Subdivision 2, Section 3, of S. F. No. 4 (Blue Sky law), i by the legislature of 1913, reads: "This act shall not include within its purview sales of stock in Nebraska corporations already in existence, and in Nebraska corporations hereafter created, but which have been in existence one year or more at the time of such sale," etc. Klased upon the observation and experience of the past two years, the judgment of the Commission that the item quoted above 1 be amended so as to read: "This act shall not include within its purview sales of stock in Nebraska corporations already in existence, and in Nebraska corporations hereafter created, but which have been in existence five years or more at the time of such sale," etc. It has been observed that quite often Nebraska companies ete their incorporation and drift along for a year or more ut disclosing their ultimate plan of operation. At the end of r they may promulgate some very objectionable plan of pro - » and be exempt from the provisions of the law which are in - i to protect the public from the exploitation of doubtful ties. If the law is amended as above suggested, it will afford greater protection to the public and will be consistent with eneral tenor of the "Blue Sky" act and with similar enact - of other states. Subdivision g, Section 11, of the "Blue Sky" law reads: "The par value of all stocks sold or offered for sale must be one hundred dollars." This provision works a hardship upon many legitimate com - panies which seek to do business in the state of Nebraska. There seems to be no good reason why stock companies should not be per - mitted to organize and operate upon a par value basis of other than one hundred dollars per share. The Commission therefore recommends that the section referred to be amended to read: U"The par value of all stocks sold or offered for sale must be t less than ten dollars per share." The false billing of shipments is a growing evil, which should be covered by definite legislation. At the present time there is no Nebraska statute which deals with this subject from the standpoint of the shipper. Section 10 of the Federal "Act to Regulate Com - merce" makes it a penal offense for carriers, their officers or agents, to countenance or be a party to false billing, and the section also bears with equal force upon shippers who are guilty of a like offense. The practice affords undue advantage to dishonest shippers, and re- </seg>
            <seg id="p025">25 I in discrimination against competitors who are scrupulous in the ration of their shipping papers and who make their bills of ; show accurate description of the consignments forwarded, ler with true weights. The evil is so far-reaching in its con - nces, and is so unjust to honest shippers and to the carriers, a law should be formulated upon the subject and adopted, ig the practice a penal offense, subject to both fine and im - iment.

            <seg id="p107">107 &gt; FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. IM Frank A. Raabe, a Merchant of the City of Stanton, Nebraska, Plaintiff, vs. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, Defendant. FINDING AND ORDER Hall. Commissioner: The petition herein was tiled January 21, 1913, the answer on February 8, 1913, and the matter came on to be heard at Stanton, Nebraska, September 16, 1913, before Commissioner Hall, Messrs. W. W. Young and W. C. Conway appearing as attorneys for the plaintiff, and A. A. McLaughlin for the defendant. I "The complainant herein complains of the condition of the depot Stanton, Nebraska, as being too small, unventilated, unlighted, unitary and unheated; tThat the portion of said depot used as a baggage room freight depot is entiiely too small and inadequate to accommo - the people doing business with the defendant; "ib&gt; That no lavatory is provided, or accommodations of this character; that no water for drinking purposes is supplied; " (c) That the lights are not sufficient to enable persons having business, and persons alighting from or taking trains to do so with safety, the only lights on the platform being one small coal oil lamp; L" d&gt; That the present depot is a frame structure and unsafe insecure, having been constructed about 22 years ago." The plaintiff prays that the defendant be required to construct a new and modern depot of sufficient size to care for the patrons of said defendant, and asks that the same be equipped with modern conveniences, such as sanitary closets, light, heat and water. A full and complete transcript of all of the testimony taken and evidence introduced at said hearing has been made, and said testi - mony and evidence has been considered by the Commission. Doubt - less a great deal of the testimony that was introduced was irrelevant, immaterial and not the proper testimony, but the Commission has considered only those things which are pertinent to the issue. The town of Stanton has a population of about 1,500; it is the county seat of Stanton county, and is located on the line of the defendant, and in about the center of said county; it is 9.8 miles west of Pilger, about 18 miles north of Leigh and Clarkson, about 16 or 18 miles northeast of Madison, 11.3 miles southeast ofNorfolk, and about 12 miles south of Hoskins. The defendant line is the only railroad in Stanton county, and the town of Pilger is the only other town beside Stanton in said </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 from which it receives both passenger and freight traffic. The evidence shows that Stanton has and owns water works and an elec - tric lighting plant, both of which are generally patronized by its citizens; that the sidewalks and crossings are almost entirely con - structed of cement; that the high school buildings are modern in structure and conveniences; that the residences and business build - ings are generally modern and are kept in a good state of repair. A great deal of evidence was introduced to show that the depot facilities are not in keeping with the general condition of the town, and that it is not adequate in its appointments to accommodate the public and adequately take care of the traffic that is handled at that point. This was partly conceded by the defendant in that they admitted that certain repairs and additions should be made to their depot. The building is of frame construction, located on the north side of the tracks and the west side of the main street, which runs north and south leading to said depot from the business section of the city. The said depot consists of one ladies' waiting room 12' 2" x21' on the west end of said building; one office room running north and south 10'x23' 6" east of the ladies' waiting room; one gentle - men's waiting room 12' 2"x21' east of the office room, and one freight and baggage room 31' 6"x21' on the east end of the depot. There is a portion of this room used for a stairway which leads to the second story, which is used as living rooms by the agent of the defendant. The ladies' waiting room has a seating capacity of about eighteen, and the gentlemen's waiting room has a seating capacity of about fifteen. The rooms are heated by the ordinary cannon coal stoves. They are lighted with coal oil lamps. The depot is not equipped with sanitary toilet rooms, nor is it supplied with water. The evidence shows that at times the waiting rooms are over - crowded, and that at such times they are uncomfortable and un - sanitary. The freight room is unfinished and not heated, thereby making it impossible to preserve perishable goods in cold weather. The agents of the defendant herein had been in the habit of storing perishable goods in the office and gentlemen's waiting room, which add to the congestion all the more. The fact that the freight room is on the east end of the depot, just adjacent to the sidewalk leading to the main business center of town, makes it necessary to unload and pile all L. C. L. freight on the platform at that point, which very much obstructs said platform and makes it inconvenient and dangerous for all persons who find it necessary to go to and from said depot. I When the depot was originally constructed, doubtless it was issible to know which end of the building would be next to the over which all persons would pass going to and from said t, but now that the town is definitely established in its location, depot should be so arranged that the waiting rooms should be est to the sidewalk leading to it and the freight and baggage i on the opposite end. The result of such an arrangement is irent and need not be further discussed. </seg>

It will be noted that this revenue all traffic, both outgoing and incoming. It will be further that no account has been considered as to the amount of traffic handled at said depot, or the revenue received from the rhich properly should be counted in considering questions of te and sufficient facilities. (The complainant herein prays that an order be issued by the emission requiring a new building to be built, but in view of the that the present depot has a great deal of good material in it ; may be utilized, the Commission is of the opinion that the ent building should be reconstructed, and in the reconstruction of same it should be enlarged in all departments, and provided with modern conveniences. In the enlargement and reconstruction of said depot, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the waiting rooms should be on the </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 east end, and the freight, baggage and express rooms should be on the west, and that the said rooms should be so arranged as to afford easy access from one to the other. It is not a convenient or satis - factory arrangement to separate the waiting rooms by the general office room, with no passage way or door connecting the two rooms. The Commission will not attempt to say what the exact size of the different rooms shall be, because of the fact that in the remodeling and reconstruction of the depot it will be necessary to take into account to some extent the present dimensions of the building, and the architect would necessarily have to vary to a considerable ex - tent from any definite figures laid down by the Commission. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that the defendant should file with the Commission, within thirty days from the date hereof, full plans and specifications for reconstruction and enlargement of said depot, and that when said plans and specifications have been accepted by the Commission, said reconstruction and enlargement should be completed by September 1, 1914. Said plans should pro - vide for all modern conveniences, including electric lights, both in the depot and on the platform, water, sanitary toilet rooms, and a hot water, steam or furnace heating plant. The platforms and sidewalks should all be of brick, cement, or other material equally durable. When said remodelling and construction is completed, the building will serve the community for at least ten or fifteen years, without much added expense, and, therefore, all the work that is done at the present should be first class in every respect.

FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 196 Percy Gardner, Complainant, vs. Archer Independent Telephone Associa- tion, Defendant ORDER Appearances: For Complainant, F. A. Bald For Defendant, E. Hansen, I. D. VanPelt, E. W. Lehr and Albert Grier. Taylor, Commissioner: Defendant is a mutual telephone company with headquarters at Archer, Nebraska. At the time of the filing of this complaint it had forty-four stockholders, who constituted the number of subscribe the service rendered by the company. The association owns no switchboard, but has an arrangement with the Nebraska Telephon • Company at Central City whereby such service is performed for ;: monthly charge. For every ten subscribers to the service of defend - ant, the Nebraska Telephone Company furnishes a trunk line from Archer to Central City, there being four such circuits at the present Complainant is a farmer residing seven miles northeast of Arch.-r Desiring telephone service, and being in the territory served by de - fendant, he made application for such service, offering to take ■ share of stock and to pay for the construction of a stub line to th nearest point on defendant's line running into that neighborhood. There are three other land-owners in the same vicinity who joined him in the application. The application was refused by the com - pany, for the reason that there are at the present time two circuits, or four wires, on the pole line with which Mr. Gardner would ha . to make connection, these wires being tied direct to the poles, no cross-arms being used. The addition of another circuit would r sitate the placing of cross-arms on this line for a distance of fiw miles, the expense of which is estimated at approximately $3u As a further reason for declining to take complainant on the lin defendant pointed to the fact that the line is already loaded beyond </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 the limits specified by the rules of the association, which provide for not over ten subscribers to each line. The line at present serves fifteen patrons, the rule in this instance being suspended by agree - ment of the subscribers. The company has not sufficient funds in its treasury for the reconstruction of the line and the only way such funds could be secured would be by assessment of the other stock - holders. Complainant contends that he is in the territory served by defendant, and for that reason is entitled to service on the same terms as has been extended to all other members of the association While there are other companies in adjoining communities, there are none from whom it would be practicable for complainant to secure service. Upon the final refusal of the company to grant the applica tion, Mr. Gardner filed a complaint with the Commission. the foregoing facts were established at a hearing held in Central Nebraska, on July 5, 1913. In view of the fact that defendan iny is a mutual organization, and rents no telephones, the on is presented as to the authority of the Commission to re the company to satisfy the complaint. This matter was re to the attorney general's department and Attorney Genera Martin submits the following opinion with reference thereto: Lincoln, December 20, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Your communication of September 5th has heretofore been answered by me orally, but a further request is made by you that the same be answered in writing. Your question is as follows: "Does this Commission have authority to compel a mutual telephone company, as distinguished from a common carrier, to extend its lines within the limits of the territory which it pre - sumably occupies to the exclusion of other companies, upon demand of prospective patrons who are willing to comply with the governing rules of said mutual company?" The record ot the evidence, which you have furnished me, shows that this company does not purpose doing a business generally, but it limits its business to its own members and does not undertake to serve the public generally for hire. On November 18, 1910, I advised your department that a telephone company organized solely for private purposes, or for the purpose of accommodating its own members and which is prohibited by its articles of incorporation from renting telephones to the public or in any manner serving the public, does not come under the provisions of law which requires the State Railway Commission to authorize it to issue stock, bonds, and other forms of indebtedness. On April 11, 1911, I further advised your department that private telephone lines, constructed for the convenience of the owners and not for hire to the public, do not come within the requirements of the physical valuation act. If the company referred to by yo was undertaking to serve the public for hire, it would be amenable to both of the pro - visions referred to in these two former communications. But, as I understand the record, it does not undertake to serve the nn hli (* unfJ h (*n cc 1 is not 11 DuV'lic c T*ripr or ft rn'^lif* n^-, ;„ </seg>
            <seg id="p113">113 corporation in the sense in which these terms are used in the statutes. The record shows that for this company to do what is re- quired of it would entail an expenditure of several hundred dollars, and I know of no way by which this money could he raised except by compelling each member of this association of private lines to submit to an assessment for that purpose. 1 have looked among the authorities for a case similar to this. and have been unable to find one. I know it is argued that because some of the lines of this issociation occupy the public highways, this company ought to be compelled to put in lines, connect up, and furnish service to any person located near by and wishing the same. But, on the other hand, this company has refused to offer its lines to the public for compensation. Having refused to do this, I know &gt;f no rule or authority by which I could advise that your "ommission order this company to extend its lines upon the demands of prospective patrons. Should you make such an order, I know of no adjudication which might sustain it or methods by which it might be enforced. Yours very truly, Signed; Grant C. Martin, Attorney General. It is clearly the conclusion of Attorney General Martin that the nission has no jurisdiction over strictly mutual companies, and an order requiring defendant to extend its service to Mr. Gard - ;ould be ineffective and void. This interpretation of the law is ted by the Commission, and a finding will be made in accord - therewith. While accepting this construction of the law, which exempts mutual organizations from the obligations imposed upon individuals and corporations who engage in the same class of business for profit, the Commission is convinced that its application in cases of this kind leads to substantial injustice. Whether the state should permit a certain number of individuals in a community to associate them - selves together for the purpose of securing telephone service, such association having unrestricted power to limit its number of members, while at the same time it occupies the field to the exclusion of all other companies, is a broad question of public interest which should command thoughtful consideration. If defendant were engaged in the business of furnishing telephone service for a compensation, the authority of the Commission to require it to furnish such service to all within the zone it covers would be unquestioned. The state permits a common carrier reasonable compensation for the service it performs, but in return demands that this service must be extended without discrimination to «U who may apply, provided the circum - stances incident to the extension of such service do not entail an excessive expense or are not contrary to customary and reasonable practice. If the defendant in this case were a common carrier it would not be a proper defense to this complaint to plead extra expense incident to the placing of cross-arms on the line in question, for the reason that such an improvement would be in line with the natural prowth of the plant and a proper method from an enpneer- </seg>
            <seg id="p114">114 ing standpoint, of meeting such development. The company would rebuild the line to accommodate the added business just as it would replace a small switchboard with a larger one if the traffic increased to a point where it became necessary to do so; and it would be within the discretion of the Commission to require it to do so if for any reason it declined. In the case under consideration, however, forty-four people join in an agreement to secure telephone service on certain terms and by so doing make it practically impossible for any other individual or corporation to engage in the same business in the same territory. At the same time these forty-four citizens refuse to extend the service thus provided to other citizens, and the latter by reason of this fact are permanently cut off from the privileges and benefits of telephone communication, while the forty-four in - dividuals have joined in a partnership for the conduct of a private business, yet they have made use of the public highways and to that extent enjoy a franchise which subjects them to a greater or less degree of public control and supervision, the grant, at the same time, carrying with it an obligation to the public which should be satisfied in a manner that is without color of discrimination. It is without any desire to minimize the benefits that flow from the organization of mutual companies that the Commission directs attention to this condition. Community co-operation in enterprises of this character is frequently highly desirable. In fact, there is reason for believing that it has been beneficial in this particular community. It is only when the co-operation benefits a certain number of people to the exclusion of others that it becomes a matter for public regulation. The matter is of sufficient importance that the Commission is of the opinion that it should be called to the attention of the next legislature for such consideration and remedy - as that body may deem proper and wise. For the reasons referred to the complaint will be dismissed. LIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein be, the same hereby is, dismissed.

But, in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision. Section 6107, Revised Statutes of 1913, provides that "The Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and service of and to exercise a general control over all railroads —engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers for hire within the state." The Commission is of the opinion that the term "Service," as used in the Constitution and Statute above quoted, should be taken and used in its broadest and most inclusive sense, and thereby in - cludes equipment and facilities. Placing this construction upon the term "Service," the Commission will not have to look farther than the Constitution and Statute above quoted for authority sufficient to give it jurisdiction in this case. Section 6112, Revised Statutes of 1913, provides that "The Commission shall have the power, and it shall be its duty to fix for all or any connecting lines of railroad in this state reasonable joint rates of freight charges, terminal switching charges for the various classes of freight and cars that may pass over two or more lines of such railroads, • • • It must inevitably follow that the Commission has power to do ings necessary to be done in order to accomplish the legislative ; and that with power to make joint rates, and clothed with s both by the Constitution and legislative enactments to regu - ervice, it has full and complete power to order such facilities as be reasonably necessary to put into effect any joint service or rates which it might establish. Going back once more to the Constitution: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers, as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision. Here we find that the Commission has jurisdiction over "Ser - vice" "as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers and per - form the duties enumerated herein." The Constitution alone, in the absence of specific legislation pertaining to service, confer the jurisdiction upon the Commission and clothes it with full power over the matter now before it, but the legislature has specifically spoken, and having spoken, there should be no reasonable doubt a? to the jurisdiction of the Commission. Section 6025, Revised Stat - utes of 1913, provides that "All railroad companies in this state, at all points of con- nection, intersection or crossing the grade of different railroads, where it is Dmcticsble sh&amp;ll provide renson&amp;ble h m d!&lt;? And </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 qual facilities, by track connection, passenger platforms and otherwise, for transferring cars, passengers and property between heir respective roads without unreasonable delay; and at any &gt;lace where the tracks of the two railroad companies are within ive hundred feet apart, whether on the same grade or not, where t is practicable and deemed reasonably necessary, the State iailway Commission, upon the application of any interested person, may require such track connection." From the foregoing the Commission is of the opinion that the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction should be and the same is hereby overruled. The only limitation then upon the promulgation of an order by the Commission for the installation of a transfer switch is that it shall be reasonable under all the facts and cir - cumstances. In the Minnesota case herein referred to, the Supreme Court of the United States said: "Taking the facts which we have already enumerated into consideration, we think there is no justification furnished for the argument that the judgment if enforced would violate any of the constitutional rights of the plaintiff in error. In so deciding we do not at all mean to hold that under no circumstances could a judgment enforcing track connections between two railroad corporations be a violation of the constitutional rights of one or the other, or possibly of both, of such corporations. "It would depend upon the facts surrounding the cases in regard to which the judgment was given. The reasonableness of the judgment with reference to the facts concerning each case must be a material, if not the controlling, factor upon the question of its validity. * * * We think this case is a reasonable exercise of the power of regulation in favor of the interests and for the accommodation of the public, and that it does not, regard being had to the facts, unduly, unfairly or improperly affect the pecuniary rights or interests of the plaintiff in error." The city of Nelson is the county seat of Nuckolls county, located at the terminus of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Rail - way Company's line known as the Nelson branch, and is 51 miles west of Fairbury and 21 miles west of Deshler. It is also located on the branch line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad, which connects the main line of the said C. B. &amp; Q. at Superior, Nebraska, with its lines at Edgar, Nebraska, and is 14 miles north of Superior and 13 miles south of Edgar and 70 miles, by way of the Burlington, southeast of Hastings. The main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. from Denver to St. Joe and Kansas City passes through the town of Superior; the Missouri Pacific railroad, known as the Prosser branch, extends from Prosser through Hastings, Superior and to points in Kansas, St. Joe and Kansas City, Missouri. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company's line, known as the Superior branch, ex - tend? from Superior to Fremont. The town of Deshler is located on the so-called Nelson branch of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, approxi - mately 20 miles east of Nelson and 31 miles west of Fairbury. All carload traffic originating west and southwest of Superior and Hast - ings on the Burlington line, or connecting carriers, destined to Desh - ler, must under the present traffic arrangement be delivered to the </seg>
            <seg id="p119">119 C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company at Fairbury, thereby making an out-of-line haul on the shipments of from 75 to 100 miles. Carload shipments originating at Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific stations on the Nelson branch, destined to stations on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company's lines and connecting carriers must be given a back haul to Fairbury before delivery to the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad can be made. Superior, Nebraska, is the northern terminus of the A. T. &amp; S. F. Railway Company. The Missouri Pacific Railway Company has a line of railway entering Superior. All traffic coming from these two lines of railroad under the present track connection arrangement must be delivered to the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company by some connecting carrier at Fairbury, Nebraska, thereby making an out-of-line haul of approximately one hundred miles. The same is true of any carload shipments that originate on the Nelson branch of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company destined to A. T. &amp; S. F. or Missouri Pacific stations in Kansas and other points south or west. t Under the present tariff arrangements on almost all carload C this out-of-line haul makes a greater transportation charge, if a joint track arrangement was established between the de - ints herein, this, in the opinion of the Commission, would tate the service, reduce the operating costs to the carrii - well as reduce the transportation charge to the consignors and consignees doing business with or at stations on the Nelson branch of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company. The Commission has given careful consideration to the probable cost of the installation of the switch. The engineering department of the Commission made a careful examination of the probable location of said switch. Said engineering department's report was filed with the Commission on February 25, 1914. It was recom - mended to the Commission that the most practical place to install a connecting switch between the lines of the defendants herein is at a point directly northwest of the present railroad crossing. The approximate cost of installation of said connecting switch, according to the engineer's report, is $3,000.00. In view of the fact that the engineer's report to the Commission shows that no unusual or abnormal conditions exist at the present time in the way of build - ings or other structures to be moved in order that a connecting switch may be installed at the point indicated, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that it is entirely practicable and feasible to construct a connecting switch between the lines of the defendants herein just northwest of the intersection of their lines at Nelson. There still remains the question to be considered by the Com - mission as to whether the amount of traffic to be transferred between the defendant carriers at Nelson is of sufficient volume to justify the ordering in of the connecting switch prayed for. Witness H. J. Struve, manager of the complainant company, the Deshler Broom </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 Factory, testified that they had a large investment in the said broom factory located at Deshler, Nebraska; that his factory employs from 65 to 86 people; that the town of Deshler has a population of about 800 and has one bank, four general stores, two blacksmith shops and one machine shop; that the Lutheran high school and college is a new institution recently constructed, at a cost up to the present time of about $50,000.00, and that when completed said cost will be about $250,000.00. The record shows that there are large milling and elevator industries located at stations on the Nelson branch of the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company; that these milling and elevator industries handle large quantities of grain; that said milling industries are limited in their grain supply to the grain that is tributary to the stations on the Nelson branch of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway exclusively; that if the connecting switch prayed for is installed said milling industries will be enabled to purchase grain at stations on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railway in the western parts of Nebraska and Kansas; that by reason of the back haul heretofore mentioned, under the present connecting switch arrangement said milling and elevator industries cannot compete with industries located on other lines of railroad having a greater territory from which to draw their grain supply. The record shows that there is now in the course of construction at Superior, Nebraska, a cement plant, which is to cost when completed $760,000.00. A large quantity of cement and products of the cement mill may be shipped to stations on the Nelson branch of the defend - ant C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company on a competing basis if the said connecting switch at Nelson is constructed. If cement produced at Superior has to be handled by the defendants by way of Fair - bury, the amount of the rate will make it impossible for the Superior cement to be laid down at Nelson branch C. R. I. &amp; P. stations on a competing basis. It is impossible for the Commission to estimate how much traffic would be delivered to the connecting switch prayed for, but the Commission is of the opinion that the establishment of said switch would tend to increase the volume of traffic going to and coming from stations on the Nelson branch of the defendant C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company. The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the Deshler Broom Factory and other consignees and consignors located on the Nelson branch of the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company are entitled to the relief prayed for. On the date heretofore mentioned a hearing was held at Nelson on the application to have transfer switch connections installed at Nora, Nebraska, between the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Rail - way Company and the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company. As shown herein, the Commission has found that a transfer switch should be established at Nelson, Nebraska, between the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company and the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad Company, which, in the estimation of the Commission will materially benefit the wi***»*a^w*»#** win uiobciiaiij ucucui&gt; vile </seg>

The C. &amp; N. W. Railway Company's line of railroad extends approximately but twelve miles beyond Nora to the southwest, and the amount of traffic going to or coming from the said C. &amp; N. W. Railway Company would be a very small volume. The Commission is therefore of the opinion, and so finds, that the application for the installation of a connecting switch at Nora should be dismissed and said application is hereby dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State ray Commission that the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Rail- Company and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Com - be and they are hereby directed and ordered to jointly construct nsfer track, connecting the line of the said Chicago, Burlington lincy railroad with the line of the said Chicago, Rock Island &amp; ,c railroad at a point as near as practicable to the point of lection of their tracks at the town of Nelson, Nebraska, and to lete the same ready for use on or before 120 days from June 1, and to so construct the same as to render convenient the fer of cars from one road to the other.

They further allege that the first train by which people from the aforesaid towns can reach Platts - mouth leaves Union, which is the junction point between the Lincoln branch of the defendant herein and the main line of its road leading from Nebraska City, Plattsmouth, and Omaha, at 4:25 p. m.. and that from Union to Plattsmouth there is but one other train, at 5:25 a. m., by which passengers from Mynard and Murray, both of which towns are located in Cass county between Union and Platts - mouth, can reach their county seat, and that there is no train south out of Plattsmouth by which passengers may return the same day. Ehe complainants ask that a motor car be put on, which would Union about 9:20 a. m., reaching Plattsmouth about 10:30 and return in the afternoon so as to make connections with ncoln branch train which runs through the towns of Nehawka, ng Water, Wabash, Elmwood and Eagle. A hearing was held at the office of the Commission on the 19th day of September, at which all interested parties were represented. At said hearing the defendant herein submitted a statement of all passengers carried on trains Nos. 638 and 639, said trains being those that run between Lincoln and Union on what is known as the Lincoln branch.

(he testimony conclusively showed that the present passenger schedules, from the above towns to Lincoln, Omaha, St. Joseph, is City, and all other points north, south and west, are tly satisfactory and should not be changed, and that the only y to accommodate passengers wishing to go to Plattsmouth and the same day would be an extra train or motor. A careful study of the passenger train schedules of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company over its line running into Lincoln, Omaha, Falls City, Weeping Water and Plattsmouth, has been made, and a further study as to the connections of the Missouri Pacific passenger trains with those of the Burlington at Louisville, has also been made. It was found that Missouri Pacific train No. 137 leaves Falls City in the morning for Omaha by the way of Auburn, Weeping Water and Louisville. Said train arrives at Louisville at 9:07 a. m. This train makes connection with the trains from Lincoln at Weeping Water.' All passengers from Eagle, Elmwood and Wabash are able to reach Louisville at 9:07 a. m. Passengers from Nehawka can reach Weeping Water on No. 635, which runs from Union to Lincoln at 6:06 a. m., and then leave there at 8:40 on No. 137 for Louisville Kt has also been found that Burlington train No. 34 leaves ville at 9:10 a. m. and makes connections at Oreapolis with a train which runs to Plattsmouth and returns in the afternoon, ngers from Louisville and Oreapolis to Plattsmouth have about lours in Plattsmouth, and then are able to return to Louisville e afternoon of the same day.

Upon recommendation of the Commission the Missouri Pacific Railway Company has so rearranged its schedule of No. 137 so that it now reaches Louisville at 8:50 a. m., and passengers from the said towns are able to reach Plattsmouth in the forenoon, remain there about five hours, and return in the afternoon of the same day. The Commission realizes that this is not the most desirable service, but considering the light passenger traffic, and that the train sched - ules in all other respects are adequate to take care of the passenger traffic over the lines of the defendant, the Commission does not feel justified in requiring the defendant to furnish additional passenger train service into Plattsmouth.

SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER Finding and Order Vacating the Order Herein Hall, Commissioner: Upon the recommendation of the Commission in the order herein referred to, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company changed the schedule of its train No. 137, running between Falls City and Omaha by the way of Weeping Water and Louisville, so that said train would reach Louisville not later than 8:50 a. m., thereby making a reasonable connection with Burlington train east No. 34, which leaves Louisville at 9:10 a. m. The schedule has been in effect since that date, but numerous complaints have been filed by citizens of Lincoln, owing to the fact that in the change of the schedule of said train, it was necessary for the defendant's train east, No. 634, out of Lincoln, to leave Lincoln at 6:45 instead of 7 o'clock a. m. This made the leaving time of said train before the arrival of certain street cars in Lincoln at the station of said company, and thereby discommoded many passengers by not being able to reach said train by the Lincoln street car service. k petition signed by many citizens and business houses of protesting against said change, has been filed with the Com - and the said company filed an application to have said case, , re-opened. Accordingly, the Commission notified all parties ■d in the case and fixed Wednesday, June 17, 1914, tt 10 ei. m., at the offices of the Commission for hearing.

The result of the study showed there were total tickets sold from Lincoln to Auburn, Ne - braska, for the first period, 356, for the second period, 245, making a decrease in tickets sold for the same period of time, 111, and a decrease in value of $157.62. For the same period of time, tickets sold for the first period to Nebraska City were 900, for the second period of time 741, making a decrease in tickets sold 159 and a decrease in value of $184.44. The tickets sold to Weeping Water for the first period were 859, for the second period 670, making a decrease of 189 tickets and a decrease in the revenue of $132.30. The tickets sold to Eagle, Nebraska, for the same period of time were 841 for the first period and 728 for the second period, making a decrease in tickets sold of 113, and a decrease in the revenue of $36.16. Tickets sold to Elmwood for the first period of time were 721. and for the second period 637, a decrease of tickets sold 84, and decrease in revenue $40.92.

            <seg id="p127">127 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. Ml P. J. Postle, Complainant, vs ficago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. ORDER Appearances: James T. Begley, for Complainant Kesse L. Root, for Defendant. ir. Commissioner: Complainant is the owner of a quarter section of land situated about two miles east of the town of Chalco, Sarpy county, Nebraska, and adjacent to defendant's trunk line from Omaha to Lincoln. Said line of railroad enters complainant's farm near the northwest corner and leaves the same at a point near the northeast corner, after describing a more or less irregular curve, the tract thu - off from the main portion of the farm containing about seven acres. The public highway extends along the northern line of the farm and also along the eastern boundary. Complainant's house, barn and other farm buildings are located near the northwest corner of the farm and about 150 feet south of the railroad track. At this point there is a hill, on the southern slope of which the buildings are lo - cated and through which the defendant company found it necessary to make a deep cut of approximately 1,000 feet in length. This hill falls abruptly to the south and east to the bed of a branch of Papillion creek. The land east of the buildings is quite low and marshy. At the eastern end of the cut referred to and a short distance east of the buildings defendant has established a private farm crossing for the use of complainant. Complainant asks for an overhead crossing or bridge at a point directly north of his buildings, in lieu of the grade crossing that has been in use since the railroad was established. Complainant alleges that the grade crossing is inadequate, dangerous and inconvenient. Located at the eastern end of the cut, it is impossible to see a train approaching from the west, the difficulty being increased because the track curves through the cut and the banks or walls of the same obstruct the view. The view to the east is clear for about eighty rods. The crossing affords complainant his only means of access to the public highway. The low ground to the east is occasionally flooded and for a greater portion of the time is wet and marshy so that it would be impossible to maintain a road - way to connect with the highway on the east except at excessive cost. Complainant further alleges that he deals extensively in live stock and for that reason more than the ordinary number of people visit his place and thus have to make use of the crossing.

            <seg id="p128">128 there are gates at either side of the crossing which it is necessary to open and close whenever the crossing is used. For answer to the complaint defendant alleges that the present grade crossing was agreed to by the owner of the land, Mr. Bartelles, at the time the right-of-way was secured and the road constructed and that it was a part of the agreement at that time that in lieu of an overhead crossing Mr. Bartelles was to be given two grade cross - ings, one at either end of the cut; that Mr. Postle, the complainant, purchased the land subject to that agreement and cannot now be heard to complain; that the Commission has no jurisdiction in the matter; that the expense of an overhead crossing would be excessive and its maintenance would incur a burden upon the company not justified by the requirements of the situation; and that the con - struction of an overhead crossing would be impractical because of the steep approach that would be necessary on the south side. The evidence adduced at the hearing shows clearly that the present crossing is dangerous and a menace not only to Mr. Postle and the members of his family and those who have occasion to use it but that it is a menace to the safe operation of defendant's trains The road leading to the crossing from the public highway on the north follows a course along the eastern side of the hill mentioned so that it is impossible to see a train coming from the west until one is right upon the track. The same obstruction prevents a view from the road leading from the south. The curve of the roa&lt; through the cut further obscures the view and renders it impossibl for a person standing in the middle of the track to see an eastbound train at a greater distance than a few hundred feet. The evidence discloses that there are from fifteen to twenty passenger and mail trains over this line every twenty-four hours and that most of them attain a speed of fifty miles an hour at this point. Several head of stock have been killed at the crossing and complainant testified that he had narrowly escaped being caught by a fast train while trying to cross the track in an automobile. Defendant's engineer admitted on the stand that the crossing is not safe and stated that he had previously recommended and offered to construct a crossing farther east. Section 10575, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, 1911, reads as fol- "When any person owns land on both sides of any railroad, the corporation owning such railroad shall, when required so to do, make and keep in good repair one causeway or other ade- quate means of crossing the same." Section 10571, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, 1911, also pro - vides: "That every railroad corporation whose lines of road or any part thereof is open for use, shall, within six months after the passage of this act, and every railroad company formed or to be formed, but whose lines are not now open for use, shall, within si a riiuiiLiis alter me uittra ui sum raurudu ur any p»i t iiieicui </seg>
            <seg id="p129">129 are open, erect, and thereafter maintain, fences on the sides of their said railroad, or the part thereof so open for use, suitable and amply sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep and hojp from getting on the said railroad, except at the crossings of public roads and highways, and within the limits of towns, cities, and villages, with openings, or gates, or bars at all the farm crossings of such railroacs for the use of the proprietors of the Ian s a( joining such railroad." Bhe jurisdiction of the Railway Commission, with reference to nforcement of the foregoing, is conveyed in Section 10650, iy's Annotated Statutes, 1911, which reads as follow "The Commission shall investigate any and all cases of alleged neglect or violations of the laws of the state by any ailway company, cr common carrier subject to the provisions lereof, doing business in this state, or by the officers, agents or employees thereof, and take such action with reference thereto as may be provided herein, or under the laws of this state pro - vic'ing for the regulation of railway companies or common carriers." Khe three sections establish clearly the authority of the Com - n with reference to complaints of this nature and answer de - it's argument that complainant should have applied to the for relief rather than to the Commission. While the crossing under consideration is a private crossing it may be a matter of public concern for all that. Because of this fact it does not logically follow that such a crossing "does not rise to the dignity of a way over which the public have any authority or the courts any concern so far as the public may be concerned," as de - fendant contends. In State v. Mason City &amp; Ft. Dodge Railway Co., 52 N. W. 490, the supreme court of Iowa, in discussing an action brought under a statute very similar to the one invoked in this case. "The public has such a right or interest in the "adequate means of crossing' a railroad, * * * * that it may compel the company to otserve its c.uty, where the track civi^es a pasture so that it is necessary that the owner's stock cross the track The court says further "Our conclusions, then, are that the railroai commissioners, in cases where a person owns land on both si.es of a railroad, have authority to make inquiry and ore ers as to an adequate means of crossing the same, anc that a violation of the law by the corporation in respect thereto involves a public right. ' ■The same court, in the case of Cray v. Railroad Co., 37 Iowa, held that the landowner had the right to ready access to the ic highway, commenting on this point as follows: "The railroad has thus, as far as the evidence shows, in - terposed itself between plaintiff and the highway, and leaving him egress only through two ill-constructeo. ana heavy gates. Every time that he or any member of his family has occasion to leave the premises, whether upon business or pleasure, the way lies through these barriers, which constitute the only means of reaching the county, town, or elections, or school meetings, or church, or of making a family visit to a neighbor." 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 The case of Bankhead v. Brown, 25 Iowa, 540, is quoted in that opinion as follows: "Without a road, or the means of getting a road, to the farm of a citizen, he could not well obey the venire that com - mands him to attend at the court as a juror, could not well pay his taxes, vote, reach the church, or send his children to school. Hence, the state may properly provide for the estab - lishment of a public road or highway to enable every citizen to discharge his duties. The state is not bound to allow its citizens to be walled in, isolated, imprisoned, but may provide them a way of deliverance." While speaking thus emphatically on the question of the public's interest in a private crossing, the court made it clear in the opinions quoted, and in others not here referred to, that each case of this kind must be determined by its own facts. In State v. Chicago, M. * St. P. Ry. Co., 53 N. W. 254, for example, it is said "that grade crossings are the rule in this state," owing to the topography of the state and the usual size of farms, such crossings for that reason being "usually adequate." The landowner's rights under the statute are limited by the term "adequate." If the crossing in use is "adequate" for the purposes designed by the statute he cannot be heard to complain, notwithstanding it may be inconvenient be - cause of the character of the use to which he puts it. State v. Burlington, C. R. &amp; N. Ry. Co., 68 N. W. 818. This brings us, therefore, to the question as to whether the cross - ing involved in this case is adequate, and, if not, whether the remedy asked for by complainant is practical and curative. In the case of O. A R. V. R. Co. v. Severin, 30 Neb. 318, the supreme court of this state says: "The right of an owner of land on both sides of a railroad to an adequate means of crossing from one part of the land ;o the other, doubtless within the meaning of the statute, mplies the right of such owner to such means of crossing, with any domestic animals under his control. But a careful reading of the fifty sections of the sub-chapter, fails to indicate that it was in the legislative mind to provide for unherded animals wandering from one side of a railroad to the other. Neither cattle nor animals are mentioned in the statute, and, as we have seen, the ownership nor possession of cattle adds to :he right of an owner of lands to adequate means of crossing: the conclusion is therefore not only logical but irresistible that a means of crossing that is adequate for one owner of land on aoth sides of a railroad is, in contemplation of he statute, adequate for all such owners. If not, then such adequacy depends upon the character of the railroad track and right of way between the lands of such owners whether level, cut, or fill, not upon the use of the land on either side of the railroad, nor upon the possession of cattle by such owner." Ender this interpretation of the statute the fact that the com - nt in this case is a dealer in live stock and for that reason ore occasion to use the crossing, would not entitle him to any nt kind of crossing than is furnished by defendant to other </seg>
            <seg id="p131">131 ■owners whose farms are divided by defendant's road and who not be such extensive dealers in cattle and live stock. The crossing involved in the case quoted was used only for the purpose of getting from one field to another or to admit the passage of stock from the farm buildings to a pasture. Plaintiff had ready access to the public highway in other directions and the railroad was not a barrier from that standpoint. It is important to observe, however, that in the concluding sentence of the paragraph quoted above the court indicates that there might be reasons, exclusive of the use to which the crossing is to be put, which would justify a different kind of crossing. These reasons might be found in the con - formation of the land through which the road is constructed, as to whether there are cuts, embankments, curves, hills, etc. In other words, the physical conditions surrounding the crossings might make the ordinary type inadequate. It is just such conditions that make the crossing involved in this case undesirable and inadequate. In State v. Burlington, C. R. A. N. Ry. Co., supra, the court dis - cusses the so-called "Cutler Case," in which the board of railroad commissioners had ordered the construction of an undercrossing on a farm where the railroad crossed on an eight-foot embankment. The court said: " Here we have a case presenting an exception to the general rule of grade crossings. Owing to the height of the embankment and the fact that safety requires gates at farm crossings, the grade crossing was not regarded adequate, and therefore the other was ordered. It was because of the embank - ment that traversed Mr. Cutler"s land that it was held im - practicable to have an adequate crossing at grade. An under crossing was deemed the only adequate means under the circum- stances, and therefore it was ordered." It is because of the deep cut and the curve on Mr. Postle's land it is "impracticable to have an adequate crossing at the grade'' e present location. It is an exceptional condition and one which egislature evidently intended to cover when it used the broad "adequate." In the case of Herrstrom v. Newton A. N. W. o., 105 N. W. 436, the court says: "If then, the grade crossing was impracticable as an adequate means of crossing from one portion of the farm to the other, as the jury found, it must be rejected and the overhead crossing, conceded to be adequate, adopted in its stead, even though this may be at considerable expense to the railroad company. I It is clear from the foregoing that the term "adequate" is ■iently broad to cover the case in hand and that measured by interpretation, the crossing under consideration does not comply the law. This brings us to the proposition as to whether an overhead crossing would correct the present unsatisfactory condition. If practicable a viaduct would be a complete remedy, as it would re - move all possibility of dancer bv placini? the traffic beyond any </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 likelihood of interference from passing trains. On that account it should be constructed unless the physical difficulties are insurmount - able. The north bank of the cut is sufficiently high to permit of a clearance of twenty-two feet between the rails and the bridge, the minimum of clearance which the company regards as safe, but the south bank, although about equal in height at the edge, falls away so rapidly to the south that the approach would have a grade of 12 per cent. This minimum grade can only be secured by turning sharply to the west after leaving the bridge and following the incline of the hill parallel to the track for a considerable distance. An approach directly south from the bridge would be still more steep and the embankment would fall between complainant's house and barn. The findings of defendant's engineers with respect to the above conditions were confirmed by the Commission's engineers and by a personal inspection by a member of the Commission. A grade of 12 per cent is a serious handicap to any roadway, although it is not necessarily impassable, as is evidenced by the approach to the overhead crossing on the public highway two and one-half miles west of Chalco, this approach ha\ing a grade of 12.72 per cent. Being located on a public highway, the presumption is that it is used for general traffic. While this sharp climb to the viaduct, therefore, would render such a crossing inconvenient it would not prevent its use and the inconvenience would be more than offset by the added safety. Mr. Fostle offers to do all the grading necessary in the construction of the approaches and to maintain them there - after. The Commission is of the opinion that he should also enter into an agreement whereby he shall waive all rights he may now have to any other crossing over defendant's tracks on his land. If for any reason he may decide in the future that the overhead crossing is not satisfactory, he should not be heard to demand of defendant another crossing. ■For the reasons assigned the complaint will be sustained and an r issued accordingly. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company be, and the same hereby is, required to construct and hereafter maintain on the northeast quarter of section nineteen, township fourteen, range twelve, in Sarpy county, Nebraska, an overhead crossing or bridge over its tracks, the same to be located at a point most advantageous for such structure, said overhead crossing to be in lieu of and to replace the present grade crossing now maintained by defendant on said land, it being a con - dition of this order that the earth approaches to said overhead cross - ing be constructed by complainant, I . J. Postle.

FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 209 McCook Irrigation A Water Power Com pany, Complainant, vs Pauline M. Burtless et al.. Defendant* ORDER Appearances: C. E. Eldred, for Complainant. Br. S. Morlan, for Defendants, e, Chairman: This is a petition by the complainant for authority to increase the maintenance charges of water right holders from $1.00 to $2.00 an acre per year. ' Complainant is operating and maintaining an irrigation ditch, about nineteen and one-half miles in length along the Republican river in Hitchcock and Dundy counties between Culbertson and McCook, Nebraska. Its claim and appropriation of 143 second feet was allowed by the State Board of Irrigation as of date December 22, 1890. We are advised that the State Board of Irrigation, in passing upon water appropriations for irrigation purposes figures on seventy acres to one second foot. If this is correct, there were about ten thousand acres subject to irrigation from the canal as originally projected. It was estimated at the hearing that from five thousand to six thousand acres could be irrigated from the ditch as it now stands. There was no evidence as to the original cost, save and except that the ditch was built by the C. H. Graham Irrigation &amp; Water Power Company as a construction proposition, and that the complainant company issued them about $50,000.00 of stock for the same on or about March 10, 1893. It was also testified that $10,000.00 precinct aid bonds were voted, but who received the same is not shown by the record. Mr. Kelley, the present secretary, testified: </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 "The books would indicate that Mr. Meeker was paid $57,500.00 for his construction work, and how much more, of course, I do not know, because I am not familiar with the earlier items." gin 1903 the stock of the company was purchased by Messrs. nson and Kelley, at approximately 30 cents on the dollar. These es hold all the stock with the exception of eighteen shares. A [ proportion only of the owners of property subject to irrigation r the ditch have purchased water rights or rented water.

            <seg id="p136">136 The water deeds issued by the plaintiff contained inter alia the following clause, to- wit: "Sixth. The said first party agrees to keep and maintain said main canal or ditch, and any or all of its reservoirs, in ;ood order and condition, and in case of accident to the same, o repair th injury thereby occasioned as soon as practicable ind expedient; and the company shall have a right to assess or the ordinary expense of maintaining, repairing and superin - tending said canal, and any and all reserv irs connected there - with, a sum not exceeding $1.00 per annum, payable on April st of the year for which said assessment is made." Biefendants insist that this is a contract which the Commission hout power to modify, annul or enforce. Plaintiff's accounts have been kept in a cash book, check book and a receipt stub book. With but few exceptions, an examination of same by a person unacquainted with the actual facts would not disclose what expense items were properly chargeable to maintenance and what to capital account. Exhibits were prepared by plaintiff and introduced in evidence which purported to contain all items of revenue and only those items of expense properly chargeable to main - tenance, covering a period of four years, from April 1, 1909, to April 1, 1913. A summary statement of these exhibits is as follows: Deficit for the four years, $8,847.12. Kt clearly appeared that several large items of expenditure not eable to maintenance were not included in said exhibits. Cer - items, such as the cost of the Kelley-Ferguson lateral, were nged by the defendants on the ground that all other water built their own laterals. This item, according to the evidence gated some $400.00, and for the purposes of this case will be ■d as a capital charge. E: further appeared from the evidence that all money received sale of perpetual water rights, in addition to the receipts from and maintenance dues, at least since April 1, 1897, has been in maintenance and upkeep, and that no dividends were ever Mr. Kelley, who has been associated with the plaintiff company, as superintendent or secretary, since 1897, estimates the necessary annual maintenance costs at $4,000.00 to $4,500.00.

            <seg id="p137">137 period above set forth, challenged by the defendants, it would appear that Mr. Kelley's estimate is not far from correct. |[t is clear that the canal is still subject to improvement, and considerable expense is caused each year by wash-outs, the filling e ditch by weeds, and other causes common to irrigation canals ally. I Defendants complained of plaintiff's failure to furnish water. Ninth Biennial Report o.' the State Board of Irrigation, for the d ending August 31, 1912, was offered in evidence by defendants, examination of same discloses that frequently there was in - ient water in the Republican and Frenchman rivers, which just west of plaintiff's headgate, to fill the appropriation of 141 d feet granted the plaintiff. No evidence was submitted of gauging* for 1913, but on account of the serious complaint against complainant for its failure to furnish water, we have examined the records in the office of the Board of Irrigation and find at Culbertson, just west of the junction of the Republican and Frenchman rivers, the following record: Republican River, for the months of July, August, September and Dry October, 1913, Frenchman River 1913 June 12 17.37 Second Feet 29.3 July 18 August 14 Sept. 13 17.35 14.34 Befendants also complained aintiff company in that it of discrimination on the part of favored the officers and owners of the plaintiff company owning land under the ditch by delivering to them more than their proportionate share of the water. The evi - dence is conflicting on this point. The officers of the company owned 1,120 acres of water rights out of 2,380 sold, and were therefore en - titled to the use of approximately one-half of the supply. It affirm - atively appears in the record that they were unable to irrigate a large portion of their land during the crop growing season of 1913 and that plaintiff endeavored to equitably distribute the water. If such dis - crimination actually existed, the injured parties have an action for damages in court. It is no defense to the present proceeding. The Commission will provide in this order for a proper regulation and dis - tribution of water in the future, and upon complaint and proof made of unjust discrimination occurring subsequent hereto, take the neces - sary steps to punish the guilty parties in the manner provided by Entiff will be required to keep a more elaborate and accurate of accounts, which will show in detail its revenues and ex - es and the exact nature thereof; second, a record of the water in its canal and the distribution thereof to the various sere. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 I defendants further complained that plaintiff refuses to allow to exchange or rotate their rights in times of shortage, thereby ng a good head of water to a particular user, with a result in and labor necessary for its economical and proper distribution, an see no good reason for refusing such request, when it can owed without prejudice or harm to other water users. Defendants concede that the Commission has jurisdiction "to sit when the question of the reasonableness of rates is to be de - termined," but insist that it has no power (a) "to annul, make or enforce contracts" or (b) "to inquire into the qualifications of con - tracting parties, or the reasonableness of a contract made and per- She defendants insist that they are the owners of the canal, te that portion of the water deeds which provides that when mpany shall have sold and have on hand water rights equal to tpacity of the company's ditch, and when the contract price sen paid, the title shall pass to the owners and holders of con - for such water rights. It is apparent that the title has not passed under the terms of the water deeds, for the reason that the contracts for the full appro - priation or the capacity of the ditch have not been sold and paid in full. After twenty years of operation only 2,380 acres of water rights have been sold and approximately only 400 additional acres of water rights have been rented. This, together with the fact, as disclosed by the record, that an attempt was made to organize an irrigation district to take over the ditch, would indicate that the possibilities of the sale of water rights and the use of water for irrigation purposes from this ditch have been exhausted. EJnder these circumstances are the owners of the canal, in law equity, obligated to maintain and operate it at a continual Do the provisions of the water deed, prescribing a $1.00 per maintenance fee, foreclose the applicant from seeking relief at ands of the Commission? At the time the contracts were entered into, the state by legisla - tion had not assumed the control of the rates and charges of irriga - tion companies. Nor had it specifically authorized irrigation com - panies to finally establish their own rates, or done anything to indi - cate that the state had waived its right to regulate rates or to con - trol the distribution of water. The parties to the contract were bound to know that the rates were subject to legislative control. The Supreme Court of the United States, in passing on a similar question in the case of Tampa Water Works Company vs. City of Tampa, 199 U. S. 201, held: A provision of a state constitution giving the legislature full power to correct abuses, and prevent unjust discrimination and excessive charges, is seif-executing to the extent that con - tracts made after it went into effect are subject to the possibility of t h p pxproisp of such power ' ' </seg>
            <seg id="p139">139 rhe Supreme Court of Colorado, in White vs. Farmers Highline &amp; Reservoir Co., 43 Pac, 1028, involving the identical question, "The law regulating water rights, being in the exercise of the police powers of the state, is paramount to a private con - tract, though such contract antedates the passage of the law, and rights given by the contract must yield when they are in contravention of the provisions of the statute." In Wiel on Water Rights in Western States, the author, while appearing to recognize a .doubt upon the law as to the proposition. "As to contracts made while there was no public rate. however, ithe public rate being adopted subsequently . the question is a difficult one. Since contracts are valid so long as public action is not taken i provided the contract rate is not discriminatory or excessive), subsequent assumption of ublic control might seem to impair the obligation of contracts, within the Federal constitution. On the other hand, it may be that the pos8ibili y of state control, be ng reserved by the constitution, entered into the contract, or the contract was made at the peril of later public action; moreover, there would be no uniformity of service (which is required by the constitutional declaration that the use is a public one) if some consumers paid according to contract and some according to the publicly fixed rates." Sec. 1321 |[f this Commission should hold that the contract rate should r for present holders of water deeds, and determine a different gher rate for subsequent purchasers, a clear case of discrimina - would follow, which could not be allowed to exist. Counsel for defendants cite cases, both state and federal, arising in California, in support of their contention. These cases are, how ever, not in point, for the reason that the California statutes clearly provide that the validity of such contracts shall not be affected by the statute. The Nebraska statute, defining the powers of this Com - mission in the regulation of the rates of irrigation companies, is general in its terms. It does not, like the California statutes, speci - fically except the rates provided in existing contracts, nor limit the powers of the Commission to companies thereafter organized. The only limitation is with respect to the works of irrigation distric As previously stated, defendants' attorney concedes trie jurisdic - tion of the Commission to determine cases where the reasonableness of rates is involved. While he fails to clearly define the cases he has in mind, it would seem that he is considering cases in which an excessive rate is involved. If such a contention is correct with reference to contracts which the Commission might find to exact an excessive rate, it is clear that the converse should be equally true, and the Commission should afford relief where the rates provided in the contracts are inadequate under the existing circumstances. This principle is recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Osborne vs. San Diego Land &amp; Town Company, 171 U. S., 22. In that case there were originally contracts fixing the </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 rates, and the ditch company was seeking to raise the maintenance rate from $3.50 to $7.00 per year. In its opinion the court says: " The annual rates for water as first fixed are not made irrevocable by a contract for the sale of water rights for a fixed sum, providing in addition for the payment of annual rates, to be fixed by the party of the first part ithe water company I as allowed by law." ■n the opinion, after stating the contention of the parties, the says with reference to the position taken by the Circuit Court; "The Circuit Court did not accept the distinction made by appellee. It did not accept the view contended for by appellants. It held, interpreting the Constitution and laws of the state, that the appropriation and disposition of water was a public use, the right to collect tolls or compensation for it a franchise, subject to regulation and control in the manner prescribed by law, and that such tolls and compensation could not be fixed by the contract of the parties." 1'urther, in answer to the evident contention of the defendants while the court might have jurisdiction to readjust the rates they were unreasonably high it would not have jurisdiction to jje the rate, the court says: "Its purpose is regulation, deliberate and judicial and &gt;eriodical regulation by a selected tribunal, and we cannot be - ieve that the legislature intends by an absolute and peremptory &gt;rovision to fix rates upon the water companies unalterable by ;hem, no matter what change in condition might supervene. Against rates which may become unreasonably high, the statute ;ives relief to consumers through petition to the board of super - visors. Rates which may become unreasonably low, it surely does not intend to impose on the companies forever, except as relief may come from th voluntary justice of its customers or &gt;y a violation of the statute and appeal to the courts. There is nothing in the act to indicate such purpose, nor does it need to have such purpose. Its dominant idea is the regulation of rates by law, not commanded to be exercised by the governing lodies as a voluntary duty as establishing rates in cities and towns, but exercised when invoked by petition." Kn the case of Stanislaus County vs. San Joaquin C. &amp; I. Co. ,192 201, the court says: "To regulate or establish rates for which water will be sup - plied is in its nature the execution of one of the powers of the state, and the right of the state so to do should not be regarded as parted with any sooner than the right of taxation should be so regarded, and the language of the alleged contract should in both cases be equally plain." I Complainant submitted additional authorities of like import l we need not discuss. We are convinced that in the absence of tatute waiving the right of the state to fix and regulate these the provisions of the contract or water deeds do not prevent Commission from exercising jurisdiction and determining a reason - rate. The expense of maintenance over receipts during the four years operation submitted at the hearing amounted to $8 847.12 or an </seg>
            <seg id="p141">141 average deficit of $2,211.78. The average receipts from rentals for these four years was $837.44. The District Court of Red Willow county, in the case of Pauline M. Burtless (one of the defendants herein &gt; against this complainant, has entered a decree since the testimony was taken in this case, holding that the company "must not supply those with mere rental rights so long as those with perpetual rights are not supplied with the amount to which they are entitled under their contract or water deed." This we have no doubt is good law and will be sus - tained. The application of this principle will undoubtedly discourage the renting of water and reduce the rental receipts largely, if not en - tirely, thereby increasing the annual deficit. It is clear from the record that there is need of considerable expenditure of money in improving the condition of the ditch, measuring boxes, flumes, etc., in order to render more certain the delivery of water. A reserve fund should be provided to take care of emergencies resulting from floods and wash-outs. It is to the interest of the holders of water rights that the ditch and its appurt - enances be kept in first class condition and the collection and prompt delivery of water, if there is any to be had, insured. If the revenues heretofore received from water rentals is wiped out, complainant must rely on its dues from water right holders for revenue. The average annual expenses charged to maintenance for the four years under consideration, as disclosed by the exhibit, was $4,793.46. In thesi expense items, however, are inchided allowances for salaries to executive officers, which we regard as excessive to the extent that they exceed $600.00 a year. The charge of $2.00 per acre for maintenance dues will produce an annual revenue of $4,760.00, and upon consideration of the evidence we find same to be just and reasonable under existing conditions. It may develop that the four-year period, —from April 1, 1909, to April 1, 1913, — will not accurately determine the amount necessary to properly maintain and operate the ditch in the future. We deem it proper to require the complainants, until the further order of the Commission, to set aside each year $4500.00 of its revenues for the operation, maintenance and betterment of its ditch and appurtenances, and to place any portion of that amount un - expended at the expiration of any year in a reserve or depreciation fund, to be used only in an emergency resulting from floods or wash-outs, or in the replacement or betterment of the ditch and its appurtenances. &gt;The order herein entered is without prejudice to any of the es hereto, their successors or assigns, from applying to the mission for such modification of this order as the future opera - and experience may reasonably require. </seg>

ORDER Hall, Commissioner: The plaintiff herein alleges that the depot of the defendant in the village of Brock, Nebraska, is too close to the main track, and that said depot is in a semi-dilapidated condition and should be rebuilt new on the south side of said main track. The plaintiff also alleges that a permanent sidewalk and platform should be built in front of said new depot, extending to the east to the sidewalk which runs north and south on the west side of the main street of said village. A hearing was held by the Commission at its office on the 17th day of November, at which the plaintiff was present, and was further represented by W. H. Kelligar of Auburn, Nebraska. The defend - ant was represented by Edgar M. Morsman, attorney. K'he village of Brock has a population of a little over four •ed. It is located on the line of the defendant about ten miles west of Auburn, Nebraska, and about five miles southeast of age, in a comparatively densely populated community.

The plaintiff has also introduced photographs of same in evidence, and the engineering department of the Commission has made an appraisal of the same. The present value as found by the engineering department of the Commission is $506.67. From all of the evidence taken at said hearing, from the report of the engineering department as to the value of said depot, and from the records on file in the office of the Commission as to the amount of business being transacted at that point, the Commission is of the opinion that the present depot is inadequate to serve the needs of the community, that said depot is located on the wrong side of the track, and that the platform and sidewalk are not in keeping with the walks and crossings of the town of Brock, and that a new depot should be constructed on the south side of the defend - ant's main track, leaving a platform space twenty feet wide between said main track and the depot. Said depot should also be located just west of the west line of said main street of Brock, which runs north and south across the tracks at that point, a sufficient distance to allow the passenger trains that are run on said line to stop at said depot without blocking said street. Said depot should also be constructed with the waiting room on the east end or next to the main street leading to said depot, and the freight room should be constructed on the west end of said depot. Irhe Commission will not prescribe plans and specifications of depot, but is of the opinion that defendant should furnish it plans of said depot for its approval, not later than thirty days the making and entering of this order. The Commission is er of the opinion that the defendant should lay a platform and alk extending along and in front of said depot, and extending to the sidewalk that runs north and south on the west side of main street.

Nethaway, Complainant, vs. rcago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Company, Defendant. Appearances: C. L. Nethaway, for complainant. E. R. Hart, Attorney, for defendant ORDER Clarke, Chairman: Eomplainant herein is the owner of a farm adjoining defendant's &gt;f-way at a point known as South Cut, which is located on a fill 3.2 miles south of Coffman and 3.8 miles north and west rence, which is 5.1 miles north of defendant's Omaha station. / The substance of the complaint is that the defendant be re - quired to construct and maintain a stock yardi, and a side track for the loading and unloading of carload freight, and that it be re - quired to stop its passenger trains on flag to receive and discharge passengers. I A hearing was had at Omaha, and the Commission and its en - rs inspected the location and conditions obtaining at and adja - to South Cut in company with the complainant and parties ested. The country adjacent to South Cut is characterized by &gt; hills and deep ravines and is devoted to farming, fruit raising agricultural pursuits. Ehere is no semblance of a village at this point, nor does any highway lead to it, though complainant alleges if his petition nted that a public highway will be donated and opened up. South Cut is located on a heavy fill between two long deep cuts, and trains approaching from either direction must overcome heavy grades ranging from 1.25', to 1.336',. On account of these grades Is must often "double" there or use a helper engine. The present ties there consist of a siding and a small night telegraph office, were constructed for the sole purpose of expediting and facilitat - he doubling of trains on either side. </seg>

Considerable evidence was submitted as to the amount of traffic that would be offered defendant in carload lots, consisting of hay, grain, live stock and fruit. This traffic is delivered at present to the defendant at Coffman, or Florence, or hauled and driven and mark - eted in the cities of Omaha and South Omaha. Ee are convinced that the estimates of traffic that would be d at South Cut are, to say the least, liberal, and, even if ;, would not, by reason of the operating conditions of the d, justify the granting of the relief prayed for. IPhe larger part of the territory that would be accommodated o the west of the defendant's right-of-way. A public highway l is macadamized for several miles out of Florence serves this ory. The proposed approach, or public road to South Cut the west, would start at a point on the above highway about and three-quarters miles from Florence, and from this point to nee the above highway descends on easy grades, and for a large of the way over macadam road. Eor the year ending July 1, 1913, four carloads of hogs and two ds of cattle were shipped from Florence, and thirty-one car - of hogs and thirteen carloads of cattle were shipped from an. At Coffman a standard stock yards is provided and at ice a portable chute is used. If there is any reasonable demand standard stock yards at Florence, the Commission will, upon aint, require its construction. In the matter of requiring defendant to stop its passenger trains at South Cut, the same objections obtain as in the matter of stopping its freight trains, though they are not as formidable. It is possible that as the country becomes more densely populated that such a service could reasonably be required. Present conditions, however, do not justify it. Another factor not presented at the hearing should be con - sidered. The patrons of defendant's entire line are entitled to reasonably rapid service. The state law requires carriers to transport live stock at a given rate of speed. To require carriers to locate stations every three or four miles and stop its trains would slow up its service to such a degree as to render it intolerable to the general public and impossible for the carrier to comply with the speed limit in the movement of live stock. Such an order as the one prayed for should be granted only where a large number of people, or amount of traffic, would be accommodated and no undue hardship would be worked on the carrier. No such condition here obtains and the Commission, upon consideration thereof, finds that the complaint should be dismissed. </seg>

FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 215 Carl Root, Complainant, vs. Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Com piny, Defendant. ORDER Appearances John M. Tucker, for Complainant. A. A. McLaughlin, for Defendant. Clarke, Chairman: I Complainant, a resident of Kilgore, Nebraska, complains of the dant, in that its depot at that place is inadequate in size to imodate both freight and passenger traffic; that its location ch as to impose upon the defendant's patrons unnecessary venience and danger; and petitions the Commission that dant be required to construct and furnish a depot at a more nient point, sufficiently large to adequately meet the require - i of the freight and passenger traffic. Kilgore is a town of approximately 225 inhabitants, located to the north of defentant's right-of way, sustaining a bank, hotel, and the usual number of mercantile and business establishments found in towns of this size. The revenue accruing to the defendant com - pany (interline revenue not included; on freight forwarded and received from Kilgore for the year ending June 30, 1913, aggregated $19,858.52. For the same period the total number of passengers reported as taking trains at Kilgore were 3817, and the passenger revenue originating at Kilgore amounted to $2,749.31. ■ The present depot is a frame structure 14x36, divided into waiting room 10x14, an office room, and a freight room 14x15. The waiting room ha? a seating capacity of eleven, and is heated by a stove. The evidence showed that Kilgore is a trading and railroad point for Indians from the Rosebud Indian Reservation; that frequently the waiting room is crowded, women being compelled to stand with babes in their arms; that oftentimes, if not usually, the waiting room is not habitable for women by reason of the smok- </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 ing indulged in by white and Indian patrons and loafers; that the freight room was inadequate in size, and that the defendant, to meet this situation, had placed a box car adjacent to the platform and depot; that -the approaches to the platforms and the location of the depot, box car, etc., are such as to render it unnecessarily inconvenient and difficult for patrons receiving and delivering L. C L. freight and express at the depot; that the stock yards are locatec at a point across the tracks about seventy feet directly north from the depot; that the close proximity of the stock yards to the depot particularly in the summer, is a source of annoyance and discomfor to defendant's patrons; that the main part of town is over fifteen hundred feet north and west across the tracks from the depot; that the only approach from the town, unless a roundabout road to the south is used, is a road directly east of the stockyards; that the stock yards and a coal shed and cars occupying the sidetrack adjacent thereto so obstruct the view to the west that it is difficult if not im - possible for a person approaching the depot from the north to detect a train approaching from the wett until he has almost reached the main track. IJpon consideration of the foregoing and the evidence, we are e opinion, and so find, that the present depot facilities are quate, and that defendant should be required to construct a depot or enlarge its present depot so as to provide separate ig rooms for men and women, and additional freight room adequate platform facilities and suitable approaches. The original town of Kilgore was platted subsequent to the building of the road, and is located directly north of the depot. There are comparatively few dwelling or business houses occupying the original townsite. The principal or main portion of the town is located in what is known as Steinbrecker's Addition, lying north Df defendant's right-of-way, west of the original town, and 1500 feet from the depot. The fact that the main part of town has been built up away from the existing depot would not of itself justify the Commission in requiring the defendant to re-locate it in order to more conven - iently serve its patrons. But, taking into consideration the too close proximity of the depot to the stock yards, the dangerous and inconvenient approaches, afforded at the present location, which is on a one-degree curve, the fact that the present depot is on the opposite side of the tracks from the town, and that a satisfactory readjustment of the situation involves either the re-location of the stock yards and certain industries, or of the depot, we are convinced that the depot should be re-located north of the tracks at a point hereinafter set out. In fact, the defendant has constructed a water tank west of the present depot, with the admitted purpose of event - ually re-locating its depot near said tank. It is desired by the complainant that the new location of the </seg>

An examination of the profiles of the defendant's main line shows that there is a one per cent grade running a considerable distance west from a point where said Main Street, if extended, would intersect the track. East of this point the grade is practically Irhe Commission is advised by its engineers that the station d not be located nearer than five hundred feet from the begin - of said, one per cent grade, as at least that much is necessary e practical and economic operation of a railroad for a train not otion to get under headway before climbing such a grade, and six hundred feet of headway would be preferable. Ehe latter figure would determine the location of the depot point between 300 and 350 feet east of the north and south &gt;r section line of section ten, which corresponds to the east f Steinbrecker Avenue. fVe are of the opinion and so find that defendant should be ■ed to re-locate its depot on the north side of its main line as it is practicable to a point 350 feet east of the intersection of ain line with the north and south quarter-section line of section Ir IS THEREFORE ORDERED, That the Chicago &amp; North Western ay Company be and the same is hereby notified and directed locate its depot at Kilgore, Nebraska, at a point north of its track and three hundred and fifty feet east of the intersection main track and the north and south quarter-section line of n ten, or as near as may be practicable.

            <seg id="p154">154 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 216 John M. Doyle, Complainant, vs. rcago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. Appearances: Theodore N. Barnes, for Complainant. Byron Clark, for Defendant. Taylor, Commissioner: Khis complaint is brought under the provisions of Section 6049, sd Statutes, which reads as follows: "All railroad companies operating their several lines of tracks in the state of Nebraska passing through any city, town or village of under five thousand inhabitants at any street or public crossing where three or more railroad tracks, either main lines, sic'e tracks or spur, pass over such street or public crossing, shall, whenever the railway commission shall so order, maintain gates in good repair, and keep a man to operate them from 7 o'clock A. M. to 8 P. M. of each day. " Iomplainant is a resident of Holdrege, and asks for the instal - of gates at East Avenue and Sherman Avenue in said city, which avenues defendant has several tracks. In addition to ates, complainant also prays for an order requiring defendant nstruct railings on the approaches leading to the public cross - ! defendant's main track at what is known as Lincoln Avenue o maintain thereat lights and electric bells. At a hearing held in Holdrege on February 5, 1914, it was shown that East Avenue is the main thoroughfare in the city o Holdrege and that at least thref-fourths of the traffic crossing th Burlington from north to south, and vice versa passes through thi street. Defendant has seven tracks at this point and it was generall agreed that the crossing is a menace to .the public and should b guarded in some manner. The first open street for four block eaat of East Avenue is Sherman Avenue. While there is considerabl traffic over the crossing on this street, it is much less in volum than over the East Avenue crossing. There are five tracks at this point, however, and buildings on either side obscure the view and render the crossing dangerous. It developed at the hearing that the mayor and council of the city of Holdrege had had the matter of the protection of these crossings under consideration for some time, and after conferences among themselves and with representatives of the company, had reached the conclusion that under the conditions obtaining at these crossings electric bells would afford the protection needed. In accordance with this conclusion they had entered into a verbal agree - ment with defendant for the installation of two electric bells, one A v a\ v vIIUC €m Ilu L 11^ v l» lid a L fcj IJd Ilia JI Xk ■ vlluvj A V_ \J 1 1 U I II w II \J I </seg>
            <seg id="p155">155 Ereement being that if the bells proved inadequate they should laced with gates. Material for these bells had been shipped as expected daily at the time of the hearing, defendant having to make the installation as soon as it arrived. Ehile on the stand M. J. Fox, assistant signal engineer for the gton, described the bells and their method of operation, as K "They are known as the Hoeschen type of bell, tht - about twelve inches high I would say, and about ten inch' diameter, of the best sounding bell metal. On the bell for Avenue in connection with the bell, is a sign of cast ir;&gt;n with red letters of glass set in, spelling the word 'Danger' on each side, and when the bell rings the light flashes behind those red etters to show them up, the idea of the flashing light being to nake them visible quickly to the eye, more so than a steady ight they are more apt to catch attention from a passerby. They are controlled from the track, and all the apparatus is )laced at certain distances from the crossing, whatever is deemed ;o be necessary due to the traffic condition. E"Q. Take the traffic conditions here, at what distance ould the train be from the crossing when the contact would be ade necessary to ring the bell? "A. I would say from 300 to 1,200 feet, possibly 1.500 feet for the east crossing. That is, a train coming in from the east would naturally be going a little faster than in the other direction and possibly signals would be moved from a little farther distance. "Q. Will the bell continue to ring with a train standing at the station? "A. Only for a predetermined length of time. ' * A through train from the west will start the bell when it crosses the contact something like 1,500 feet west. * * The bell can be adjusted so that when the train stops at the station, say the bell would continue to ring for two minutes, and then stop, and when the train starts again the bell will begin again to ring." ■Attorney for complainant contends that bells of this type would be as effective as a means of protection as gates. The record s, however, that on the lines of the Burlington west of the Missouri river there are forty sets of bells and only four sets of gates. As to the relative effectiveness of the two safety devices but little evidence is available and the question is, therefore, more or leas one of individual opinion. There are reasons in this particular case why gates would be inconvenient and might be the cause of accidents. The tracks crossing East Avenue are widely separated and three grain elevators are located between the main line and the southernmost industry track. During the grain season scores of loaded wagons cross the tracks daily, frequently being lined up in the street waiting their turn for unloading. The constant movement of these teams in and out of the yards would almost certainly result at times in some of them getting caught between the gates, when the danger from accident might be greatly increased. The operation of the gates would undoubtedly result in retarding the movement of this traffic and be a source of annoyance to those engaged in it. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 On the other hand, a bell at this crossing would give timely warning of the approach of a train and would note the movement of a switch engine at work in the yards. The chief danger at this point is from main line trains, and it is apparent that the bell described above would give ample warning of the approach of such a train so that a person exercising ordinary caution should be able to avoid accident. The gong has a distinctive tone that would be recognized above the noise of a train and in the midst of other sounds. The conditions surrounding the traffic at Sherman Avenue differ from those just described, but the bell should be equally effective there. Rn view of these considerations, therefore, the Commission is of pinion that bells would be as adequate for the guarding of these ngs as gates. At any rate, they promise sufficient merit to war - t thorough trial. With reference to that portion of the complaint praying for electric bells and lights at the Lincoln Avenue crossing and for railings on either side of the approaches leading to the same, the record shows that this crossing is about 200 feet east of the east point of the switch yards and that the main line track at this point rests on an embankment about ten feet above the level of the ground, there being a sharp ascent from either side to reach the crossing. Lincoln Avenue crosses the track from north to south, while at the same point Fourth Avenue crosses from east to west, the latter being a continuation of the public highway leading into Holdrege from the east. For a short distance both north and south of the track Fourth Avenue practically parallels the track, so that in making the turn at the crossing the curve is very sharp on either side. Although the top of the approaches and the crossing has been widened on account of the junction of the two highways, pockets have been left on the inside of the curves, and these add greatly to the difficulty of manag - ing a fractious or frightened team. The sides of the embankments next to the railroad are also quite steep. A railing following the edge of the embankment would afford protection, but the Commis - sion is of the opinion that the matter could be better cured by filling the pockets referred to, thus further widening the approaches and giving ample space on top of the grade for the handling of teams and for the passing of vehicles. A clear view of the track is obtain - able for quite a distance in either direction and from either side of the track, consequently there appears to be no need for a bell at this crossing. The city authorities have already provided an electric light at the crossing. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint in so far as it applies to the installation of gates at East Avenue and Sherman Avenue in the city of Holdrege, be and the same hereby is dismissed, it being understood that defendant, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, is to install and maintain in good working order electric gongs or bells at said crossings, as per agreement entered </seg>

Complainants' petition asks that the Commission establish switching rates on shipments of live stock and grain moving between South Omaha and Gilmore. Complainants, in support of their pe - tition, show that they are engaged in the business of shipping live stock and grain from the station of Gilmore to South Omaha; that prior to the establishment of the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion, cars of live stock and grain were handled by defendants between the stations of Gilmore and South Omaha on the basis of $7.00 per car as a switching service; that cars moving between the station of Gilmore and South Omaha at the present time are handled by switch crews; that the defendants bring empty cars to a point close to Gilmore for the purpose of cleaning the same, which cars are handled in switching service; that the South Omaha yard limits of the defendant company extend to the station building located at Complainants further show that the switching rate on live stock between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and South Omaha, Albright and Avery, is $6.00 per standard car; that the rate on live stock from South Omaha to Council Bluffs, Iowa, on shipments destined beyond is $4.00 per car, and from Council Bluffs to South Omaha, when from stations in Iowa and Missouri west of the Mississippi River, is $4.00 per car; that the rate on grain between Council Bluffs and South Omaha is one cent per hundred pounds, with a minimum charge of $5.00 per car; that the distances between the foregoing points are as folio we: Council Bluffs to South Omaha 7.1 miles Council Bluffs to Gilmore 12.6 South Omaha to Gilmore 5.5 Omaha to Gilmore 9.8 Defendants, by direct testimony or cross-examination, show: That the rates on shipments of live stock and grain from the station of Gilmore to South Omaha are constructed on the same general basis as from other stations on their line; that the station of Ft.

            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 reason why switching rates are established and maintained between Council Bluffs, Omaha and South Omaha is on account of there being a large amount of traffic moved between those poincs; that regular local road train service runs through Gilmore over the old line from South Omaha to Lane; that switching rates are not established by the Missouri Pacific or the Burlington railroads for the transporta - tion of carload freight between South Omaha and Ft. Crook; that Gilmore was never included in the South Omaha switching district; that the defendant company is compelled by law to clean and dis - infect it? live stock cars, and that the place where the cars are cleaned near Gilmore is the most available point they have for per - forming such service; that $1.50 per car of live stock must be paid by defendant companies to the Union Stock Yards Company at South Omaha for the service of unloading and yarding the stack; that this amount must be paid out of the rate. Epon consideration of the foregoing the Commission is of the n, and so finds, that as long as Gilmore is retained within the limits of the defendant, and served by switching crews, the lant should be required to put into effect the following schedule Between Gilmore and South Omaha Li\e stock, $5.00 per car. Grain and grain products, one cent per hundred pounds, with a minimum charge of $5.00 per car. Between Gilmore and Omaha Live stock, $6.00 per car. Grain and grain products, 1} cents per hundred pounds, with a minimum charge of $6.00 per car. The defendant will not be required to absorb any switching or other terminal charges, assessed by other carriers. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Union Pacific Rail - road Company be, and the same is, hereby notified and directed to establish and maintain, not later than thirty days from date hereof, the following schedule of switching rates on live stock, grain and grain products in carloads: Between South Omaha and Gilmore Live stock, $5.00 per car. Grain and grain products, one cent per hundred pounds, with a minimum charge of $5.00 per car. Between Omaha and Gilmore Live stock $6.00 per car.

FINDING AND ORDER Hall, Commissioner: This matter came on to be heard in the District Court room at Albion, Nebraska, before Commissioner Hall on the 8th day of January, 1914. The plaintiff asks that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company and the Union Pacific Railroad Company be re - quired to construct and maintain track scales on their joint connect - ing track at Albion, Nebraska. Chapter 67, Article 5, of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1913, contains the following sections: t"SEC. 75. Weighing Cars Freight. The Nebraska State ilway Commission shall have power, and it shall be its duty, enforce reasonable regulations for the weighing of cars and of ight offered for shipment or transported within this state."

S. D. Phillips was called as the principal witness for the plaintiff who represented the Albion Milling Company. His testimony shows that almost all of the milling products are shipped to Atkinson, Bassett, Long Pine, Creston, Kilgore, Meadow, Gordon, Clinton, Harrison, Oelrichs, South Dakota, Van Tassel, Lusk, Lost Springs, Orin Junction, Glen Rock, Casper, Arapahoe, Lander and Ft. Wash - ington, Wyoming. His testimony also shows that the weights of carload shipments of flour are reckoned on the number of sacks rather than on the exact weight of the carload. His testimony further shows, with but one exception, that the Albion Milling Company had never been charged on a higher weight than that estimated by the number of sacks. The witness concluded by saying that scales at Albion would not be of any advantage in his flour business. His I </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 Inony shows that his grain shipments are weighed first by the lg company itself when loaded; second, at the destination of shipments; and that said destinating weights are the ones that usually accepted. The witness, however, thought that there d be track scales that he might have a chance to compare his its with the weights of the track scales. His testimony shows his coal comes through the jobbers at Omaha from Ft. Weir, as City and southern Illinois and from Colorado and Wyoming. IFhere are track scales maintained by the Chicago &amp; North ern Railway Company at Oakdale, which is on the Albion :h, 33 miles north of Albion, and at Scribner, which is 82.3 miles of Albion on said branch, also at Norfolk, which is 62.7 miles Albion, by the way of Oakdale, upon which all traffic moving d out of Albion over the Chicago &amp; North Western lines can be »ed. The Union Pacific Railroad Company maintains scales at Colum - bus, which is 43 miles southeast of Albion, upon which all traffic moving through that point over the Union Pacific in and out of Albion can be weighed. Track scales are also maintained at Fre - mont, which is 106.5 miles east of Albion. The testimony of all the witnesses shows conclusively that they never have ordered carload lots destinating at Albion, or originating at that point, to be weighed in accordance with the statutes made and provided for such weighing. Most of the witnesses did not know that the statutes provided for such weighing. K'he Commission is of the opinion that the defendants herein provided and are maintaining scales within reasonable distances town of Albion, and that they are sufficient to give reasonable dequate service to the shippers at that point. The Commission is of the opinion that the complaining witnesses should first take advantage of the facilities that are being main - tained for the weighing of such freight, and that if it then should prove to be impractical and unsatisfactory it would then be time for a complaint to be filed with the Commission, requesting that the track scales be installed at Albion or some other point more con - venient than those places at which scales are now being maintained and operated. The testimony shows that almost the entire amount of traffic in carload lots moving in and out of Albion originates at points beyond the location of track scales or goes to points beyond the location of track scales. This being true, it is possible to have all carload lots weighed that destinate at Albion or originate at that point, on track scales located at one of the points above mentioned, and the Com - mission can see no practical benefit of scales being installed and maintained in accordance with the prayer in the petition of the The Commission is therefore of the opinion that said complaint </seg>

Gutru, Complainant, vs. Chicago A. North Western Railway Com- pany, Defendant. Appearances: W. J. Donahue, for complainant A. A. McLaughlin, attorney for defendant. F. Walters, general superintendent. OPINION AND ORDER Hall, Commissioner: This matter came on to be heard in the District Court room at Albion, Nebraska, on the 8th day of January, 1914, at which all parties in interest were represented. The complainant herein com - plains of the defendant and alleges that the passenger train service be - tween Scribner and Oakdale, Nebraska, on the Albion branch of said defendant's line of railroad is poor and insufficient. The complainant prays that the defendant be required to operate another daily passenger train between Scribner and Oakdale, or that the running time of the passenger trains as now operated from Oak - dale to Omaha be very much shortened. In answer to the complaint, the defendant states that the passenger train service now being furnished by defendant on said line of railroad between Oakdale and Omaha is adequate for the needs of the communities served by its said line, and that the running time of its passenger train between Oakdale and Omaha is as fast as the work required to be done by its said train will permit, having due regard to the safety of its pass - engers, employes and the general public. Khe defendant operates the following trains between Oakdale, er and Omaha: No 310, passenger, leaves Oakdale 6:00 o'clock A. M.; Albion, 7:18; Scribner, 10:47. Arrives at Union Station in Omaha, 1:35 P. M. No. 309 leaves Omaha 5:30 P. M.; Scribner, 8:20; Albion, 1 1 .CA a ■ -.— — f. /~V 1- J 1_ • ,i j » » m fi»m ♦• in i l </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 up of vestibuled cars, consisting of one combination mail and baggage car, one baggage car, one smoking car, and one chair car, and when the traffic warrants, additional cars are carried. No. 340, freight, carries passengers, leaves Oakclale 2:55 P. M.; Albion, 4:30. Arrives at Scribner, 11:30. No. 339 leaves Scribner 6:15 A. M.; Albion, 1:00 P. M.; arrives at Oakdale 4:10 P. M. Nos. 365 and 366, freights, carry passengers. 365 runs to Cornlea and 366 from Cornlea back to Scribner. KPhe burden of the complaint is to the effect that the time of 309 and 310, between Oakdale and Omaha, is too long. It is tted that the running time between stations is fast enough but too much time is consumed at stations in handling baggage, ex - and cream. Possibly there is some merit in this complaint, but the amount of cream handled would not justify a special cream train, and it seems to be necessary to handle that commodity by express trains and it is therefore necessary for Nos. 309 and 310 to do this work. These are purely local trains, which necessarily makes the scheduled time longer than that of through trains between the same points. A careful comparison has been made between the time of these trains and like trains on many other branch lines, and the evidence shows that the time of the trains referred to is faster than that of like trains in northeastern Nebraska. Train sheets for the month of April, 1914, have been submitted to the Commission and a complete analysis of the same has been made by the rate department. Said sheets show - that Albion train No. 310 makes fourteen stops between Oakdale and Scribner, and that the average time consumed was 2.9 minutes per stop. Said train was on time into Scribner, and practically at every station, with the exception of April 9th, on which date this train arrived at Scribner 45 minutes late on account of being delayed 57 minutes at Loretto by reason of a broken spring hanger on engine No. 698, and on April 27th, on which date they left Oakdale twenty minutes late on account of waiting for connection with train No. 2, arriving at Scribner 14 minutes late. The train sheet bears the notation that they could not make up time on account of soft track. On April 23d train No. 310 was 14 minutes late out of Oak - dale, on time at Scribner. The train sheet showing the movements of train No. 310, Scribner to Fremont, shows that this train arrived at Fremont on time every day excepting April 9th, when they were 45 minutes late out of Scribner by reason of the train being late from th» west. This was the dav on which the engine failure at Loretto occurred. On April 13th train No. 310 was delayed at Scribner one hour and five minutes on account of having to change engines by reason of the fact that engine No. 698 had a broken spring hanger. Special attention is called to the fact that train No. 310 was delayed at Hooper on account of meeting train No. 1 a large percentage of the days of the month for which the train sheets were submitted. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">165 Einutes. The maximum delay is fifteen minutes, ranging between and three minutes. The train sheet for train No. 310 on the Fremont to Omaha, shows that train Xo. 310 arrived at the 1 Station on time every day that the train ran during the h of April, 1914, excepting April 9th and 13th, these (i. caused by reasons hereinbefore mentioned. Cream shipments during the summer months are very heavy, which necessarily causes delay to train No. 310. The loading capa - city is limited to the ability of the express agent to move the cans from the door. Superintendent Reynolds has suggested that an extra man should be furnished to assist the express agent in taking care of these cans, which will enable the train to get out of stations quicker. There are approximately twenty-two regular stops bet Oakdale and Omaha, and it is the opinion of the rate department of the Commission, after making a careful analysis of the train sheets submitted, that the time consumed at stations by this train might be cut down between twenty and thirty minutes on the whole run. During the heavy cream period five cars are carried on this train, which would appear to be a pretty good load, especially in view of the fact that there are a number of steep grades on the line for an 18x24 engine, such as is used on this train. The service of passenger trains Nos. 309 and 310 is supplemented by the freight trains hereinbefore referred to one freight train each way a day for the entire distance between Oakdale and Scribner, the other freight train which runs out from Scribner to Cornlea and back to Scribner. The defendant herein submitted an exhibit showing the pass - enger train earnings of all trains on said line, beginning with October 13th and ending November 12, 1913, including both dates. The passenger earnings of said trains per train mile were as follows: Train No. 309 Train No. 310 Train No. 339 Train No. 340 Train No. 365 Train No. 366 65c 66c 2(h- 2U- 22c 10c From the above earnings it would not appear that the Com - mission would be justified in ordering the defendant to operate another special passenger train over said line, and until the cream traffic becomes much heavier than it now is the Commission would not be justified in ordering a special cream and express train to be operated over said line. The Commission is of the opinion that for the present the train service operated on said branch is reasonably adequate and sufficient, all things being considered, but the Commission recommends that the said defendant shorten its schedules for trains Nos. 309 and 310 </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 EThe Commission is of the opinion that this can be done by rting the morning train out of Oakdale ten or fifteen minutes lier, and that the loading of cream cans can be facilitated by an ra helper in the express car to assist the express agent. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the defendant herein report to the Commission as to the shortening of said schedules. The Commission is of the opinion, and so orders, that the com - plaint herein be dismissed. Dated at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 15th day of July, 1914. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Thos. L.

C. Strode, for complainants. Krederick Shepherd, for respondent. e, Chairman: For about six years prior tp November 1, 1913, the respondent and its predecessors maintained and operated a street car line, known as the S Street line, in the city of Lincoln, beginning at 34th and S Streets, extending west on S Street to 30th, south on 30th from S to R, west on R from 30th to 29th, south on 29th from R to O, west on O to 10th, thence around the Government Square, and thence back to 34th and S over the same streets and lines of travel above indicated. A fifteen-minute service was given. On or about November 1, 1913, respondents constructed a line of track north from 34th and S to Vine, thence west on Vine to the terminus of its line known as the Vine Street line, at 33d and tVine Street line, as operated prior to November 1, 1913, 33d and Vine west to 27th, thence south to O, thence west 10th, thence around the Government Square, and back to Vine over the same route. A thirty-minute service was </seg>
            <seg id="p167">167 Bn or about November 1, 1913, and subsequent to the con - on of the track connecting the two lines, respondent changed uting of its cars on the two lines and substituted therefor a -minute service, as follows: All cars going out from the Government Square and business section of the city were routed over the original Vine Street route to 33d and Vine, thence over the connecting track above referred to to 34th and S, and thence back to the Government Square over the route of the original S Street line. Vnder the substituted service the cars were operated to and the Burlington depot. Complainants, patrons of the respondent company, residing on or near the S Street line east and north of 29th and O, complain of the substituted service, in that they are compelled to travel from the business portion of the city approximately two miles farther in reach - ing their destination than under the old arrangement. Bt further appeared that as a consequence of the substituted e the cars were during certain hours badly crowded, subjecting lainants to a great inconvenience which they did not suffer under rior service. It is contended by the complainants that some of them pur - d property with reference to the car service existing at the of the purchase, and that they have a legal right to its con - nce. It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to de - ne that question. However, the Supreme Court of Kansas, in ig on a similar contention, has said: "An individual can acquire no vested right as against the public in continued service of a public utility. Such a doctrine once admitted would destroy the convenience as a public utility. It would then become hampered and subject to the control of the in&lt; ivicual and mace to subserve such interest to the detriment of the public welfare." Asher v. Hutchinton Water, Light A. Power Company, 71 Pac. 813. The only arguments in support of the substituted service are that it gives the patrons of the original Vine Street line a twelve - minute service as against a thirty-minute service, saves the re - spondent the operating expense of one car, and that all patrons are given depot service as against Government Square service. These arguments, however, do not, in the opinion of the Commission, out - weigh the great inconvenience to which the S Street patrons are now subjected under the present service, which we find to be unreason - able and inadequate. Subsequent to the hearing, the respondent submitted a plan for a different service. While the plan submitted appears to offer a satisfactory solution of street car service in this section of the city, inasmuch as it involves the securing of franchise rights over certain streets not yet granted, and may present features objectionable to patrons not heard by the Commission we deem it improper to ex- </seg>

At the close of the hearing a conference was held between the representatives of the interested parties, at the close of which an ex - tension of thirty days was asked for further conferences. The result of said conferences has been a practical agreement as to the general plans and specifications of said depot should the Commission order the construction of the same. No date, however, for the completion of said depot was agreed upon. Said plans are those of the Harvard depot (C. B. &amp; Q. blue print on file with the Commission), A. F. E.

            <seg id="p170">170 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 224 rcy Independent Phone plainant, Line, Com- vs Chadron Telephone Company, Defendant Appearances: For complainant, J. G. Honnold For respondents, G. T. Babcock, Attorney, and E. D. Warner, General Manager. An informal hearing was held at the village hall at Whitney by Commissioner Hall, on the 7th day of May, 1914. Hall, Commissioner: The complainant herein complains of the defendant, the Craw - ford Telephone Company, for that the said defendant performs switching service to the complainant, and all other farm lines running into its exchange, at a rate of $5.00 per year, while at the same time the said defendant furnishes switching service to the subscribers and farm lines of the Whitney exchange for the same price, the result being that the subscribers of the Whitney exchange and all farm lines running into the Whitney exchange get the Whitney exchange service and the Crawford exchange service for the same rate that the complainant pays for the Crawford exchange alone. Crawford is located on the C. B. &amp; Q. and C. &amp; N. W. roads in the western edge of Dawes county. Whitney is seven miles north - east on the North Western line. The complainant is a farm line running directly east from Crawford seven miles where it branches out to the north and south, and continues east two more miles, and again branches to the north and south, and thence east another mile, and branch farm lines run out to the east, to the southeast and to the northeast, upon which there are about twenty-two phones. There is a farmers' line known as the Ash Creek line, which connects with the Whitney exchange and runs south about six and one-half miles, thence east about two miles, thence south a mile, then branching out in a southeasterly direction, occupying territory adjacent to and just north of the territory that is occupied by the complainant The defendant owns and operates a line which extends north of Crawford one mile, thence east seven miles to a point known as the Brodhurst farm, where it joins with the Ash Creek line which runs almost straight north to Whitney. This line of the defendant, and that portion of the Ash Creek line which runs north to the Whitney exchange, is used as a trunking line between Whitney and Crawford by the Whitney exchange and Crawford exchange, over which all ■■•■■ages are sent by the subscribers of the Whitney exchange and </seg>
            <seg id="p171">171 defendant gives the subscribers of the Ash Creek line switching service to Whitney and to Crawford at $5.00 per year, the Ash Creek line, of course, maintaining its half of the trunking line between Whitney and Crawford, and the Crawford exchange maintaining its half which extends from Crawford to th« Brodhurst farm. The Whitney exchange with all the farm lines connected therewith has less than fifty phones, for which the subscribers of the Whitney ex - change pay $2.00 for business, $1.50 for residence, and $1.50 for farm, but for these prices they are given the Whitney exchange and are switched to the subscribers of the Crawford exchange, which have something over 500 subscribers. The real basis of this complaint is that the subscribers of the Ash Creek line and the farm lines that run into Whitney get not only the Whitney exchange but the Crawford exchange for $5.00, while the complainant gets only the Crawford exchange. It was brought out clearly at the hearing, however, that the complainant herein has a direct connection with the Crawford exchange, unin - terrupted by any other subscribers except its own, in getting the con - nections with the Crawford exchange. For the subscribers of the complainant to reach Whitney it is necessary for them to call the Crawford exchange and pay a toll charge of fifteen cents. This is true of all the farm lines that run into Crawford; whenever any sub - scriber of any of the farm lines of the Crawford exchange wishes to call Whitney a toll charge of fifteen cents is made. Now, if the switching charges performed for the complainant were to include the Whitney exchange, it would also be necessary to give all the farm lines that run into Crawford the Whitney exchange for the same switching charge. When a subscriber of the Ash Creek line, or of any one of the farm lines that run into Whitney, wishes to call Crawford they have to take their turn on the trunking line with all of the subscribers of their own lines, and with the subscribers of all other lines connected with the Whitney exchange, thereby deferring the service to a great extent as compared with the service that the Valley line has with the Crawford exchange. It is apparent that there may be a phase of discrimination in the fact that the farm lines of the Whitney exchange and the Ash Creek lines get both the Whitney exchange and the Crawford ex - change at $5.00 per year, while the Valley line gets only the Craw - ford exchange for the same price. Yet when the question of service is considered, and the fact that if the Valley line were given service to the Whitney exchange, that the same service would have to be given to all the farm lines that run into Crawford, it does not seem that the element of discrimination complained of should be con - sidered. The complainant herein admits that in order for it to be given switching service with the Whitney exchange it would be necessary to build an extra trunking line between Crawford and Whitney, ow - ing to the fact that the present joint trunking line is not of sufficient </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 fty to carry the necessary extra wires. That the wires that are eing used on the trunking line are already overloaded, and that indition of the pole line is such that it would not bear the burden of more wires. B; was further brought out at the hearing that the toll revenue le year 1913 paid to the Crawford exchange for connections the Whitney exchange amounted to but $2.45. This would te that the service demanded is very light and would not ' the building of an additional trunking line between the two lges. I It was further brought out that the Whitney exchange, as a er of fact, is a part of the Chadron company, although the Iron company is owned by the same parties that own the Craw - exchange. The defendant herein expressed its willingness to the plaintiff herein additional switching service with the Whitney inge if the plaintiff would extend its line from a point about 1 miles east of Crawford up to Whitney and connect with the ney switchboard. This the plaintiff does not wish to do. There is no substantial difference as to the facts brought out at the hearing. Considering the amount of toll revenue that is being collected for toll service from the plaintiff for toll calls to Whitney, and the fact that a new trunking line would have to be built a distance of about fifteen miles in order to give the service demanded by the plaintiff, and the fact that if service were given to the plaintiff as demanded it would make it necessary to give the same service to all farm lines running into Crawford, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the complaint herein should be dis - missed.

Thompson, A. M. Conners, Jack Donald, for complainant. K. Montmorency, for defendant, e. Chairman: Ehe complaint filed herein attacks the reasonableness of the y-six-cent rate now in effect between Odell, Nebraska, and I Island, Nebraska, on vinegar in carload shipments. ■In support of their contention complainants show that the de - int has established the following commodity rates on vinegar, ,., from Odell: To Omaha, Nebraska, distance 125.6 miles, rate 14 cents To Lincoln, Nebraska, distance 70.8 miles, rate 8 cents The distance to Grand Island from Odell is 123 miles I It further appears that during the year 1913 eighteen carloads inegar were shipped to Grand Island from Odell as against five ads to Lincoln and two to Omaha, aryd that the loading on ship - s to Grand Island will average seventy-six barrels to the ear - as against a loading of sixty-five barrels to the carload on oln and Omaha shipments. Defendants contended that the adjustment of the vinegar rates to Grand Island from the various sources of supply in Nebraska was based with reference to the jobbing situation rather than on ? mileage basis, and submitted a table or comparative statement of the freight charges on vinegar transported in carloads from Odell to Grand Island, Omaha and Lincoln, and thence L. C. L. to certain points of consumption, which showed that under the existing rates Grand Island had an advantage over Omaha and Lincoln in each case, ranging from two to fourteen cents per hundred pounds. This advantage inures to Grand Island, however, by reason of its location, and while a different and more or less arbitrary scale of rates may reasonably be applied to or from certain distributing centers, as compared with others under certain circumstances, we can see no justification for any such action in this case. K[*he existing rate of 26 cents from Odell to Grand Island, a of 123 miles, produces a revenue per ton per mile of 4.22 cents, the rate of 8 cents, Odell to Lincoln, a distance of only 70.8 produces a revenue per ton per mile of 2.25 cents. To attempt to justify such a disparity in transportation charges on any other grounds than short line or water competition, neither ol wnicn appear in tnis case, wouiu De ioiiy. </seg>

Clarke, Chairman: The petition of the applicant herein shows that it has recently constructed and completed a modern depot in the city of Fairbury, and that it is necessary for the proper operation of its trains to cross the main track of the defendant company at another and different crossing than the one now made within the city of Fairbury, and that the applicant and defendant have been unable to agree upon the points and manner of making said crossing, and submitted same to the Commission for its determination. IV hearing was held in Fairbury on the 23d of February, 1914, rich hearing it appeared that a tentative agreement or contract been submitted by the defendant company to the applicant, which tentative agreement or contract had been agreed to by cant herein, save and except the provisions of paragraph 5 of agreement or contract, which reads as follows: It is further understood and agreed that the junior com- pany (.which is the applicant herein; shall not obstruct the crossings covered by this agreement by the use of the track </seg>

The applicant company herein objected to any restrictions in the extent or manner of use of this crossing, and desired the elimination of this portion of the contract submitted. The defendant company, however, insisted that inasmuch as crossings of this kind are always more or less dangerous, depending upon the extent of the use, there should be some restriction as to the manner and extent of the use of this crossing by the applicant road, and that the insertion of the clause in paragraph 5 objected to by the applicant was not intended to in any way restrict or prohibit what might properly be termed main line switching of passenger and freight trains, but that it was intended to prevent and prohibit the use of this track and crossing as a main lead switch track for shunning and kicking of cars and trains to sidetracks within the company's yards. I The Commission, upon consideration of the evidence submitted, that the position of the defendant carrier herein is well taken, that there should be a restriction in the use of the crossing for operation of applicant's main line trains, and the necessary •hing of freight and passenger trains and cars as is properly in - it to so-called main line switching. E'he Commission further finds that the contract submitted by efendant to the applicant is a fair and reasonable contract, but le purpose of further defining the extent of the use and making any uncertainty as to the extent of the use, the paragraph d be amended by adding to the same the following: "Provided, however, the above provision shall in no way be construed as prohibiting all main line switching both of pass- enger and freight trains."

The territory north, northeast and northwest of Lemoyne for a distance of thirty to forty miles is tributary to it for its railroad service. The government has recently opened up 600,000 acres of land, which is being rapidly taken up by homesteaders. Small interior towns and trading points have been established, such as Willett, twenty-four miles to the northeast. The roads leading from that point to Lemoyne are good as compared with the roads to Lewellen and Keystone from the same territory. The territory to the south is at present not tributary to Lemoyne on account of the river, save and except in periods of low water or when the river is frozen over. It is expected that a bridge will be built in the near future, and that a considerable territory will trade and use the rail - road facilities at Lemoyne.

            <seg id="p180">180 During the year 1904 the Lawrence Telephone Company built a telephone line from Lawrence to Pauline, Nebraska, and installed a booth there. They then took messages there and delivered them to the Nebraska Telephone Company at Lawrence, Nebraska, where they then were connected with the lines of the said Nebraska Tel - ephone Company. About the end of the year 1904 the Nebraska Telephone Company made an agreement with the Lawrence Tel - ephone Company to build a line from Hastings to Pauline, installed phones in Pauline and for farmers north of Pauline. That the said Nebraska Telephone Company would maintain a switchboard at Pauline and do the switching for the Lawrence Telephone Company's subscribers on lines running into their switchboard at twenty-five cents per month including Hastings service. The toll messages between Lawrence and Hastings were to be handled via Pauline and the tolls should be pro-rated by both companies on the basis of 50 per cent to each company, the distance from Hastings to Pauline being practically the same as the distance from Pauline to Lawrence. The Lawrence Telephone Company agreed to remove their booth from Pauline and to not build any lines north of Pauline and to not install any phones in the village of Pauline. It was further agreed that they might install farm phones south of Pauline and run lines into the Nebraska Telephone Company's switchboard at The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company purchased the exchange and all lines of the Nebraska Telephone Company at Hastings, including the line above referred to running from Hastings to Pauline. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company also owns and operates a toll line from Hastings to Lawrence via Blu Hill, the distance from Hastings to Lawrence via Blue Hill bein practically the same as that from Hastings to Lawrence via Pauline Considering both lines from Hastings to Lawrence for toll purposes we find that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company own three-fourths of the lines on a mileage basis, i. e., the Lincoln Te ephone &amp; Telegraph Company owns the entire toll line to Lawrenc via Blue Hill and one-half the line to Lawrence via Pauline. The Commission, having held several conferences in the matter and being fully advised in the premises, is of the opinion that the Lawrence Telephone Company should have the privilege of routing all messages originating on its lines at Lawrence to Hastings via Pauline, and that the division of the toll charges should be made on a 50 per cent basis between the complainant and the defendan herein. The Commission is further of the opinion, however, tha the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company should have the privilege of routing all business originating on its exchange at Hast ings.

Appearances: For Complainant, M. S. Hartman. For Defendants, G. D. Patterson and J. H. Butler. ORDER Taylor, Commissioner: I his is a complaint brought on behalf of the ice cream manu - ers of Nebraska, and asks, in substance, that the present tariff ng express shipments of ice cream be modified so as to provide e return without charge of the containers in which the pro - s shipped. The tariff now in effect, covering the return of these ners, is as follows: cream empties returned, with or without wagon service. he 25' ( reduction not to apply: Five-gallon cans, and under. 10 cents Over 5-eallon cans 15 cents </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 Under Official Express Classification No. 17, applicable on in - trastate business in Nebraska, shipments of ice cream, packed in the customary manner, take what is known as the merchandise rate up to and including points between which the distance is about seventy-five miles, the tariff conveying the meaning that ice cream will take merchandise rates up to a point at which the merchandise rate is equal to seventy-five cents; above that charge the ice cream rate does not follow the merchandise scale but is considerably lower. The ice cream rates, in common with all other express rates in the state, are subject to the twenty-five per cent reduction ordered by the legislative act of 1907. At the time of the hearing complainants announced that they were willing to have the complaint limited to the traffic that moves within the seventy-five mile zone. The question to be determined is whether the rate on ice cream shipments plus the charge for the return of the container makes an excessive charge for the whole service. While, as stated in the fore - going paragraph, the schedule of merchandise rates forms the basis for the ice cream rates, the latter are conditioned on a minimum shipment of one hundred pounds. The merchandise rates, however, are graduated according to weight and the effect of this is to make them considerably higher than the rates on ice cream. For example, the rate on a twenty-pound package for a distance of seventy-five miles is 40 cents. The rate on an equal amount of ice cream on the present basis, assuming that twenty pounds could be shipped at the hundred-pound rate, would be 15 cents. Practically all merchandise moves at less than one hundred pounds so that the charges on the average are substantially higher than they are for ice cream. The spread is more marked after the charge for merchandise reaches 75 cents, for as explained above, the rate on ice cream is then arbi - trarily changed to a lower basis. Reference is made by complainant, and emphasis placed on the fact, that under the tariff approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission for interstate traffic, ice cream is classified as a "food product" and takes the second class rate, which is 75 per cent of first class, classification being uniform for all distances. Under the Nebraska tariff, as has been noted, ice cream takes the merchandise rate up to 75 cents, but at that point changes to a lower scale. It is important in this connection, however, to note that the inter - state adjustment is materially higher than the Nebraska schedule, particularly on the shorter distances, the difference being as much as 50 per cent in favor of the Nebraska schedule. The adoption, there - fore, of the interstate method of classification and rate adjust - ment would secure uniformity at the sacrifice of a much lower rate. In addition to having a lower rate than merchandise, ice cream is accepted at estimated rather than at actual weight. The record shows that substantially all ice cream moves in five-gallon lots, the ten-gallon shipments being made only for special occasions. Com Dlainant's witnesses testified that the average weisrht of a five- </seg>
            <seg id="p183">183 gallon shipment, including the ice cream, container and ice packing, 135 pounds. Defendants insisted that the actual weight is nearer 150 pounds. The five-gallon shipment is billed at 100 pounds. The express company, therefore, transports from 135 to 150 pounds, but is paid for only 100 pounds. The actual weight of the ice cream is less than 15 pounds. Fish is accepted at estimated weight with a 25 per cent allowance for ice and the tariff provides for re-icing in transit. Practically none of the shipments are re-iced in state traffic, however, as the haul is so short as to make it unnecessary. If the tariff was amended so as to provide for the acceptance of ice cream at actual weight with a provision for re-icing by the carrier, a plan suggested by complainants, it would be necessary for all the manufacturers to provide much smaller containers in order to secure the advantage of the 100-pound minimum, while at the same time it would increase the necessity for re-icing with its attendant incon - venience and expense to the company. This plan does not appeal to the Commission as being either practical or economical. Ice cream also enjoys another advantage in that the tariff now in effect provides for the pick-up and delivery of both the out-going shipment and the return shipment of the container. Some com - plaint was expressed on the part of the manufacturers that this pick-up and delivery service was not reliable and at some points could not be depended on. It is expressly provided for in the tariff, however, and the express companies can be required to give satis - factory service. According to the record the outbound shipments of ice cream are bulky and if transported any distance require considerable attention. The ice packing and covering make it practically impossible to stack the tubs one upon another, and, as a consequence, if there are a number in a car they occupy much space. As the ice packing melts it is necessary to drain the brine, as the movement of the train adds to the danger of the water being thrown into the can and damaging the contents. The tubs have to be watched closdy to guard against damage from this source and the task of getting them to the fish racks or an open door to be drained is difficult and time - consuming. These features of the traffic are not common to many other commodities and render the carrying of ice cream less desirable as a consequence. Complainants direct attention to the fact that empty containers are now returned free in shipments of oysters, coca-cola, beer, cider, pop and mineral water. All these commodities, however, are billed at actual weight, while ice cream is billed at from 35 to 50 per cent less than is actually shipped. Furthermore, none of the commodities mentioned enjoy the pick-up and delivery service given to ice cream, an advantage, which of itself would offset the charge made for the return of the containers. According to complainants' testimony the container for ice cream is valued higher than that used for any of thp commodities named with the exception of beer the ice cream </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 Eld can having an average value of $2.85. The value of a beer given at $2.90 while the value of a number of other con - j mentioned runs from 50 cents to $2.00. Ice cream, therefore, i disadvantage on the point of liability of loss or damage to the ner, a substantial factor in arriving at the cost of service. The rule quoted above as covering the return shipment of ice cream containers was approved by the Commission on June 15, 1913, on application of the various carriers affected, it being repre - sented that the rule had been approved by a conference participated in by representatives of the express companies and shippers in the states of Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois. The new tariff reduced the rates in Nebraska on five-gallon containers from 15 cents to 10 cents and left the rate of 15 cents for ten-gallon containers, at the same time adding the privilege of wagon service for the pick-up and de - livery of containers. The new rule amounted to a substantial con - cession on the part of the carrier. The rule now effective on inter - state traffic and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission on February 1, 1914, provides for a return charge of 15 cents for five-gallon and 25 cents for ten-gallon containers, with a provision for pick-up and delivery service. I In view of the fact that ice cream now moves at a reasonable when compared to other commodities, that it is favored with a minimum weight and actually moves at a greater weight than paid for, that it enjoys a broader service with respect to pick-up delivery than other commodities and that its transportation is ided by more or less unfavorable conditions, the Commission is le opinion, and so finds, that the present rates are reasonable that the complaint should be dismissed. ■IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein be the same hereby is dismissed.

            <seg id="p185">185 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 241 The Crete Mills, Complainant, vs. fcago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. Appearances: A. L. Johnson and H. A. Butler, for Complainant Byron Clark and H. H. Holcomb, for Defendant. ORDER Taylor, Commissioner: Complainant is an incorporated company engaged in the milling, grain, coal and ice business, with headquarters at Crete, Nebraska. In connection with its business it controls two lakes, one at Curtis and the other at Maywood, 235 miles west of Lincoln, from which it harvests natural ice during the winter season. These lakes cover an area of about 125 acres, and, according to the record, have a cutting capacity during a normal season of 20,000 tons of twelve-inch ice. The combined loading facilities at both points permit of the loading of 96 cars in a working period of ten hours, or double that amount in a 24-hour period. In recent years, and during the past two in particular, the Burlington has been the largest purchaser of complainant's product, taking about 90 per cent of the annual cut of 1,500 cars. A schedule of commodity rates to thirty-four specific points is now in effect on the Burlington lines from Curtis and Maywood, the most distant point to which they apply being Geneva, which is 179.8 miles from Curtis. To all other points not named in this com - modity tariff the regular Nebraska Distance Tariff Class E rates apply. Complainant asks for a new schedule of rates covering all points on defendant's line of railroad in Nebraska, its contention being that it is unable to dispose of its maximum output of 3,000 cars owing to the proscribed territory under the present rate adjust - ment. A distance schedule is asked for that has been worked out by using as a basis some of the low commodity rates on ice now in effect on the Burlington. There appears to be merit in complainant's request for a lower and broader schedule of commodity rates. Ice has come to be a necessity and the consumption is increasing rapidly. It is a com - modity of such perishable nature, however, and is used under con - ditions that make low cost to the consumer so imperative that it must be produced at very low original cost and sold at a very small margin of profit. Carriers have recognized these conditions by fixing low rates in some instances for its transportation, realizing that it will not move unless it can be delivered to the retailer for winter storage at a price not to exceed $1.00 to $2.00 per ton. In controlling </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 the two large lakes at Curtis and Maywood, complainant has the largest single source of supply of natural ice south of the Platte river and west of Lincoln, there being no other large bodies of water so situated with reference 'to loading and railroad facilities. There are many small ponds and streams in this territory but they furnish a varying and more or less uncertain supply. The lakes referred to are fed by springs, and being in a prairie region are free from sewage deposits and other unhealthful drainage, consequently the ice is of high quality. That there is a substantial demand for this ice in southeastern Nebraska is established by testimony submitted by complainant to the effect that actual shipments were made to twenty-eight points last season, two of these shipments going as far as Tobias and Chester, 188 miles distant, on the Class E rate 9.5 cents per hundred pounds. In addition there were inquiries from prospective patrons at twenty-four points to whom shipments could not be made on account of the present rate adjustment. A considerable trade has been established among the farmers, but this business is necessarily limited to a small radius by the rates now in effect. Complainant is of the belief that the sale to farmers could be greatly increased if the rates were adjusted so as to permit of delivery on track at destination at not to exceed $1.50 per ton. Large quantities of natural ice are harvested in Memphis, Ashland and Laketon, all in the eastern section of the state and tributary to the same territory, but the record shows that much of this ice is of poor quality, un - suitable for commercial use, and that the full output of the plants is now consumed. There are a number of plants for the manufacture of artificial ice in the territory, but their capacity is limited. It appears, therefore, that there is a field to be developed by complainant and that the chief handicap to its development at the present time is the rate adjustment. If the demands for ice in the southeastern part of the state will be increased by a lowering of the price to the consumers, resulting from a reduction in the cost of transportation, to the extent indicated by the testimony of com - plainant's witnesses, it is evident that if the present rates produce a revenue in excess of the actual cost of transportation they do not pro - duce the economic maximum of traffic and are therefore unreasonably high. This Commission has held that the volume of traffic has a direct bearing on the cost of transportation, and this factor is recog - nized in the construction of practically every rate schedule, conse - quently if the traffic in ice from Curtis and Maywood can be in - creased and the increase will tend to reduce the unit cost the present schedule should be reduced to a basis that will permit of the maxi - mum tonnage. The commodity rates now in effect apply to such a limited territory that they are of but little aid to the development of the traffic. Compared with earnings from a number of other commodities </seg>
            <seg id="p187">187 rates are found to be unreasonable. The following table shows the carload earnings on a number of commodities, based on a shipment from Curtis to Lincoln: Commodity Value Rate Minimum Gross Earr, There are so many modifying conditions affecting the transporta - tion of different commodities that car earnings cannot be relied on as the sole measure of a reasonable rate, nevertheless they have their value from a comparative standpoint and are used for that purpose in this connection. It will be seen that with the exception of wheat, ice under the present rates produces a larger revenue per car than any of the commodities named. This is true notwithstand - ing the fact that it has less value than any of the others, moves under a high minimum, is not subject to speed requirements, requires no attendants and is not subject to damage in transit, one or more of which elements enter into, the carriage of one or all of the others. Potatoes, for instance, moving under a rate of 15.3, may require under the tariff rules the installation of stoves in the car and trans - portation of one caretaker one way, and between June 1st and October 31st of each year the minimum is reduced to 24,000 pounds. Shipments of hogs and cattle are subject to numerous requirements respecting prompt delivery, feeding in transit and transportation of caretakers, all of which add substantially to the cost of handling the On the other hand, there are numerous reasons why ice can be handled to advantage from the points involved in this complaint. The record shows that the great bulk of ice is moved at the time of cutting, usually during the months of December, January and February. The cars are loaded eight at a time and are handled by a switch engine at each point. They are handled in trainloads as far as Holdrege at least. The business comes at a time when other traffic on the road is light and as a consequence car equipment and motive power is available. Ice can be shipped in either box cars or stock cars and the cars require no special preparation. In fact, the older equipment is usually assembled for ice loading, as it answars the purpose as well as the newer cars or those in a good state of repair. With winter shipments time is not an essential element and if necessary cars can be held for several days to permit of the assembling of a trainload. The record shows that the average load - ing at the two points is 66,000 pounds, which permits of the maxi - mum loading efficiency of the equipment as well as its maximum earning caDacitv The value of the ice is nominal, the Drice f o. b. i.

            <seg id="p188">188 IB or Maywood running from 35 cents to 50 cents per ton, so the liability of loss to the carrier is practically nil. There was testimony by defendant to the effect that the tendency of ice ift in the car caused damage but this was controverted by com - int. At any rate, the damage could not be large nor in excess at common to the handling of many other commodities which ice but little if any greater earnings. There is still further evidence that ice can be transported eco - nomically from these points in the fact that defendant itself has been the largest patron of complainant and has found it advantageous to purchase for its own use upwards of 1,300 cars each season. Much of this ice has been shipped to St. Joseph and practically all of it has been stored at the terminals in the eastern part of the state, necessi - tating a haul in some instances of 300 miles. If defendant can afford to transport this ice at a cost that will permit of its use for its own purposes, surely it can afford to transport it at a rate that will per - mit of economical commercial distribution. The advantages of su - perior product and favorable traffic conditions, as outlined above, appear to have made a practical appeal to defendant, of sufficient force at least to control its action. The same points of advantage that appear to have controlled the judgment of defendant are equally convincing to the Commission. It seems clear, therefore, that there is substantial reason for a lower basis of rates than now prevails, in order to stimulate the traffic and thereby better serve the public interest. The new rates, however, should apply only to winter shipments. Practically all of the reasons advanced in the foregoing lose force when applied to sum - mer traffic. In fact, the conditions are exactly reversed. The quan - tity of ice handled out of storage by the complainant in the summer is very small, the amount stored last season being only 4 per cent of the total cutting. From 40 to 50 per cent of this is lost through shrinkage, while the demand from dealers at this season is very light and comes from a wide territory, necessitating scattered and in - frequent shipments. As a consequence the advantages connected with the handling of the product in large quantities and during a short season are lacking. The movement would come too at a time when the defendant would be engaged with other traffic, particularly grain, and when equipment would be in service and difficult to secure. The loss from shrinkage during warm weather is enormous, making shipments for any considerable distance practically impossible. If attempted at all the ice must be moved without any delay, introduc - ing the time factor that is absent in the winter season. The carrier's liability is further increased by the fact that the value of the product in the summer time is from three to four times as great when taken from storage as when loaded directly from the lakes to the cars in winter, complainant testifying that it must be sold at not less than $1.25 per ton in the warm season. A rate that might be reasonable, </seg>

For that reason the Commission is of the opinion th; t the lule us hereafter ordered should be made to apply only during months of December, January, February and March of The Commission is now engaged in the promulgation of a new intrastate class rate schedule to be applicable to all carriers in the state of Nebraska. This new schedule will be made effective not later than September 1, 1914, the basis for the ratrs ha\ing been • lished, and the only work remaining being that of printing and checking. In \iew of the fact that the new class rate schedule is established on a distance basis, in the opinion of the Commission confusion will be avoided in the future if readjustments of existing rates are fixed as a percentage of the rate as established for the class under which the freight should properly mo\e. As before stated, ice now moves under Class E rates. After careful consideration of the conditions as set forth in the foregoing, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the existing rates on ice from Curtis and Mavwood are unreasonable and that defendant should be required to publish and rr.aii.tain as a maximum the fcllowing schedule of which are arrived at by taking 65 per cent of the pro; Class E rates to be promulgated in General Order No. 19. heretofore General Order No. 19. heretofore in referred to Mil« 0 to 50 51 to 60 61 to 70 71 to 80 81 to 90 91 to 100 101 to 110 111 to 120 121 to 130 131 to 140 141 to 150 151 to 160 161 to 170 171 to 180 181 to 190 191 to 200 201 to 210 211 to 220 221 to 230 ZS1 to 240 241 to 250 251 to 260 261 to 270 271 to 280 281 to 290 291 to 300 301 to 310 111 to 320 321 to 330 331 to 340 In &lt; ( ents per ( 2.5-1 2.80 2.M 3.19 3.45 3.64 3.90 4.10 4.16 4.55 4.K2 5.01 5.20 5.40 5.66 5.85 6.11 6.31 6.50 6.76 6.96 7.22 7.41 7.61 8.06 wt </seg>

ORDER Taylor, Commissioner: En connection with its system defendant operates a line from lbus to Spalding known as the Spalding branch. The branch cts with the main line at Columbus, at Oconee, a few miles of Columbus, the branch effects a junction with the Norfolk h and at Genoa it connects with another branch extending to i. This complaint is made by and on behalf of a large number irons of the branch who desire better passenger service. At the present time defendant operates two trains each way for the transportation of passengers on the Spalding branch.

Spal ing 9:15 a. m. Ar. Columbus 11:55 a. m 1 — " Lv. Columbus 1:10 p. m. Ar. Spal ing 4:00 p. m 9 — Mixed Lv. Columbus 7:00 a. m. Ar. Spal .ling 11:30 a. m 0 " Lv. Spalding 12:30 p. m. Ar. Columbus 4:55 p. m Ileither of these trains runs on Sunday and there is no mail or iger service on the branch on that day. Complainants ask Sunday service be provided, that the passenger train be held &gt;lumbus until seven o'clock in the evening, that a motor car stalled, that larger engines be provided for freight service and the present schedule of the passenger train from Spalding to nbus remain unchanged. There is an abundance of evidence in the record to show that the present service is inconvenient to a large number of patrons and that to a large extent it is inadequate for the traffic handled by the branch. The principal objection, and the one particularly emphasized, applies to connection with main line trains at Colum - bus, especially with the trains to and from Omaha. Under the present schedule passengers on the branch desiring to transact business in Omaha must leave in the morning after nine o'clock, remain in Columbus until 1:30 p. m. and arrive in Omaha at 4:00 p. m. If it is desired to return the next day it is necessary to leave Omaha at 10:30 in the morning in order to make connection with the passenger at Columbus at 1:10 p. m. This arrangement results in an arrival in Omaha after business hours and does not allow time for the transaction of much business before leaving the following day. If it is necessary to remain until later in the day departure must be made late in the afternoon, remaining over night in Columbus and consuming part of the next day in reaching the destination on the branch. It will be seen that this is not a satis - factory service and that it consumes the greater part of three days in making the trip. The trip can be made by taking the mixed train in the afternoon and making a connection with one of three evening trains at Columbus, reaching Omaha in the night. Owing to the irregularity of the mixed train the first of these connections cannot be relied on. Until recently if the first train was missed it was necessary to wait in Columbus until 12:28 a. m. The schedule of No. 10 has been changed, however, so that it passes through Columbus at 10:41 p. m.. thus affording a reasonably prompt con - nection. Service on the mixed train is far from satisfactory. This train handles all the freight on the branch, including practically all of the grain and live stock. This necessitates long waits at stations while freight is unloaded and switching is being done and renders the arrival and departure of the train so uncertain that passengers </seg>
            <seg id="p193">193 Son this train, which appear from the record to be well founded, ht trains never furnish satisfactory passenger service and this s no exception to the rule. The present schedule of the trains, in so far as the time is concerned, appears to be about as satisfactory as any that could be arranged with only two trains in service. There is a demand for Sunday service and this could be provided by running the pas - senger on that day. Vigorous protests against any change in the present time of arrival and departure of the trains have been re - ceived since the filing of the complaint, and the only improvement possible, aside from the suggestion with reference to the Sunday service, appears to be the addition of another train. This raises the question as to whether this branch produces enough revenue to warrant additional facilities and whether it is being treated as liberally in the matter of service' as other branches on the system in this state. The Union Pacific operates the Kearney-Stapleton, Grand Island- Ord, Columbus-Norfolk, Lincoln-Central City and Lincoln-Beatrice branches, all of which are comparable to the Spalding-Columbus branch. Taking these in the order mentioned, we find that there are three trains each on the Kearney-Stapleton branch, one being a motor car. There are also three trains each way on the Grand Island-Ord branch, one of which is a motor car. The service on the Columbus-Norfolk branch is the same as on the Spalding branch with the exception that the steam passenger is scheduled to run on Sunday. There are motor cars on the Lincoln-Central City and Lincoln-Beatrice branches in addition to the steam passengers and mixed trains. It is manifest, therefore, that the service on the Spalding branch is more limited than on any of the others, and that to the extent of the decreased facilities the patrons of the line are being discriminated against, provided the line produces traffic sufficient to warrant equal service. A comparison of the passenger revenues from the various trains operated by defendant has been made by the Commission. The earnings covering the branches referred to above are as follows, the figures given being the annual earnings per train mile for the tiscal year of 1914: Earnings of Various Lines No. 31 No. 32 No. 79 No. 80 No. 35 Columbus-Spalding Spalding-Columbus .

The Grand Island-Ord and Lincoln-Central City branches are the only ones producing more earnings, and this not - withstanding the fact that the other lines have more trains and thus are in a position to de\elop rrore traffic. The comparison with reference to the Lincoln-Central City branch is hardly fair for the reason that the trains given cover a portion of three branches, it being difficult to allocaie the revenue to the particlar part of the line producing it. It is highly significant in this connection to note that of the ninety-six trains on the Union Pacific in this state that carry passengers only ten produce more passenger revenue per train mile than the two passenger trains now operated on the Spalding branch. The ninety-six trains referred to include all main line trains. The main line local passengers running between North Platte and Council Bluffs and Grand Island and Council Bluffs produce more gross revenue in the course of a year, but the train mile earn - ings are but slightly rrore than half that produced by the passengers on the Spalding branch. These comparisons indicate that the branch is one of the most productive lines on the system so far as passenger traffic is concerned. That it produces such a revenue under present service conditions, speaks well for the territory it serves and is a strong indication that it is capable of further development. In- </seg>
            <seg id="p195">195 addition of a new passenger train on branches such as these usually stimulates increased traffic. In Application No. 2,000 (N. S. R. C. which was a request by the Union Pacific for permission to tem - porarily discontinue motor car service on the Kearney-Stapleton branch, we found that the installation of the motor car had increased the gross passenger revenues of the branch by 33 per cent. The addition of the motor on the Lincoln-Central City branch also resulted in a substantial increase in passenger traffic and, as will be noted by the figures given above, it has outstripped the steam passenger and is now the largest revenue producer on any of the three branches running into Valparaiso. The increased traffic is stimulated by the more frequent service and the better connection with main line trains and it also results from the advantages of using a combination of trains to work back and forth on the line. It is very probable, therefore, that the addition of another train to the service on this branch would increase the traffic and that within a few months after the addition of such a train the gross revenue of the branch would equal and very likely exceed the revenue now derived from the Grand Island-Ord branch. In Application No. 2,000, supra, we discussed the cost of operation of both motor cars and three-car steam passenger trains, stating that as the result of investigations we had found the operat - ing cost of the former to be 19.7 cenis per train mile and of the latter approximately 45 cents per train mile. The former figure includes current repairs and maintenance of the car but does not cover station expense or maintenance of roadway, which would bring the total cost to perhaps 30 cents per train mile. The figures found for the steam train include all known items of expense. The earn - ings of the trains now in service average about 75 cents per train mile for each train. The addition of two more trains would make the average earning 51 cents per train mile, sufficient to leave a substantial margin above the cost of operation of either class of train. On the present revenue, therefore, defendant could operate an additional train without loss, and even at some profit. Any increase in traffic would increase those net earnings, and, as stated above, there is good reason for believing that this increase would be considerable. To sum up, it is clear to the Commission that the service on the Spalding branch is not as satisfactory as it should be and that it is not as good as that provided for other branch lines owned by defendant, notwithstanding the fact that the revenue produced by the line is equal to and even exceeds that produced by the lines more generously treated. It is clear, also, that the earnings now received from passenger service are sufficient to justify more adequate facilities and that the prospect of increased revenue makes the addi - tion of another train a promising traffic experiment. For these reasons the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the </seg>

Kohler, et ■!., Complainants, vs. Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defend- ant. ORDER Appearances: Walter C. Nye and others, for Complainants A. C. Ellick, for Defendant. Clarke, Chairman: This cause arises on a petition of thirty-one residents of Roscoe and vicinity, including the wives of some of the signers, praying that defendant be required to construct a depot and install an agent at that point. The nearest agency stations of defendant are Ogallala, seven miles to the west, and Paxton, thirteen miles to the east. The defendant has a small one-room depot, about 10x14, which is always open. No fire is maintained in it. There is no town at Roscoe. Two small general merchandise stores, which carry in addition a small stock of lumber and imple - ments, are located there. The only other residents at or near there are farmers. The evidence showed that the complainants are subject to the usual inconveniences obtaining at non-agency stations, and that by reason of the failure of defendant's train crews to place freight in the depot, shippers suffer loss and damage to goods through weather conditions. Khe following is a statement of the business done at Roscoe by •fendant company for the twelve months' period ending June 13, and ten months period ending April 30, 1914: 1913 1914 Freight Forwarded State Interstate State Interstate Number cars of wheat 1 I Number cars of corn 1 Number cars of live stock 1 5 1 All other carloads forwarded . . .

            <seg id="p199">199 If an agent were installed at Roscoe the business would un - doubtedly be increased to some extent, and would probably be in - creased considerably by heavier grain and hay shipments, the crop prospects being better than for several years past, but it is clearly evident that with such increase the showing would not justify the Commission in requiring defendant to install and maintain an agent at an expense to the defendant of from $600.00 to $1,000.00 per year. There was no evidence showing that the present structure was in - adequate in size to handle the business. Defendant should, however, be required to furnish a stove and lights and fuel for the use of patrons, both passengers and shippers of live stock awaiting trains. Defendant's trainmen should be required to place all L. C. L. freight, subject to damage from inclement weather or otherwise, inside the depot. Certain other matters developed upon the hearing which were not a part of the complaint, but which should be taken notice of and Ehippers of carload traffic, to place orders for cars, must drive allala or Paxton and place orders direct with the agent or order over the telephone. While usually no difficulty has arisen in ling cars so ordered, yet in times of car shortage, and par - rly during the hay-shipping season, disputes arise between shippers as to who is entitled to the empties set for loading. It appears that more or less frequently cars have been taken and loaded by shippers who arrived first after the setting of empties, though their orders had been placed subsequent to other orders not yet filled. To obviate this difficulty, and further to convenience the ship - pers of live stock, it is recommended that defendant install a tele - phone in its station connected with its Ogallala office, to the end that in case of disputes arising over the question as to who is en - titled to any car set for loading the Ogallala agent may be called by tplpohonp to sot t 1p smri&amp; n n d li ke wise to sdvJ36 1 1 vp stock s hi d dcts of Total amount this company's revenue L.

It further appeared from the evidence that defendant's stock - yards, constructed of one-inch boarding, are inadequate to properly handle the business and hold the stock. The lack of suitable yards, with loading chute and platform, has influenced shippers in the past to take their live stock, at more or less inconvenience and loss, to other stations, such as Ogallala and Paxton, on defendant's line, and Madrid, on the Burlington, to the south. It is recommended that defendant at once construct a suitable stockyard with loading chute and platform at this point. It further appeared that none of defendant's westbound trains, except way freight No. 261, stop at Roscoe. Passengers from the east must either arrange to board said way freight, which leaves North Platte at 6:30 a. m., or go on to Ogallala and take a freight back, or passenger train No. 4, which arrives at Roscoe at 8:11 p. m. Defendant's failure to stop any passenger trains westbound neces - sitates the carrying through of express from the east to Ogallala and a back haul on No. 4 arriving at 8:11 p. m. Consignee must be at station to receive express at non-agency stations. Such a service, particularly as to the handling of perishable products such as fruit, is not reasonable. It is therefore recommended that defendant arrange to stop one of its westbound passenger trains at Roscoe, preferably No. 19, and at any rate one which passes through Roscoe during the usual business hours.

BY THE COMMISSION: STATEMENT . The complainants in this case have recently constructed and are now operating the only cement manufacturing plant in Nebraska. The principal offices of the complainant are located at Omaha. The manufacturing plant is located at Superior, a city approximately 155 miles west of the Missouri river and two miles north of the Nebraska-Kansas state line. The Kansas City-Denver main line of the Burlington and a branch of the Missouri Pacific Railway Com - pany from Yuma, Kansas, to Prosser, Nebraska, passes through the station of Superior. Superior is also the terminus of a branch of the C. &amp; N. W. Railway Company, Fremont to Superior, and the end of the line of a branch of the A. T. &amp; S. F. Railway Com - pany running from Strong City, Kansas, to Superior, Nebraska. The shale rock, from which the cement is made, is located some three or four miles south of Superior in the state of Kansas, and is brought into Nebraska by a railroad operated as a part of the com - plainant's plant. The cement plant itself is located about one and one-half miles west of the station of Superior. The rated capacity of the plant is 2,500 barrels per day. ■The petition sets out that the present rates charged by the idants herein on carload shipments of cement from Superior are st, unreasonable, excessive, and discriminatory, and that inter - ' rates from cement-producing points located outside of the state [ebraska to Nebiaska stations are relatively lower and discrimi- Iln addition to the petition, complainants filed a schedule of ested rates on carload shipments of cement from Superior to a number of stations in the state of Nebraska located on the of railroad of the defendants herein. Complainants In the testimony complainants show that they have invested </seg>
            <seg id="p203">203 cement; that they are unable to supply orders that they have on hand for the reason that they have no rates; that they have started to manufacture cement, having on hand at the time of the hearing clinker ready to grind into the finished product; that the schedule of rates submitted by the complainants for the consideration of the Commission was based on 115 per cent of the commodity distance tariff rate in effect in the state of Iowa up to 225 miles, and beyond that distance the rates shown in the schedule were based on 125 per cent of the Iowa rates. That the Public Utilities Commission of the state of Kansas, on the 9th day of July, 1914, promulgated an order establishing certain rates on carload shipments of cement from pro - ducing points in the so-called Gas Belt to all stations in the state of Kansas. That the coal used for burning cement is secured from mines located in southern Kansas or southern Illinois; that coal enters materially into the cost of manufacturing cement. That complainants are at a disadvantage of from 15 to 18 cents a barrel as compared with cement-producing plants located in Kansas and Iowa, by reason of a higher cost of coal. That the order promulgated by the Utilities Commission of Kansas did not change the rates in effect at the time the order was issued up to 70 miles in distance, and that the order reduced rates for distances 70 miles to 260 miles: that the present rates in effect in the state of Kansas are legislative rates; that the rates in effect in the states of Iowa, Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri are either Commission- or legislative-made rates. That the order of the Public Utilities Commission of Kansas divided that state into two territories, viz., A and B, and that the dividing line between these two territories was irregular and based on certain lines of railroad running diagonally across the state, Territory A being that portion of the state located east of an irregular line drawn from Weber, Kansas, a station approximately nine miles directly south of Superior, on the A. T. &amp; S. F. Railway, to the station of Sitka, located on the A. T. &amp; S. F. Railway in the extreme southwestern portion of the state of Kansas. Territory B is that part of the state lying west of the above described line. That the rates promulgated by the Kansas Commission made the rates from the cement-producing stations in the Gas Belt to certain Missouri river stations different than the rates named to other stations located in Territory A. That the Kansas Commission undertook to equalize the rates from the different cement-producing plants to stations lo - cated in Territory B. That the cement distance tariff commodity rates promulgated by the Kansas Commission are about 661 per cent of the Kansas distance tariff Class C rate. That the present minimum on carload shipments in Kansas is 30,000 pounds; that the minimum weight under the order of the Kansas Commission is 60,000 pounds when final destination is Kansas City, Leavenworth or Atchison, Kansas.

That the average earnings per ton per mile on carload shipments of cement originating at Des Moines, Iowa, to 44 stations located in the state of Nebraska average 9.7 mills per ton per mile; from Superior to the same stations, the average earnings are 11.3 mills per ton per mile. That the average earnings per ton per mile on carload shipments of cement from Iola, Kansas, to 44 Nebraska stations are 7.8 mills per ton per mile; that the rate on carload ship - ments of cement from Portland, Colorado, to Denver is five cents per cwt., a distance of 147 miles; that the rate from Des Moines, Iowa, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, is five cents per cwt., a distance Certain wholesale firms doing business at certain jobbing cities in the state informally asked permission to appear at the hearing as intervenors relative to the rate adjustment on carload shipments of cement within the state of Nebraska, and at the time of hearing there were representatives of these several firms who offered testimony which tended to show that any readjustment of the carload rates on cement in the state would directly affect their business, all of which is before the Commission and is duly considered in the rendering of this opinion. Defendants The testimony of the defendants shows that the Kansas Gas Belt commenced to be a producer of cement fourteen or fifteen years ago; that the first Portland cement plant was built at or near Iola, Kansas, and gradually extended to include other points in Kansas and in Oklahoma, until there are now some thirteen or fourteen plants producing cement in the so-called Gas Belt; that at the time the Gas Belt of Kansas was developed, Hannibal, Missouri, was a very large producer of cement; that the rate first established for carload shipments of cement from the Kansas Gas Belt was from Iola to Kansas City, 7.2 cents for a haul of 108 miles. That the same rate was charged for shipments from Dewey, Oklahoma, a point about 150 miles from Kansas City. That the Interstate Commerce Commission, in opinion No. 893, decided May 7, 1912, sustained the 7.2-cent rate from the Kansas Gas Belt to Kansas City, Missouri. That the cement plant was established at Bonner Springs, Kansas, many years after the plants had been established in the Gas Belt of Kansas; that Bonner Springs is located on the A. T. &amp; S. F. and Union Pacific railroad lines. That they had presented a schedule of rmtes to the complainants for their approval; that said schedule of rates was adjusted on the same mileage scale as their rates on inter - state shipments from Nebraska gateways, such as Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont and Beatrice.

            <seg id="p205">205 schedule suggested by the defendants — shows that the complainants would have an advantage over interstate cement manufacturers of as much as 60.8 cents per barrel at certain Nebraska points. That on the schedule proposed the complainants would have an advantage on carload shipments of cement to the station of Hastings of 49.4 cents over cement manufactured at Iola, Kansas. That the rates estab - lished from interstate points to Nebraska stations are based on com - petitive conditions as between the manufacturers of cement located in Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. That rates on carload shipments of cement have been established after numerous conferences and dis - cussions of the cement-producing territories. That the rate from Hannibal, Missouri, to Omaha, Nebraska, is 10 cents per cwt., the distance 330 miles. The rate to Lincoln from Hannibal, Missouri, is Hi cents. That the rate from Hannibal, Missouri, to Omaha is established on the short-line distance between Hannibal and St. Joseph, Missouri. That that distance is 198 miles. That the Class C rate established by the state of Missouri fixes the rate that can be charged for the haul, Hannibal to Kansas City. That the rate from LaSalle, Illinois, to Omaha is 11 cents, the distance 500 miles. That this rate was established without reference to mileage. That the commodity rates named on carload shipments of cement from Lincoln are lower than the Class C rates. That the interstate rates on car - load shipments of cement from the south and east are made on the lowest combination of the sum of the locals. Finding* A brief statement of the present adjustment of cement rates on Nebraska intrastate traffic since the establishment of this Commis - sion might be of advantage in the discussion of the rates herein com - plained of. The Commission Act, passed by the legislature of 1907, made the rates in effect January 1, 1907, the legal rates for Nebraska intrastate traffic, the same to remain in effect until changes were authorized by the Commission. The Western Classification, in effect January 1, 1907, provided a classification rate on carload shipments of cement as Class "C," minimum weight 30,000 pounds. The de - fendant Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company had a distance tariff commodity rate in effect on carload shipments of cement when the law became effective. This defendant also had established special commodity rates on carload shipments of cement from Omaha, South Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont, Beatrice and Wymore to all stations on their line in this state. The defendants Union Pacific Railroad. Company, Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Com - pany, Missouri Pacific Railway Company and Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company had in effect January 1, 1907, certain commodity rates from jobbing centers to stations on their lines in the state of Nebniska that were the same or lower than the terminal {~*Iark «!/-«•' fl 4._ T*hp four defendants last named did not have a </seg>

All shipments between stations other than the jobbing stations on the classi - n Class "C" distance tariff rates. No material changes had been made in the cement rates in effect January 1, 1907, until the final order in General Order No. 19, promulgated by this Commission, effective September 6, 1914. The Class "C" rates named in this order had the effect of materially lowering the rates on the lines of the four defendants, Union Pacific, Chicago &amp; North Western, Missouri Pacific and Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, for shipments between stations other than jobbing stations. This order, however, did not affect the rates on the Burling - ton, so that at the present time the rates charged by the C. B. &amp; Q. from Superior are materially higher to the same points of destination than the rates in effect via the C. &amp; N. W. or Missouri Pacific. Below will be found a brief comparative statement of the present rates from Superior via the C. B. &amp; Q. as compared with the rates via the lines of the four other defendants, and what is shown here for Superior applies similarly from all other stations except cement jobbing stations where commodity rates are in effect. Ke have set out here the er that it may be readily above history with so much detail understood that the present cement rate adjustment on intrastate shipments of necessity must be cor - rected and the same general scale made to apply alike, or practically so, on all lines of railroad in this state. With these facts before us let us consider the question of how this equalization of cement rates might properly be determined. In our statement of the testimony offered on behalf of the complainants, it is clearly shown that they rested their case almost entirely by a comparison of carload cement rates in effect on state and interstate shipments in other states. Numerous exhibits showing the ton mile earnings of certain rates established by legislative and Commission acts in the states of Kansas, Missouri and Iowa were presented, also ton mile earnings of rates established by defendants on Nebraska interstate traffic. A comparison of rates on the per ton per mile earnings basis is oftentimes very interesting, and it is sometimes quite hard to understand why one schedule of rates should produce such a materially lower ton mile average earning than an- rom Superior to a ! 25 miles away 50 75 100 150 200 250 ann " " Station C.

The Interstate Commerce Commission in numerous cases have used language similar to the following: "The revenue per ton mile in itself is not a sufficient basis for a juc'gment regarding the reasonableness of the rate which yielr's that revenue. Inquiry must be ma.e regarding the ex- pense incurred in r oing the business." Nebraska State Railway Commission v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 23 I. C. C. 121-125. "The rate per ton mile is but one of many influences in rate adjustments, an' in the present case its value as a com parison is somewhat impaire'." Ash Grove Cement Co. v. A. T &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 23 I. C. C. 519-524 This complaint has brought before the Commission the rate adjustment on carload shipments of cement moving wholly within this state, and the question must be determined. Complainants allege in their petition that the present rates are "unjust, unreason - able, excessive and discriminatory." On the preceding pages we have shown how the present rates are dissimilar and materially higher on one of the defendants' lines of railroad as compared with the rates charged by the other defendants. No attempt was made on behalf of the defendants to show why the present rate adjustment should be continued. It is our opinion, and we so find, that the present com - modity distance tariff schedule on carload shipments of cement in effect on the lines of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company are unreasonably high and discriminatory and should be At the hearing and in numerous conferences complainants have had much to say about the establishment of this cement plant in the state of Nebraska, and have intimated that by reason of the fact that this is an "infant industry" the Commission should allow freight rates that would tend to reserve to the Superior plant the cement trade of the state of Nebraska. This Commission has but recently issued its order in General Order No. 19, after several years of careful investigation, and in that order an equalized plan of establishing class rates as between all stations in Nebraska was adopted, and we shall attempt to pursue the same general plan in the determination of the rates herein complained of, giving due consideration to all of the facts as we understand them. I It appears from the record that numerous conferences were had ween parties herein, with an end in view of being able to agree a schedule of rates that would be satisfactory to both parties, 1 judging from counsel's brief for complainants, the difference ween the rates offered on the part of defendants is not materially higher than the rates considered reasonable by the Superior shippers. We refer to page four of complainant's brief, where it appears that the schedule of tentative rates presented to the Commission by complainants is abandoned, and the rates established in Kansas arc used as a more reasonable comparison. We quote the paragraph re- </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 "Kansas lies immediately south of Nebraska and probably forms a fairer basis of comparison than can be obtained from any other state." The tentative schedule presented by the complainants, as hereto - fore stated, was based on the Iowa rates. We have many times had occasion to compare the rates in Iowa with the rates in other states, and from our investigations we have found conditions in that state materially different in some respects from the conditions surrounding the transportation within Nebraska. The mere fact that practically all of the traffic to the east originating or terminating in Nebraska passes through the state of Iowa would naturally make the density of traffic in that state greater than in Nebraska. In view of these facts we will accept the statement in counsel's brief of complainant and give our attention to the consideration of rates in effect on car - load shipments of cement in Kansas, including the rates promulgated by the Utilities Commission of that state. Ke have already found that the distance tariff commodity rate ct on the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad Company's lines should be ed. Our comparison, therefore, will be based on the Class "C" rates as promulgated in final order in General Order No. 19, as applying to all defendants herein on carload shipments of cement originating at Superior, and will separately consider rates from Su - perior to Lincoln and Omaha and rates from Superior to other stations. The question of joint rates will be considered separately later on in this opinion. Starting then with the proposition that the Class "C" rates promulgated in General Order No. 19 are reasonable for the transportation of articles classified as Class "C," we will un - dertake to find what may be considered a reasonable rate for straight carload shipments of cement between all stations within the state of Nebraska. For the purpose of comparison we have set forth a statement showing the Class "C" rates as promulgated inGeneral Order No. 19, and the rates promulgated by the Kansas Utilities Commis - sion for the same distances, using some of the stations shown in complainant's Exhibit "A" for this purpose: From Superior to Miles Class "C" Rate Kansas P. U. Rate Carlisle 30 5.7 4.5 Geneva 45 6.6 6 Hastings 50 6.9 6 Newark 60 7.5 6.5 Goehner 75 8.4 7.25 Sutton 81 9 7.5 Holdrege 90 9.3 7.5 Crete 99 9.9 8 The above summary shows that the rates in Kansas are 15 per cent plus lower than the Nebraska rates. The order promulgated by the Public Utilities Commission of Kansas, from which the above rates are taken, is not in effect on Kansas traffic at the present time, having been suspended by an injunction granted by the court. We are not Smyrna 8 4.5 3.5 Byron 17 5.1 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 convinced that conditions surrounding the transportation of carload shipments of cement in Kansas are the same or similar to the con - ditions surrounding shipments in the state of Nebraska. The fact that there are some fifteen or sixteen cement-producing plants in the state of Kansas would of necessity provide a greater tonnage for transportation within that state than the shipments within Nebraska. No doubt a large amount of shipments from the Kansas producing plants is moved to interstate points, and thereby increases the ton - nage moved within the state of Kansas, while this condition does not exist within the state of Nebraska. The shipments from the Superior plant will be small as compared to shipments from plants of like capacity in Kansas until the Superior plant has established its trade in the territory tributary to Superior. There is nothing to be gained by an extended discussion of rates promulgated in other states as compared with rates in Nebraska. The fact that this Commission has given a great deal of careful investigation to the question of rates to be applied on Nebraska intrastate traffic, and having had numerous studies and a large amount of statistical data before it in the recent class rate order heretofore mentioned, we are of the opinion, and we so find, that the classification rating as provided in Nebraska Classifica - tion No. 1, wherein cement is classified as Class "C," is higher than the rates should be when compared with the carload cement rates established and maintained by the carriers on Nebraska intrastate traffic from jobbing points, and which rates are used by the carriers in making their interstate rates from cement-producing points located outside of the state of Nebraska. In other words, we find that the rates from Superior and between other stations within the state of Nebraska should not exceed the rates established and now charged by carriers operating in this state on carload shipments of cement as provided in commodity tariffs. At the time that Nebraska Classi - fication No. 1 was promulgated, careful consideration was not given to the question of what rating should properly apply on carload shipments of cement in large - quantities, and for that reason the current rating which had been established by the carriers was con - tinued in Nebraska Classification No. 1. ■For the purpose of comparing the present commodity rates on ad shipments of cement, we have caused a tabulation to be e showing the rates on the C. B. &amp; Q. from Omaha to all Ne - braska stations on that line as compared with the Class "C" rate provided in Part II of the final order in General Order No. 19. This compilation shows the rates to 416 Burlington stations. We find that the Class "C" rate when so applied is 114 per cent plus of the commodity rates. On short distances, up to approximately 50 miles, the Class "C" rate runs below the present commodity rates. On greater distances, however, the Class "C" rates run above. To illustrate, the present commodity rate on carload shipments of cement from Omaha to Kearney, a distance of 190 miles, via the Burlington, is 14 cents per cwt., while the Class "C" rate is 15.3 cents The </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 commodity rate, Omaha to McCook, a distance of 283 miles, is 17 cents per cwt.; Class "C" rate, 21.3 cents. The same comparison made on the lines of the other defendants would show approximately the same rate adjustment. We have already found that the rates on carload shipments of cement moving from Superior and between other stations in the state should not exceed the present commodity rates established by the carriers from jobbing stations. The next question to be determined is how shall the rates be applied by the defendants on carload shipments of cement on Nebraska intrastate In the order promulgated in General Order No. 19 an equalized adjustment of rates was established by the Commission on all classes of freight, and in view of the fact that large business interests have been established on the present rate adjustments on carload ship - ments of cement, the Commission is of the opinion that the rates from Omaha should be established on a basis not exceeding the Class " D " rates as established by the Commission in General Order No. 19, and that the rates from other cement-jobbing points in the state should be adjusted with regard to the present interstate rates to other jobbing stations from which the defendants now name com - modity rates. We are dealing at the present time with the question of straight carload shipments of cement. In the commodity rates established by the carriers cement is allowed to be mixed with other like commodities, such as lime, stucco, plaster, etc. We do not attempt in this opinion to find in regard to the carload mixture of the different commodities. That question is left open for the carriers to make application in case they wish to change the present pro - vision of the commodity tariffs. In view of the testimony submitted and all of the information before the Commission with regard to the rate adjustments in the state of Nebraska, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the rates on straight carload shipments of cement, with a minimum carload weight of 30,000 pounds, between all stations on the lines of the defendants, should not exceed the Class "D" rate as pro - vided in Exhibit "C," Part III, final order in General Order No. 19, except from jobbing points where it may be necessary to make a slightly greater rate by reason of the adjustment between Omaha and other jobbing stations. There still remains the two questions to be determined, i. e., what is a reasonable rate for carload shipments of cement from Superior to Omaha and Lincoln, and what is a reasonable rate for more than one-line haul. The petition asks that rates to the above named stations shall be considered separately from rates to other stations in the state of Nebraska, and much testimony was in - troduced in the hearing to show that in other states Commissions have found that rates may properly be different from and to certain stations by reason of the larger amount of traffic offered for trans- </seg>
            <seg id="p211">211 rates in the state of Nebraska, the Commission has been called upon to make special commodity rates for the purpose of allowing the shipment of certain commodities produced in large quantities a' tain stations, in order that the commodity so produced might have an outlet to the markets of the world. At the time that the beet sugar factory was started at Scottsbluff the Commission was asked to es - tablish a rate on carload shipments of sugar from Scottsbluff to the Missouri river at a figure materially less than the rates in effect at that time. In that order we found that the circumstances and con - ditions surrounding the traffic, and in view of the large volume offered to the carriers, the rate was found to be reasonable and was authorized. In the case at bar we are asked to provide a rate from Superior to the large cement consuming markets of Nebraska for the purpose of giving the plant at Superior the chance to com - pete in these markets on an equal basis with cement-producing fac - tories located in other states. It is true tha' at the present time the amount of the traffic is an unknown quantity, but it is also self - evident that without the establishment of a rate that would allow the Superior plant to get into the larger markets they cannot suc - cessfully compete with plants located in other states. If this can be done and still leave a reasonable return to the carriers for the service performed, it should be done. The present arbitrary established by the carriers on carload shipments of cement originating at points east and south of the Missouri river, as between Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont and Beatrice is 1} cents higher to the last three named stations. The petitioners, in their suggested schedule of rates, provide a rate of seven cents per hundred pounds to be established on carload shipments of cement, Superior to Omaha, and a rate of six cents per hundred pounds. Superior to Lincoln. No testimony was offered at the hearing that would tend to justify this schedule of rates between the points just named, and in view of the facts and data that the Commission has accumulated in this and other hearings, we are of the opinion, and we so find, that a rate of seven cents per hundred pounds on straight carload shipments of cement from Superior to Lincoln and Fremont, minimum weight 30,000 pounds, and a rate of 81 cents per hundred pounds on straight carload shipments of cement, minimum •'! pounds, Superior tc Nebraska City, Plattsmouth, Omaha, South Omaha and Blair, Nebraska, are reasonable rates, and we are also of the opinion, and so find, that these rates should be established as terminal rates only and not made to apply at intermediate points. Relative to thi question of more-than-one-line rates to be es - tablished on carlop.d shipments of cement between points in the state of Nebraska, the question of joint rates is one that is still pending before the Nebr'iska Commission as to the general rate adjustment of the state, and a question which the Commission proposes to take up on its own motion in the near future. Pending this investigation. </seg>

Railroad Company et al., the Commission established joint rates on carload shipments of apples, peaches and pears on the basis of 80 per cent of the sum of the locals on the nearest junction points where facili - ties were provided by the carriers. Since the rendering of this opinion, however, the Interstate Commerce Commission has handed down its opinion in the so-called Iowa-Nebraska complaint, Docket No. 5241, Iowa State Board of Railroad Commissioners vs. Arizona Eastern Railway Company, in which Commissioner Prouty found that a reasonable two-line haul arbitrary to be added to the distance rates provided in the schedule for Class "D" commodities was 1J cents per hundred pounds. Pending the time when the Commission can make a further investigation and study of what constitutes a reasonable arbitrary or additional compensation which should be allowed to the carriers in excess of the mileage schedule, the Com - mission is of the opinion, and so finds, that a reasonable rate for the transportation of carload shipments of cement over more than one line of railroad, on Nebraska intrastate business, shall be 1J cents added to the rate as provided herein. This finding is made with regard to the rates between points in Nebraska other than the rates heretofore mentioned, which the Commission will expect the carriers to establish from certain jobbing stations on the basis heretofore laid down. An order will be issued establishing Class "D" rates for the transportation of straight carload shipments of cement between all stations in the state of Nebraska except those stations from which specific rates are named in General Order No. 19. Within thirty days from the date of this opinion the defendant carriers herein will be required to file with the Commission rates on straight carload shipments of cement, or mixed carload shipments of cement and articles taking cement rates if they so desire, from the jobbing sta - tions from which commodity cement rates are in effect at the present time. Carriers operating in the state of Nebraska who are not parties to this complaint, viz., the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway Company and the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway Company, may file with the Commission application to correct their rates on carload shipments of cement to correspond with the rates herein promulgated, if they so desire. If they do not wish to establish the rates promulgated by the Commission in this order, the rates in effect may be allowed to stand pending further investigation on the part of the Commission or upon complaint being filed with the Commission bringing in question the rates on the two lines of railroad just mentioned.

INFORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 2856 I the Matter of an Application for Addi - tional Depot Facilities and the Installa - tion of an Agent at Glenrock, Nebraska. W. H. Wilson, et al. Complainants vs The M. P. Ry. Co., Defendant. ORDER Hall, Commissioner: Ki'he above entitled case came on to be heard at the office of the nission on the 17th day of November, 1913. The complainants represented by W. H. Kelligar of Auburn, Nebraska, and the dant by General Superintendent A. DeBernardi, Division intendent J. F. Russ, and Edgar M. Morsman, Jr., Attorney. Elenrock is a village of about sixty or seventy-five population, d on the Missouri Pacific railway about five miles northwest burn, Nebraska, and about five miles southeast of Brock. From all the evidence adduced at said hearing, and from all reports on file with the Commission as to the amount of passenger and freight traffic at that point, the .Commission feels that it would not be justified in issuing an order requiring the defendant to build a new depot and install and maintain an agent, as prayed for in said petition. However, as shown by the evidence, and admitted by the Superintendent of said railroad, the Commission is of the opinion that the present facilities are unsuitable and inadequate to properly serve the necessities of the community, and while the Commission does not wish to encourage the use of discarded box cars for depots, it is of the opinion that in this particular case, and as a temporary matter, such a car may be used for said purpose, provided said car is of such dimensions that there will be sufficient floor space for a freight room, and a waiting room. The defendant submitted a photo - graph of a box car remodeled into a small depot, which, if of sufficient dimensions, put in first class condition, would reasonably take care of the traffic at that point. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail- </seg>

ORDER ClarWe, Chairman E'his complaint arises by reason of the refusal of the defendant :eive and transport without delay green hides. The Commis - after some correspondence, held a hearing in which all carriers large number of dealers in hides were invited to participate. It appeared from the evidence adduced, that there is a con - siderable traffic in green hides; that particularly during the summer months green hides are salted to prevent deterioration; that shippers of hides vary in the care they prepare green hides for shipment, and that varying with the care with which they are prepared, and delay in shipment, they are more or less offensive in odor, and more or less liable to contaminate other merchandise such as sugar, flour, milk, etc., if carried in the same cars. The Union Pacific Railroad Company, where the movement is considerable, provides hide cars two days in the week. This is denied by the complainant whose evidence, and admissions by the carriers, tended to show that where such cars were provided, the trainmen occasionally failed to load the hides on account of their aversion to handling them, the delays occasioned thereby resulting in the rapid and serious deterioration of such hides in the summer months, and a consequent loss to the Shippers of traffic liable to contamination from the odor, etc., emanating from such hides when shipped in the same car, and like - wise the deputy pure food commissioner, protest against the practice of shipping hides in the same cars with such commodities. It is impractical to compel the carriers to furnish cars exclus- </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 ■ would require the setting aside of an excessive amount of &gt;ment which, in times of car shortage, would prove burdensome unjustifiable. ■Carriers are permitted in the handling of other commodities, as oil and live stock, to limit their movement to two and three in the week. Kn the opinion of the Commission no good reason was advanced the same restrictions should not be permitted in the movement pen hides. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that carriers operating in Nebraska be and the same are hereby authorized to limit the days for transportation of hides within this state to two days in the week, provided, however, that where such restriction is exercised carriers must post notices in a prominent place in their freight rooms at points affected by such restrictions, advising shippers of green hides of the days on which they will be shipped and how late they will be received on such days for shipment.

ORDERS ON APPLICATIONS APPLICATION NO. 1417 I the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany for Authority to Discontinue the Exchange at Vesta, the Subscribers of said Exchange to be Connected with the Tecumseh and Crab Orchard Ex - changes; also for authority to Establish a new Schedule of Rates for Tecumseh, Sterling, Cook, Adams, Crab Orchard, Graf and Elk Creek, and to discontinue free county service. I)n May 23, 1912, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company its application asking permission and authority of the Ne - a State Railway Commission to increase certain rates for hone service in Johnson county exchanges, and for the exchange dams, and prayed for permission to discontinue the exchange esta, transferring the Vesta subscribers to the Crab Orchard ecumseh exchanges as said subscribers might elect, and for ission to restrict the service of each of the exchanges to its immediate territory, thereby abrogating the free county service tofore furnished through part of the exchanges. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">219 Kermission was also asked to establish differential gross and net with a difference of $3.00 per annum, which difference was to tated in the form of discount for prompt payment of bills. Pin May 31, 1912, notification of the application submitted by iincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company was sent to some five bankers, business men, attorneys, newspapers, and others i towns proposed to be affected, and the hearing was set for 15th. Said notice, except as to repetitions, reads as follows: "The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company has pur- chased all the property of the Johnson County Home Telephone Company, inducing the Adams exchange. The business of the two companies is about to he merged and handled over a single switchboard in each of the towns affected. Possibly the con- solidation has already taken place in some instances. In view of the merger, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company has made application to this Commission for authority to change its rates in all of the towns formerly served by the Johnson County Home Telephone Company. I submit to you herewith a resume of the change of rates asked for by the L. T. &amp; T. Co., as applied to the several towns. In most instances an increase is asked for. "The Commission has t'ef erred action upon this application until June 15th, and any aggrieved or dissatisfied party will have opportunity to file protest against the change of rates during the two weeks encing June 15th. A copy of this letter is being mailed to a number of parties in each of the towns mentioned so that the public may have notice of the application which has been filed by the L. T. &amp;. T. Co., and opportunity to offer protest, in event that anyone desires to take such action." KJetween the date of this notification and the date set for the ninary hearing, numerous protests against the increase in rates curtailment of service were received from patrons, and were due and full consideration. I On the date set for the hearing it developed that the company not yet filed or completed its inventory of property in Johnson ty and the town of Adams, which inventory was necessary to Dper determination of the value of its property devoted to the of the public in the territory, and pending the making of a &gt;lete valuation, the hearing was indefinitely postponed. K Shortly thereafter complete inventories of the company's plant facilities, together with maps showing in detail the location of roperty in Johnson county and the town of Adams, were sub - •d to the Commission. The inventory having been completed and filed with the Com - mission, and the physical valuation department having completed its investigation of the properties and made a valuation thereon, the Commission on May 26, 1913, issued notice that hearing would be held on June 17, 1913, notifying generally the same patrons, and others in the territory who had shown interest in the matter theretofore, to that effect, in order that all parties might have ample opportunity to be present- and take part in the hearing. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 " You are hereby advised that the Commission has fixed Tuesday, June 17, 1913, at 10:30 o'clock a. m., in its office at he State House, Lincoln, as the time and place for public tearing upon Application No. 1417, being the application of the ,ineoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to discontinue its xchange at Vesta, the subscribers of said exchange to be con - nected with the Tecumseh or Crab Orchard exchanges, and also for authority to establish a new schedule of rates for Tecum - eh, Sterling, Crab Orchard, Cook, Adams, Graf and Elk Creek, aid exchanges having been purchased from the Johnson County iome Telephone Company. You will please make note of aid hearings and be governed accordingly." Schedules were submitted, showing in detail all operating expenses ch of the exchanges for the months of January, February and &gt;, 1913, and careful comparison and analysis of these expenses that they are not abnormal nor subject to criticism. E Maintenance charges in some of the exchanges were over, while era they were below the average charges in exchanges of»the size and class, but on the whole averaged less, which is ac - id for in part by reason of the fact that the maintenance s are generally less in the winter than in the summer months, certain parts of the maintenance work cannot be prosecuted ; the winter months. The total operating expenses, and including maintenance per subscriber's station per annum, based on the three months analyzed, is $13.89, while the average cost for the entire Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company plant for ten months in 1912, was $15.61 per subscriber's station, and the average for the entire plant, excluding the Lincoln zone, was $14.10, and it would appear from this that the business was economically managed and conducted in Johnson county, in that the cost of operation and maintenance is less than the average. The overhead charges for executive officers, general supervision and accounting were based in part on proportions of the pay rolls, and in part on the proportion of the number of subscribers' stations in service, and in the instances where such proportions are used they seem to form the most equitable basis which has been so far devised. The analysis shows that the averages for Johnson county for the various classifications of expenditures, based on the months of January, February and March, 1913, are as follows: Commercial expense $3.37 Traffic expense 4.29 General expense .89 Uncollectible accounts .14 Taxes .58 Rents .61 Total direct operating expense $9.88 Current maintenance 2.70 Station removals and changes 1.31 Total of all operating expenses, in- ducing maintenance and station removals and changes, per sub- scriber station per annum 13.89 </seg>
            <seg id="p221">221 An analysis of the three months maintenance costs shows that while the maintenance expenditures were above normal in Elk Creek exchange, the average for the county was below the normal as compared with the entire plant. Total average per subscriber's station $5.79 Average, excluding Lincoln zone, per sul scriher's station 4.72 As against an average in Johnson county, based on the three months named 4.01 SThe difference, however, is accounted for in part as mentioned ve, because based on winter months the maintenance work is not heavy as during the summer months. The actual expenditures the three months used as a basis would produce an average •nditure per subscriber's station per annum of $4.01. No complete analysis on plants of the size or distribution com - posing the Johnson county group has as yet been attempted or made with sufficient detail to determine the exact apportionment of operating expenses as between toll and exchange service. The company claims that 25 per cent of the gross revenue from the toll is sufficient to counterbalance the expenses incident to the operation of the toll service, but on the other hand, an analysis of their ac - counts shows that the apportionment of direct operating expenses as made by themselves exceeds the 25 per cent of revenue received from the toll service. Biased on the three months under consideration, the gross ue from toll for the year would be $6,452.40. 25', of this amount would equal $1,613.10 Fees received from messenger service for threu months 66.40 Total amount credited to toll service $1.67 The company's own apportionment of direct ex - penses chargeable to toll, plus the messenger fees for this period, was 2,355.76 So that, according to their own apportionment, the direct costs of the toll operation, exceeded the 25 &lt;-' ( of revenue credited by 676.26 J'he above is calculated for twelve months, on the basis of the months under consideration, and shows the directly apportioned ses in this case to be 36', of the gross toll revenue, as against allowed by the company. The company claims that the needs for depreciation reserve above current maintenance are equivalent to 7 per cent per annum of the reproduction new value, as claimed by them, or $21,823.14 per annum, which when added to the current maintenance, based on the three months analyzed, would make the total requirements for depreciation and current maintenance of $31,608.58, and this amount would be equivalent to 10', on the net values as claimed by the company. The Commission feels that this amount is in excess of actual needs. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 The engineering department of the Commission have submitted a schedule calculating estimated needs for annual depreciation amounting to $18,097.82, but assuming for the purposes of this case that 75', of this estimate will for the present be a sufficient allowance to cover depreciation not included in charges for current maintenance, the amount to be allowed will be $13,573.47, which amount based on 2464 subscribers' station in service June 1, 1914, is equivalent to $5.51 per subscriber's station per annum; adding this to costs for current maintenance, removals and changes, which is $4.01 per subscriber's station per annum, based on actual costs for the three months analyzed, the total requirement for depreciation and current maintenance combined is $9.52 per subscriber's station per annum -(the total found to be necessary for these purposes in the Lincoln zone was $12.21). Ee company also claims that it should be allowed to earn expenses, current maintenance and depreciation reserve, 8 t on a value of $318,389.01, or $25,471.08 per annum. The ssion, however, feels that this question need not enter into ument. inasmuch as the rates applied for will not produce it revenue to furnish any earnings whatever above operating s and depreciation reserve. The total claim, as mace by the company, is: For maintenance and depreciation $31,608.58 While the Commission feels that the allowance for maintenance and cepreciation should not uncer the present conditions exceed $23,457.28 Eeing a reduction from the claims of the com pany in this respect of $8,151.30 E Based on the operating costs for the first three months of 1913, on the proposed new schedule of rates applied for, the result, •arly as may be estimated or determined in advance under the nt conditions, will be about as follows: Estimated Revenues under Proposed Rates Operating expenses, maintenance and cepreciation Gross direct operating expense based on first 3 months 1913, excluding maintenance and station removals and changes $24,118.84 Less cost toll operation and messenger costs 2,355.76 f\* fnnf ATpkoncrD nniip&gt;itinir ov nawan 4*^1 T fi '^ (\Si Adams Cook Crab Orchard Elk Creek Graf Sterling Tecumseh Vesta subscribers $4,773.00 4,908.00 5,793.00 2,868.00 1,053.00 8,568.00 15,234.00 468.00 Total exchange revenue • $43,665.0 </seg>

Khe situation at Vesta shows that the plant is too small to e separately without considerable loss, and the company's for permission to discontinue the exchange by transferring )scribers to other nearby exchanges seems reasonable and just. IFhe petition of the company asking permission to discontinue ree and unlimited intercommunication between exchanges, seern - founded on reason. The practice generally is not countenanced, this Commission is satisfied that the practice is not consistent proper and practical operation of telephone plants. It leads rious discriminations, and places a burden on many patrons who 9t need or demand the extended service. None of the patrons of the telephone company demand that they shall receive any service of value to themselves, or which entails added operating expenses to the company, without compensation. The situation in Johnson county seems to have been the outgrowth of competition between former rival interests, and the extension of the service generally was apparently offered as an inducement to secure subscribers, or to make it easier to secure the transfer of sub - scribers from the one to the other of the companies in the field. I he testimony also shows that but a very small per cent of the subscribers make actual use of the service, and the tests made indicate that a large part of the service is taken advantage of ansients and non-subscribers, who thus escape any payment ver for the service rendered at the expense of the other patrons he company. Every facility placed at the disposal of the public, and every service rendered, entails some expense, and when such service is not specifically paid for through toll charges, then the cost must neces - sarily fall as a general average charge against all subscribers, whether they use the service or not. This is not fair, and those who need and use such service should pay for its full value, and not ask others </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 No subscriber in Johnson county would demand that free service should be given to him over toll lines to Denver, Omaha or Chicago, but the service rendered in giving free connection between exchanges within the county, or in any other restricted district, differs only in distance, and if permitted to continue without restriction it would result in constant demands for extensions, leading to endless confu - sion, and would inevitably result in prohibitive rates to telephone subscribers, or ruin to the company. It is always difficult to draw a line of demarcation for the limits of such service when rendered, and this Commission is of the opinion that the only safe and equitable plan to all concerned is to restrict the service to the individual exchange, and let those patrons who desire the extended service pay reasonable toll rates; thus only can the burden be equitably distributed, and those subscribers who do not use the service be relieved of a tax for the benefit of others, and escape the discrimination which results from the other plan. Nevertheless the Commission feels that in Johnson county, be - cause of the conditions under which the custom was established, be - cause of the fact that many subscribers in the county are not con - nected with the exchange nearest to them, as well as for other minor reasons which need not be here enumerated, the situation justifies an apparent exception to the rule which should obtain under the general policies of the Commission given above and, therefore, until it shall be shown that conditions are materially changed and further hearing had on application, the farm subscribers to the various exchanges shall be permitted to enjoy unlimited free service to all subscribers in the county under consideration in this case. The company in its petition requests permission to charge $3.00 per subscriber's station per annum, in excess of the net rates, with the provision that the excess shall be deducted or rebated, in the form of a discount if monthly bills are paid at the company's office on or before the 10th day of the month, and quarterly bills at any time during the first month of the quarter for which bills are rend - ered. Contrary to the suspicion, which seemed in some instances to have been entertained by some of the patrons, this rule is not sought to be established here for the purpose of securing added income, nor is it a reflection on the credit or honesty of the company's patrons in any sense. The expense of collections, especially in exchanges whose patrons are to a large extent scattered outside of the city limits, is consider - able, and when, through some discount arrangement as is here pro - posed, the patrons can be induced to call at the office to make pay - ments promptly, it results in some saving to the company in costs of collecting, in interest, and in the saving in part from losses from uncollectible accounts, which latter will always be greater where no inducement is made for prompt payment. The plan is generally sanctioned by most regulating bodies, is </seg>

            <seg id="p228">228 APPLICATION NO. 1417 I the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Authority to Discontinue the Ex - change at Vesta, the Subscribers of said Exchange to be connected with the Te - cumseh and Crab Orchard Exchanges; also for authority to Establish a new Schedule of Rates for Tecumseh, Sterl - ing, Cook, Adams, Crab Orchard, Graf and Elk Creek, and to discontinue free county service. MINORITY OPINION Clarke, Chairman: RI cannot concur in that portion of the order directing the con - ince of county service to farm subscribers without limitation, an additional exchange service after May 1, 1914, to town sub - ere. It is a generally recognized and accepted principle in establish - ing rates for telephone service that single exchange service should form the basis for the units on which rates should be determined. Where added exchange service is given at a blanket rate, an addi - tional and higher rate should be established for the added service. The reasons for this are obvious. Some of the subscribers of an exchange will use the added exchange service but little if at all; some will use it more or less frequently, and some will use it a great deal. It is common knowledge among telephone operators, and in fact axiomatic in telephone operation, that the establishing of free county service and added exchange service has the following results: V'irst. A great number of calls, social or trivial in their nature, ut through which would not be indulged in by the subscriber he or she required to pay ev«n a minimum toll for the service. Second. It necessitates the installation and maintenance of added equipment upon which earnings must be made, increases operating expenses, and occasionally, if not frequently, interferes with the furnishing of satisfactory long distance toll service. Third. Non-subscribers and transients using the telephones of friends or business acquaintances, put through calls to neigh - boring exchanges without charge, thereby depriving the telephone company of a revenue to which it is justly entitled. I fourth. It influences some subscribers, and particularly the subscribers, for social reasons or otherwise, to insist on being d by different lines or exchanges than would be expected if &gt;d to the one exchange to which they are naturally by location, tributary, and thereby occasions additional expense, not only in ial construction, but thereafter in maintenance etc </seg>
            <seg id="p229">229 These added costs and loss in revenues must be met by the rates paid by the company's subscribers. Assuming that the rates paid do take care of operating expenses, etc., and pay a fair return on the value of the property devoted to the public's use (and in this case they will not 1 , it necessarily follows that the subscriber who has use only for the single exchange service, or uses the additional ex - change service but little, is paying more than he should, and those who are using it a great deal, not enough. The principal function of the Commission in cases of this kind is determining, as near as may be, what the reasonable cost is of furnishing telephone service, and to equitably apportion this cost among the subscribers according to use. The ideal apportionment would be a readiness to service charge per subscriber station, sufficient to cover returns on investment, taxes, depreciation, and possibly maintenance charges, plus a measured service rate per call to cover operating costs. In such a case each subscriber would contribute to the cost according to the use. This method, for reasons unnecessary at this time to discuss, is impracticable and unsatisfactory when applied to single exchange service, but when applied to service be - tween exchanges, or so-called long distance service, the measured service, or toll rate, is the only logical and equitable method of apportioning such cost. IFhe majority opinion concedes that the free and unlimited ;ommunication between exchanges "is not consistent with the &gt;r and practical operation of telephone plants," and should not snerally countenanced, but "because the custom has prevailed" jhnson county, because "many subscribers are not connected the exchange nearest to them," and to which they are naturally tary, 'and "for other minor reasons," they make an exception in case. Pf the rates provided in the order were higher than those charged her exchanges of similar size and character, or if they produced renue sufficient to meet all the necessary costs of operation. ;enance, etc., and pay a fair return on the value of the property levoted to the public's use, there might be some justification in Ing an exception in this instance, but when we consider that the herein authorized correspond with those charged by other ex - ;es of similar size and standard, for single exchange service, and in this case they fail to furnish sufficient revenue to pay a fair n on the value of the property after deducting operating costs, act that this practice has prevailed there in the past does not int or justify its continuance in the future. The fact that some subscribers are not connected with the ex - change nearest them, and to which they are naturally tributary, does not justify the continuance of free county service for an unlimited period. On the contrary, I deem it a convincing argument for the opposite conclusion. With the continuance of free county service. </seg>

I am convinced that the Commission has erred in not restrict - ing the service under the rates authorized to a single exchange, such restricted service to become effective only after a reasonable time, sufficient for the company to ascertain from its patrons their pre - ference as to the particular exchange service desired, and to readjust its lines, etc., accordingly. In any event, a specific schedule of rates should have been established for single exchange service and supple - mental schedules for additional exchange or county service. Dated January 30, 1914.

APPLICATION NO. 1437 I the Matter of the Application of Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to Cancel Item 224-B, Supplement 104, C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. No. 15863. ORDER Appearances W. W. Johnston, for Applicant. W. H. Young, for Remonstrator. Clarke, Chairman: The applicant herein seeks to cancel a commodity rate of 4) cents on stone between Lincoln and Grand Island, which was es - tablished in 1906, with the expectation of handling a considerable quantity of lime rock used by the American Beet Sugar Company at its refinery in Grand Island. The evidence showed that no stone quarried at Lincoln was moving to Grand Island. It does not appear from the record, nor is the Commission advised of any quarries being operated at Lincoln. Specific commodity rates are in effect from quarries within the state to Grand Island. Carload shipments of stone such as that contemplated by the applicant in establishing the rate in question, in the absence of specific commodity rates, take Class E rates under the various issues of the Western Classification since 1896, and also under Nebraska Classification No. 1 and supple - ments thereto. The only traffic that can be affected by the cancellation of the item in question would be interstate shipments of building or monu - mental stone billed to Lincoln and after arrival at Lincoln rebilled </seg>
            <seg id="p231">231 to Grand Island. Such shipments are only occasional, and do not justify the continuance of the commodity rate in question, which was established in the first instance with a view of handling a con - siderable volume of traffic in stone of much cheaper quality than building or monumental stone, and we find that the application should be granted and the item cancelled. Controversies have arisen as to what class or character of stone shipments the rate in question should apply while in force. In the absence of a specific description in the tariff establishing the rate, the classifications in effect at the time such shipments moved must control. These classifications, under the heading "Stone and Manu - factures of Same," have on the average some thirty different items, specifically indexing various kinds and descriptions of stone and manu - factures of same by name, and providing different carload ratings ranging from fifth class on "artificial marble, polished surfaces com - pletely protected" to Class "E" on "stone, N. O. S., including artificial stone, rough or dressed, not lettered or figured, and bridge stone, minimum weight 36,000 pounds." (Items 10, 11, 12, 13, page 161, Nebraska Classification No. 1 . These last items above set forth, and similar items in the other Classification, are the only items naming stone in general terms, and applying a specific rating to such shipments. Shipments of par - ticular kinds of stone, such as "marble, granite, jasper and onyx blocks, rough quarried," or "marble, granite, jasper, onyx, rough sawed or dressed, boxed or not boxed, when chiselled, traced, pol - shed, lettered or carved (not sculptured)," etc., could not properly be billed as "stone," for the reason that such shipments are specific - ally described and indexed in the Classifications, and take ratings or minimums different than those applicable to "stone, N. O. etc. We are of the opinion, and so find, that only such carload ship - ments as could properly be billed as "stone, N. O. S., including artificial stone; dressed i^not lettered or figured), rough," etc., under Nebraska Classification No. 1, page 161, Items 10, 11, 12 and 13, and corresponding items in previous classifications, effective on Ne - braska intrastate traffic, are entitled to move under the commodity rate in question. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company for authority to cancel Item 224-B of Supplement 104, C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. No. 15863, be, and the same is, hereby approved, effective thirty days from date hereof. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 10th day of Jan uary, 1914.

The application herein is for the authority of the Commission to issue 240 shares of additional common stock at a par value of $25 per share. In Application No. 940, on the 4th day of October, 1910, the Commission granted the applicant herein authority to issue $8,000.00 in common stock. At that time, and previous to the taking effect of the Stock and Bonds act, the company had out - standing stock in the amount of $28,975.00 And the amount authorized October 4, 1910 8,000.00 Making a total amount of outstanding stock at that time. $36,975.00 The matter has been delayed from time to time on account of the inability of the applicant herein to appear before the Commis - sion. A hearing was held at the office of the Commission January 20, 1914. A detailed inventory of the applicant's properties had previously been filed with the engineering department of the Com - mission, as of date July 1, 1911. The engineering department made its return to the Commission, and showed the reproduction new value of the plant at that date to be $72,498.48, and a depreciated value aa of that date of $52,016.07. </seg>

The testimony further showed the proceeds of the outstanding indebtedness referred to were in actual extensions and betterments to the plant, and that of it was used for replacement, maintenance or depreciation. I From all of the evidence, the Commission is of the opinion that applicant should be granted authority to sell 240 shares of non stock in denominations of $25 per share, at its par value, ng a total of $6,000.00, and that the entire proceeds should be ed to the liquidation of that amount of bills payable and out - ling indebtedness that was created by extensions to the plant, will make the total amount of stock outstanding $42,975.00. The Commission is also of the opinion that the applicant herein should set aside an amount of money out of its operating income, not less than 8 per cent annually, on the entire amount of outstand - ing stock, said amount being $42,975.00. This would make the entire amount to be set aside as a maintenance and depreciation reserve fund, $3,438.00 per year. The Commission is also of the opinion that separate, true and accurate accounts should be kept of the entire operating income by the applicant; said accounts shall show in detail the amount of money expended in maintenance and depreciation and, if any, the amount of money spent out of the operating income for extensions and betterments, to the end that the Commission may know whether said plant is being properly maintained, so that the assets will always be kept approximately equal to the stock outstanding, and said accounts and all vouchers and records shall be open to audit, and may be audited from time to time by accountants and examiners designated for such purpose by the Commission.

APPLICATION NO. 1905 In the Matter of the Application of the Lynch Telephone Exchange for an In - crease in its Farm Line Switching Rate from $1.50 per year to $3.00 per station per year. Appearances: A. A. Binkerd, for the Lynch Telephone Exchange KA. Donohoe and H. W. Tomlinson, for Dorsey Telephone ny. ORDER Taylor, Commissioner: The applicant company operates a telephone exchange at Lynch, Holt county, Nebraska, with about 160 subscribers' stations in ser - vice. In addition the company performs a partial switching service for the Dorsey Telephone Company and Redbird Telephone Com - pany, two farm lines on which there are about 70 subscribers. At the present time the applicant receives for this switching service $1.50 per station per year, or 12^ cents per month. Alleging this rate to be unremunerative, it asks permission to increase it to $3.00 per station per year, or 25 cents per month. Inasmuch as the Com - mission, upon due investigation and consideration, found the rate warranted by existing conditions and in line with other farm line switching rates in the state, the application was approved and an order issued accordingly. Subsequent to the issuance of the order, however, the Dorsey Telephone Company entered objection to the increase and asked permission to present certain aspects of the case that had not been rendered clear in the original application. There - upon, the Commission entered a supplemental order advancing the date upon which the new rates were to become effective and setting the matter down for a hearing. Such hearing was had on November At the hearing it developed that the Dorsey Telephone Com - pany operates a switch of its own and does a portion of the switching between its own subscribers. It does not perform all of this service, however, for the reason that 36 of its 54 subscribers are connected direct to the switchboard of the Lynch company and a portion of the traffic between these subscribers is handled by the operators on the Lvnch board. The other patrons of the Dorsey Company, however </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 are switched by the operator of that company. While the traffic from this source handled by the Lynch Company is not heavy it does impose a burden for which there should be some compensation. The arrangement is made more burdensome to the Lynch Company, moreover, by reason of the fact that it meets the lines of the Dorsey Company six miles from its exchange, consequently the expense of maintenance of the property thus devoted to the use of the con - nection is added to the direct cost of operation. The fact that the Lynch Company has a free exchange of service with a number of other exchanges does not offer a reason for its performing a free switching service for the Dorsey Company. If the latter company were doing all of its own switching, the Lynch exchange would then not be justified in assessing any charge for such service. If the Dorsey Company prefers to take these thirty-six subscribers off the Lynch board and perform all of the switching service between them rather than to pay applicant for the service, it has a right to do so, and we understand, has expressed a willingness to effect an adjustment on that basis. So long, however, as any portion of its subscribers maintain a direct connection with the Lynch board they should be willing to pay for the service thus provided. The situation with reference to the Redbird Company is that of the ordinary farm line connected to an exchange, the latter perform - ing all of the switching service except that secured by the subscribers between themselves by means of numbered rings. As in the case of the Dorsey line, the Redbird wire connects with the Lynch line at a point six miles from Lynch. The Commission has had the question of a proper switching charge under consideration in a number of cases and has supplemented the information thus obtained by independent investigations, and it is of the opinion that a rate of 25 cents per month per station is not unreasonable. As a matter of fact, in many instances it will not pay the direct expense of operating the switch - board. That is true in the case under consideration, as shown by the figures submitted by the applicant. From these figures we have set up the following: Wages of operators $600.00 per year Maintenance of switchboard 28.00 per year Total $628.00 On a basis of 214 subscribers actually switched it will be Been that these two items alone amount to $2.93 per station per year, or a fraction less than 25 cents per month per station. This computa - tion excludes all items of general expense, manager's salary, taxes, insurance, maintenance and depreciation of the poles and wire in use and the building in which the exchange is located and any return on the investment. Surely, such a showing establishes the reasonable - ness of a 25 cent rate. Conditions vary, of course, with every ex - change, and it is possible that some plants may be conducted on a </seg>
            <seg id="p241">241 instances it will not cover the bare cost of operation. For these reasons the application appears reasonable and will be approved. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the application of the Lynch Telephone Exchange, of Lynch, Nebraska, for authority to increase its farm line switching rate from $1.50 per station per year in advance to $3.00 per station per year in advance, as approved in an order issued by the Nebraska State Railway Commission on October 10, 1913, and suspended in a supplemental order issued on October 18, 1913, be, and the same hereby is, approved, said rate to become effective February 1, 1914. ■Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 12th day of Jan , 1914. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Henry T. Clarke, Jr., Chairman. Attest: A. B. Allen, Secretary. APPLICATION NO. 1917 rhe Matter of the Application of the Sarpy Mutual Telephone Association of Gretna, Nebraska, for Authority to In - crease its Farm Line Rates from One Dollar to One Dollar and Fifty Cents per Month. Appearances: For Sarpy Mutual Telephone Association, A. M. Bottorff, Secretary-Treasurer, and L. C. Olderog, President. ORDER Taylor, Commissioner: Applicant is a mutual telephone company, owning six farm lines, three extending from Springfield and three from Papillion. It has no switchboards but secures switching service from the ex - changes of the Nebraska Telephone Company at Springfield and Papillion. It has sixty-six subscribers, all but one of whom are farm patrons who pay a rate of $1.00 per month. One business sub - scriber pays a rate of $1.50. Of these sixty-six subscribers about forty are stockholders in the association, which at the present time has a paid-up capital of $2,000. The association desires to in - crease its rate for the farm line service to $1.50 per month and aaks the Commission to approve the new rate. The applicant is no exception to the ordinary small mutual company in that its books and records are very incomplete, the financial history of the company, for that reason, being impossible to accurately trace. Taking what records there are, however, together with the testimony submitted by L. C. Olderog and A. M. Bottorff, </seg>
            <seg id="p242">SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT 242 president and secretary-treasurer, respectively, of the association the Commission has been able to arrive at the approximate amoun of money invested in the property and the expenditures for operation and maintenance. The Commission's engineering department mad an inspection of the plant and found the reproduction value to be J5.072.82 and the present value $3,575.71. The disparity between the amount of the paid-up capital of the association and the repro duction value as found by the engineers is accounted for in a numbe of ways. In the first place, the association has been reorganizec since it was first established and the stock has been transferred and bought up by the company until it bears no relation to the actual amount of the investment in the property. Again, practically all of the labor involved in the construction of the plant was performed by the stockholders and no account kept of the same. One gift of $900 in cash was made to the company, the only condition being that the donor should receive interest on the same during his life - time. The bare invoice cost of the instruments, poles and wire used by the company aggregates over $3,000, so it is clearly apparent that the amount of capital stock now in force represents only a fraction of the investment in the property. A summary of the fragmentary expense items for the year 1913 presents the following showing: bThe by-laws of the association provide for a salary of $5.00 per for the treasurer and $25.00 per year for the secretary, none of h was paid during 1913 on account of lack of funds. The income from the sixty-six subscribers during 1913 was $66.50 per month, or $798.00 for the year. It will be observed, therefore, that the balance after the payment of the expenses noted was only $85.26. As one item of $60.00 interest and the nominal salaries of the officers were not paid on account of lack of funds, it is apparent that the above showing of operating expense is not complete and that if the record were complete there would be no surplus whatever to cover depreciation and returns on the greater portion of the investment. The record shows that it will be neces - sary to reconstruct a portion of one line next year, President Old - erog estimating that the cost will be between $50 and $100. En - gineer Kates, of the Commission, states that such an estimate is too conservative, and that it will take considerably over $100 to pay for the three and a half miles of cross-arming and an equal amount of -abor $163.50 Paxes 21.69 Maintenance — material 33.55 iwitching charges — 50 cents per station per month 396.00 Total $614.74 nterest 98.00 $712.74 </seg>

The record also shows that but little reconstruction i has been done on the property and that a considerable amount uch work will be imperative in the next two or three years if Bervice is to be maintained at any reasonable degree of efficiency. Snder the circumstances, therefore, the Commission is of the n that the added revenue to be secured through the increase 58 is needed. Moreover, the rate of $1.50 per month for farm &gt; is in line with the rates for similar service throughout the BT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Sarpy Mutual hone Association be, and the same hereby is, authorized to in - s its rate for farm line service from $1.00 per month per sub - r to $1.50 per month per subscriber, said rate to become ive on and after March 1, 1914.

APPLICATION NO. 1934 I the Matter of the Application of the Washington &amp; Western Telephone Com - pany for the Commission to Validate $1275.00 of Common Stock, which has been previously issued by said company without the authority of the commis - sion, and to Issue $5,500.00* of Additional Common Stock. FINDING AND ORDER Hall, Commissioner: Ehis is an application made to the Commission pursuant to n 758, Revised Statutes of 1913, "An act regulating the issu - of stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of common rs and public service corporations and providing penalty for iolation thereof." In force July 1, 1909. I 'he application herein was filed with the Commission on Jan - 30, 1914. Said application contains a detailed statement of aterials and property owned by the applicant and devoted to lone service, and shows the reproduction value of the same to 5,245.88. The applicant has previously outstanding $2500.00 mmon stock and $1275.00 common stock which has been issued ut the authority of the Commission, making a total of $3775.00. On March 10, 1914, an informal hearing was held in the matter </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 at Verdigre, Nebraska, and all books and records now in possession of the company were submitted to U. G. Powell, accountant and statistician for the Commission, by Mr. V. A. Pavelka, secretary and manager of the company. From an examination of the books and information furnished by Mr. Pavelka, we find that the com - pany was organized June 29, 1907. On June 30, 1913, it had 177 subscriber stations in service, divided into 19 city and 158 farm. It was impossible to ascertain the book cost value of the company, for the reason that the books of the company, prior to sometime in 1909, were burned. The books that are now in the possession of the secretary are not kept in such a manner that it would be possible to tell what the property cost that has been added to the plant since the present books were established. From the books and information furnished by the secretary and manager, we find that there are five classes of telephone users in said company, divided as follows: 1) 61 stock holders who paid in $25 into the original organi - zation of the company and received a share of stock, face value $25. In addition to the $25 they were expected to furnish their own sub-station apparatus and one day's hauling of poles and two days' labor to the building of the main lead lines that were built at that time. (2) 69 stockholders who became interested in the company by the payment of $35 in cash, for which they received one share of stock, face value $25, and were expected to furnish apparatus for the substation, to haul the poles necessary for the construction of the drop wires from the main line to the stockholder's residence, it being understood by this class of stockholders that the company would set one mile necessary for the drop, the new stockholders to set the necessary poles to reach the farmhouse beyond the mile limit, the company to furnish one mile of wire and to furnish the labor necessary to string all of the wire from the main line to the residence. (t) 21 stockholders who paid in cash $45 for which they re - ceived one share of stock, face value $25. They were to furnish and install apparatus at the substation and haul the poles necessary for reconstructing the drop from the main line to their residence beyond a limit of one mile, the company to furnish the material necessary to build the drop. 1,4) 9 renters, so-called, furnished their lines complete from the (main line lead to the residence, including the substation apparatus and installment. For the privilege of connecting to the main line of the company these nine subscribers pay an annual switching rental of $6.00. (5) The company has 14 renters who do not own any part of the line or apparatus necessary to furnish them telephone service. 12 of these .so-called renters live in the city and two in the country. They pay an annual rental charge of $15 for the service. From the above it will be readily noted that an attempt was made by the original organizers of the company to equalize the stockholders coming into the company after the original organization was put into operation by charging them amounts above the $25 </seg>
            <seg id="p245">245 for stock issued. It is to be noted, however, that the bulk of the stockholders coining into the company after the original company was organized was mostly on the basis of $35, which was later raised for the balance of the new members, that afterwards came in, to $45. No annual rental charge was made against the stockholders, but small assessments were levied when money was actually needed to pay for the operation of the plant. According to the best re - collection of Mr. Pavelka, three assessments were levied against the original stockholders of $1.00 each; the result of this being that there was no money raised except that actually necessary to pay bare operating expenses, and for a number of years the stockholders received practically free telephone service, at the expense of their plant, which was subject to regular depreciation. The first annual report that Washington &amp; Western Telephone Company of Verdigre made to the Commission was for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1912. This report shows that the earnings from operation for the fiscal year were as follows: L'...— tkn ahovp fiffurps it &amp;DDCArs 1 1\ n t t n f stock holders did ■ Toll . $33.25 Rental 328.75 Miscellaneous . . 25.70 :S b Total IMT.TI Maintenance $252.44 Operation 300.00 General 15.01 Total $567.45 Net deficit $179.75 No. of subscribers' stations this date, City Farm 8 Total 5 »he annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, the following earnings and expenses: ,„, rarnings: Toll $60.40 Subscribers' rentals 1,080.20 Miscellaneous 58.00 Total $1,198.60 Ixpenses: Maintenance $353.85 Operation 461.40 General 3.75 § Total $819.00 Net surplus $379.60 o. of subscribers' stations in service: City Farm - Total </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 stand it, no rental charges were made to the stockholders for any - period previous to that time. If the number of actual renters of service and the farm lines switched were practically the same in 1912 as they are at the present time, the earnings from these two sources would amount to approximately $300.00, while the amount of earnings in 1912 from rentals was $328.75. ■We were informed by Mr. Pavelka that the board of directors recently authorized increased salaries as follows: Central operator $90.00 per annum additional Blanager 90.00 oard of directors 32.00 Total $212.00 The estimated annual earnings on the basis of the present subscribers' stations in service, baced on information supplied by Mr. Pavelka, is Total $1,266.00 The question for the Commission to determine in this case is the amount of stock that it should authorize to be issued. The petitioners asked to be allowed an issue of additional capital stock in the amount of $5,500.00 and to have validated $1,275.00, which has been previously issued by the company without the authority of the Commission. This makes a total outstanding capitalization at the present time of $3,375.00, which amount was verified by our investigation of the books of record and from the information fur - nished by the secretary and manager, from which we found that there were at the present time 151 stockholders who have received shares of stock, of the par value of $25.00, making a total sum of $3,375.00. kFrom the above figures it will be readily seen that no stock been issued for the money paid into the treasury of the company hose stockholders who became members after the original 61, constituted the entire membership at the time the company organized. t mentioned before, 69 stockholders paid in $35 and received e of stock of the par value of $25, making a sum, in excess stock issue, of $690.00; 21 stockholders paid in $45 and one share of stock, par value $25, making an amount of paid into the company in excess of stock issue.

            <seg id="p247">247 Ehich no stock was issued, but according to the statement of &gt;cretary and manager the money was used not only for the uction of new plant but was used for maintenance of the ant. As evidenced by the statement of earnings shown in the annual report for the fiscal year 1912, it would be fair to assume that some of the free labor was furnished the company by the stockholders for telephone service and might be properly considered as a payment of telephone rental rather than for the construction of new plant. It is to be noted that the direct operating expenses for the year 1912, not including maintenance, was $315.01, an amount very little in excess of the money received from the renters who pay $15 per annum to the company, and those renters who pay a switching charge of $6 per year. Attention is called to the material difference in the two classes of stock, for which the applicant makes application. Referring to the last page of applicant's statement, subdivisions a and which describe the purposes for which they ask to issue $7,4" of stock, subdivision (a) asks for the validation of $1,275.00 worth of stock already issued; subdivision (bj asks to have issued $6,200.00 of stock for the purpose of selling same to additional subscribers and shareholders and for the further improvement of the pr- At the hearing the secretary, and manager said that the plant had to be reconstructed and that it was necessary to raise funds for that purpose and that he could sell stock to his present stock - holders and raise money in that way for said reconstruction easier than he could raise it from rents charged for the phones to his stockholders. The result of this would be to capitalize replacements, which would be contrary to the spirit and intent of the law. The $1,275.00 of stock issued without authority of the Commission represents the amount paid into the treasury of the company at $25 par value, plus the additional amount that the directors demand, which we have heretofore explained was an attempt at an equal - ization between stockholders, and the same has already been placed into the plant, so that in validating this amount the holders of the same would receive the stock for which they have already paid money at par value into the company. Assuming that the secretary and manager was correct in his statement when he said that a considerable amount of reconstruction must be made in the near future, the question arises where is the money to come from with which to make the necessary repairs, and it becomes all important. The money received from new shareholders, who desire service from the company, will not be available for the purpose of reconstruction. It will be put into extensions and better - ments. It will, therefore, be necessary for the present holders of stock to pay into the treasury of the company for any stock that might be issued to them but the proceeds of the same should not </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 be used for reconstruction purposes but would have to be used for extensions to the plant. The money for reconstruction purposes should be raised in one of two ways: First, if the rates are not sufficient to raise funds sufficient to pay operation and maintenance and for reconstruction of the plant, they should be raised; or, if it is not desirable to raise the rates to the stockholders of the com - pany, then assessments should be made upon the stockholders to raise funds sufficient to reconstruct the plant. The stockholders of the company should not receive free telephone service and at the same time not take care of the reconstruction of the plant, and if the plant is allowed to deteriorate they should then be called upon to raise the money to rebuild the plant. The Commission is of the opinion that should the $1,275.00 of stock be validated, the amount of stock then legally outstanding will fairly represent the present value of the company's properties, and that as there is a demand for a few more stockholders, the Commission is of the opinion that authority should be granted to the applicant herein to issue $500.00 additional stock for the purpose of extending its lines to the new subscribers desiring telephone The Commission is of the opinion that the applicant herein should take over and own all of the subscribers' stations and drops now owned by the different stockholders of the company, because as its telephone service enlarges it will be practically impossible to con - tinue to give satisfactory and efficient service with part of the sub - scribers owning and maintaining their own drops and subscriber's stations, and when these properties are all taken over by the com - pany, then the company should be capitalized with sufficient stock to represent the entire telephone properties in service, and that rental charges should be made to all users alike, sufficient to pay the operat - ing expenses, current maintenance and depreciation, and create a net surplus sufficient to pay reasonable dividends to the owners of the stock. This is a matter that can be worked out by the stockholders themselves, and the Commission simply recommends that in its opinion it will be more satisfactory for the future of the company. I The Commission is further of the opinion that the said company Id keep separate, true and accurate accounts of all of the money into the company for additional stock and that the said com - » shall make detailed reports to the Commission as to the receipt the expenditure of the same. (The Commission is also of the opinion that the company should separate, true and accurate accounts of its entire operating in - &gt;, showing in detail the receipts and disbursements of the same, accounts should show what money is being paid for general ating expenses, current maintenance and depreciation and what lint of money is being paid to the stockholders as dividends.

The applicant herein has contracted with the Biue River Power Company of Seward, Nebraska, for electric current to be used in the operation of its plant. The said Blue River Power Company is to deliver current at the village limits of Germantown, at a contract price of 8 cents per kilowatt, with a minimum charge of $100.00 per month, so for this reason the applicant is constructing an electric current distributing plant only. SThe cash book shows that the applicant has received from cash criptions for stock $2,225.00, and $55.25 from a contracting that put up a check with its bid for a contract to furnish ma - 1 for that amount, which was afterwards forfeited to the com - f, making the total cash receipts on December 8, 1913, $2,280.25.

            <seg id="p256">256 Exhibit A shows the total asset and liability accounts of the applicant herein in complete summaries. According to said exhibit A, the plant has been developed from $26,000.00 to $36,729.78. Exhibit B shows the entire operating income and disbursements of the same for the same period of time. From an analysis of the books, and the exhibits just referred to, it appears to the Commission that the plant is in a prosperous con - dition and is on a sound financial footing. However, by direction of the Commission the engineering department of the Commission made a physical valuation of the properties of the applicant herein, and on January 27, 1914, filed its report, a copy of which follows: Lincoln, Nebr., Jan. 27, 1914. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sirs: I am handing you herewith copy of our estimate of the physical value of the property belonging to the Albion Electric Light Company of Albion, Nebr. This statement is based on an inspection made by Messrs. Kates and Barnes and represents a con - servative estimate of the cost to replace the property as it now stands, and shows also the present or depreciated value of the various In estimating the value of the re^l estate, the value per acre of $150 is taken as the market value of this land as farm land and does not represent any value which might be there on account of its utility as a power site. Lacking evidence of any bonus having been actually paid for this land on account of its usefulness for power purposes, we could only base our estimate of the increment in value on this account from an analysis of the commercial possi - bilities, and as this would take us into the realm of intangibles we have preferred to exclude any so-called value on account of its being an actual power site. The power development at this place was originally for the purpose of driving a mill which stood on the site of the present electric generating plant. The original creek dam was a timber affair while the present dam at this point is a steel and concrete affair built on such of the old timber substructure as was serviceable. In estimating the replacement cost of the present dam we first calculated the depreciated value of such part of the old structure as was utilized in the new and then added the actual cost of the new concrete and steel, details of which were obtained from the owners of the property. K!"he headgate dam, flume and race have been washed out several so that the present equipment here represents a patchwork, cost of the various rebuilcings and the useless timbering was ied entirely from our estimate. Invoices were found for the engine and generating machinery and the actual cost of this equipment is incorporated in our report. Invoices of transformers and certain other distributing apparatus were found and information thus obtained was utilized wherever possible. The company has bought but one car of poles lately, and as the prices they paid for these poles were considerably above the present average prices we aid not consider it proper to base our pole costs on such information. The prices therefore which we have used for poles in this report are actually lower than the prices paid by the company for its last car. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">257 The company has on hand some second hand machinery as well as several lines of old cypress poles for which they claim no value. We have entirely excluded all such property from this report. Yours truly, C. H. Gerber, Engineer.

Pursuant to notice duly issued, hearing was held in the office of the Commission on January 21, 1914, at which hearing testimony and exhibits were introduced, setting forth the conditions surround - ing the telephone service of the Crete exchange, the capitalization of the Crete Telephone Company which covered the Crete exchange of the said company, and also its exchanges and plant in and about Kramer, Denton and Pleasantdale; also exhibits showing by classes the number of subscribers for all its exchanges, the subscribers of the Crete exchange of Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and the revenue derived from each at the existing rates. The company also filed with the Commission copies of the agreement and con - tracts entered into with the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany, subject to the approval of this Commission, setting forth the conditions and terms of the proposed purchase and sale and manner of payment therefor. The testimony and exhibits disclose that the proposed payment of $32,870.00 to the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for its Crete exchange is the same sum which the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company paid to the Nebraska Telephone Company for the same plant on or about February 1, 1912, and that it is es - timated that expenditures for additions and betterments since that date are greater than estimated depreciation; that the existing in - debtedness of the Crete Telephone Company of $23,700.00 was from time to time, since 1906, incurred by the company for making ex - tensions, additions and betterments in the plant and that all the moneys so borrowed and now owing were expended for such pur - poses only and that to effect the consolidation of the two plants as is contemplated, it will cost approximately $6,047.33, less estimated salvage for property which will be put out of service, of $2,617.33, leaving net cost of such consolidation about $3,430.00.

            <seg id="p270">270 APPLICATION NO. 2000 I the matter of the Application of the Union Pacific Railroad Company for Authority to Temporarily Discontinue Its Motor Car Service Between Kearney and Stapleton. ORDER Appearances: ror Applicant — Edson Rich, General Attorney; Chas. Ware, General Manager; Wm. Cahill, General Superintendent. For Defendants — Warren Pratt, Kearney; R. R. Brega, Calla - way; H. E. Dress, Stapleton; W. E. Hill, Gandy; John T. Bridges, Oconto; H. H. Andrews, Arnold; W. J. Flagg, Miller; J. E. Harris, Amherst. Taylor, Commissioner: Alleging that crop conditions the past season and the present - depression in business has so reduced revenues on its Kearney- Stapleton branch as to cause it to operate said line at a loss, appli - cant asks for permission to discontinue its motor car temporarily or until such time as business picks up and the earnings are sufficient to warrant resumption of the service. Vigorous protests having been expressed by patrons living along the line, a hearing was had at Kearney on January 23, 1914, at which time one or more represent - atives from each town on the line were present, and the service thoroughly canvassed. Bipplicant operates a passenger train each way over this line dition to the motor. The record shows the revenue for this passenger train, for the months of September, October, Novem - nd December, 1912, to have been as follows: Westbound Eastbound September 73c per train mile 75c per train mile October 93c 75c November 58c 51c December 51c 45c ■The revenue for the same was as follows: ■ train for the same period during Westbound Eastbound September 48c October 58c 48c per train mile 43c per train mile 55c " November 47c 39c December 54c 43c The revenue from the motor car for the same months in 1913 wu as follows: Westbound Eastbound September 53c per car mile 70c per car mile October 42c 47c November 36c " " " 44c " </seg>
            <seg id="p271">271 While conceding that the traffic on the motor is sufficient to justify the operation of the car itself, the company contends that such traffic is secured at the expense of the steam train and that the combined revenue during this period of business depression is not sufficient to warrant the operating of both trains. It is apparent from the figures shown above that the introduction of the motor service did reduce to some extent the revenue from the steam train, the reduction amounting to approximately 14 cents per road mile. On the other hand, it is equally evident that the addition of the motor has increased the total passenger traffic, the revenue from the two trains being 33 per cent larger than that of the steam train before the motor was installed. Assuming that the traffic on the steam train would have been the same in 1913 as in 1912 had there been no motor service, the increase induced by the motor service would amount to 65 cents per road mile, or a credit daily to the motor of $66.30, the distance from Kearney to Stapleton being 102 miles. In other words, the loss in revenue of 14 cents per road mile to the steam train by the installation of the motor is not only offset by the increased traffic induced by the motor, but a comfortable margin over and above that of 51 cents per road mile may be directly credited to the motor. Expressed in terms of dollars and cents, the daily increase in earnings due directly to the motor amounts to As the result of a careful study of the cost of operation of a three-car steam train on the Rock Island, made by the accountants of the Commission in 1909, it was found that such cost was 22.8 cents per train mile. This figure covers the wages of the train and engine crews and the cost of fuel, the principal items of expense in the operation of that class of train. It does not include station expense or maintenance of equipment and roadway. Another study made at the same time and on the same road for the purpose of ascertaining the average cost of operation of all passenger trains resulted in a figure of 13 cents per car mile. The figure covers every known item of expense, including maintenance and depreciation of equipment and roadway, general expense, taxes, station expense, etc. On this basis the cost of operation of the three-car train would be 39 cents per train mile. The two studies indicate that it is fair and reasonable to the company to use a figure of 45 cents per train mile for the operating cost of such a train as we have under consideration, and on that basis the earnings for 1913, allowing for the reduction in traffic brought about by the motor, about equal the cost of opera - tion. Using the earnings for 1912, as justified in the foregoing paragraph, a much better showing for defendant is made, indicating that the train, instead of being operated at a loss, is actually running at a small profit. Having found that the steam train is at least not being operated at a loss, we now come to the question as to the earnings of the motor and their relation to the operating expenses. Tti a study </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 made by this Commission of the direct cost of operation of motor cars on the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railroad Company, it was found that the cost per motor car mile was 19.7 cents. This study involved the operation of five cars and covered a period of three months, so that the results should be fairly conclusive. This figure, unlike the one covering steam train operation, includes current repairs and maintenance of the car. It does not, however, include station expense or maintenance of roadway. Reference to the sched - ule showing the earnings of the motor for four months in 1913 develops a comfortable margin between this expense of 19.7 cents per car mile and the revenues earned by the car. The average cost of operation of the car per trip of 204 miles on this basis would be $40.19. We found that the revenue properly creditable to the motor, over and above the traffic it took from the steam train, was $52.02 per trip. This leaves a balance above direct operating expenses of $11.83 per trip. While defendant might contend that this is no more than sufficient to take care of station expense and maintenance of roadway, it should be remembered in that connection that these items of expense are fixed and constant, and would not be affected in any appreciable degree by the removal of the motor. It would require just as many general officers, train dispatchers, station agents, operators, section men, etc., with the motor off as with it on. As a measure of economy, therefore, the reduction in the service is a doubtful and ineffective expedient. There is an abundance of testimony in the record to show that the removal of the motor would impose a hardship on the patrons of the line. The schedule on which the motor runs affords a service that makes it available for use by a large number of people. While, of course, the patronage is largely confined to strictly local traffic, the connection afforded with defendant's main lire trains is decidedly advantageous. Traveling salesmen find the car a distinct conven - ience as, used in connection with the steam passenger, it facilitates their work and saves them much time and expense. It is admitted by the patrons of the line that the service provided by defendant is exceptionally good, but they contend that the territory served has become adjusted to it and that it could not be impaired without substantial loss and inconvenience. In view, therefore, of the benefits that accrue to the public through this service, the saving effected by reducing it should be very substantial before it is attempted. It does not appear to the Commission that the saving is sufficiently large to warrant such a reduction. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the application herein be, and the same hereby is, denied.

In force July 1, 1909. The application herein was filed December 27, 1913, and at - tached to and made a part of the same is a copy of the applicant's articles of incorporation and a complete inventory of all properties owned by said applicant and an itemized financial statement as to the cost of the same. No formal hearing has been held in the matter but from a careful check of the inventories furnished and the item - ised financial statement as to the cost of the same, the Commission is of the opinion that the amount of stock applied for is reasonable and necessary for the purposes set forth in the petition. The Commission is also of the opinion, and so finds, that the applicant herein should keep separate, true and accurate accounts, showing the receipts and application in detail of the proceeds of the sale or disposal of the stock hereby authorized to be issued, and on or before the 15th day of February, 1914, the company should make a verified report to the Commission, showing the sale of said stock, to whom sold, the terms and conditions of the sale, the money realized therefrom, and the use and application of such money; that separate, true and accurate accounts shall be kept of the entire operating income; said accounts shall show in detail the amount of money spent in operation, the amount of money spent in mainten - ance and depreciation, and, if any, the amount of money spent out of the operating income for extensions and betterments, to the end that the Commission may know whether said plant is being properly maintained, so that the assets will always approximately equal the stock that is hereby authorized to be issued, and said accounts, all vouchers and records, shall be open to audit and may be audited from time to time by accountants and examiners designated for such purpose by the Commission. ■The property owned by the applicant herein, as shown by th»&gt; itory on file, consists of: </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT Total $2,000.00 From the above inventory it will be seen that the property owned by the applicant is subject to great depreciation, and that the amount of money necessary to take care of current maintenance will be great, and while the Commission deos not have sufficient information or data to enable it to determine the amount of money that should be set aside for maintenance and depreciation out of the operating income, it is of the opinion that said amount should not be less than 15', annually upon the $2,000.00 of stock hereby authorized to be issued. If this amount should be too great, upon a proper showing by the applicant it may be reduced by order of the Commission. However, that the properties may be kept to a proper state of efficiency, approximately equaling at all times the amount of stock outstanding, the Commission will for the present require a maintenance and depreciation reserve fund to be set aside out of the operating income. The petition states that there will be cash on hand of $543.50, to be used as current expenses and to be used in carrying on the business. It will not be proper to use any of the money derived from the sale of stock for current expenses unless said fund is continually reimbursed from the operating income. In other words, the $543.50 must be kept whole along with the rest of the property. If the physical properties were kept up to 100% of their original values by reason of the maintenance and depreciation reserve fund that is set aside and the $543.50 were used in current expenses, and we were then to take an invoice of the properties and the liabilities outstanding, we would find that we had $2,000.00 in stock outstanding but the physical properties of the plant were $543.50 short, so it will be necessary to keep the $543.50 up to that amount at all times before any dividends are paid.

The history of this company is interesting as well as typical. </seg>
            <seg id="p277">277 of farm lines that had been built into the town of Comstock. The equipment at first was meager and crude, the switchboard being a home-made affair operated with a single plug. For a distribution system the company relied on barb wire fences. This was soon found to be unsatisfactory and iron wire was strung on two-by-fours nailed to the fence posts. As the system expanded this kind of con - struction was also found to be inadequate and small cedar poles were placed to carry the wire, although some of the two-by-four supports are still in service. There were few, if any, cross-arms in the beginning and the wire was attached to the poles with small porcelain insulators. Practically all of the labor incident to the first construction of the plant was performed by the officers and stock - holders without charge to the company. There were about fifty subscribers on the system when the consolidation was effected but with the installation of a switching device the exchange began to grow and it was but a short time until the improvised switchboard was entirely inadequate to accommodate the traffic. Late in the year 1906 a small switchboard was purchased of sufficient capacity to handle the traffic and this switchboard is still in service. At the time it was installed considerable reconstruction had to be done to bring the plant up to the standard it established. Since that time but few improvements have been made in the plant although con - siderable sums of money have been expended in maintaining it. Needless to say, the equipment is badly depreciated and will have to be practically rebuilt if anything approaching satisfactory service is furnished to the public. The switchboard is worn out and will have to be replaced by a new one of modern type. There is need of cable in the town, both on account of the large number of open wires and for the reason that the wire in use is old and subject to constant repair. At the present time there are 146 subscribers on the exchange, in addition to which there are sixty-seven farm subscribers switched by the exchange. As usual in such companies, the books and ac - counts are incomplete and improperly kept. Operating expenses, maintenance and cost of new construction are so intermingled that it is impossible to secure an accurate accounting history of the plant. The Commission's engineers and accountants made an investigation of what records there are and of the physical plant, and from these studies and the testimony adduced at the hearing held in Comstock on April 17, 1914, it is possible to get a general idea of the invest - ment in the plant and the receipts and expenditures. While the authorized capital stock of the company is $10,000. but $2,650 has ever been paid up in cash. No dividends have ever been paid on the stock, but in 1910 a stock dividend of $2,500 was declared, the stock being apportioned according to the holdings of each stockholder. According to Mr. Dunbar, an officer of the com - pany since its organization, this new stock was issued in lieu of un- </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 rendered. No dividends have ever been paid on this stock. The actual capital investment in the plant appears to be between $4,000 and $5,000, made up as follows: Capital stocks $2,650; loans, $800; accounts payable, $200, and working capital $350. In addition to these items there should be some allowance for the labor con - tributed by the stockholders. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the investment has been about $4,500. The reproduction new value found by the Commission's engineers is $5,990 and the present value $3,751. New construction to the amount of $1,200 to $1,500 has been paid for out of the revenues of the company. Averaging the earnings for the four years from 1910 to 1913, inclusive, we find the annual gross income to be as follows: This includes nothing for return on the investment and only a small amount for depreciation. The balance left for these purposes is $436.36. An average of four years' expenses is hardly fair to the applicant, however, for the reason that the expenditure for main - tenance in the year 1913 was double that for the years 1910 and 1911, being $531.36 for the former as against $269.00 and $258.57 for the latter. The condition of the plant plainly calls for an added allowance for maintenance and depreciation, and as no reserve is available for this purpose, it will be necessary to provide for the necessity through increased revenue. During the four-year period there was expended for maintenance an average of 8.8 per cent of the capital investment in the plant. This is somewhat in excess of the amount usually required for current repairs and covers a portion of unrealized depreciation. Using the figures of 1913 as a basis and allowing 7 per cent return on $4,500, and 4 per cent on the same amount for unrealized depreciation, there is a deficit under the present rates of $167.65. The proposed rates would increase the gross revenue $438.00 annually. The new rates would thus produce a surplus of $270.35. In view of the present low state of efficiency of the plant and the necessity of its immediate reconstruction, and considering that the operating expenses will undoubtedly be substantially increased in the near future on account of higher costs of material and wam»n Toll $91.86 Telephone rental 1,569.01 Switching 221.70 Sundry sales 12.63 Or a total revenue of $1,895.20 he average expenses for the same period have been as follows Maintenance $356.45 .Direct operation 919.50 General expense 152.89 Taxes 30.00 Or a total of $1,458.84 </seg>

If :o give first-class, efficient telephone service it must have more L1C The Commission is, therefore, of the opinion that the rates applied for, so far as they apply to exchange service, are reasonable and should be approved. The rate of 40c per month now being charged for farm line switching service appears to be reasonable for the service performed. It is slightly above the average over the state. While not having analyzed the operating costs in the instant case, the Commission has made studies in a number of other companies and believe the rate of 40c to be remunerative for a company of this class. For that reason, the application with respect to the switching rates will be denied. t; is regarded as reasonable and as good telephone practice o ish a gross rate from which a discount can be made for prompt int. The discount reduces collection expense and by reducing perating expense tends to reduce the rate paid by the sub - r. A discount of 25 cents per month is customary and will be ved in this case.

In July 1, 1909. Baid application is for the authority of the Commission to issue shares of common stock in denominations of $40 per share i owners of the property of said Bethel Telephone Company. No formal hearing has been held in the matter herein, but from correspondence and affidavits before the Commission it has been shown that the property of said applicant was constructed in 1906 and the years following and operated purely as a mutual concern. Later the owners concluded to incorporate and on June 21, 1913, they filed articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, a certified copy of which has been filed in this application. An amended application was filed on March 30, 1914, and attached to and made a part of the same is a certified copy of the articles of incorporation above referred to, and an exhibit which contains a detailed inventory of all material and labor that have gone into said properties.

The Commission is also of the opinion that separate, true and accurate accounts shall be kept of the entire operating income by the applicant. Said accounts shall show in detail the amount of money spent in maintenance and depreciation and, if any, the amount of money spent out of the operating income for extensions and better - ments, to the end that the Commission may know whether said plant is being properly maintained, so that the assets will approxi - mately equal at all times the stock authorized to be issued and said accounts and all vouchers and records shall be open to audit and may be audited from time to time by accountants and examiners desig - nated for such purpose by the Commission. The Commission is further of the opinion that the applicant herein should set aside an amount of money out of its operating income, not less than 8', annually on the entire amount of stock hereby authorized to be issued by the Commission, for current maintenance and depreciation. ■'he Commission is further of the opinion that the applicant make reports to the Commission of its affairs, the first report &gt; made on June 30th, 1914, and annually thereafter on the day of June. From the evidence before the Commission, it further appears that there has not been a regular rental charge made to phone users, but assessments have been made from time to time upon the stockholders to pay operating expenses and current maintenance. The Commission is of the opinion that it will be necessary to make a regular rental charge for the use of phones, that sufficient funds may be raised to pay operating expenses and to create a maintenance and depreciation reserve fund, to the end that the company will have sufficient funds on hand to always take care of current main - tenance and depreciation of the plant.

APPLICATION NO. 2076 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany for Authority to Establish a Schedule of Rates at Its Hastings Ex- change.

Toll rate to Blue Hill to be cut to 10 As the consolidation of the two plants is now ready to be effected, and as there is an urgent demand on the part of the patrons for the unified service, the Commission deemed it advisable to approve a new schedule without making the usual exhaustive valu - ation of the property and study of the accounts as to earnings and expenses. Accordingly a conference was held at Hastings on April 21st, which was participated in by the members of the Commission, representatives of the applicant, and a number of other companies affected and by a large number of patrons, at which time the matter was canvassed in a general way and the opinions of all parties received, together with such data and information as was available. Any rates approved at this time, therefore, will only be tentative ■will be subject to further investigation in the future. The approximate cost of the consolidated property to the appli- cant is disclosed by the books. The automatic plant was purchased for $112,299, this figure excluding the cost of the toll property. The purchase price of the Nebraska Telephone Company's plant, exclusive of toll property, was $87,758. Since the purchase of the two plants a considerable sum has been expended in improvements and betterments, the exact amount not being ascertainable as the work is not yet completed. The deductions from plant and the </seg>
            <seg id="p295">295 B pears from the records at hand, however, that the cost of the rty as it will be employed in the consolidated service and with per allowance for working capital will be in the neighborhood 15,000 to $250,000. The earnings from both exchanges for the last six months of 1913 were $29,401.51. This figure does not include any of the exchanges' income from toll, nor will the following figures relating to expenses include any of the expenses caused by toll operation, the plan of the Commission being to segregate the toll property from that devoted to the use of the exchange together with the earnings and expenses from the same source. The expenditures for maintenance and realized depreciation for the same period were $7,513.34, while the direct operating expenses were $7,508.90. Added to this was $741.84 for taxes and $387.57 for uncollectible accounts, making a total charge against earnings for maintenance and depre - ciation, direct operating expenses, taxes and uncollectible accounts of $16,151.65. Doubling these figures in order to arrive at a basis for a year's operation we have $58,803.02 as the earnings from the two plants, out of which was expended $32,303.30 for the purpose detailed above, leaving a balance of $26,499.72 for return on the investment and a reserve for depreciation. Assuming the coat value of the two plants to be $200,000 and allowing 7 per cent for rate of return, we have $14,000 to be charged against the balance, leaving a surplus of $12,499.72. On the above assumption it might appear that the present rates are sufficient to operate and maintain the plants, provide a depreciation fund and pay a reasonable return on the investment. The figures, however, are by no means con - clusive, as they have been subjected to but little analysis. A study of the history of the automatic plant, for example, shows that in the six years of its operation from 1908 to 1913, inclusive, there was expended for current maintenance slightly over 3 per cent of the cost value of the plant annually, while at the same time there waa set aside a surplus for depreciation of only 2 per cent. An allowance of only 5 per cent for both maintenance and depreciation is not sufficient to maintain the plant at one hundred per cent service efficiency and at the same time protect the property against loss. The Commission has in some cases allowed 9 per cent for these purposes and regards 8 per cent as a minimum allowance. The consolidation of the plants will result in a substantial reduction in revenue due to the duplication of telephones. As shown above, there were 2775 stations in service on April 1, 1914. A study submitted by the company estimates the number of duplicates at 320, 206 of which are business subscribers. There will be a number of readjustments following the consolidation, so that it is impossible to accurately forecast the number of stations in each class of service and the exact revenue that will accrue therefrom, but the study referred to was made with considerable care, and is believed to be </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 I rates to the 2455 subscribers who can reasonably be expected ■main after the consolidation, the annual rental revenue will SO, 400, which is $8,403 less than the rental earnings from the plants at the present time. Applying this revenue to the con - ited plant, on the basis of the expenses for the last six months 113, the following result is obtained: Total $50,400.00 $48,753.30 Surplus for depreciation reserve $1,647.00 The tax item used above is the actual payment as shown by the books and covers nothing but general taxes. If an occupation tax is levied it would reduce the net revenue and would necessarily have to be considered in the fixing of the rates. While this indicates that the Bell rates will not, under present conditions, produce sufficient revenue to take care of operating expenses and dividends, and at the same time provide a proper amount for depreciation, yet the earnings will be sufficient to protect the property from serious loss for a period of several months, during which time the improvements to the plant can be completed and the necessary adjustments brought about to bring the system to a normal operating basis. The schedule proposed by the applicant increases the rates to business subscribers only, adding $1.00 per month to the present Bell rates. The increase would produce slightly less than $4,000 per year more revenue. It will be observed from a study of the present schedules that an unusually large amount of "free service" is being given at the present time, particularly by the independent exchange. Through an arrangement with the Glenwood Telephone Company the Hastings Independent Company gave free service to all of the exchanges on that system, which covers practically all of Webster county. It also had free exchange arrangements with the other independent compan - ies in Adams county. The situation with respect to the old Bell exchange is somewhat different for the reason that five of the ex - changes with which there is a free exchange of service, namely, Ayr, Pauline, Juniata, Prosser and Hansen, are owned by the Lincoln company and the subscribers pay the same rates as are in effect at Hastings. There is a free exchange of service, however, with the exchange of the Clay County Rural Phone Company at Glenville. The large amount of free service thus furnished has imposed a heavy burden on the companies affected, the results being reflected in a depleted toll revenue and an increased traffic expense.

            <seg id="p297">297 as is indicated by notice served upon the Commission by the secre - tary of the Glenwood Telephone Company. This letter was received by the Commission on May 26, which was subsequent to the con - ference at Hastings. The letter says in part: "It virtually has been agreed by the parties to establish a toll rate of ten cents per call between Hastings and the Glen - wood exchanges at Ayr, Blue Hill, Bladen, Holstein and Rose - land, and that a contract will soon be entered into after a few minor points have been agreed upon, subject to the approval of the Railway Commission. "That at a meeting of the directors of the Glenwood Telephone Company held April 30, nine of the eleven directors, several members of the district boards and the executive board were present to consider the proposed contract, no objections were made to adopt the contract, except by the director of the Holstein district. "The Glenwood Telephone Company therefore requests that that part of the application of the L. T. &amp; T. Co. referring to the free service with Holstein and Roseland be not granted." The Commission is advised that this contract has not yet been consummated but that negotiations are still in progress. Negotiations are also being conducted with the other companies affected, with the object of discontinuing the free service arrangements and placing the traffic on a message basis. There can be no question but that the discontinuance of the free service would insure a more equitable distribution of the charges and greatly improve the service. Its discontinuance is likewise necessary if the Bell rates as applied in the above study are to be approved as the tentative schedule for the consolidated service. The placing of the free service on a toll basis will affect the company in one of two ways, either it will reduce the number of calls and thus reduce the traffic expense and the investment incident thereto, or it will increase the toll revenue. In either event, the net revenues of the applicant will be materially increased. To what extent it is impossible to predict, but that is another matter that will develop from a trial of several months. At any rate, the saving thus effected will contribute to the surplus for depreciation and render more unlikely any injury to the property through a trial on the basis outlined. IM the present time a discount of 15 cents per month on business hones and 10 cents per month on residence telephones is being ed the subscribers on the automatic exchange for payment of hly bills within ten days. The application in the present case des for a flat discount of 25 cents per month from the gross to all subscribers. This is a discount that is standard over the , and has been approved in a number of cases by the Commission. Jtigation shows that it is a material incentive to prompt pay - , and results in a reduction of collection expense. It is regarded reasonable rule and will be approved. The records for the s : x months referred to above show that the removal of telephones and their change from one location to annth^r </seg>
            <seg id="p298">298 imposed upon the two companies an expense of $1,592.99, or about $3,000 per year. This is a burden, which, if not provided for by a special charge, must be passed along to the public in the monthly rates. That the latter method is inequitable, is obvious, for the reason that many of the changes are unnecessary, and in some instances are prompted by whimsical motives. As stated in N. S. R. C, Application 1637 (p. 21), "It seems unfair to the Commission that patrons who are permanent and who do not demand frequent removals and changes should be called upon to assist in paying for the expense of making removals and changes for others, and there - fore a schedule of rates is made to cover in part at least the expense incurred in this manner." The charge imposed in that order waa $2.00 for a move within a building or change of class of instrument. This appears to be a reasonable charge in the present case, and for the reasons given will be approved as a part of the schedule. In view of the lack of time in which to make the necessary valuation and accounting, and in view of the satisfactory showing made by an application of the old Bell rates to the system after consolidation, the Commission is of the opinion the public will be better served and the requirements of the company substantially met if this schedule is applied for a period of at least nine months. With the discontinuance of the free service and the adjustments suggested, it is apparent that the company will not seriously suffer. At the end of nine months the plant should be working smoothly, the classification of subscribers definitely determined, the earnings and expenses should be on stable basis, and the whole system should have reached a normal condition. If, at the end of that period, the company finds that its revenues are insufficient and concludes to ask for an increase of rates, the Commission will make a thorough and exhaustive investigation to determine definitely what the rates ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lincoln Telephone Begraph Company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to and collect, until the further order of the Commission, from ter June 1, 1914, the following schedule of rates on its Hastings exchange: Metallic Circuit Grounded Circuit Gross Net Individual business $45.00 $42.00 Two-party business 39.00 36.00 Four-party business ....

In fact, the operating statements of the company show that up to December 31, 1911, the cost of operation exceeded its revenue by $790.50, and that the deficit which might be termed "cost of develop- ment of business", and could properly be charged to capital, was Bout from the net earnings of the following years, o dividends have been paid to the stockholders, the net earn- ings having been used on building additions and betterments to the The growth of the company's business is clearly evidenced by the following statement of its gross earnings Twelve months ending April 30, 1912 $5,041.60 Twelve months ending April 30, 1913 8,542.26 Twelve months ending April 30, 1914 11,092.69 That the applicant has developed a successful going business is evidenced by its operating statements for the periods hereinafter set fort H * Calendar Year 1913 Gross earnings $10,422.23 Gross expenses 7,893.07 Net earnings 2,529.16 Four Months Period Jan. 1, 1914 to May 1, 1914 Gross earnings $4,212.38 Gross expenses 2,528.45 Net Earnings 1,683.93 It is clear that applicant's petition, so far as it relates to the discharge of its bills payable, and additions to its electric plant, is proper and should be approved. The proposition that it should be authorized to issue and sell its securities in the amount of $12,700.00, the proceeds of which are to be invested in an artificial ice plant. presents a more difficult question. Under the provisions of the statute a public service corporation "may issue stock, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness * * • • when necessary for the acquisition of property, the construction, completion, extension or improvement of facilities, or for the improve- </seg>
            <seg id="p304">304 Biing of its obligations, provided and not otherwise that there have been secured from the Nebraska State Railway Commission der authorizing such issue and the amount thereof, and stating in the opinion of the Commission, the use of the capital to be ?d by the issue of such stocks, bonds, or other evidence of tedness, is reasonably required for the said purposes of the ration." As a general principle, where the control of the capitalization of public service corporations is vested in Commissions, such corpora - tions are not permitted to issue and sell their securities for the pur - pose of using the proceeds thereof in any other business than that which is commonly termed "public service." At the present time the manufacture and distribution of ice is not regarded as a public Itt is, however, becoming more and more a common necessity, of late years the demand for municipal ice plants has become and more urgent, particularly where the local situation savors onopoly and the prices charged for ice are deemed unreasonable. Bn localities unfavorably located for a supply of good natural he operation of artificial ice plants has been demonstrated to be imically profitable and of public benefit. If the conditions in Broken Bow were such that a sanitary and sufficient quantity of natural ice were available to supply its needs, or if it appeared that conditions were such as to permit the financing of an independent company; or that the operation of an artificial ice plant would possibly prove a financial burden on the light and power department; or that the capital investment, eosts and operating ex - penses, and income of the ice plant and the light and power plant, would be so intermingled that they could not be allocated or appor - tioned with reasonable accuracy to the proper account, the Com - mission would not deem it proper to approve of applicant's petition so far as it relates to the ice plant. Upon the hearing it developed that the applicant at the present time is not giving day service, that there is a demand for such ser - vice, but that under existing conditions the consumption of current during the day would be insufficient to pay operating costs, and to furnish such service without developing an additional load would prove economically unsound; that the operation of an artificial ice plant in conjunction with an electric light plant will furnish the additional load necessary to justify the giving of day service. It further appeared that by such operation the exhaust steam which is now a waste product may be utilized; that the surplus of distilled water from the ice plant may be substituted for the water now used in the company's boilers, which requires chemical treatment at con - siderable expense; that but little if any additional help will be re - quired, and that as a general and practical result the units of cost in generating electric current will be reduced to the ultimate benefit 01 the electric ugnt ana power patrons. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">305 It further appeared that the local community consumes on the average approximately 600 tons of ice each year; that its supply is frequently inadequate and more or less unsanitary; that the demand for an artificial ice plant is so urgent that within a period of three days subscriptions to the company's proposed bond issue in approxi - mately the sum of $4,000.00 were pledged locally; that the stock - holders of the applicant are unable to finance an independent ice company, and that it is necessary to construct and operate same in connection with the electric plant in order to secure the needed It further appeared that in addition to the local demand there is a large territory to be supplied, extending from Ravenna on the east and south to Alliance on the north and west; that the lighting company operating an ice plant in Holdrege, a city but little larger than Broken Bow, is marketing 3,000 tons per year at a profit; that this latter company is subjected to greater competition from natural ice in neighboring territory, and that the territory supplied is but little if any greater than that tributary to Broken Bow. I 'he manager of the applicant company demonstrated that he lade an exhaustive investigation as to ice production costs, am I the maximum cost upon a 600-ton basis at $1.25 per ton costs will be reduced appreciably with increased production ; company develops a market for its full production of approxi y 3,000 tons per year. I The price of ice F. O. B. applicant's loading platform is $3.25 ton. If its market were limited to local consumption, a net ating revenue of $1,200.00 per year would be realized from the slant operations. It is apparent, therefore, that the ice plant not only be self-sustaining but that with the development of ide trade the ice plant will not only be self-sustaining but prove ofitable enterprise, in addition to the reductions of units of cost h it will effect in the operation of the electric plant. I Upon consideration of the evidence, it is clear to the Commis - that the investment and operating costs of the ice plant can be ■gated with reasonable accuracy from those properly chargeable he electric plant, and applicant will be required to so keep its s of account that they will accurately show the various items erly chargeable to such accounts. I The record shows that the company has been economically »nd fully managed in the past. In order, however, that the pur - »ers of the bonds applied for herein may be fully protected, applicant will be required to set aside a sufficient amount out of earnings to provide for deferred depreciation. Applicant will be given thirty days from the date its ice plant is placed in operation within which to submit to the Commission for its approval a plan of accounting which shall segregate the costs, operating and invest - ment, as between the ice and electric plants, and an amount or per - ccnt&amp;fG which it deems su fficicnt to uro v i dt* for f u t nrp (.ipttrpoifltion </seg>

APPLICATION NO. 2145 rtie Matter of the Application of the Ne - braska Telephone Company for Au - thority to Issue and Sell Its Common Stock in the Amount of $1,500,000.00. By the Commission: Appearances: Guy H. Pratt and W. A. Pixley, for Applicant ORDER This matter came on for hearing on the petition of the applicant herein, asking that the Commission grant its authority for the Ne - braska Telephone Company to sell its common stock, at par, in the </seg>
            <seg id="p307">307 The purpose of the issue of common stock, as shown by the last page of the petition, is stated as follows: 'To retire one million three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,350,000) of six per cent (6 r , ) demand notes now outstand - ing, for which notes the Nebraska Telephone Company received their face value. The balance of $150,000, after the retirement of the notes, to be used for future construction and betterments to the Nebraska Telephone Company's plant as from time to time the same will be needed." Accepting this statement of the applicant as to the purposes for which the new issue of common stock is required, it becomes quite necessary that the Commission definitely determine whether or not the $1,350,000.00, said to have been received by the Ne - braska Telephone Company for the 6 per cent demand notes which said company sold, actually was paid for in cash or other tangible assets. With this end in view, the accounting department of the Commission was instructed to make an investigation of the books and accounts of the applicant, the Nebraska Telephone Company, and as a result of said investigation the Commission is advised: (1) That on certain dates certain amounts of money were re - ceived by the applicant from the sale of its demand 6 per cent notes, the dates and amounts of which are stated in detail in the accountant's report in Application No. 2071, being the application of the Nebraska Telephone Company to issue its two-year 6 per cent notes in the amount of $4,000,000.00, which application was allowed by the Commission in its order in the above numbered application, dated April 4, 1914. The accountant's report in the instant case shows that the total amount of money received by the applicant from the sale of its 6 per cent demand notes from the time when the company began meeting its financial needs in the above men - tioned manner was $6,766,000.00. In Nebraska Telephone Com - pany's Application No. 1610 this Commission authorized the appli - cant to issue its common stock in the amount of $1,313,000.00. This amount added to $4,000,000.00 of two-year 6 per cent notes, au - thorized by this Commission in Application No. 2071, makes a total of $5,313,000.00 capital liabilities heretofore allowed by the Commis - sion, all of which amount has been paid into the treasury of the applicant by the sale of its demand notes, the total amount of which, as mentioned above, is $6,766,000.00. After deducting the issues of two-year notes and common stock there would be remaining $1,453, - 000.00 of- cash received by the Nebraska Telephone Company, the applicant herein, from the sale of its demand notes. 1(2) That on December 31, 1913, the Nebraska Company sold emand note in the amount of $103,000.00, which demand note paid and cancelled in April, 1914. Deducting this amount from total mentioned above in the amount of $1,453,000.00, there remains the amount of $1,350,000.00, for which the applicant n now asks the Commission to authorize the issuance of common :, thus cancelling the demand notes now outstanding in the same </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 In order that the Commission might know that the proceeds from the sale of the demand notes in the amount of $1,350,000.00 had been invested in betterments and additions in the plant of the applicant, the accounting department was instructed to make its investigation and report to the Commission its findings on the amount of money received by the applicant from the sale of its demand notes for the purpose of betterments and additions. The accountant's report shows first, that it is impossible to trace the actual betterments and addi - tions added to the Nebraska Company's property by reason of the investment of $1,350,000.00, by reason of the fact that the above mentioned amount of money was received by the defendant company at different times, covering a period of from twelve to fourteen months, and at the same time that this money was being invested in the property, money received by the company from operation and credited to reserve or surplus accounts was in like manner in - vested in betterments and additions, thereby making it impossible to specifically trace the investment of the $1,350,000.00 mentioned herein. For the purpose of ready reference and comparison, the amounts in which the applicant's plant has been increased since the date, November, 1909, when the first money was received from the sale of its demand notes, are shown in the following statement, which is before the Commission in the accounting department's report and reproduced here: June 30, 1909 $6,931,960.00 December 31, 1909 7,092,855.00 April 30, 1914 15,078,567.54 Iccording to the accountant's report, it has been the practice Nebraska Company to invest its appropriated and unappro - 1 surplus earnings in betterments and additions to the plant, refore becomes important that the Commission be fully advised authorizing the issuance of capital liabilities that no part of tine is for deferred depreciation or other appropriated reserves ary for the operation of the company's property. The accountant's report shows that the total amount of capital and working liabilities on April 30, 1914, is $11,838,482.28. The same statement shows the total liabilities as of that date to be $15,078,567.54. The difference between the capital and" working liabilities, as stated above, and the total liabilities, in the amount of $3,240,085.26, is represented in the company's accounts as appro - priated reserves and surplus. The appropriated and unappropriated reserve accounts of the company as of the above mentioned date are If 1J1U 1, 1911 1, 1912 1, 1913 . 10,044,806.90 13,704,558.15 15,047,584.81 </seg>
            <seg id="p309">309 The accountant's report further shows that the credit to the depreciation reserve fund as of December 31, 1911, was $1,550,905.67; December 31, 1912, $1,618,479.06; December 31, 1913, $1,496,762.94; April 30, 1914, $1,510,464.73. From the above statement of the depreciation reserve account it will readily be seen that during the four years mentioned the de - preciation reserve account remained almost stationary. This fact would tend to indicate that the amount charged against operating expenses for realized and unrealized depreciation taking place in the plant was practically sufficient to maintain the property. This at least would be true during the four-year period mentioned above. It would therefore appear that the money received by the •ant from the sale of its demand notes in the amount of $1,350, - ) is represented in the assets of the company, and that the nt of free assets above the capital and operating liabilities, as oned above, is sufficient to amply protect the authorization of &gt;mmon stock, as asked for in the petition of the applicaiu. There remains but the one point to be mentioned and that is the $150,000.00 which is to be paid into the treasury of the company from the sale of its common stock in the same amount. This amount together with the $1,350,000.00, heretofore explained, will equal the total amount asked for by the applicant. I The Commission, upon consideration of the application herein the report of its accountants, and being fully advised in the lises, finds that the Nebraska Telephone Company has outstand - 11,350,000.00 of 6 per cent demand note:, which is a lawful exist - indebtedness of the company and for which it received one [red cents on the dollar. K'he Commission further finds that the applicant reasonably re - i for the purpose of future betterments and additions the amount 50,000.00, and that the said applicant should therefore be au - ed to issue its common stock in the amount of $1,500,000.00. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Nebraska Telephone Company be and the same is hereby authorized to issue its common stock in the amount of $1,500,000.00 for the purpose of retiring its 6 per cent demand notes in the amount of one million three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,350,000.00) and for the payment in cash, one hundred cents on the dollar, of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00).

            <seg id="p314">314 The new schedule, as will be noticed, provides for considerable change in the arrival and departure of the passenger trains and dis - continues one of the trips made by the "shuttle train" between Grand Island and Hastings. While the schedule does not show it, a change is also proposed with reference to the handling of live stock from Grand Island and the two stations between Grand Island and Hastings. At the present time live stock is moved out of these stations on the mixed train that leaves Grand Island in the morning, connection being made with a stock train that leaves Hastings early in the afternoon. Under the proposed schedule the plan is to operate a special train between Grand Island and Hastings whenever there are five cars of stock to be moved, the only other service being the mixed train that will leave Grand Island at 3:45 in the afternoon, arriving at Hastings in the evening, too late for the regular stock train, thus necessitating a lay-over there until the following day. The advantages urged by the company for the new schedule are that it will be more economical and at the same time provide a better local service to all points on the line. The St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island is essentially a local road, and the great bulk of its traffic, both freight and passenger, is local. Heretofore an effort has been made to furnish a through passenger service to St. Joseph and Kansas City. According to the testimony of the representatives of the road, the traffic is not sufficient to justify a continuance of the service, and the management has concluded to devote its entire attention to the development of the local business. From the ob - jections expressed at the hearing, however, it hardly appears that the schedule as planned is calculated to improve the local service to any appreciable extent. In fact, the objectors think it would be seriously impaired under the new arrangement. There are three main points of criticism offered by the remon - strators: (1) The insufficiency of the stock service, (2) the disad - vantage to Grand Island jobbers in the new freight service, and, (3) the discontinuance of the second trip of the mixed train between Grand Island and Hastings. As to the first objection there appears to be ample grounds for it. As shown above, the new schedule provides for no regular stock service whatever, except that furnished by the mixed train in the afternoon, and as that would be attended by an eighteen-hour delay at Hastings it would be practically the same as no service at all. A suggestion was made at the hearing that a stock train operated regularly one day in the week would be much better than the plan proposed, and this was admitted by applicant, and the latter offered to modify the schedule so as to provide for a regular weekly or semi-weekly service. The importance of Grand Island as a live stock market, and the amount of traffic moving over applicant's road from that point, calls for better than a weekly or semi-weekly service. One of the largest horse markets in the United States is lucaieu «i vimiiu lomnu, anu mere is a large movement ui iiur»t?s </seg>
            <seg id="p315">315 from that point to St. Joseph, Kansas City and southern points. The record shows that 220 cars of horses were shipped out of Grand Island over applicant's road in 1912, 275 in 1913, and 100 cars in the first six months of 1914. While the stock movement in other lines showed a falling off in 1913, the slump did not affect the horse business, as is evidenced by the fact that 15,800 head were handled in 1912 and 23,922 in 1913. In addition to horses there is a large movement of other live stock, owing to the fact that the Union Stock Yards Company has a plant at Grand Island, and much stock is stopped for feed and water at that point. According to the records of the stock yards company, introduced in evidence, 947 cars of all kinds of stock were shipped out of the yards over the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island railroad during 1912, 839 cars during 1913, and 208 cars during the first seven months of 1914. These figures do not include any shipments billed through and which are not stopped at Grand Island. There are five stock shipping points between Grand Island and Hastings that are served by applicant. Using the figures as shown by the station reports on file in this office, and adding them to the figures as shown above, it appears that 1,428 carloads of live stock were handled by applicant in 1912, and 1,314 carloads in 1913, an average of almost four carloads daily. Crop conditions were poor in that section last year, and less than the usual amount of stock was marketed, but this year the crops are fairly good, and the movement should at least be as large as Shippers are the more inclined to object vigorously to any re - duction in service at this time, for the reason that the service was reduced about a year ago. Previous to that time a special stock train left Grand Island daily about 1:30 in the afternoon, and pro - vided excellent service. This train was discontinued, and, as stated above, stock is now handled on the mixed train leaving Grand Island in the morning. It would appear, therefore, that the proposed arrangement for the handling of live stock between Grand Island and Hastings would be entirely inadequate, and that the present service is the least that applicant should expect to provide. The second objection is based on the disadvantage Grand Island jobbers would be put to in getting orders delivered promptly to cus - tomers in applicant's territory. The time of arrival at Grand Island of No. 1, the northbound passenger, it is proposed to change from 8:15 a. m. to 10:00 a. m. Jobbers contend that it would be im - possible to pack, bill and deliver shipments, the orders for which were received on this train, as the mixed train would be scheduled to leave at 3:45 in the afternoon, particularly if the present rule requiring all shipments to be delivered at the freight depot by 11:00 in the morning is continued in force. Representatives of the com - pany thought that the time of delivery might be changed to 2:00 in the afternoon. This suggestion was accepted as an improvement by the jobbers but they still contend that the proponed schedule would </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 seriously injure their business, which, in the territory affected, de - pends to a large extent on quick service. The discontinuance of one trip of the mixed train does not ma - terially affect the service this train is expected to provide, as the remaining trains are so timed as to furnish about the same service between Grand Island and Hastings. The moving forward, how - ever, of No. 2 from 9:45 p. m. to 7:00 p. m. destroys connections with two main line trains on the Union Pacific, and with the Central City branch line train from Lincoln. While the dropping of this train will not seriously impair the service, the Commission cannot see that any substantial saving is effected, for the reason that the mileage for the two trips is just 100 miles and the crew must, under the rules, be paid for that mileage whether it is run or not. The earlier departure of No. 2 provides a somewhat better local service to points as far east as Fairbury, and the later arrival of No. 1 in the morning furnishes patrons in the same territory with a more convenient service. The advantages of the proposed arrange - ment do not seem to offset the disadvantages, however, and the Commission is of the opinion that unless a more satisfactory schedule can be worked out, conditions should be left as they are. Less than a year ago the present schedule was established, after considerable controversy, and it does not appear wise to interfere with it at this For the reasons assigned the application will be denied.

            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 317 B25, 1914, consolidated the same with its exchange at Harvard. Harvard Telephone Company had 413 subscribers and the In Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company 254. The consolidated nge will have about 590 subscribers, there having been about ty duplicate telephones. The Lincoln Company has made application to the Commission for permission to establish a schedule of rates for the consolidated service, and proposes a schedule that is a combination of the rates of both companies. The rate now in effect on the Lincoln Com - pany's exchange for individual line, metallic business, is $36.00 per year, and the two-party, metallic business rate is $30.00 per year. These rates it is proposed to continue. The individual line, metallic residence rate of $24.00 per year and the two-party, metallic residence rate of $21.00 per year it is proposed to reduce to $18.00 and $15.00 per year respectively. T-he service within the city limits is to be entirely metallic, but the farm line service will be grounded, the rate to be the same as now prevails on the Harvard Company's exchange, viz.: $15.00 per year. The service given by the Harvard Company has been a combination of grounded and metallic, with no dis - tinction in the rates, which have been $18.00 per year for business and $12.00 per year for residence. In connection with its application the Liiftoln Company filed a petition signed by ninety-one of the business and residence sub - scribers of Harvard, who thus indicate their willingness to pay the rates proposed. Subsequent to the filing of this petition, however, another petition signed by eighty people was filed as a protest against any change in the rates. Seventeen of the signers on the second petition were also signers of the first, while fourteen of them are not patrons of either telephone company. A hearing on the applica - tion was held in the offices of the Commission on August 19, 1914, due notice of which was given to all parties concerned. It is of record that the patrons of the two companies desired the consolidation, and its early consummation was a prime consideration in the agreement to pay the rates proposed by the applicant. With two exceptions the rates proposed are standard for ex - changes of this size, and for that reason no exhaustive showing was made by applicant, nor has any thorough study of plant investment, operating expense and revenues been made by the Commission. The two exceptions are the rates of $36.00 and $30.00 for individual business and two-party business. The rates for these classes of service on exchanges of this size are usually $30.00 and $24.00 re - spectively. The service proposed, however, is more extensive than that usually given for the latter rates. Under the consolidation Bard subscribers will be given free connection with Saronville, d and Clay Center. Later if a lower rate is desired the service &gt;en the towns mentioned could be put upon a message basis he business rates reduofd. </seg>
            <seg id="p318">318 H. G. Wellensiek, on behalf of protestants, suggested at the hearing that a six-months' trial of the proposed rates be made, during which time applicant can complete its improvements and demonstrate by actual operation whether the revenue and expenses conform to the estimates submitted. This suggestion was accepted by the applicant, the understanding being that at the end of six months applicant submit a complete detailed statement covering the operation of the plant for that period. If, at that time, there is a demand for further investigation the matter can be gone into more EIn view of the fact that there will be a saving to the patrons of company of between $600.00 and $700.00 annually, by reason he elimination of duplicate telephones, and in view of the im - ed and extended service that will result from the consolidation, Commission is of the opinion that the agreement to give the pro - d rates a trial for six months should be approved, and an order be entered accordingly. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to charge and collect, from and after August 1, 1914, and until the further order of the Commission, the following schedule of rates for its Harvard exchange: Individual business, metallic $36.00 per year Two-party business, metallic .

What plan of rate making is for the best interests of the state as a whole? In this connection the Commission will consider (a) The advisability of promulgating a schedule of flat rate maximum and minimum distance tariffs. General Order No. 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p329">329 L(b) The advisability of promulgating a schedule of flat rate aximum distance tariffs.

The first hearing is set at the office of the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska, at 10 o'clock A. M. on Tuesday, the 24th day of March, 1908. At this hearing consideration will be given more particularly to the questions presented under sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (e) of ■Subsequent hearings will be held at the office of the Commission ncoln, or at such other places as the Commission may hereafter advisable. Any person or persons having specific complaints which may properly be considered under any of the above paragraphs, and desiring to be heard in regard thereto, are requested, in order to expedite the hearing, to file their complaint in writing in this office on or before the 17th day of March, A.

All persons interested in the subject matter will be given an opportunity to be heard. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. Dated at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 13th day of February, 1908. R Pursuant to said notice and thereafter, hearings were held h 24th and 25th, April 27th, May 19th and 20th, 1908. Said ngs were attended by representatives of all the railroads in the state, a large number of commercial clubs and individual shippers. IVt these hearings the Commission received and heard all evidence irguments that were offered pertaining to the matters announced ie circular. With but few exceptions the sentiment expressed unanimous that the promulgation of an inflexible distance would not prove beneficial to the best interests of the state, would work a hardship not only on the manufacturer and r but likewise on the consumer. S'hat portion of the circular relating to the rules and regulations b carriers, minimum weights and classification, has since been d separately and specific action taken by the Commission in ebruka Classification No. 1, issued October 31, 1911, effective </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 E Tiber 15, 1911, and supplements thereto. The preparation of classification took many months of careful investigation and rous hearings were held in order that the Commission might lly advised. ROn May 28, 1908, the Commission, pursuant to written requests, d the protests and arguments submitted by the representatives he employees' organizations of the various railroads against any her reduction in rates. !The Commission, upon consideration of the evidence and argu - ts submitted at the hearings, determined that it should, before hing any final conclusion as to a schedule of rates, submit a itive plan to the interested railroads and shippers for their oval or criticism, not only as to its reasonableness, but as to proper relation of classes and the proper gradation of the rates rding to distance. E Before the Commission could arrive at what it deemed a just reasonable schedule, it became necessary to devote the entire and energies of its rate and accounting experts to the prepara - of the state's evidence in the defense on their merits of the ss, two-cent fare and commodity rate laws, passed by the ature of 1907. Up to this time the litigation of said laws had ved legal issues other than the reasonableness of the rates them - i, and had occupied only the time of the State's attorneys. Eie successful outcome of the trial of the above cases is public dge, a source of gratification to the Commission and a justifi - of its course in suspending further action at that time in is rate investigation. ■4o further action was taken until July 6, 1909, upon which the Commission issued its General Order No. 19, which is here ,rth: BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION General Order No. 19 In the Matter of the Investigation of the Reason- feness of the Merchandise and Commodity riffs of Rates and Charges between Stations the State of Nebraska, on the Several Lines of Railroad. ORDER I The Commission, having had under investigation the reasonable - of the rates and charges between stations in Nebraska, and it aring to the Commission that the present rates and charges for transportation of freight under the classification now in effect een stations in this state are unreasonable and excessive, and it ler appearing that the schedule of rates hereto attached, marked tiibit A", and made a part hereof, is just and reasonable; It Is Therefore Ordered that the various railroads engaged in the transportation of freight between stations in this state be, and the same are hereby notified and required to appear at the office of the Nebraska State Railway Commission at Lincoln, Ne- </seg>

Further proceedings were deferred, pending the decision of the Federal Court in the Minnesota rate cases. Certain of their rate laws had been enjoined, and the validity of all were being contested. The progress of the litigation in that state and similar litigation in Missouri and other states were such as to induce the belief that a reduction of the class rates at that time in addition to the passenger and commodity rate reductions of 1907 in this state might result in an injunction from the Federal Court, enjoining not only any class rate reduction but also the 1907 rate laws, which were then in effect and were of more importance to the people of this state than any class rate schedule that could reasonably have been adopted. The report of the Master in the Minnesota cases, filed October 10th, 1910, and affirmed by the court, speaking through Judge Sanborn, April 8, 1911, are common knowledge. The resultant injunction of all Minne - sota rate reductions, the legal principles therein announced, and the methods used in arriving at their conclusions, not only afforded ample justification of the Commission's conservative course in proceeding with its investigation, but rendered useless further proceedings pend - ing a final determination of the cases in the Supreme Court of the United States. The Commission thereupon made a careful study of the record in the Minnesota cases, and contributed one-third of the brief of S89 pages filed by the Commissions of eight western states as imicui curia*, attacking the legal doctrines therein announced and </seg>
            <seg id="p335">335 arrived at their conclusions. That the arguments therein submitted by this Commission, contributed in no small degree to the final successful outcome of that litigation, has been freely admitted by Chairman Thome of Iowa, who was in charge of the Commission's brief, and others who have taken the time to study the briefs sub - mitted and the Supreme Court's opinion, reversing Judge Sanborn, which was rendered June 9, 1913.

            <seg id="p338">338 SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT beard all evidence and arguments offered by carriers, shippers and interested parties. Subsequent to the hearings in October, 1913, the Commission, influenced by arguments advanced at previous hearings and results of further investigation, modified the schedule proposed in original order No. 19, by increasing the percentage relationship of fourth class from 55 per cent to 60 per eent, and fifth class from 40 per cent to 50 per cent, and further changing the rate of progression by carrying the added one cent per cwt. every five miles to a distance of three hundred miles, thereafter one cent per cwt. every ten miles. This amended schedule known as Revised Order No. 19, was not placed in the hands of the carriers and interested shippers until a short time prior to the hearing of February 23d and 24th, 1914. Representatives of the carriers requested that the hearing be continued in order that they might have a reasonable opportunity to study the revised schedule and its effects. The request was granted, and evidence and arguments on both the original order and revised schedule were received and heard in the March and April hearings. We have gone somewhat into detail in the history of this in - vestigation, in order that those disposed to criticise the Commission for the seeming delay might know the reasons therefor, and to demonstrate that our sole purpose has been not only to secure a class rate schedule which, in our judgment, was fair and reasonable, but one which would become effective when promulgated. II. DISTANCE TARIFF E present Nebraska distance tariff, which the Commission ids to be unreasonably high, is a maximum scale.

The following is a comparison of the present Nebraska distance I with the Omaha terminal tariff by classes, based on the average for each class from five to two hundred miles on a ten-mile rate rogression, and a similar table based on similar averages from to five hundred miles on a ten and twenty-mile rate of pro- Vhe percentage shown is the average percentage that the terminal are of the distance tariff rates. 111 "Distance Tariff" class rate schedules should be made with I to the conditions and territory for which they are established. it explanation of how "Distance Tariff" freight schedules are y constructed may assist in making plain that portion of this that establishes the class rates which will govern the trans - ion charge for all freight moving under the Nebraska Class - on No. 1 and wholly within the state. Bhree elements are always used in the construction of " Distance " schedules: (1) Mileage rate of progression, or same rate zones. (2) Money rate of progression for the increased distance. (3) Percentage relationship of each class to the first class, or base rate. 1. (a) The mileage rate of progression carries in different "distance tariffs" and usually there is a difference in the mileage progression in the same tariffs, that is, the first one or two hundred miles may be divided in five mile rates of progression, then beyond two hundred miles the rate of progression may be stated for each ten or twenty miles. The idea being to so divide the distance for which the tariff is made up, so that the rates to two stations, say five miles apart, will be reasonably uniform and without sudden raises in the rates which would tend to give one of two neighboring towns the advantage over another in the transportation charge on any commodity or article of commerce.

            <seg id="p342">342 Kmile rates of progression uld be stated thus: then in that case the first class 1 to 100 miles 33 cents per cwt. 53 cents per cwt. 73 cents per cwt. 83 cents per cwt. 93 cents per cwt. 100 to 200 miles 200 to 300 miles 300 to 400 miles 400 to 600 miles From the above it will readily be seen that two towns located, say, one, one hundred miles from a wholesale or jobbing city, the other located one hundred and five miles from the same jobbing city, could not compete for business on a fair basis. The town located one hundred miles away would have a 20 cents per cwt. advantage on first class freight over the other in the transportation charge. The average distance between all stations in Nebraska is approx - imately seven miles. In the eastern or central portion of this state the average distance between stations is less than in the western part of the state. For this reason, the first two hundred miles of the "Distance Tariff" herein promulgated is stated in five-mile rates of progression and beyond two hundred miles in ten-mile rates of progression. 2. (a) The charge for the different distances for the first class freight is always used as the basis or skeleton on which the "Distance Tariff" schedule is constructed and the amount of the first class charge is always, or at least should be, based on the mileage rate of progression. Manifestly, the charge for 5 miles should not be the same as for 100 miles in a tariff constructed for the purpose of distributing merchandise, so that if it be determined by the rate - making body that 33 cents per 100 pounds of first class freight is a reasonable and just charge for a haul of 100 miles, the question of what the charge shall be for each 5 miles from one to 100 miles be - comes important. In all properly constructed "Distance Tariff" schedules there should be an initial charge for the service rendered by the carrier at the two terminals, i. e., points of origin and destination. This terminal charge should be arrived at without regard to how far the shipment is to be transported. This Commission's investigation of terminal costs has been most extensive, and will be spoken of again later on in this report. The question of what items of cost of performing the service should be included in the terminal charge and what items should be considered in the haulage costs, is a much debated question, and is at the present time being carefully and extensively investigated by state and federal commissions. After the two terminal costs have been determined, the amount of the charge which shall be added to the terminal charge as a haulage cost becomes important and should be made with regard to the conditions under which the transporta - tion must be conducted. A haulage charge should be greater in a II1U UIIlulIlUUD vci 1 1 1« vi y vUm** IU • •*' IJVU"IIlvU ilVdlllUUa CUU Illi jr » </seg>
            <seg id="p343">343 ■p distance tariff herein adopted these questions have been care - considered by the Commission. I (a) This question will be more fully explained in other por - of this opinion. In formulating a correctly constructed distance this question is very important, and possibly the hardest of a t and scientific solution. The relationship of the less than ,d and carload traffic is so close, being frequently carried under ame class in the "Classification", that the question becomes complex. The Commission in its investigation has considered many distance scales. For the purpose of comparison and reference, we submit in addition to the tentative scale already given as General Order No. 19, the so-called Prouty Iowa-Nebraska scale, the Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska distance schedule, a composite of the so - called Nebraska terminal or jobbing tariffs, and the distance schedule </seg>

            <seg id="p354">354 Ee mileage rate of progression shown on the preceding tabula - not the same as used in the construction of the published but is here graduated on a 10- and 20-mile scale for the sake According to the monthly station reports on file with the Com - mission there were, January 1, 1914, 723 agency stations and 345 non-agency stations. Of the former there were 13 so-called jobbing stations, to-wit: Omaha, South Omaha, Lincoln, Beatrice, Fremont, Grand Island, Hastings, Norfolk, Fairbury, Columbus, Nebraska City, St. Paul and Plattsmouth, to and from which so-called terminal ratea lower than the distance schedule are in effect, and producing an equalixed condition in certain classes that will be considered separately hereafter. The composite schedule above set forth is a composite of the terminal rates in effect to and from the said jobbing stations. The Minnesota and Iowa schedules are those promulgated by the Commissions of those states, and the Prouty or I. C. C. schedule is one established by the Interstate Commerce Commission in a decision rendered by Commissioner Prouty in the case of Iowa State Board of Railroad Commissioners v. Arizona Eastern Railroad Company et al. (28 I. C. C. 193 and 563), which in - volved the reasonableness of the class rates from interior Iowa points to Nebraska and other western stations. In preparing its tentative scale set forth in Original Order No. 19, the Commission followed very closely the Minnesota scale and method. That schedule is such that each rate for each class, for any distance, bears such an exact relation to each other rate, that given a single rate for any class for a stated distance, any other rate can be ascertained by mathematical calculation and without reference to the schedule itself. The Minnesota schedule starts with a base rate of 12 cents per cwt. for a five-mile haul of first-class merchandise, and for each additional five miles, .98 of a cent per cwt. is added up to 200 miles. After a distance of 200 miles is reached .98 of a cent per cwt. is added for every ten miles up to 400 miles, and thereafter .98 of a cent per cwt. for every twenty miles. The schedule in Original Order No. 19 started with the same base rate of 12 cents per cwt. first class for a five-mile haul and under, and increased 1 cent per cwt. for every five miles or fraction thereof up to 200 miles. From that distance 1 cent per cwt. for every ten miles up to 300 miles, and thereafter 1 cent per cwt. for every twenty miles. The rates in both schedules for the other classes bear a fixed percentage relation of the corresponding rates for the first class and such percentages are here set forth below, together with the corresponding percentages in the other schedules shown on the next preceding tabulation and also what is known as Revised Order No. 19, and the schedule established by the State Commission of Washington in 1912. </seg>

            <seg id="p356">356 In the course of its investigations, the Commission for the pur - pose of laying a proper foundation for its conclusions, and to deter - mine the character and volume of the traffic involved, the effect of any proposed reduction in the carriers' intrastate earnings, etc., had caused the carriers to file for each station in this state a monthly station report, commencing July 1, 1907. As an illustration of the nature of the information obtained from said reports the following summary of all station reports filed by all the railroads for the fiscal year 1912 is given. Annual Summary All Roads Year Ending June 30, 1912 FREIGHT FORWARDED State Interstate NOTE — This report does not include company material. The Commission further, for the purpose of securing data cover - ing the direct operating costs in handling the various classes of traffic, made the following investigation covering the operation of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway in this state: (a) Train sheets covering movement of all trains operated in Nebraska for the fiscal year of 1909 were examined and compiled, separate tabulations of the through and local freight and passenger trains being made; (b) the time lost by local trains in meeting through freight and passenger trains and in doing construction work, and the amount of overtime consumed by local freight train crews, was ascertained; (c) the number of revenue ton miles of intrastate carload business Number cars of Wheat 12,044 19,765 Number cars of Corn 15,991 28,598 Number care of other Grain and Grain Products 8,064 16,217 Number cars of Live Stock 72,288 49,023 All other car loads forwarded 70,639 58,837 Weight in pounds all L.

            <seg id="p357">357 determined; (d) the freight conductors' wheel reports of all trains operated in the state, in whole or in part, covering a period of four months, were tabulated and subdivided as to local and through trains, and the number of gross and lading ton miles, handled by the two classes ascertained; (e) the number of tons of coal consumed by each engine in freight and passenger train service operated on train divisions, in whole or in part, in Nebraska, covering a period of two months, was tabulated and separated as between passenger and freight and through and local trains; (f) the corresponding tabulation for the same period was made on train and enginemen's cost; (g) a complete record of non-revenue lading ton miles (company material i handled in whole or in part within Nebraska, for the entire fiscal year of 1909, was tabulated and separated as between through and local trains. The data so obtained, together with reports filed with the rail - road company, as required by the Commission, furnished a reason - ably accurate foundation for the determination of the direct operating costs of both passenger and freight traffic, subdivided as between state and interstate, through and local. The tabulations above referred to, the methods of their application, and the determinations made therefrom, were introduced in evidence in the federal court in the cases involving the validity of 1907 rate laws, and are a part of the record in this investigation. Similar cost data and determination were not made on the other lines of railroad, for the reason that the Rock Island case in the federal court appears to have been selected as a test case in deter - mining the validity of the 1907 rate laws, and the Commission itself from its investigation considered that the cost data so obtained was a reasonably fair average as between the stronger and the weaker roads. In addition thereto the Commission has made a complete abstract of every waybill covering the movement of intrastate traffic on certain Nebraska roads for a period of four months on the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, and Union Pacific Railroad Company lines and for a period of two months on the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company's line within this state. This portion of the in - vestigation involved the handling of approximately a million and a half of state and interstate waybills, the transcribing of the intra - state shipments onto permanent records filling 62 volumes of 20,000 pages and containing approximately 700,000 entries. A sample page of the record is here given. </seg>

            <seg id="p360">360 So far as we are advised no such searching or far-reaching investigation of this character has ever been attempted by any rate - making body. That the months used were a fair average for the entire year and that the compilation was accurate is demonstrated by the fact that the waybill charges for the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company's L. C. L. shipments for the four months period above mentioned, multiplied by three, came within $10,000 of E'ng the amount as reported by that road for the entire year's ska intrastate business, L. C. L., aggregating a total of $1,187, - , as reported by the company. Erhe amount of labor involved in the analysis of such a compila - can hardly be appreciated by one not engaged in the same or ir work.

            <seg id="p367">367 13 those not acquainted with the difficulty of preparing a :e tariff schedule, providing a proper mileage progression in ind a proper relationship of classes, the foregoing may appear ess labor, a refinement of investigation and a waste of the 's money. One instance alone will suffice to answer such a tion. Khe Interstate Commerce Commission in the decision prepared ommissioner Prouty, in the case of Iowa State Board of oad Commissioners v. Arizona Eastern Railroad Company et al., supra, promulgated a mileage schedule of rates, which is heretofore set forth and referred to as the "Prouty scale" covering the movement of traffic under class rates from interior Iowa towns to Nebraska and other western points. This Commission was not a party to, nor did it participate in the hearings resulting in the "Prouty scale". The application of the long and short haul clause to said scale placed the towns in Nebraska, particularly Omaha, Lincoln and Fremont, at a decided disadvantage in Nebraska terri - tory with the intermediate Iowa jobbing towns, Sioux City and Council Bluffs. This Commission was not, at that time, prepared to promulgate its schedule and, in the hope that the Prouty scale, with which the Iowa Commission was dissatisfied in certain particulars, might be revised, and the date of its taking effect postponed, held a conference with Mr. Prouty at Washington, at which were present the chairman of the Iowa Commission and the traffic managers of the commercial clubs of Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Omaha, Lincoln, and Grand Island. Among other matters considered was the rela - tionship, or percentage, of the fourth-class rates to the first-and fifth - class rates. Under the "Prouty scale" fourth class is 50 per cent and fifth class is 40 per cent of first class. The "Prouty scale" is the composite result of an exhaustive comparison of class rate tariffs promulgated by state commissions and others voluntarily issued by carriers. When it was made clear to Mr. Prouty that the bulk of the jobbing traffic in this territory moved inbound fifth-class carload, and outbound fourth class, less carload, and that this Commission's analysis of the traffic movement of intrastate shipments within this state showed that only .57 of 1 per cent of the carload traffic moved fourth-class carload, he frankly admitted his fourth-class relationship was too low. f'or reasons unnecessary to discuss, nothing was accomplished uring a revision of the "Prouty scale", but, through the courtesy ? Interstate Commerce Commission, and acquiesced in by the Commission, which we gratefully acknowledge, the effective of the "Prouty scale" was postponed from April 1, 1914, to 1, 1914. The Commission has carefully considered all the evidence and arguments submitted by the carriers. Much of it was similar in character and based on theories or formulae submitted by the </seg>
            <seg id="p368">368 r disproved by the Supreme Court of the United States. Upon con - sideration of all the evidence and arguments presented, and the' results of its own investigations, the Commission finds that the existing Nebraska distance and terminal or jobbing class rates, are unreasonably high, unjust and discriminatory, and that the scale of rates herein set forth under the heading "Adopted No. 19", are just and reasonable for the movement of traffic under class rates between stations on the several lines of railroad in this state, with certain exceptions hereinafter specifically set forth. A comparison of the adopted scale with the tentative scale as promulgated in General Order No. 19, will disclose the following changes; 1. The base rate of 12 cents, first class, five miles, has been increased to 14 cents. This base rate is made up largely of terminal costs and the evidence submitted by the carriers and the result of the Commission's own investagation of the actual operating cost in the Lincoln terminal, together with other studies, convinced it that a 12 cent base was too low, at least in this state. 2. The percentage relationship of fourth, fifth, A and E classes have been changed as follows: Fourth from 55 to 60 per cent Fifth from 40 to 45 per cent A from 45 to 50 per cent E from 20 to 17 per cent 3. The progression of the first-class rate of 2 cents per cwt., applied to each additional ten miles of haul, up to a distance of 200 miles and, thereafter, applied to every additional twenty miles of haul in the original order, is applied under the final scale to every ten miles up to a distance of 400 miles, and, thereafter, to every twenty miles. The Commission's analysis of the traffic as disclosed by its way - bill compilation, in addition to the evidence submitted, further con - vinced it that the percentages adopted in its final schedule and that the rate of progression should be modified as above set forth. For the purpose of comparison we herewith submit a com - parative statement showing the money rate of progression adopted in the establishment of the tariffs' shown below for the first-class or base rate.

An examina - of the foregoing statement shows that the present Nebraska nee tariff is fearfully and wonderfully made. C. C. Wright, al solicitor for the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., speaking in behalf of tads, said: "I have said we are willing an adjustment should be made of these things. It is true the relation of one class to another is not right. It is not right, and it is time it be adjusted, but it is our idea that it should be equalized rather than reduced." The changes noted above in the adopted No. 19 schedule effect an increase in the rates over the original tentative schedule as a whole. Competitive conditions are such in this state that a different scale of class rates on different lines is hardly practical, inasmuch as competitive conditions arising from the paralleling and intersecting of the various lines of railroad would determine the rate, and while a lower schedule than the one adopted might be justified on the more prosperous roads, it would indirectly work a hardship on the weaker roads, the results of which would ultimately affect the shipper and the traveling public on the weaker lines in the shape of a more limited service and inadequate and poor facilities. The Commission has carefully considered the "Prouty scale" and has in its deliberations and conclusions accorded it all the weight and influence to which it is entitled. It is a matter of regret to us that there should be such a variance between the two schedules. The issues involved in that case, however, differ greatly from the matter under our consideration. In that case the question before the Interstate Commerce Commission was just and reasonable rates, which would permit of manufacturers located at interior Iowa points placing their products in Nebraska, Kansas, and territory beyond, on an equal transportation basis with the large manufacturing and distributing centers on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and the result was evidently determined, or at least influenced, largely by existing tariffs and rates, such as rates between the Mississippi and Missouri river points on the one hand and Colorado common points on the other.

            <seg id="p371">371 classes, is a composite of rates and schedules of the carriers them - selves between points in Minnesota and Iowa, and between points in Missouri and Iowa. Considering the issues involved, and the evidence introduced in this case, it is in all probability as just a solution of the problem presented as could have been reached. The main issue before this Commission, however, is widely different. It involves a reasonable schedule of class rates for mil stations in Nebraska. Rates obtaining in other states, or between outside points and Nebraska points, while they have been given consideration have not exercised a controlling influence, either in the initiating of the proceeding or in the determination of the result. Again, the investigation of this Commission has been admittedly far more searching and exhaustive in its details, more comprehensive in its nature, and we are confident that had the data in the possession of this Commission been before the Interstate Commerce Commission in that case it would have reached different conclusions, at least in some important particulars. Ill EQUALIZATION IJne of the most important questions involved in this investiga - was whether or not the Commission should establish an inflexible nee tariff such as obtains in Iowa, a dual distance tariff such as ns in Minnesota, and suggested in original Order No. 19, pro - g a lower fixed percentage differential as between jobbing and obbing points, or retain in some form at least the equalized rate situation that now obtains in this state as between the ;nized jobbing or terminal stations. ■In order that the equalized rate situation existing in this state be understood, we submit herewith the following explanation, lay properly be divided into the following subdivisions: 1. Short line distance equalization between railroads. 2. Lincoln-Fremont arbitrary differential over Missouri river jobbing points. 3. Beatrice arbitrary differential on certain classes over Missouri river jobbing points. 4. Grand Island-Hastings equalized adjustment as between the two cities. 5. Grand Island-Hastings equalized adjustment on fourth-class shipments. 6. Norfolk adjustment on first four classes. 7. Jobbing rates out of St. Paul-Columbus-Fairbury. 1. (a) Short line distances are equalized at most of the com - petitive points in the State of Nebraska, as between the jobbing cities of Omaha, Nebraska City, Lincoln, and Fremont. To illustrate this point, the short line distance between Omaha and Lincoln is 66 miles. The first-class jobbing rate is 30 cents p*r cwt. The </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 distance via the Union Pacific, Omaha to Lincoln, is 83 miles. The first-class jobbing rate is 30 cents per cwt. Eta) The present method of establishing the jobbing class out of Lincoln and Fremont is, generally speaking, as follows: cities pay the following differentials over Omaha on all traffic ating beyond the Missouri river taking class rates. Classes 1 2 3 4 5ABCDE Differential in cents per cwt. 5 544333333 Ehe distance tariff rate is used for a distance of 40 to 50 miles, it is graded into the Omaha rate less the above differentials, arbitrary rate adjustment as to Lincoln and Fremont was shed, approximately as it is today, in 1888. ■I. (a) The rates from Beatrice on certain classes, and to cer - territory on the C, B. &amp; Q. R. R., are found in like manner, it that its inbound differential over Omaha is as follows: 12345ABCDE Differential in cents per cwt. 12 12 88666665 4. (a) The first five classes are equalized as between the jobbing cities of Hastings and Grand Island on the C, B. &amp; Q. R. R. and stations west, in the following manner: The rates from Grand Island and Hastings at points approximately 50 miles west and beyond Grand Island on the Billings line, and approximately 50 miles west and beyond Hastings on the Denver and Cheyenne lines, are the same at each station on the first five classes. This arrange - ment allows the two cities on the same rate basis. The inbound rates to both cities, in almost every instance, are the same. 5. (a) The fourth-class rate from Hastings and Grand Island to any points west of those two stations is found in the following manner: Find what the fourth-class rate is to a given point from Omaha. Deduct from this amount the fifth-class rate from Omaha to Grand Island and Hastings, which at the present time is 26 cents per cwt. To illustrate, the present fourth-class rate from Omaha to Alliance is 65 cents per cwt. Deduct the fifth-class rate of 26 cents Omaha to Grand Island, and we have the fourth-class rate of 3! cents, Hastings and Grand Island to Alliance, which is the rate in effect at present from the two cities. This same equalized fifth in and fourth out rate adjustment applies on the Union Pacific rail road west of Grand Island. No attempt is made at equalizing any of the other classes except the fourth class. 6. (a) The rates out of Norfolk on the first four classes are established on approximately the same scale as used to establish the jobbing rates out of Omaha. No attempt is made at equalizing as between the different classes. </seg>
            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 373 I (a) Rates have been established out of St. Paul and Colum - n the first four classes which are, as a general proposition, made le same relative scale as used for finding the jobbing rates out naha. These rates, however, apply only to a limited territory. Fairbury rates, except as to nearby stations, are the same as ates from Beatrice. No attempt is made to equalize this city regard to the in rates. In order that some idea may be had of how the terminal or jobbing intrastate class rates from Missouri river cities located in Nebraska compare with the class rates from interstate jobbing points which have been established and maintained by the carriers for many years, we have prepared a statement of terminal class rates from St. Joseph and Kansas City to Nebraska stations. The rates shown below are average figures derived by finding all the rates from points above mentioned to Nebraska stations for the distances shown in the statement. </seg>

            <seg id="p376">376 The above tabulation clearly shows that the rates voluntarily established by the carriers from St. Joseph and Kansas City to Nebraska stations are considerably lower for the same distance than the rates now in effect from Missouri river cities located in Nebraska, which rates the Commission finds to be unreasonably high. IlS previously stated, the sentiment expressed in the early hear - was almost unanimous against the establishment of a rigid ice tariff. As the hearings proceeded this sentiment became mous, and in their objections to such policy witnesses bordered e vehement. We herewith quote certain portions of the record it regard: Mr. Burgess of Beatrice testified: "A distance tariff similar to that of Iowa, I would regard as absolutely disastrous to the business and com mercial interests of Nebraska, and I believe it would be very njurious and unfair to the railroads. I believe a distance tariff would tend to retard the building up of the state.' Konorable A. E. Cady, a jobber, speaking for Grand Island ercial Club and for himself, testified: t"I think I might summarize the thing by saying that the distance tariff of Iowa were placed in force in Ne - raska it would place us at a very serious disadvantage. ' ' Mr. W. H. Young, manager Traffic Bureau, and representing the Fremont and Kearney jobbing interests, when asked as to the position of Kearney with reference to a rigid distance tariff or an equalized basis, testified: "The same as all other jobbing communities within the state, that a rigid distance tariff would be harmful and destroy communities practically that have grown up under the system that has been in force for a great many years." Mr. Conners, secretary Grand Island Commercial Club, testified: "A rigid distance tariff would have a tendency to tear down the business and that they (jobbers) would have to split up their business and scatter their houses over the territory and some would withdraw from the territory entirely." Again, in response to the question: "Is it your opinion that the effect of these rates (Re - vised Order No. 19), if they were adopted without any equalizing provision, would stifle competition by reason of the fact that it would drive the Grand Island jobbers out of business?" The witness answers: We Dracticallv know it would </seg>
            <seg id="p377">377 Walter S. Whitten, secretary Lincoln Commercial Club, testified "I want to reiterate the position of Lincoln as made at the October hearing, that we are unalterably opposed to the establishment of a rigid distance tariff for rates in Nebraska for the reason that it would immediately deprive Lincoln o: a very large part of its territory, and on the other hand would give it, which it does not desire, an increased ad - vantage in what is known as the South Platte territory." And further: "I think the Commission has before it sufficient data to substantiate the fact that it would be disastrous, almost reaching absolute destruction, to Lincoln jobbing interests and those of other jobbers of the state, if a rigid distance tariff was applied." Mr. E. J. McVann, representing the Omaha Commercial Club, testified: "There was a general meeting held some days ago by the Omaha shippers, by whom I am employed, and it was the unanimous sentiment of the meeting, expressed by resolu - tion duly passed and recorded, that I be instructed to say to the Commission generally on behalf of the Omaha shippers this: That there is no objection on their part to any reduc - tion in the rates now existing in Nebraska which this Com - mission may find to be reasonable and proper after due consideration of the subject, but they were just as unani - mously opposed to a reduction which should take the form of the tariff prescribed." K.t. J. C. Stubbs, at that time traffic director for the Harriman and one of the most eminent of rate authorities in railroad , testified as follows: "Now, you fix the distance tariff and of course you wipe out these jobbing centers, and you take from the consumer the very people that it is proposed you desire to serve — a these commercial advantages. I can not see that goo reason in the interest of the state in its growth, in it development, in any particular, will be served by thi proposed change. I think it would be manifestly a ste backwards. It suppresses competition, it certainly imposes additional burden on the small dealer, and naturally i reaches the consumer. Now, I do not think it would requir a very great inquiry on the part of the Commission t prove what I have said to be true as to the origin of these jobbing rates and as to the effect of their annulment, nor d I think there will be very much difficulty on the part o the Commission in abandoning the feature of a hard and fast tariff rate. </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 Ilhe Iowa Commission itself has spoken with reference to their rigid distance tariff. In an opinion rendered by that Commission case involving the rates on soft coal, which is found in the al report of that Commission for the year 1911, the following ■age is used with reference to the distance tariff in effect in that "Our law bases all freight rates on distance alone. It i inelastic and inflexible. It throttles competition. The fac that the territory in controversy is traversed by the Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad, the Chicago, Rock Island &lt; Pacific Railway, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway the Iowa Central Railway, is no benefit to this district s far as competition is concerned. It is quite likely that i the fetters were taken from competition that the roads abov mentioned would fully take care of this territory. If thi Commission had the power to group the mines, as is genera in the state of Illinois, in the first district by rate adjust ment, it would be of very great benefit to the territory. "By this method the territory of the Centerville mines could be very greatly increased without injury to any othe nterest. The inflexible rule of distance forbids this Com mission from considering any question except that of a reasonable rate to be applied to every mile of railroad in owa, regardless of conditions. No other state with whicl owa has traffic arrangements is so fettered. If the same atitude was permitted in Iowa that is in Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, manufacturing could be greatly stimulatec within this state, and undeveloped coal fields within its &gt;orders could furnish cheap fuel which is the manufacturer's necessity." I 'his Commission is unanimous in its opinion that to establish d maximum and minimum distance tariff would be disastrous e jobbing and manufacturing interests of the state, in which ns of dollars have been invested, and years of labor consumed velopment. It would tend to circumscribe and restrict the tion of most, if not all, the jobbing centers to a limited terri- To the extent that such restriction was affected, to such an t would competition be reduced without any resulting benefit ? ultimate consumer. There may be a difference in rates according to distance which is discriminatory without being unjust or unreasonable. It is only when the differences are so great as to be unjustly discriminatory that they are unlawful. The spread between the existing distance schedule and the terminal schedules in some instances is excessive and unduly discriminatory. The carriers urged that the Commission establish a distance tariff and permit them to formulate the jobbing tariffs with the distance tariff as a maximum. Upon consideration thereof, it devel- </seg>
            <seg id="p379">379 Kthat the same objections obtaining under existing tariffs would xist, and that it was necessary for the Commission to prescribe ites and schedules necessary to maintain a fair equalization. In so doing we have pursued, generally speaking, the following I^irst. The rates prescribed in the distance tariff herein adopted he rates established to and from Omaha, except in a few in - es where short line distance controls, and except further in cer - instances where the application of the federal long and short clause applied to the Prouty schedule establishes lower rates upper Missouri river crossings in which said rates are used as a ■num. |&gt;cond. The schedules from Lincoln and Fremont for all classes Class E, in certain instances, are obtained in the same manner present by deducting the inbound differentials from the Omaha after a distance of approximately fifty miles is reached. In g into the Omaha rates less the differential, the rates prescribed some instances higher and in others lower than the distance Krhird. The schedules from Beatrice, to stations south and west le Burlington and Rock Island lines have been established in manner. In the balance of the territory the distance tariff B'ourth. In determining the schedules from Grand Island and ngs, two equalizing methods have been adopted: I (a) Equalization between the two cities is obtained by applying distance tariff schedule, except as to fourth class, from the more nt city to a point approximately sixty miles beyond the nearer and grading the rates from the nearer city into the rates at sixty-mile point. Beyond that point the rates are the same both cities in all classes. (b) The rates from both cities are equalized with Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont, and Beatrice on fourth class shipments, to stations north, west, and south, by ascertaining the Omaha fourth-class rates to such stations, and deducting therefrom the fifth-class rate, Oman to Grand Island and Hastings. This method is identical with th existing method, save and except wherever the above method woulc determine a fourth-class rate from Hastings or Grand Island lowe than the fifth-class rates under the distance schedule from the sam cities, the said fifth-class distance rates have been applied as a minimum. To all other territory the distance tariff is applied. I Fifth. The rates from Norfolk to points west and north have equalised with Omaha, Lincoln and Fremont on fourth-class in same manner as Hastings and Grand Island. Distance tariff ies to all other territory.

Phe application of the distance tariff schedule from Omaha lined a like application of that schedule from Columbus, ska City, Fairbury, and St. Paul, save and except in certain ces where short line distances become a maximum via the long ■\n examination of the tariffs and schedules will demonstrate these cities can reach a wider territory and on a more equitable , from a rate standpoint than is in effect at the present time. The specific tariffs determined by the above methods are hereto attached, marked Exhibit "B", made a part of the order, and are found to be just and reasonable. I They preserve the equalized situation in this state, enlarging the tory of smaller jobbing centers and at the same time minimize spread between jobbing and non-jobbing stations now so ag- ft is possible that we have failed to include some towns or cities id to specific consideration, or that we have erred in some ulars in the rates determined for the towns included. Any omissions or errors, properly submitted upon complaint or &gt;n to the Commission, will receive prompt consideration and actions as the facts and conditions may justify. I We do not maintain that the distance schedule adopted is the word, or summum bonum, of distance schedules. Experience undoubtedly disclose wherein we have failed to reach that much e desired result. It is to be hoped, however, that the carriers exercise the same spirit of fairness which has characterized the mission throughout the course of this investigation, and accept schedules herein established without delay. In the course of this investigation it developed that the table of distances published by certain of the carriers were inaccurate. More - over, their tables did not publish the distances between all stations on their lines within the state, but only published the distances between certain jobbing points and all stations and the distances from all stations to a limited and varying number of junction points, depending upon the location of the particular station. As a result the obtaining or quoting of a correct rate between points, neither one of which was a jobbing point, depended entirely upon the accuracy of agent or rate clerk. In order to facilitate and avoid any possible excuse for the quoting of an incorrect rate, the Commission has prepared a true and correct table of the short line distances obtaining on each line of railroad within this state. </seg>

BEAR Sir: I am directed by the Commission to request of you nion in writing on the following question: I toes this Commission have authority to compel a mutual tele - : company, as distinguished from a common carrier, to extend »es within the limits of the territory which it presumably oc - i to the exclusion of other companies, upon demand of pro - ve patrons who are willing to comply with the governing rules d mutual company? This question is based upon the issue involved in a formal com - plaint now pending before the Commission, docketed as No. 196, Percy Gardner vs. Archer Telephone Company. Complainant prays for an order requiring defendant company to furnish telephone service to certain prospective patrons who are presumably within the limits of the territory occupied by defendant. The Commission has held a hearing upon the case, and the transcript of testimony taken is now in your hands. Your early compliance with this request will be appreciated Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, December 20, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. ■Gentlemen: Your communication of September 5th has hereto - been answered by me orally, but a further request is made by you the same be answered in writing. Your question is as follows: " Does this Commission have authority to compel a mutual telephone company, as distinguished from a common carrier, to extend its lines within the limits of the territory which it pre - sumably occupies to the exclusion of other companies, upon demand of prospective patrons who are willing to comply with the governing rules of said mutual company?" I The record of the evidence, which you have furnished me, shows this company does not purpose doing a business generally, but nits its business to its own members and does not undertake to ; the public generally for hire. On November 18, 1910, I advised your department that a tele- </seg>
            <seg id="p396">396 pose of accommodating its own members, and which is prohibited by its articles of incorporation from renting telephones to the public or in any manner serving the public, does not come under the provisions of law which require the State Railway Commission to authorize it to issue stock, bonds, and other forms of indebtedness. En April 11, 1911, I further advised your department that e telephone lines, constructed for the convenience of the owners ot for hire to the public, do not come within the requirements physical valuation act. I the company referred to by you was undertaking to serve the for hire, it would be amenable to both of the provisions re - to in these two former communications. But, as I understand :ord, it does not undertake to serve the public, and, hence, is public carrier or a public service corporation in the sense in these terms are used in the statutes. I he record shows that for this company to do what is required would entail an expenditure of several hundred dollars, and I of no way by which this money could be raised except by lling each member of this association of private lines to sub - ) an assessment for that purpose. I have looked among the ■ities for a case similar to this, and have been unable to find iknow it is argued that because some of the lines of this aaao - n occupy the public highways, this company ought to be com - 1 to put in lines, connect up, and furnish service to any person ;d near by and wishing the same. But, on the other hand, this any has refused to offer its lines to the public for compensa- Having refused to do this, I know of no rule .or authority by l I could advise that your Commission order this company to d its lines upon the demands of prospective patrons. Should make such an order, I know of no adjudication which might in it or methods by which it might be enforced. Yours very truly, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. No. 62 Lincoln, January 12, 1914.

Dear Sir: Calling your attention to paragraph (cj of Section 15 of the Commission Act, which reads as follows: "It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any Railway Company or Common Carrier to change any rate, schedule or classification until application has been made to the Railway Commission and permission had for that purpose. Any Railway </seg>
            <seg id="p397">397 Company or Common Carrier violating this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars." I am directed by the Commission to ask your opinion in writing as to whether or not the word "schedule" in said paragraph can properly be construed and maintained to mean train schedules, or time tables, of carriers operating trains between stations in thU state, or whether it refers only to rate schedules. Yours truly, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, January 17, 1914. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Yours of the 12th instant is as follows: "Calling your attention to paragraph c, of section 15, of the Commission Act, which reads as follows: " 'It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any railwa; company or common carrier to change any rate, schedule, o classification until application has been made to the railway commission and permission had for that purpose. Any railwa; company or common carrier violating this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereo shall be fined in any sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars "I am directed by the commission to ask your opinion in writing as to whether or not the word 'schedule' in said para - graph can properly be construed and maintained to mean train schedules, or time tables, of carriers operating trains between stations in this state, or whether it refers only to rate sched - ules." Irhe section referred to is the last section of the Railway Com- Dn Act, and by its terms when a railroad company undertakes ange any rate, schedule, or classification, before proper applica - has been made to your body for permission so to do, said rail - company subjects itself to a fine not exceeding $1,000. I It is an elementary proposition of law that in prosecutions the e denounced must come within the plain provisions of the statute, ive examined the entire Railway Commission Act and observe the word "schedule" is used with reference to rates and charges h are fixed by the companies themselves, or, upon proper hear - are fixed by the Railway Commission. I Section 6125, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, requires ommon carriers to file with the Commission, on or before a cer - date, their freight and passenger schedules, classification, rates, 'a, and charges. Reference is also made in section 6126 to iule of rates to be fixed by the Commission, and section 6128 •tins to the decision of the Commission after a hearing on a schedule of rates, etc. Section 6132 deals with emergency rates, tariffs schedules orders circulars etc. Section 6135 relates to the </seg>
            <seg id="p398">398 publication of rates, fares and charges, and provides remedies in case of failure to publish the same. Eo, from all these provisions, it is quite plain that when the "schedule" is used it is in connection with the subject of the nt to be paid for the transportation of freight or passengers, lere do I find any provision in the act which refers to train ules or time tables. ! Therefore, I hold that a prosecution could not be successfully itained against a company which failed to submit the subject s train schedules or time tables to your body for orders thereon, question as to when trains should be run might arise indirectly n the Commission is dealing with the withdrawing of certain 1 service, but I do not think that, under the provisions of the way Commission Act, a common carrier could be prosecuted for re to make application to the Commission for the privilege of iging its train schedules or time tables.

Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to request of you an opinion in writing upon the question as to whether or not the South Omaha Live Stock Exchange can legally impose an insurance charge of ten cents per carload, to be paid by the shipper, covering live stock entering the South Omaha Stock Yards, said insurance being presumably for the protection of the shipper during the time that the stock is in the receiving pen, subject to the orders of the consignor or consignee. Also, does this Commission have jurisdic - tion over such a charge, or any other charge made by the members of the South Omaha Live Stock Exchange, in connection with the sale of stock consigned to them. As explanatory of the situation, I enclose to you herewith certain papers applicable to the case in point. An early reply to this communication will be appreciated. Very truly yours, A. B.

In any event I do no see that this charge is a matter over which your body has any juris diction whatever. It occurs to me that charges made by the Sout Omaha Live Stock Exchange are matters not within the purview o the Commission. The stock yards companies are declared by law t be common carriers, hence the South Omaha Stock Yards are com mon carriers and the freight and carrying charges of such companies are matters over which the Railway Commission has jurisdiction, but I do not understand that your body would have any control whatever over charges made for caring for stock or protecting the owners by insurance after the Stock Yard Company had completed the delivery of the same by having it placed in pens subject to the orders of the consignor or consignees. Yours respectfully, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. No. 65 Lincoln, June 10, 1914. Honorable Grant G. Martin Attorney General, Lincoln, Nebraska. (Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to ask of you an ion in writing as to whether or not a telephone company which i to its farm line subscribers added service on an additional flat basis, denying said service on added flat rate basis to its city cribers, is guilty of discrimination under the provisions of Sec - 14 of the Railway Commission Act. The circumstances leading to this inquiry are as follows: The Benedict exchange of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and the Stromsburg exchange of the Polk County Telephone Com - pany are at the present time giving reciprocal service between the two exchanges to their farm line subscribers only, at a rate of fifty cents per month, in addition to their regular farm line rate. That is, farm line subscribers are given the service of the two exchanges at an added rate of fifty cents per month. City subscribers of the two exchanges are not accorded this service and rate but are required to pay the regular toll rate for service between the two exchanges. It has been the policy of this Commission to recognize such rate adjustments as are above set forth for the primary reason that farm lines on the various exchanges frequently overlap and unless pro - vision was made of the character indicated many farmers would be substantially denied the privilege of communicating with their neighbors, the very people with whom they have most business and </seg>
            <seg id="p401">401 Sis no discrimination in such an arrangement, for the reason the service and rate apply to all patrons of the particular class •vice affected who may desire the service. !t is manifest that the rates for all classes of service cannot r be the same, because some classes of service are much more isive than others and the phones of some classes are used much than are the phones of others. For example, there is almost rsally a difference in the rental rates of business, residence and line phones of all exchanges. If there is any further informa - that we can give you in relation to this subject, please com- Awaiting your prompt reply, I am Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, June 17, 1914. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: You have asked for an opinion from this office on the following question: "If a telephone company gives to its farm line subscribers added service on an additional flat rate basis, denying said service on such added flat rate basis to the city subscribers, is it guilty of discrimination under the provisions of the Railway Commission Act. "The circumstances leading to this inquiry are as follows: The Benedict exchange of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and the Stromsburg exchange of the Polk County Telephone Company are at the present time giving reciprocal service between the two exchanges to their farm line subscribers only, at a rate of fifty cents per month in addition to their regular farm line rate. That is, farm line subscribers are given the service of the two exchanges at an added rate of fifty cents per month. City subscribers of the two exchanges are not ac - corded this service and rate but are required to pay the regular toll rate for service between the two exchanges." Unjust discrimination is defined in the Railway Commission Act as follows: "If any railway company or common carrier subject to the provisions of this article, directly or indirectly, through or by its agents, officers or employees, by any special rate, rebate, drawback or other device, shall charge, demand, collect or re - ceive from any person, firm or corporation a greater or less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by it than it charges, demands, collects or receives from any other person, firm or corporation for doing a like and contemporane - ous service, the same shall constitute an 'unjust discrimination,' which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful." It is undoubtedly true that there must be classes among tele - phone users and that there must be a different charge put upon the </seg>
            <seg id="p402">402 E duals in these various classes. The Railway Commission has rity, under section 6109, Revised Statutes of 1913, to make all lary classification. Telephone companies and commissions have generally recognized three classes of telephone users, namely, business, residence and farm line patrons. For each of these classes certain fixed tariffs are made for all service accorded each instrument within certain specified zones. Charges are different to the various classes and necessarily so by reason of the difference in conditions attending the service. There can be no discrimination in charging the business man a higher rate for different service than is charged him at his residence; neither can it be justly urged that there is discrimination in charg - ing a still lower rate to the farm line patron. He is one of a large number of patrons attached to that line and necessarily his service is of less value than that of the residence patron in the city, who has an independent line for himself. In the facts set out in your letter it appears that a certain minimum charge of fifty cents per month is made to the farm line patrons whereby they have full access to all of the subscribers on both lines without paying extra toll. The town subscribers of these lines do not have this minimum rate, but must, in each instance, pay the toll required. On its face this looks like a discrimination in favor of the farm line patron. It looks as though the toll service between two towns is discriminatory unless the charge is the same to each patron of the calling exchange. When a subscriber of the Stromsburg exchange calls one of the subscribers of the Benedict exchange the same service must be rendered by these two exchanges whether the person calling is on a farm line or on a town line. Unless conditions are dissimilar as affecting the expense or difficulty of performing the service demanded of a telephone company, or un - less other conditions arise, which seem to require or warrant a differ - ent rate, each patron should be charged the same price. (Western Union Telegraph Company v. Call Publishing Company, 44 Neb. 326; Nebraska Telephone Company v. State of Nebraska, 55 Neb. I do not think for a minute that a different toll rate should be made as between the business and residence phone users of either of these exchanges. It would clearly be discrimination. But there are conditions attending the farm line service, which might warrant the charge of fifty cents per month as has been made between these two exchanges in the past. These two exchanges have extended their farm lines in such a manner that they overlap. Neighbors on farm lines find themselves connected up with different exchanges. The men, with whom the farmer wants most to talk, may be near neigh - bors and yet far away on another telephone exchange. To give ac - etm to these neighbors on the other exchange at a cheap rate seems equitable. It is hardly possible that any of the farmers on these </seg>
            <seg id="p403">403 advantage of this minimum rate. By reason of this complex and intermingled condition of the farm lines of the two exchanges I be - lieve conditions exist which would warrant the Commission in per - mitting this minimum rate of intercourse between the two exchanges to remain. Another condition, which affects the farm lines and which should give them cheaper service, is the difficulty in getting the line. Where the farmer is on the same line with ten or twelve other farmers and !ie wishes to call a neighbor, who is on another farm line, which has en or twelve subscribers, he may have the utmost difficulty in getting he person he wishes. This question is a close one, but I believe there is enough difference in the conditions attending the use of this toll service by these farm line subscribers to warrant the Commission in authorizing this rate.

Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, September 17, 1914. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska.

            <seg id="p404">404 section 5978, Revised Statutes of 1913, railroad companies can be compelled to furnish elevator sites to private parties or associations, where they have such sites available on their rights of way, on the same terms that similar sites are furnished other persons or associa - tions, and ask for the opinion of this department thereon. ■n answer to the question propounded by you I will say that jpreme court of the United States has twice held that they are ompelled to furnish such sites. "An order made by a state court, under authority of statute, requiring a railroad company to surrender a portion of ts right-of-way to private individuals, as a site for an elevator to be erected and maintained by such individuals for their own benefit, amounts to a taking of private property by the state without due process of law. 45 N. W. 785, 29 Neb. 550, reversed." (Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. State of Nebraska, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep., 130.) "The taking by a state of the private property of one person or corporation, without the owner's consent, for the private use of another, is not due process of law, and is a viola - tion of the Fourteenth Article of Amendment of the Constitu - tion of the United States. "A statute by a state, by which, as construed by the supreme court of the state, a board of transportation is au - horized to require a railroad corporation, which has permitted the erection of two elevators by private persons on its right - of-way at a station, to grant upon like terms and conditions a ocation upon that right-of-way to other private persons in the neighborhood, for the purpose of erecting thereon a third ele - vator, in which to store their grain from time to time, is a tak - ng of private property of the railroad corporation for a private use, in violation of the Fourteenth Article of Amendment of the Constitution of the United States." (Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, 164 U. S., 403.) Our own supreme court has also passed upon a question anal ogous in many respects. "An order of the state board of transportation under the provisions of the act of March 31, 1887, entitled 'An act to regulate railroads and prevent unjust discrimination,' etc., which requires a railroad company to surrender a portion of its right - of-way for an elevator site to a person or corporation engaged in the buying and shipping of grain, contemplates the taking of property for mere private use within the prohibition of the United States constitution, and is accordingly without au - thority and void." Missouri P. R. Co. v. State, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 130, reversing same case, 29 Neb. 550. (Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. Co. v. State, 50 Neb. 399). Kn view of the court decisions above cited, I am of the opinion a railroad company cannot be compelled to furnish elevator on its right-of-way to parties applying therefor, even though y have given permission to others to construct elevators upon fht-of-way.

This comes about in this way: Senate File 174, Session Laws of 1913, is an amendment of section 10602, Cobbey's Annotatec Statutes of 1913. Said section 10602 is one of the several section constituting chapter 106, Session Laws of 1905. Neither in the original bill nor in the aforesaid amendment is there any provision made for the punishment of a railroad violating the provisions o said section. The remedy, as provided by statute, is one that inure to the shipper injured, who may sue for damages.

A telephone company is given a right, by statute, as I under - stand it, to run its lines along the public highways of the state, upon the implied condition that it shall comply with the statutory requirements providing that wherever such lines cross roads they shall be placed a certain height above the highway crossed. I do not think it matters, so far as the duty of the telephone company to raise its wires to the required height is concerned, whether the rail - road was put in before or after the installation of the telephone Section 6162, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, made it the duty of any railroad corporation, crossing any public or private road, to make and keep in good repair good and sufficient crossings on such road. Construing this provision of statute, the supreme court of this state has held it is applicable in cases where a public highway was laid out after the railroad was completed, as well as in those cases where the highway was in existence at the time of the building of the railroad. • Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v.

Gentlemen: Yours of the 25th instant is as follows: "I am directed by the Commission to request your opinion in writing as to whether it can properly and lawfully pay the traveling expenses of witnesses used by the Commission in matters or hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion, in which this Commission appears as party plaintiff, party defendant, or intervenor." The Nebraska State Railway Commission finds it necessary to appear before the Interstate Commerce Commission sometimes as party plaintiff, party defendant, or intervenor. This it does for the purpose of protecting the interests of the people of this state, because of the close relationship existing between the state and interstate rates and discriminations which grow out of same. These duties and the expenses incident thereto, no doubt, were contemplated by the legislature when it made an appropriation for the use of the Railway Commission. In that appropriation it expressly provided for the payment of the "expenses of investigation and litigation." When the Commission is compelled to take a witness before the Interstate Commerce Commission, or someone representing it, on questions of this kind, it should see that such witness is paid at least his actual expenses and the fund appropriated to the Commission by the legislature should be used for paying such expenses. Very respectfully, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. No. 70 Lincoln, November 5, 1914. ■arable Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. BDear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to request of you ipinion in writing as to the proper interpretation to be placed louse Roll No. 57, passed by the legislature of 1913, being the relative to "light engine crews." Said law provides: "That it shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business in the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road from one division to another division, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road from one division to another division, outside of yard limits, any light engine which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman and one conductor." The Commission especially desires an interpretation of the phrase "from one division to another division." Here is a case in </seg>

Did such light engine run constitute lation of the statute referred to? An early reply will be appreciated. Very truly yours. A. B. Allen, Secretary Lincoln, November 30, 1914. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Eentlemen: This office is in receipt of your letter of the 5th ;, in which you call attention to the provisions of House Roll ssed by the legislature of 1913, wherein it is provided: "That it shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business n the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road from one division to another division, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road from one division to another division, outside of yard limits, any light engine which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, and one conductor." Kou ask for the opinion of this department as to the meaning phrase, "from one division to another division." Kin my judgment, said phrase means just what it says, that is to there must be a full crew where a light engine is run from one ion to another division outside of the yard limits, but not nee— ' a full crew where the run is merely between stations in the division. It is to be borne in mind that the statute in question is penal nature, and, hence, its provisions must be strictly construed i one is charged with a violation of the provisions thereof. In words, the language of the statute cannot be broadened by ruction, so as to make one guilty of an offense against the law would not be guilty if the words used were given their literal ing. Very respectfully, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. By Geo. W. Ayers, Deputy Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p410">410 COURT DECISIONS rte of Nebraska, ex rel., Hudson J. Winnett et al, Relators, vs. raha A. Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, Respondent. An Action to compel compliance with Railway Commission's order to file physical valuation report. SYLLABUS 1. The words "railroad" and "railway" as used in the physical valuation act (Laws 1909, c. 107), held not to include street rail- B. Since such act declares that "the term 'public service cor - ion' when used in this article shall mean and embrace" certain i classes of such corporations, no other class of public service ration is within its terms. Kt. The proper object of a court in construing a statute is to effect to the intention of the legislature, and where the language in an act is ambiguous, resort may be had to the history of its ,ge through the legislature, if this throws any light on the ing of the language used therein. 4. Where the legislature has, upon the effort being made therein, refused to include certain classes of public service corporations in a physical valuation statute, the court will not include them therein by construction. Letton, J. This is an original application to this court, made by the State Railway Commission, for a writ of mandamus to compel the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company to forthwith file with that body a detailed inventory of its property under the provisions of sections 26-36, Art. 8, c. 72, Comp. St. 1911, commonly known as the "Physical Valuation Act." It is alleged that the relators ordered the respondent to file such an inventory within sixty days from the date of the order; that it was duly notified of this order, but that it has neglected and refused to furnish the Commission with any information whatever regarding the amount, reproduction cost, or value of its property. The defense is that a corporation operating a street railway is not embraced within the terms of the act re - ferred to. The cause was submitted upon the pleadings and upon a stipulation of facts which recites that portions of the line of the respondent run, in one instance, for a distance of about three blocks and in another for a distance of about six blocks in public highways, outside of the corporate limits of any incorporated city or village, and that in Iowa a portion of the line operated by the company u ndcr a lcstsc runs for &amp; distuncp of a bout 1 ' m i l(*s t h roii p h tprntorv </seg>
            <seg id="p411">411 Si of any corporate limits. It is also stipulated that it will cost dent the sum of $7,500 to furnish the information requested if is made in the manner requested by the relator. Khe determination of the controversy depends upon the scope given the provisions of chapter 107, Laws 1909 (Rev. St. 1913, 5), known as the Physical Valuation Act. The title of the act "An act to provide for the physical valuation of railroads and other public service corporations in Nebraska, and to define such corporations, and to provide for the employment of clerical and expert help, and the manner in which expenses incurred in arrying out this bill shall be paid, and to provide penalties or the violation of this act." Sections 1, 2 and 3 are as follows: "Section 1. The term 'railroad', as used herein, shall mean and embrace all corporations, individuals, associations of in - dividuals, their lessees, trustees or receivers i appointed by any court or lawful authority whatsoever) that now or may hereafter own, operate, manage or control any railroad or part of a rail - road as a common carrier in this state, or cars or other equip - ment used thereon, or bridges, terminals or side tracks used in connection therewith, whether owned by such railroad or other - wise. "Sec. 2. The term 'public service corporation' when used in this act shall mean and embrace every railroad, railway, tele - graph, express, telephone, and the railroad transportation prop - perty of stockyard companies. "Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of the state railway com - mission to ascertain forthwith, upon the taking effect of this act, the physical value of each railroad and public service cor - poration in this state within the meaning of this act. The physical value so ascertained shall be the physical value of each of these properties on the first day of July, of the year in which ■tich valuation is ascertained. Provided, that steam railroads shall first be valued according to the provisions of this act, and thereafter other public service corporations in such order to be valued as shall be determined by the state railway commis - sion." Section 4 prescribes the manner in which the physical valuation in case of railroads shall be made and what it shall include. The property of railroads is divided by the section into nine different classes or descriptions, and it is provided that: "This section shall apply to each railroad in this state separately, and the finding of the commission shall show the total value of each railroad, the number of miles of road and the average value per mile of track," etc. Section 5 provides for the manner of estimating the "physical value of each telegraph, telephone, express and the railroad transpor - tation property of stockyard companies." The question presented is whether a street railway company is embraced within the definition of "railroad" or of "public service pnrnorAt ion*' us us**fl in t hf* no t Thp rpl iit or (*onoi-*fips t h n t t \\(* word </seg>
            <seg id="p412">412 "railroad" does not at all times and under all circumstances include within its meaning street railways and that whether or not they are included within the terms "railway" or "railroads" is to be deter - mined from the context and from the purpose of the act in which the term is used, but contends that since in fixing rates it is neces - sary that the commission shall have a reasonably accurate knowledge of the value of the property, the necessity for a statement from the company of the property of the street railway company exists just as much as in the case of any other common carrier. Evidently the first section of the act does not define the term "railroad," but uses that word to designate all kinds or classes of persons who may be known to operate, manage, or control any railroad, or equipment, or bridges, or terminals or side tracks used in connection therewith. This section, therefore, throws no light upon the problem. Neither does section 2, defining "public service corporation," aid in solving the question. It includes within its definition certain classes of public service corporations, but excludes other classes of such corporations, such as gas, electric light, heating, power and water companies. It does, however, include "every railroad, railway, telegraph, express, telephone, and the railroad transportation property of stockyard companies." It is to be presumed that the legislature in using language in a statute will give it the same significance that has already been accorded it by the Constitution and laws of the state, unless a different meaning is provided in the enactment itself, or must be drawn from its context. The question whether street rail - ways are included within the term "railroad" as used in the Con - stitution and statutes of Nebraska had been decided a number of times by this court prior to the enactment of this law. In Lincoln Street R. Co. v. McClellan, 54 Neb. 672, 74 N. W. 1074, 69 Am. St. Rep. 736, in considering the question whether street railway companies were included in the statute providing that "every railroad company" should be liable for all damages inflicted upon the person of passengers while being transported over its road, this court considered this question, pointed out a number of differ - ences between a street railway and a railroad, and, after quoting and citing authorities, held that such statement had no application to street railways. This was followed in Omaha Street R. Co. v. Boesen, 74 Neb. 764, 105 N. W. 303, 4 L. R. A. (N. S.) 122. In State v. Lincoln Traction Co., 90 Neb. 535, 134 N. W. 278, the question is again considered in construing section 3, Art. 11, of the Constitution which forbids the consolidation of the stocks, property franchise, etc., of two or more railroad corporations owning compet - ing or parallel lines, and it was held that the word "railroad" as used in the Constitution does not purport to, and does not as a matter of law, relate to street railways. In a case involving the regulation of rates of this respondent by the Interstate Commerce Commission a similar question was presented to and so decided by the United </seg>

I In investigation of the history of the act in its passage through ?gislature shows that at one stage "street car, interurban rail - interurban railroad, stockyard, electric light, waterworks and ompany" were all included in the definition of "public service ration" in section 2. These were afterwards stricken out, and .ct passed as it now stands. This conclusively shows that it not the legislative purpose to compel the valuation of such rations.

The Commission entered an order in' the above cause under date of June 15, 1912, said order appearing in the Fifth Annual Report, pages 175-177, inclusive. The Chicago, Rock Island &amp;. Pacific Railway Company appealed from the Commission's order to the supreme court, which court rendered its opinion under date of May 15, 1914 (case No. 17733), in which it held that the Com - mission's order is not unreasonable and unjust, and therefore dis - missed the appeal. Text of the supreme court's decision and of the mandate follows: SYLLABUS Khe order of the State Railway Commission set forth in the n, held under the facts in the case not to be unreasonable njust. Letton, J. This is an appeal from an order of the State Railway Com - mission denying the request of the appellant that it approve, ratify and confirm supplement 97 to Freight Tariff No. 21432, which eliminates from the tariff providing for switching charges the names of certain corporations and individuals as engaged in industries located upon the track of the applicant. The Commission allowed the Benjamin F. Bailey Sanatorium Company to be eliminated but denied the request as to the others named in the application. The evidence indicates that all of the occupations affected are carried on at some distance from the tracks of appellant; that by an error of a former agent the names were listed and placed upon the tariff sheet without regard to the fact that the industries were not situated upon a track; that they have been allowed for years to use tracks other than the regular team track; and that no separate tariff charge has been made for this service. It is conceded by the At - torney General that the railway company is not bound by this refusal so far as concerns interstate shipments. It is also conceded that it may require reasonable compensation for delivering shipments upon these tracks which have been received from other railroads. With these concessions, and with the provision contained in the order that the service shall only be continued until a showing is made to the Railway Commission that the industries on and adjacent to the right-of-way on these industrial tracks are inconvenienced by this service, it appears that no property right is" affected and it does not appear that by the order the property of the railway company </seg>

I This case is before us on a direct appeal from an order of the raska State Railway Commission requiring the Union Pacific road Company to construct a depot and install an agent therein he village of Gandy. Kie appellant has filed a motion asking the court to remand ise to the Commission for the purpose of taking further testi - and making a different order. The application is supported davits showing or tending to show some change in the con - since the order appealed from was made. This application be determined before the questions raised by the appeal are red. SYLLABUS </seg>
            <seg id="p417">417 We held in Hooper Telephone Co. v. Nebraska Telephone Co., Neb. , No. 18340, that the jurisdiction of this court upon such appeals is only to reverse, vacate or modify the order of the Commission, which will not be done unless it appears from the record that there was error in the proceedings before the Commission prejudicial to the appellant, or that the Commission has exceeded its power. If the order is affirmed it becomes the final order of the Commission, and the judgment of this court affirming the order is without prejudice to future applications to the Commis - sion for a modification of the order. The motion to remand to the Commission is overruled. We come now to the consideration of the order from which the appeal is taken. It appears that the complainant, George V. Hill, is a resident of the village or town of Gandy, and is chairman of the board of trustees of said village; that Gandy is the county seat of Logan county; that the Union Pacific Railroad Company, hereafter called the appellant, has constructed and is operating its line of rail - way through said county at a point about one and a half miles from the said village; that an addition to the village has been laid out, which extends to the appellant's railroad. It further appears that since this complaint was filed appellant has established a depot at Stapleton, about three miles from the town of Gandy, and has refused to build a depot and establish an agent at the latter point, and the town and its inhabitants, and the inhabitants of the surrounding country, are thus denied railroad facilities. Thus far the parties have agreed upon the facts, and there - fore they may be said to be established without any dispute. The amount of business which the railroad facilities would bring to the appellant at the point in question is not shown, and it is difficult to see how it could be ascertained until after a depot is furnished and an agent installed, and the business is conducted for at least some reasonable length of time. On the hearing before the Commission it seems to have been practically agreed by both parties, that, brushing aside all of the immaterial issues involved, the question to be determined was, what is Gandy and the surrounding country entitled to in view of their location, and all of the existing circumstances? It appears that the population of Gandy as given by the last census report was 318, and at the time of taking the census it had no railroad facilities nearer than twenty or more miles; that Gandy, previous to the time of building the extension of the appellant's railroad, was the business center of Logan county, and had a court house, two banks and a number of well established business houses. It is situated on an elevated site in the Loup valley. As to the construction of the contiguous railroad line, it was contended that it was impracticable to leave the valley along which the road is built, and attempt to climb the grade to the town of Gandy, consequently the road was located at one and a half miles north of the village. It is the cor.- </seg>
            <seg id="p418">418 tention of the railroad company that the citizens of Gandy and vicin - ity are reasonably well served at Stapleton, where a depot has been built and an agent installed, and that the company should not be compelled to provide facilities for the people of Gandy. The evidence shows that Gandy has been the county seat of Logan county for more than twenty years; that the major portion of the local busines of appellant's railroad would come from a farming settlement on wha is known as the Garfield Table, where most of the farm products o the county are produced; that in order to reach Stapleton those pro ducts will have to be hauled through Gandy, the distance between Gandy and Stapleton being something over three miles; that th road is very sandy, while the road between Gandy and the point on the railroad one and a half miles north of the town is solid, and can be well maintained. It appears to have been argued before the Commission by the appellant, that most of the business houses formerly located in Gandy have moved to Stapleton, and it is only a matter of time until they will all be moved, and that eventually the courthouse will be located there. It appears, however, that a large number of persons are desirous of maintaining their homes at Gandy; that they have so maintained them for many years (having no railroad facilities), and now that the railroad has been built they insist that they should have the opportunity of enjoying the benefit of \\ at its nearest possible point. A large part of the strictly farming population of Logan county lies south and east of Gandy, making a longer and more difficult haul necessary if Stapleton is to be the only place where railroad facilities are furnished. Logan county is sparsely populated. The courthouse was built many years ago; the bonds issued for its construction have just been paid, and it may be that the citizens of the county are not ready to assume the new obliga - tion for the construction of another courthouse, but will prefer to put up with the present inconvenient location for a considerable period. The Commission found that it has no way to estimate the earnings of this line of road, but that the company has obliged itself by such construction to give reasonable service to the com - munity through which it passes; that had Gandy not been built and the county seat not located previous to the time the road was constructed, the prayer of the petition might properly be denied; but under existing circumstances it was the opinion of the Commis - sion that the rights of the people should be protected. The Com - mission also found that the peculiar situation existing at Gandy was to be considered as a ruling factor in determining the question at issue, and the finding of the Commission was "that the defendant company shall make provision at the most convenient point on its line north of the village of Gandy to receive and discharge passengers and freight; that a small station building shall be constructed; that blue prints and specifications of the proposed building shall be submitted to the Commission on or before December 15th, 1912, </seg>
            <seg id="p419">419 and that the building shall be completed on or before June 1, 1913, and an agent installed." A more detailed statement of the evidence is unnecessary, for it would add nothing to the value of our opinion. ■ does not appear from the record that the Commission has ed its power, that the order is unreasonable or unjust, and no icial error appearing, the order of the Commission is AFFIRMED.

St. 1913, sec. 6132. The complaint before the Railway Commission alleged that the complainants are residents of College View and "are each engaged and employed in a business which is unfavorably affected to a substantial degree by the matters and freight rates hereinafter complained of. * * * That said College View is an organized village duly incorporated under the laws of this state, having a population of about fifteen hundred, and is one of the college suburbs of the city of Lincoln, and is immediately adjacent thereto, being connected with the city of Lincoln by two street railway lines which form a part of the street railway system of said city of Lincoln, which system is owned and operated by the Lincoln Traction Company, and said village is also connected with the telephone system existing in said city, and the inhabitants talk over said phone system with - out any toll charges therefor; that s-iid village also gets all the electric current for lighting said village and for the use of its in - habitants from one of the lighting plants in the city of Lincoln and the sanitary sewer of said village is connected with the sewer system of said city; that the territory lying between the city of Lincoln and said village is practically all laid out into lots and blocks and suburban residences and is purely urban in character, and that in every sense of the word, said village is distinctly a suburb of said city of Lincoln, and the civic life and business interests of said city and said village are intimately connected and interdependent. That in the above mentioned particulars, as well as in point of distance from said city, the relations of said village to said city are sub - stantially similar to those of University Place and Bethany Heights, and in fact said College View is much more closely and intimately connected with said city and sustains a much more distinctly subur - ban relation to said city than does the village of Bethany, and that there is shipped to said village of College View approximately four hundred cars of freight per annum in carload lots. "Complainant alleges that University Place is not upon any line of railroad other than a spur from the Rock Island road, which was recently extended to said University Place, and the nearest line of railroad to the village of Bethany is the Missouri Pacific road, which passes near the south boundary line of said village of Bethany at a distance of little over a mile from the business section of said village, said railway maintaining no depot nor station other than a flag station and siding for the accommodation of said village of Bethany at about said distance from said business section, while on the other hand both the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad pass the said village of College View at a distance of a little over a mile from the business section the said Burlington line being actually within the corporate </seg>
            <seg id="p422">422 limits of the said village at one point and having two sidings for the setting out of cars at said point, and said Rock Island road passes within a few feet of the west line of the corporate limits of said College View, and has a siding for the setting out of cars at said point, and also a spur which actually extends into the corporate limits of said village and connects with the Lincoln Traction Com - pany's line which enters College View and affords switching facilities by which loaded freight cars from said Rock Island line can be switched and transferred into the very center of the business section of said village and is actually used for that purpose. 3 "That the success of the business represented by these com - plainants, as well as that of all others engaged in business at said village, as well as the upbuilding, growth and prosperity of said village depend to a large extent upon the ability of the business interests of said village of College View to be placed upon an equality with other suburbs of said city of Lincoln, and especially with Uni - versity Place and Bethany Heights, in the matter of freight rates, shipping facilities and switching privileges and advantages, in order that carload freight may be shipped to said College View upon the same terms as those afforded said other suburbs, and that if these rates and privileges be denied to said village, said College View will be illegally and unjustly discriminated against in those particulars and great and irreparable injury will result to said village, and to the business interests and inhabitants thereof. 4 "That prior to the organization of this Commission the several railroads involved herein, by an illegal, unfair combination and agreement between them, created a switching district, and established switching limits for said city of Lincoln, which limits included the city of University Place and the Village of Bethany Heights, but excluded the village of College View, and said switching limits are still unlawfully maintained by said railroads, to the great damage and injury of said last named village. That said Missouri Pacific Railway Company has extended a spur from its road at about 30th and Y streets in said city of Lincoln, to and connecting with the interurban electric line operated and maintained by the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company between Lincoln and Bethany Heights, and by some agreement between said Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railroad Company and the several railway companies here - inbefore named, the said loaded cars of freight are transferred and switched from all of said railroads over said Missouri Pacific Rail - road Company's track from the switch yards in the city of Lincoln, over said Missouri Pacific Railroad Company's line and its said spur and thence over said interurban line to the business section of </seg>
            <seg id="p423">423 the business section of University Place by transferring loaded freight cars from all of said railroads to the Rock Island road and moving the same over said line and its University Place spur into said business section of University Place, and by means of this switching district and the agreement maintained between said several roads and said Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Bethany Railroad Company, all of said switching is done without cost to the shippers of freight to University Place, or the consignees thereof, and the said University Place and said Bethany Heights are given the benefit of the Lincoln freight rates save in those instances where the regular freight charges on such cars are less than $15.00, and the switching charges which are paid to the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railroad Company, and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad Company are paid by the initial carrier or road whose cars are so switched and are absorbed by such road in its income or freight revenue account. 5 "That by reason of the fact that College View is outside of said switching limits, so unjustly and arbitrarily fixed and established by said railroad companies, said village is denied the switching privileges and the Lincoln freight rates over said several railroads which are furnished and accorded to the said city of University- Place and said village of Bethany Heights, and it is impossible for said College View and shippers located at that point to ship goods over other railroads than the Burlington and the Rock Island roads and have the same consigned direct to College View, but the same must be consigned to the city of Lincoln and then reassigned over the Burlington or the Rock Island roads from Lincoln to College View, and the shipper is obliged to pay exorbitant and arbitrary local freight tariffs to said Burlington and Rock Island roads from Lincoln to College View on such shipments, in addition to the regular Lincoln freight rates, and even then this merely places cars so re - billed upon the team tracks of said Burlington and Rock Island roads at College View, a distance of a little over one mile from the business section of College View, unless the car is sent from Lincoln over the Rock Island road and transferred over the Rock Island spur or transfer track to the Lincoln Traction Company's line and thence to the business section of College View, and if this is done, the shipper is obliged to pay the Morris Transportation Company, lessee of the said Traction Company's express and freight transporta - tion privileges, another excessive, exorbitant, and in most cases pro - hibitive rate of $7.00 per car, and thus College View is discriminated against on all freight shipped in carload lots over other roads than said Burlington and Rock Island, as compared with the city of Lincoln and said other suburbs, to the extent of the local freight from Lincoln to College View plus the charges of the Morris Transporta - tion Company of $7.00 per car. That by reason of the matters </seg>
            <seg id="p424">424 Eiid College View is practically excluded from territory not nt to the Burlington and Rock Island roads in the matter pping such freight as lumber, coal, hay, potatoes, apples, brick, cement, and all other similar articles, greatly to the ice of said village. "Complainants allege that the charge of $7.00 per car, made by said Morris Transportation Company for each car taken from the Rock Island road over the Lincoln Traction Company's line to the sanitarium in the business section of College View, a distance of a little over one mile, is unreasonable and excessive and is prohibitive and shippers find it much more economical to haul their freight from said Rock Island road by team rather than have the same brought in over said Traction Company's line at the rate aforesaid." The answer of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad Company alleges: "That the village of College View in Lancaster county, Nebraska, is not located upon the line of railroad of the said respondent company, but is distant therefrom a mile and a half. That at a point where the Lincoln Traction Company intersects and crosses this Respondent's line of railroad, your respondent maintains a spur that connects with the said Traction Company's street railway line at a point distant from said village of College View a mile and a half, as aforesaid. That said connection with the Traction Com - pany's railway was made under and pursuant to a private agreement whereby this respondent was to set cars upon the spur herein referred to, to be disposed of and hauled to the said village of College View by the said Traction Company under a special and private contract made and entered into by the said Traction Company and the sanitarium, maintained, owned and operated by the Seventh Day Adventists' Association located in said village." It denied any combi - nation to fix rates or switching district. The answer of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Com - pany alleges "that this railroad designates its own switching limits without consultation or consent of any other railroad, except in that part of Lincoln where the possession of the territory is in common, or is parallel to each other, and where the facilities are such that immediate and economical exchange can be made of traffic, and that College View and the complainants herein are not within any territory so occupied by said railroads, and denies that any combina - tion or agreement has ever been made between this defendant and other railroads in the city of Lincoln with reference to switching which is illegal or unlawful, or discriminates against any person, particularly complainants. This defendant further alleges that the conditions at College View are entirely different from those at Uni - versity Place and Bethany Heights, in that the latter points of de - livery are within the switching limits of Lincoln upon the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway and the Missouri Pacific Railway. The Rock Island has a station outside of Lincoln limits called Uni- </seg>
            <seg id="p425">425 freight to and from University Place, which spur track is within the Lincoln switching limit. Bethany Heights is on the Missouri Pacific Railway within the Lincoln switching limit of that line, the switching charge in each case being $5.00 per car, which the tariffs of this company provide it will absorb with certain restrictions. College View is outside the switching limits of both the Rock Island Railway and this defendant, it being 5.9 miles from Lincoln by the line of this defendant, and no switching rates are published between College View and Lincoln by either line. The rates to College View and Lincoln are the same, and carload freight only being handled at College View. The switching charge of the Lincoln Traction Com - pany from the Rock Island west to the Nebraska Sanitarium is $7.00 per car." In Hooper Telephone Company v. Nebraska Telephone Com - pany, Neb. , the practice in case of appeal directly from the Railway Commission to this court was considered. It was there pointed out that the original act, Laws 1907, Ch. 90, recognized three different methods of questioning the orders of the Railway Commission. Subdivision e, Section 5, refers to the proceeding in equity which was allowed in the absence of any statute and prescribes the manner of proceeding in such case. Section 11 of the act pro - vided for proceeding in the district court to enforce the orders of the Commission. This section provided that the court should "proceed to hear and determine the matter speedily as a court of equity * * * in such manner as to do justice in the premises." It contemplated that the court would hear evidence and try the case as ordinary cases in equity. Section 7 provided for appeals by the Railway Com - mission, or any person affected thereby, to the district court. It provided that upon the appeal the action "shall be tried and de - termined as other civil causes in said court." This of course con - templated the taking of evidence and full investigation of the whole matter in a court of justice. It also provided that either party might appeal to this court from the judgment of the district court, and that in the trial under this section the burden of proof should rest upon the plaintiff, that is, the party appealing, and that the order of the Commission shall "be received in evidence, that said or - der order made by the Commission) is primi facie just and reason - able." This section providing for an appeal and trial in the district court was the only section amended by the act of 1911, Ch. 94. By that act Section 7 was repealed and a new section enacted in its place. The change made by this amendment was radical. It provided for a review of the proceedings before the Commission by proceedings in this court to "reverse, vacate or modify the order complained of." These were the words used in the former statute providing for pro - ceedings in error in this court to review the judgments of the district court in civil actions at law, and the section as amended further pro - vided that the procedure "to obtain such reversal, modification or vacation of any such order or regulation made and adopted uDon </seg>
            <seg id="p426">426 which a hearing has been had before said Commission, shall be governed by the same provisions now in force with reference to appeals and error proceedings from the district courts to the supreme court of Nebraska." It also provided for superseding the order of the Commission until the matter could be reviewed in this court. It takes the place of the former section in the act, and is of course affected by the provision of subdivision b, Section 10 of the act, which provides that when proceedings are begun affecting the de - cision of the Commission the order of the Commission shall be held in abeyance until finally determined by the court. In the Hooper Telephone case it was decided that under this amendment appeals from the orders of the Commission directly to this court are to be considered and determined in the same manner as appeals from a judgment of the district court upon trial by jury in civil cases. It has uniformly been held by this court that in such cases judgments of the district court will not be reversed unless it affirmatively ap - pears from the record that it is clearly wrong. We have already determined in the case above referred to that when upon such appeal the record fails to disclose affirmatively that the order of the Com - mission is clearly wrong, and the order is therefore affirmed by this court, it then becomes a final order. The Burlington Company contends in its brief that there is no allegation in the record that its "commodity or class rates on articles transported by it between Lincoln and College View are unjust or excessive," and that there is no evidence submitted to prove such fact, and that "by the order of the Commission every schedule and rate concerning transportation in carload lots between Lincoln and College View is amended without any reference having been made thereto in the complaint or in the evidence." The complaint counts principally upon the allegations that there is a discrimination on the part of the railroad companies centering in the city of Lincoln, between the village of College View on the one part and Bethany Heights and University Place on the other. The brief of the com - plainant is wholly devoted to this proposition, that there is an un - lawful discrimination, and that College View should be placed by the various railroad companies in the Lincoln "switching district." No reference is made in the brief to any evidence supporting this contention and no attempt made to assist the court in ascertaining whether the facts will justify compelling these various railway com - panies to form a "switching district" which will include the village of College View. The contention of the railroad company that there is no allegation or evidence that their charges upon shipments to College View are excessive or unreasonable is not controverted by the complainants in the brief. Their position seems to be that, without regard to the reasonableness of the charges for the services rendered, each of these defendants should be compelled to reduce its charges to the lowest charge for like shipments through the citv of Lincoln to Bethany Heights and University Place </seg>
            <seg id="p427">427 "A finding that the rates charged by railroads for shipments to a particular point are unreasonable in themselves, and in viola - tion of Section 1 of the interstate commerce act (24 Stat. 379 V. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3154) cannot properly be baaed on evidence which only tends to show that they are too high as compared with the rates charged between the initial points and one or two other points." Interstate Commerce Commission v. Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. Co., 120 Fed. 934. I 'A reduced rate upon a particular commodity cannot be said ? reasonable and just when it is established without regard to her the existing rate is high or low, as compared with rates on 1 commodities, and without regard to whether it will pay the of the service rendered, or yield a fair return to the carrier upon :apital invested." Morgan's L. &amp; T. R. &amp; S. S. Co. v. Rail- Commission, 53 So. 890 (127 La. 636). "An order of the railroad commissioners that defendant railroad company transfer cars delivered to it by another company, from its station to another point, as a switching service and at switching rates, will not be enforced where such point is beyond the yard limits, and the service rendered is on the main line, and is done under orders, as in case of trains, and not under the direction of the yard master." State v. Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. Co., 55 N. W. 331, (88 la. 445). This last case cited was approved by this court in State v. Sioux City, O'N. &amp; W. R. Co., 46 Neb. 682, and the Louisiana case was cited with approval in Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co. v. State Railway Commission, 85 Neb. 18. It is conceded that the line of the Rock Island road does not pass through the village of College View. It runs near the corporate limits of the village, and a mile or more from the business part thereof, and the company maintains a side track at that point upon which it places cars for unloading upon request. This side track is connected with the street railway, operated by the Lincoln Trac - tion Company, and it appears that the Morris Transfer Company, through some traffic arrangement with the Traction Company, transfers cars from this side track over the line of the Traction Company, under a contract which it has with a private company in College View, at a fixed charge, as agreed between the College View party and the Morris Transportation Company. It is also conceded that the line of the Burlington Company passes through the corporate limits of the village of College View about one and a quarter miles from the business part of the village and maintains two sidings at that point, but has no station or office of any kind at or near the village of College View. These sidings are 7 or 8 miles from its Lincoln station and from its transfer facilities with other roads. The Rock Island road has a station and side tracks at University Place but does not pass through Bethany Heights, and the Missouri Pacific railroad maintains a flag station at Bethany Heights but not in University Place. It seems clear that under </seg>
            <seg id="p428">428 I conditions the fact that the charges for the delivery of intra - freight in carload lots through the city of Lincoln to Bethany ts or University Place are less than charges for the same es over the Rock Island and by way of the Traction Com - 3 lines to College View and is less than the same services over urlington lines at a distance of 7 or 8 miles from its station and er grounds, is not sufficient of itself to justify the order of the lission. The findings of the Commission show quite in detail the charges on freight in carload lots to College View as compared with charges from the same initial points to Bethany Heights and University Place. It appears that in some instances there is a considerable difference. The order, as before stated, grants substantially all the relief asked for, and does much more. It adjusts the rates on the several roads affecting College View and provides what they shall be for the future. It changes the contract price to be paid the Morris Transportation Company by the College View Sanitarium under their contract. It requires the Burlington and the Rock Island roads to receive cars from the other roads at the transfer yards in Lincoln and deliver them at the points on those roads nearest to College View, and fixes the charges therefor, and determines many other things not included in the complaint, and so far as has been sug - gested or we have observed, not covered by the evidence. It is quite possible that there are existing conditions that ought to be corrected, but we are of the opinion that the complaint and the evidence do not justify the order complained of. Khe order complained of is therefore reversed and the cause ded without prejudice to further proceedings before the Com - n, if the parties are so advised. Reversed and Remanded.

Petition for an order to require defendant to furnish toll connec- tions and service between its exchanges at Fremont and Hooper; also, that the revenue arising from said toll business may be divided in accordance with Chapter 79, Session Laws of braska, 1913. The Commission entered an order in the above cause under date of September 20, 1913, said order appearing in the Sixth Annual Report, pages 158 and 159. Defendant appealed from the Com - mission's order to the supreme court, which court rendered its opinion under date of May 15, 1914 (case No. 18340), affirming the Commission's order and issuing mandate requiring compliance there - with.

            <seg id="p430">430 E*. The amendment creating the State Railway Commission, the stautte enacted pursuant to the power given to the legisla - thereby, confer administrative and judicial powers upon the mission in addition to the main purpose of its creation which e exercise of legislative powers. B Chapter 94, Laws 1911, providing for proceedings in this to review the decisions of the State Railway Commission s appellate jurisdiction upon this court, within the meaning of n 2, Art. VI, of the constitution. I The statute is not unconstitutional as an attempt to confer tive powers upon this court, its purpose being to afford a ' determination as to the regularity of the proceedings of the lission and the legality of its decisions. It should not be ued as giving this court any different jurisdiction than in or - '. civil cases under the former statute by proceedings in error also gave this court jurisdiction "to reverse, vacate or modify" ents and not to retry the case as an original action. 4. Chapter 79, Laws 1913, is not unconstitutional as taking private property without due process of law. Ii. The State Railway Commission has jurisdiction under that o order physical connection of telephone lines and exchanges, when the parties fail to agree, it is the duty of the Commission itermine and prescribe the terms and conditions of such con - &gt;n and of the use of the lines so connected, and apportion the se of connecting the same. IJ. The orders of the Commission are presumed to be within jower given by the constitution and statutes, and will not be sed by this court upon appeal unless it appears affirmatively, the evidence in the record, that there was error in the pro - ngs prejudicial to the party complaining or that the Commis - has otherwise exceeded its powers. 17. When appeal from the order of the Commission is taken tly to this court, and the proper bond given, such order becomes final order of the Commission when approved by this court, remedies recognized by subdivision e, Sec. 5, Ch. 90, Laws 1907, lot superseded by such order of the Commission. 13. The evidence in the record is not sufficient to show that &gt;rder of the Commission is impracticable or incapable of execu - or that the Commission has proceeded illegally or has exceeded Dwera in this case. Sedgwick, J. The complainant, Hooper Telephone Company, filed its com - plaint with the State Railway Commission, alleging that it is and for several years past has been operating a public telephone station and exchange at Hooper in Dodge county, and that the defendant, Nebraska Telephone Company, is and for many years last past has been "operating public telephone stations and exchanges and various </seg>
            <seg id="p431">431 telephone toll lines throughout the state of Nebraska, one of such exchanges being at Fremont, Nebraska, which exchange has more than two thousand subscribing telephones connected therewith"; that the Fremont Telephone Company had for several years been doing a similar business in Dodge county and that company and complainant had owned and maintained a country line jointly, am that the Nebraska Telephone Company had purchased the stock o the Fremont Company, and asked the Railway Commission to orde the defendant to connect its switchboard and exchange with the complainant's lines. The Railway Commission heard the evidence and ordered the connection made substantially as asked by the complainant, and the defendant, Nebraska Telephone Company, has appealed to this court. ■'he complainant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the d that this court has no jurisdiction thereof and this presents rst question to be determined. 1. Sections 1, 2, Art. VI, of the constitution are as follows: Section 1, "The judicial power of this state shall be vested in a supreme court, district courts, county courts, justices of the peace, police magistrates, and in such other courts, inferior to the district courts as may be created by law for cities and incorporated towns." Section 2, "The supreme court shall consist of seven (7) judges; and a majority of all the elected and qualified judges shall be neces - sary to constitute a quorum or pronounce a decision. The supreme court shall have jurisdiction in all cases relating to the revenue civil cases in which the state is a party, mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus, and such appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by law." In 1906 an amendment to the constitution was adopted, providing for a State Railway Commission. Since the revision of the statutes in 1913 this amendment appears as Section 19a, Art. V of the con - stitution, and is as follows: "There shall be a State Railway Com - mission, consisting of three members, who shall be first elected at the general election in 1906, whose terms of office, except those chosen at the first election under this provision, shall be six years, and whose compensation shall be fixed by the legislature. Of the three commissioners first elected, the one receiving the highest number of votes shall hold his office for six years, the next highest four years, and the lowest two years. The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." The legislature of 1907 enacted a general comprehensive statute entitled: "An act, creating and denning the powers, duties and qualifications of the State Railway Commission and the secretary thereof and fixing their compensation; defining railway companies and common carriers, regulating the same, and providing the method </seg>
            <seg id="p432">432 the transportation of passengers, freights and cars, including joint through rates and joint traffic arrangements, over and upon the various lines of said railway companies and common carriers in this state; to provide for a system of annual reports by common car - riers; the method of making, establishing and enforcing the general orders of said Commission; defining unjust discriminations; to pro - vide penalties for the violation of the provisions of this act, and to repeal all acts or parts of acts in conflict herewith, and to declare that an emergency exists." Laws 1907, Ch. 90. Section 2 of the act provides for the organization and the powers and duties of the Commission. Subdivision b of that section is: "Said Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and services of, and to exercise a general control over all railroads, express companies, car com - panies, sleeping car companies, freight and freight line companies, and all other common carriers engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers within the state." The Commission also is required by subdivision c to "investigate any and all cases of alleged neglect or violations of the laws of the state by any railway com - pany, or common carrier." Subdivision d of this section provides: "Said Commission shall have the power, and it shall be its duty to make all necessary classifications and to fix all necessary rates, charges and regulations to govern and regulate the freight and passenger tariffs of railway companies and common carriers, the power to correct abuses and prevent unjust discriminations, extortions and overcharges in rates of freight and passenger tariffs on the different railroads in this state, and to enforce the same by having the penal - ties inflicted, as hereinafter provided, through proper courts having jurisdiction." The Commission was given power, by subdivision j, "to administer all oaths, certify to all official acts, to compel the attendance of witnesses, to examine any of the books, papers, docu - ments and records of any railway company or common carrier sub - ject to the provisions of this act, or have such examination made by any person or persons that they may employ for that purpose, to compel the production of such books, papers, documents and records, or to examine under oath, or otherwise, any officer, director, agent, or employee of any railway company or common carrier subject to the provisions of this act or any other person." Sub - division e, section 5, provides: "No railway company or common carrier applying in any court for any temporary writ of injunction or other mandatory order, with reference to any or all of said rates so complained of, shall be entitled to any injunction or mandatory order unless it show to the court that there has been a hearing before said Commission with reference to said rate or rates, within the time fixed by said Commission for said rate or rates to go into force and effect, and shall attach to said application for said tem - porary writ of injunction or other mandatory order, and make the same a part thereof, a transcript of the record of said Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p433">433 which said transcript shall contain a copy of the complaint tiled with said Commission, their decision and findings of fact with reference thereto, and all the evidence introduced at said hearing, which transcript shall be considered by the court in allowing or disallowing said temporary writ of injunction or other mandatory order." tion 7 provides for appeals from the decisions of the Commission, as follows: "If any railway company, common carrier, or any person or persons affected thereby, shall be dissatisfied with the decision of said Railway Commission, affirming, revising, annulling or modifying any rate or rates complained of in said original schedule, or any sub - sequent schedule which may be the subject of investigation or with the decision of said Commission with reference to any rate, classi - fication, rule, charge, order, act or regulation made or adopted by them, upon which there has been a hearing before said Commission, except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, such dissatisfied railway company, common carrier, person or persons, may file a petition, setting forth the particular cause or causes of objection to such decision, act, rate, rule, charge, classification, or order, or to either or all of them, in the district court of the county where the cause of action arose in this state, sitting as a court of equity, against said Commission as defendant. Said action shall have pre - cedence over all other causes on the docket of a different nature, criminal cases excepted, and shall be tried and determined as other civil causes in said court. Either party in said action may appeal to the supreme court of this state, and said appeal shall be at once returnable to said court and said action so appealed shall have precedence in said court of all causes of a different character pending therein; Provided, that if the district court be in session at the time such right of action accrues, the suit may be filed during the term and stand ready for trial after ten days notice." Section 11 provides for enforcing the decision of the Commission: "Whenever any railway company or common carrier shall violate or refuse or neglect to obey any order or orders of said Commission which have been finally established, the commissioner, or any company or person in - terested in such orders, may apply in a summary way, by petition, to the district court of the county in which the violation or disobed - ience of such order or orders shall happen, alleging such violation or disobedience, as the case may be; and the said court shall have power to hear and determine the matter, on such notice to the railway company or common carrier complained of, as the court shall deem reasonable; and such notice may be served on such rail - way company or common carrier, its officer, agents, or servants, as the court shall direct; and said court shall proceed to hear and determine the matter speedily as a court of equity, and without the formal pleadings and proceedings applicable to ordinary suits in equity but in such manner as to do justice in the premises; and to this end, such court shall have power, if it deem proper, to direct and prosecute, in such manner and by such person* as it may ap- </seg>

The legislature of 1911 amended section 7 in an act entitled, m An &amp;ct to amend section 7 chaDter 72 article 8 ComDiled Statutes </seg>
            <seg id="p435">435 of Nebraska for 1909, and to repeal said original section." Laws 1911, Ch. 94. The first part of the former section was retained, but beginning with "may file a petition, setting forth the particular cause or causes of objection to such decision, act, rate, rule, charge, classi - fication, or order, or to either or all of them, in the district court," the following was substituted for the remainder of the section: "may institute proceedings in the supreme court of Nebraska to reverse, vacate or modify the order complained of. The procedure to obtain such reversal, modification or vacation of any such order or regulation made and adopted, upon which a hearing has been had before said Commission, shall be governed by the same provisions now in force with reference to appeals and error proceedings from the district courts to the supreme court of Nebraska. The evidence presented before the Railway Commission, as reported by its official stenographer and reduced to writing, shall be duly certified to by said stenographer and the chairman of the Railway Commission as the true bill of exceptions, which, together with the pleadings and filings, duly certified in said case under the seal of the Railway Commission, shall constitute the complete record, and the evidence upon which the case shall be presented to the appellate court, pro - vided, however, that the time for appeal from the orders and rulings of said Railway Commission to the supreme court shall be limited to three months; and provided further, that in no case shall the filing of a supersedeas bond suspend the putting in force or operation of any decision, regulation, rate, schedule, or order of the Commission of any nature whatsoever, unless such supersedeas bond is con - ditioned and in sufficient amount, to be approved by the Commis - sion, to insure the prompt refunding by the appealing common carrier to the parties entitled thereto, of all charges which such common carrier may collect or receive pending the appeal in excess of those fixed or authorized by the final decision in said cause by the supreme court." This last act, it is insisted, is unconstitutional and void. Sec - tion 2, Art. VI of the constitution, above quoted, prescribes the original jurisdiction of this court. If the jurisdiction which this statute attempted to confer is original, this court cannot have such jurisdiction under the constitution unless it can be held that the "state is a party" within the meaning of that provision. Whether the state may be so far interested as to be considered a party in the sense intended by the constitution although not named as such, or this provision must be taken literally and the state must be actually named as a party, and if the former, whether the state is in fact defending this action of the Commission and so is the real party in interest, are interesting questions in view of decisions of this court in cases such as State v. Pacific Express Co., 80 Neb. 823, and holdings of the supreme court of the United States in the so-called rate cases. We have concluded to place our decision of this motion to dismiss the appeal upon urounds perhaps less difficult although </seg>
            <seg id="p436">436 I entirely free from doubt. The same section of the constitution hich we have just referred contains also the provision that this t shall have "such appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by ' This language is broad and general. The power of the legis - e to enlarge the appellate jurisdiction of this court is unlimited, what did the constitution makers regard as "appellate juris - on" as the phrase is here used? This question is elaborately and ledly discussed in the briefs. In State v. Piper, 50 Neb. 25, 33, the court said: "It is very evident an appeal or proceeding in error will not lie directly to this court to review the decisions of the secretary of state under the Australian Ballot Act, for two reasons: First, no provision is made therefor by the law in question, or by any other statute; and in the next place, the appellate jurisdiction of this court is confined to a review of the judgments and orders made by the several district courts of the state. Neither error nor appeal can be prosecuted from the decision of any other court or tribunal directly to this court." The action was an original one in mandamus to compel the secretary of state to certify to the county clerks the names of certain persons only as nominees for certain offices. There was no question of appeal involved, and the language above quoted was used merely arguendo. If it involved a point necessary to be decided in the case, the first reason given for holding that no such appeal would lie was amply sufficient. It was not necessary to say that neither error nor appeal can be prosecuted directly to this court from the decision of any other court or tribunal than the district court. Cleghorn v. Water - man, 16 Neb. 225, is cited, which decides only that this court can reverse, vacate or modify a judgment rendered by the district court only for error appearing on the record, and does not consider the question of the right of appeal from other courts or tribunals. There is still a stronger reason for not regarding State v. Piper, supra, as authority in this case. At that time the constitutional provision creating the Railway Commission was not in existence, and the statement that no appeal could be taken from any other court ortribunal than the district court could not then apply to the State Railway Commission. Of course, "a state may, by constitutional provision, unite legislative and judicial powers in the same body." Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210. The amendment gives very large powers to the legislature. In providing for general legislation upon the subject of the powers and duties of the Commission it uses the words, "as the legislature may provide by law." It is not neces - sary now to determine whether the legislature could confer the powers of a court upon this Commission. It is sufficient to consider that the amendment introduces a new element into our constitution, and construing the other provisions together with this amendment its purpose and scope must not be limited only as the necessary mean - ing of the whole instrument requires. We must therefore consider t his ponstitutionnl &lt;i me n d mpnt 1 1 spI f in the li ?ht of ol hpr nro visions </seg>
            <seg id="p437">437 of the constitution, and discover whether the legislative construction of its power to allow appeals from the decisions of the Railway Commission is so clearly unwarranted as to require us to hold this legislation unconstitutional for that reason. The words appeal and appellate are words of general application in the law. Ordinarily they refer to the removal of proceedings from one court or tribunal to another for review. In Section 9, Art. IX of the constitution, the word appeal signifies a transfer of proceeding for review from an executive office to the district court. The former decisions of this court would, perhaps, preclude construing the word appellate in Section 2, Art. VI, so broadly. But it is not necessary to do so in this case. Article II of the constitution provides: "The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments, the legislative, executive and judicial, and no person or collection of persons being one of these departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as hereinafter ex - pressly directed or permitted." The last clause of this provision implies that some of the provisions of the constitution expressly direct or permit one department of government to exercise powers belonging to another department. The State Railway Commission is considered as belonging to the legislative department. Has this amendment given it judicial powers? In providing for this appeal the legislature considered that this amendment and the statutes authorized thereby have given the Commission administrative and judicial powers in addition to its legislative powers, the main pur - pose of its creation. It has not attempted to authorize this court to act in a legislative capacity. The decision of the Commission in this case compelling physical connection of these telephone systems is not wholly legislative. Even legislative acts may be of such a nature and so grossly unreasonable as to present a judicial question for the consideration of the courts. But so far as they are legislative the courts in this state have no jurisdiction over them by appeal or otherwise. " Proceedings legislative in nature are not proceedings in a court, within the meaning of Rev. St. Sec. 720, no matter what may be the general or dominant character of the body in which they may take place. * • * The nature of the final act determines the nature of the previous inquiry. * * * And all that we have said would be equally true if an appeal had been taken to the supreme court of appeals and it had confirmed the rate. Its action in doing so would not have been judicial, although the questions debated by it might have been the same that might come before it as a court, and would have been discussed and passed upon by it in the same way that it would deal with them if they arose afterwards in a case properly so called." Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 l\ S. 210, 226. That was an action in the federal courts to enjoin a rail - road rate prescribed by the corporation commission of Virginia. The </seg>
            <seg id="p438">438 mission to the supreme court of the state. The supreme court of the United States held that when such appeal was taken the action of the Commission was not final before the supreme court of the state had passed upon the appeal. That then the rate was fixed if affirmed by the supreme court, and that then action might be brought in the same manner and for the same purpose as though there had been no appeal from the decision of the Commission. This holding was upon the ground that the supreme court of the state was given legislative jurisdiction by their statute providing for appeal, and acted in that capacity in reviewing the action of the Commission, so that the legislation was not complete until the court had acted. This court has no legislative powers, but the same con - clusion is necessary for another reason. The statute providing for this appeal does not expressly require or authorize this court upon appeal to act in a legislative capacity. Our constitution forbids the legislature to confer legislative powers upon the courts. If the statute providing for this appeal necessarily does so, such legislation would be void. The statute must be sustained if it will admit of any reasonable construction in harmony with the constitution. By Section 11 of the act provision is made for enforcing the orders of the Commission when they be - come effective. By subdivision e, above quoted, the remedy of in - junction and "mandatory order" are recognized as existing in - dependently of the remedies provided by the act. Section 7 of the original act, which provided for an appeal to the district court, is the only part of the act amended. That section provided that, when the proceedings were so removed to the district court, that court should be "sitting as a court of equity," and the case should "be tried and determined as other civil cases in said court." These provisions were omitted in the amended section, and in lieu thereof it is provided that the procedure "shall be governed by the same provisions now in force with reference to appeals and error proceed - ings from the district courts to the supreme court of Nebraska." The evidence taken before the Commission is certified to this court, and this court is to act only upon the record so made. The court is to "reverse, vacate or modify" the decision of the Commission. These words are borrowed from the statute which provided for petitions in error to this court in ordinary civil suits, and it seems plain that the legislature did not attempt to give this court any other jurisdiction on these appeals from the Commission. When the decision of the Commission has been "fixed and authorized" by this court upon appeal it becomes the final order of the Commission, so that by this amendment of Section 7 the legislature has not at - tempted to confer legislative power upon this court. We conclude that under the power given to the legislature to provide generally the appellate jurisdiction of this court, in view of the scope and purpose of the constitutional amendment which napA * AA f U a LJ Oil «f A \J /"^ /\W1 ILL |gA| f\ *« A W\ gl * 1| p nAWOf €w\ VOfl t f\ t ilA | ami q| q </seg>
            <seg id="p439">439 Kby that amendment, and the general statutes enacted pursuant at power, the amendment of the statute providing for appeals :ly to this court is not in violation of the constitution. The in to dismiss the appeal is therefore overruled. 2. In 1913 the legislature enacted a statute entitled: "An act compelling all persons, associations or corporations doing a public telephone business in this state to connect trunk or toll lines through their switching stations, and to give and make terminal service to all subscribers from any point in the state of Nebraska regardless of the ownership of lines or routes over which such message or service was received. To provide in what manner same shall be done, and giving certain instructions to the State Railway Commission regard - ing the division of toll charges and the enforcement of the pro - visions of this act, and to provide a penalty for the violation of the same, and to repeal all acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith." Laws 1913, Ch. 79. The first section of the act is as follows: "Any telephone company, corporation, association, person or persons doing a public telephone business in the state of Nebraska shall take the calls or messages coming from any other telephone company, cor - poration, association, person or persons, and so switch and connect its wires that such telephone message from any point in Nebraska may be delivered to any subscriber served by its telephone exchange or switched through, so that any message may be passed on to an - other exchange over such trunk or toll lines as may be available and designated by the exchange or switching station where the call originated, regardless of the ownership of such lines. And such telephone company, corporation, person or persons shall also take calls from its subscribers and public pay stations and pass such calls through its exchange toward destination and over the lines and the route designated by the person making such telephone call if there be competing lines existing between such points. Provided, that in case the person making such telephone call does not designate a route for such message, or that no competing lines exist between points of origination and destination, then the company may by it* operator at originating point, make such designation of route, but calls or messages must be switched through to destination if the point be reached by any connecting wires." The second section provides for maintaining connections when connecting plants or exchanges have been consolidated. Section 3 makes provision for division of toll charges when physical connection is made between plants or exchanges, and Section 4 provides a penalty for violation The appellant contends (a) that the Railway Commission has no jurisdiction of the controversy; (b) that the Commission had no authority to make an order in reference to physical connection be - tween telephone lines as that matter is regulated by statute; t,e) that Chapter 79, Laws 1913, is unconstitutional because it provides f nr t a Ir i n v of nri v3.t f* Di*OD£rt v without due nroo^sn of 1 &amp; w ul* h i ph is </seg>
            <seg id="p440">440 forbidden by the state constitution as well as by the 14th amendment of the federal constitution; id) that the order of the Commission is void for the same reason. It also contends that the order of the Commission is not supported by the evidence and that the Fremont Telephone Company was a necessary party. It is contended that the statute itself fixes and determines the rights of the public and of individuals and has left nothing for the Railway Commission to do in that regard, and therefore the State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction in the matter. It must be conceded that the statute is somewhat indefinite as to the duties of the Railway Commission in the matter. The title of the act, however, recites that one of the purposes of the act is to . give "certain instructions to the State Railway Commission regarding the division of toll charges and the enforcement of the provisions of this act," and section 3 of the act provides that "in case of a failure to agree (upon division of toll charges) the company where the messages originate and the company where the messages destinate shall report to the Railway Commission," etc. It is suggested in the appellant's brief, and per - haps the record discloses, that there are many matters involved in making physical connections of telephone lines which require adjust - ment in detail when the parties fail to agree, and to adjust these matters equitably between the parties would seem to be the proper function of the Commission. In this connection it is also insisted in the brief that the order of the Railway Commission should be reversed because of its indefiniteness in not having made the neces - sary adjustment of the rights and duties of the parties and the expenses incurred in complying with the order of the Commission. The appellant is not in a position to complain of this. It failed en - tirely to bring this matter to the attention of the Commission. Ita answer to the complainant before the Commission was substantially a general denial. It made no attempt to present the issues which it now insists the Commission should have determined and offered no evidence from which the Commission might make such a determi - nation. The appellant contends that the order compelling it to make physical connection with the Hooper Company amounts to the taking of its property without compensation, and, as the statute makes no provision for compensation, it violates both the state and federal constitution in that respect. It is conceded that the appellant is engaged in the carrying on of a general telephone business and operates telephone exchanges located in various towns in the states of Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota; that it owns and operates toll lines which connect the telephone exchanges owned by it in those states, which lines connect with toll and long distance lines and with telephone exchanges owned and operated by other persons and com - panies. It is also conceded that its toll lines can be physically con - nected with the lines of the Hooper Company, but its contention is that the "result of such a connection is to at once Dass to the </seg>
            <seg id="p441">441 Hooper Company as much dominion and control over the toll lines as the Nebraska Company itself possesses and when service is given over such a connection the Hooper Company is in control not only of the toll line but likewise of its operation * * * Telephone lines are operated by an electric current and wherever the line terminates there lies the control of the entire line. But one conversation can pass over a circuit at the same time, and the minute the tele - phone circuit is connected with the switchboard of the Hooper Company the switchboard becomes the end of the circuit and it lies within the power of the Hooper Company to interfere with and control the traffic of the entire circuit all the way between Omaha and Norfolk," and that there is no escape from the conclusion that physical connection with the toll circuit "subjects the property of the Nebraska Telephone Company to certain risks and dangers against which the Nebraska Telephone Company cannot guard because these risks and dangers arise from the fact that the Hooper Telephone Company has the physical possession of the end of the toll circuit." Perhaps we do not fully understand the argument and reasoning upon this point. It appears that physical connection of different telephone lines has been made in many instances without any such direful results. When an individual asks for connection of his private telephone with the toll lines of the company and such connection is made for him, he has the exclusive use of the toll line of the company for a certain time. There is no doubt that if he complies with the reasonable regulations of the company he is entitled to such use of the line, and that the company could be compelled to furnish such use upon reasonable terms and upon complying with reasonable regulations without any greater use of the company's property or any greater danger of injury thereto than in case such service is furnished to a patron of the company itself. If there are inherent reasons for making the distinction which the appellant seeks to make, that fact does not appear from the evidence in this record. The brief does not make it clear that this court should take judicial notice of such conditions. Another contention is that since the order of the Commission includes physical connection with the lines formerly operated by the Fremont Telephone Company that company is a necessary party to these proceedings, without which no such order could be made. It is conceded in the record that the Nebraska Telephone Company has purchased and now owns and controls the stock of the Fremont Telephone Company, except a few shares not nominally held by the Nebraska Company, the ownership of which is not disclosed in the record. Since purchasing this stock the Nebraska Company has transferred the business of the Fremont Company to its own ex - change and is using the lines of the Fremont Company in connection with its own business. It does not appear from the evidence that </seg>

We cannot therefore determine from this d that the Railway Commission has exceeded its powers in pro - ng to a determination of the matter without bringing in the lont Company.

            <seg id="p629">PHYSICAL VALUATION Summary — October 30, 1913, to November 30, 1914 Lincoln, Nebraska, December 1, 1914 To the Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. BIentlemen: The work of your Engineering Department has ed a wide range of activities which have been required by reason e many duties vested in the Commission through the various itive enactments. The state wide physical valuation of steam railroads as of July 1, 1911, summaries of which appeared in your last report, appears here as of July 1, 1913. The amounts reported by the various rail - road companies as having been expended for additions and better - ments during this period have been added to the 1911 valuation to find the values which appear here. There is one exception to this general statement in the item of general expenditures. This account has been estimated on the basis used in the 1911 valuation in order to conform with the statute requiring the reproduction method to be The physical values are shown as usual in three columns. The first column is the estimated cost of reproduction new, the second column is the reproduction less depreciation value in which certain elements of cost, such as Engineering, Superintendence, Rent and Repairs of Equipment, etc., have been treated -as non-depreciating. The third column represents the result when these items are properly adjusted to conform with the condition per cent of the physical property to which the respective elements apply. Cost Data of Steam Railroads. The large amount of cost data collected by this department since 1909 relating to the repro - duction cost of steam railroads has been arranged and classified by account numbers for convenient reference, to conform with the attached summaries. The Division of Physical Valuation of the Interstate Commerce Commission has requested and received copies of the above information. Further effort to collect cost information by this department relating to railroads has not been aggressively - continued for the reason that the Interstate Commerce Commission is expected to value the steam carriers of Nebraska in the near future and the work of the state along this lire would be largely a Stock Yards, Bridges and Crossings. The legislative enact - ments conferring general and various degrees of jurisdiction to the Commission over stock yards, railroad bridges, roadway conditions and crossings have made it necessary to refer many complaints </seg>
            <seg id="p630">630 ■ring these matters to this department for investigation and re - in order that all the facts and conditions may be known to the nission. Electric Properties. The regulation of telephone rates, service and securities by the Commission has required many physical valua - tions and investigations h r this department. The time consumed by each valuation has var. d more with the nature of the problems involved than the magnitude and extent of the property would sug - gest. The expenditures for additions and betterments reflected in new extensions and the rebuilding and re-routing of old telephone lines is constantly taking place to keep step with the increasing demand for service as well as improvements in the class of service offered to the public. This condition makes a physical valuation of many of the properties imperative at the time the applicant com - pany is before the Commission. I. continuous effort has been made to collect telephone cost from companies and individuals actively engaged in telephone uction and operation, and a large amount of material and nent costs have also been assembled through application to a and manufacturers. It is also the policy of the department ike independent cost studies in the field where construction is tgress. The owners of electric light and power properties, including both hydro-electric and steam plants, have been before the Commission for authority to issue and sell their securities in various amounts under the stock and bonds act. Physical valuations have been made in these cases and the essential facts regarding each property have been set out in the written report accompanying each finding. No further values of traction properties have been found, our supreme court having held that these utilities are exempt from the physical valuation law. Irequent calls are made on the department for the physical of railroad, telegraph and telephone properties set out by es and towns. This information is used by county and town &gt;rs. Reports have also been required necessitating studies to line as nearly as practicable the probable value of patents set a basis for the issue of securities. 8 The working force of this department has been reduced to the mum during the last year, largely on account of lack of funds to nue investigations, the results of which would undoubtedly be ilue to the Commission and the public.

            <seg id="p655">BLUE SKY DEPARTMENT Lincoln, Nebraska, November 30, 1914 To the Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Eentlemen: The following report will show the names and ises of companies and their agents to whom permits have been during the year ending November 30, 1914, authorizing them I their securities in this state. A financial statement is also tted, showing the receipts from the permits as provided by id the proper charges to the administration of the Act, although funds received from permits have been withheld from the use Commission. No attempt is made to show the number of conferences and the amount of time required of the Commission and the Special Ex - aminer in dealing with informal applications, which for various reasons are unable to satisfy the requirements of the law. The companies to whom permits have been issued consist largely of domestic corporations which arise from the natural growth and enlargement of legitimate business in the state, while the informal applications made personally and through correspondence are made in a large part by foreign corporations seeking to finance their enter - prises away from home. Very few of these foreign corporations are able to meet the terms of the law, regardless of their financial stand - ing, on account of the provisions requiring that all stock offered for sale to the public, unless specifically exempt, shall have a par value of $100. In many instances this provision has been unfair to the applicant company and to the public as well, when a company in good standing desires to put an attractive investment on the market. It is recommended that the required par value of stock coming within the purview of the law be reduced to $10 to obviate this difficulty. I The applicant companies whose stock is based on the specula - values of undeveloped oil lands, untried patents, mining prospects experimental schemes of all sorts, along with stocks for which bulous net return is claimed, have met with no encouragement the Commission. I Representatives of these enterprises seldom make a formal ication to the Commission to sell their securities, as this would for certain definite financial statements and inventories of prop - but they seek to secure immunity through some technical i« - •etation which might satisfy the language but not the spirit of law. When they are made to understand that any attempt to 1 the law will be followed by investigation and publicity they lly seek more favorable fields of operation. As stated in the last </seg>
            <seg id="p656">656 Bial report, the newspapers have been of great assistance in warn - the public against stock selling schemes that have not complied the Blue Sky Law. » Numerous opinions handed down by the Attorney General have re - d in putting the law on a good working basis. The procedure nnection with investigations has become more or less established known to companies desiring permits. ISo far, the law has accomplished the desired results, and with amendment suggested it should prove of great benefit to the ic. Yours truly, B. E. Forbes, Special Examiner. </seg>
