            <seg id="p002">2 REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL REPORT STATE OF NEBRASKA ADJUTANT GENERALS DEPARTMENT LINCOLN' December 1, 1922. From | The Adjutant General of Nebraska. To: I His Excellency, Painuel R. McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska Subject: Biennial Report of 1921 and 1922 1. In compliance with the requirements of Section 3305, Chapter 34, Article 1, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, the following biennial report for the calendar years 1921 and 1922 is respectfully submitted: LEGISLATION Liberal appropriation was made by the Legislature for the support of the National Guard and for the promotion of Rifle Practice, but the special session of the Legislature deducted $12,000 from our support fund, which is causing some handicap toward the end of the biennium in the perfection of new organizations which are required by the Federal Government. The appropriation for Armory Rental would have been inadequate had it not been determined that the organization of a 155 mm. Howitzer Regiment was not feasible in this State and that it would be utterly impossible to house the equipment furnished such an organization. At the urgent request of the officers and enlisted men of the National Guard, which was augmented by request from very many ex-service officers and enlisted men, a law was passed which takes the Adjutant General's Office out of politics and requires certain qualifications to make him eligible for appointment (see Sections 3305 and 3320, Chap - ter 34, Article 1, Revised Statutes, Nebraska, 1922. PROPERTY The National Guard of this State is now fully equipped with the latest and best Quartermaster, Ordnance, Medical and Signal property and are so equipped that they can take the field at any time of the year without hardship or suffering. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 3 HOUSE ROM, NO. 537, 1919-1 92O Conforming to House Roll 537, 1919-1920, Certificates of Service have been made and mailed to all ex-service men, serving from Ne - braska, whose records have been furnished this office by the War Department. Up to this time approximately ninety percent of the records of enlisted men have been furnished. Very few records for officers and no records for nurses have so far been furnished by the War Department. IUKLK RANGE The Rifle Range at Ashland, Nebraska, is not in condition to use as such at this time. It was the intention of the State to reconstruct this range at the State's expense in order that the annual encampments could bo held within the State. Application has been made to the War Department for funds to construct cement butts, cement target house and for placing the firing points in condition for use, and a survey has been made by a Regular Army Officer, also estimate sub - mitted for the construction of same and we are just in receipt of a letter promising that these funds will be made available by the War Department within a few days now, which will cause a great saving to the State and permit us to hold our annual camps of instruction within the State in the future, which will keep our Federal expendi - tures all at home. REORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL GUARD Since the last biennial report was submitted the organization of the 134th Infantry Regiment, Nebraska National Guard, has been com - pleted and Hospital Company No. 130, motorized, has been organized and equipped. Nebraska's allotment for the year ending July 1, 1923, is one Medical Regiment and one Quartermaster Train. The Quartermaster Train will be equipped and trained as Infantry and will therefore be of special value to the State in case additional Infantry troops are needed within its own borders. ANN1AL ENCAMPMENTS Under the requirements of the War Department it is now necessary to devote fifty percent of the time provided for annual training in target practice and it is therefore necessary to hold the annual field training some place where a target range of sufficient size is available for this purpose. August 17 to 31 inclusive, 1921, the Nebraska troops were trans - ported to Camp Dodge, Iowa. Owing to the fact that this was the </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL first mobilization for the Nebraska National Guard since the World War it was necessary to devote most of the time, when not on the Rifle Range, at target practice in close order work. The morale, spirit and discipline of the troops was excellent and at the end of the fifteen day period a very pronounced advancement had been made as could be seen by the most inexperienced observer. August 14 to 28 inclusive, 1922, arrangements w?re made to hold the annual field training at Plattsmouth, Nebraska, and the Federal Rifle Range was put in shape and made available for the use of the National Guard. The only land available for camp purposes is just east of the City of Plattsmouth and is on low ground which had formerly been the river bed. The soil is of a gumbo nature and a light rain would therefore cause cessation of work for several hours. The Rifle Range is inadequate for a large body of m?n and the results obtained at this camp were therefore not entirely satisfactory, though much progress was made taking the weather and conditions of the grounds into consideration. When not on the Rifle Range, the men were drilled in close and extended order work with the spirit and morale, if anything, a trifle better than the year previous. The In - fantry Regiment has advanced rapidly in the last two years and Hos - pital Company No. 130 was able to erect their Field Hospital at Plattsmouth. thereby giving much organization and amply providin troops in need of same. valuable instruction to this medical ; hospital facilities for any of the Lt. Col. W. A. McDaniel, D. O. the National Guard of Nebraska, troops in the field at both of the L., Senior Instructor, on duty with rendered valuable assistance to the above mentioned camps, as did the corps of Regular Army Officers assigned to us for instructional pur - poses. C. S. ARMY OFFICERS DESTAII.ED TO THE STATE W. A. McDaniel, Lt. Col. Inf., D. O. L., Senior Instructor, and John W. Crissy, Captain, Inf., D. O. L., Instructor, are assigned to the State of Nebraska for instructional purposes by th? War Department. Both of these officers are of great value to this office and render most valuable assistance to the Military Department of the State. DISORDERS WITHIX THE STATE On the evening of January 27, 1922, this office was informed by the Governor that he was called upon for troops to suppress lawless - ness and put down disorder^ in Nebraska City, Nebraska, and territory adjacent thereto and that he was of the opinion at that time that it would be necessary to send troops in, possibly the next day. About nine o'clock A. M. January 28, 1922, this office was informed by the </seg>
            <seg id="p005">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 5 Governor that conditions in Nebraska City were such that immediate Military occupation would be necessary. General Orders No. 4, State of Nebraska, 1922, were immediately issued by the Governor and wired and phoned to the organizations effected, with the result that by 1:30 P. M., Co. A. of Auburn and Co. B, of Falls City, had arrived at Nebraska City and taken charge and by 5:30 P. M. complete Military occupation was perfected. All organizations and detachments s^nt to Nebraska City on this tour of duty conducted themselves in a dignified, soldierly manner and proved to be well disciplined and well trained troops and while con - ditions at Nebraska City were found to be really much worse than expected, the occupation was completed without the firing of a gun. A Military Commission was established and all violations of Military proclamations were tried thereunder. Appeals from the findings of the Military Commission were made to the United States District Court and decisions rendered thereby in favor of the State (findings of the Court attached hereto and made a part of this report). It K( X Â»l MKNDATIONS Owing to the fact that the National Guard is now paid, subsisted, equipped and transported by the Federal Government and that it de - volves upon the State to furnish armories for the respective organiza - tions and armory rentals are high all over the State, it is recommended that the State build its own armories and perfect a great saving thereby. CONCLUSION 1 wish to express my appreciation to your Excellency for the moral support, advice and for the uniform courtesy always extended by you to this Department. The Officers and men of the Nebraska National Guard have given me faithful and loyal support, without which no one can fill such an office as this with satisfaction to himself and credit to the State.

Regulations, to Provisional Infantry Training Manual 1919 (W. D. Doc. 844 1 and to the advisability of laying plans for progres - sive advancement, having in view the training before encampment in those subjects to be carried out in camp. Such as range practice with rifle, automatic rifle, pistol and machine gun (including care and safety precautions in their use); tent pitching; ceremonies; minor tactics, both day and night (including use of patrols, messengers, scouts, advance guards, rear guards, attacks, retreats, outposts, convoys, etc.); and use of special weapons (machine gun, automatic rifle, bayonet hand grenade, rifle grenade, pistol, 37 mm. gun and light trench mortar). (d) The schedule allows but 72 hours armory training for a year, which is wholly inadequate.

As model pay rolls for the period ending June 30, 1921, are being distributed by the Corps Area Finance Officer, unit commanders will not complete their rolls until these models are received. The old separate company designations will be used on the rolls (or this period. 2. Pay rolls to be started July 1, 1921, will bear the new unit designation prescribed in G. O. No. 11, Nebraska, dated June 22, 1921. 3. The following decisions concerning pay are published in ad - vance of the model pay rolls for the information and guidance of all concerned : (a) Date of qualification for enlisted men is the date of the dual oath, except that the date of Federal recognition is the date of qualifications for those belonging to the unit when it was Federally recognized. Date of qualification for officers is the date prescribed by the Militia Bureau in extending Federal recognition to the individual or the unit to which he belongs. (b) Remarks showing promotion or reduction must give order before the date unless the order number is followed by the notation "ad." Example, "Prom. Sgt. fr Corp. O. No. 9, Jan. 31, 1921" or "Prom. Sgt. fr Corp. Jan. 31, 1921, O. No. 9, sd." "Prom. Sgt. fr Corp., Jan. 31, 1921, O. No. 9," cannot be ac- cepted. (c) Each calendar month is considered separately; no credit is given for the fractional part of a drill (1% hrs. ) ; officers cannot draw pay for more than 5 drills in one month and enlisted men for more than 8; and no enlisted man will receive pay for any month in which he has attended less than 60 per centum of the drills prescribed for that month. (d) Each drill is considered separately for the pay of company officers; for pay qualification for any drill at least 50 per centum of the commissioned strength of the unit must attend; 60 per centum of the actual enrolled enlisted strength must attend, except that 60 per centum of the maintainance strength must attend when the enrolled strength is less than the maintainance strength (60 per centum of 65 being required for all lettered companies, Service Co., Regl. Hdqrs. Co., and all companies required to maintain 65% of required strength for those under 65 in tables of organization). </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 19 (e) The inclusive dates he has commanded the company will be shown in remarks on form 367 opposite the Captain's name. (f) Character of drill or assembly at the top of Form 367b should be indicated by "a", "b", "c", "d", etc., in the small space alloted for that purpose and a legent showing the kind of drill repre - sented by each letter placed on the back of the form. (g) The totals at the bottom of 367b should include both officers and enlisted men, but the officers must be deducted from the totals on the last sheet before computing the percentage of enlisted attendance. (h) It is not necessary to eliminate the name and start a new record on Form 367b at the time a promotion or reduction occurs but it is necessary at the termination of the period to give the com - plete record in column of remarks under the new entry at the back of the roll whereby correct payment may be made and the original entry crossed out with red ink and a notation made as to why it was eliminated. 4.

Col. of Infantry, Instructor, N. N. G. STATE OF NEBRASKA ADJUTANT GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT LINCOLN September 17, 1921. General Orders No. 16 The attention of all concerned is called to the necessity for strict observance of the following regulations of the War Department per - taining to the National Guard: 1. Maintenance Strength, X. G. Units: Although Circular Letter 53 M. B., dated August 10, 1921, prescribed that the required per centum of drill attendance be based upon the actual enrollment strength, Cir - cular Letter 48, M. B., dated July 23, 1921, authorizes the Chief M. B. to withdraw Federal recognition from those organizations failing to acquire the minimum active strength within six months after Federal recognition. The minimum active strength required to be maintained is prescribed in Paragraph 1, Circular Letter 31, M. B., dated May 5, 1921, and a variation of but 10 per cent either way is permitted. 2. Physical Examination of Applicants by a Physician Required Before Enlistment: Paragraph 350 N. G. Regulations requires that before a man be enlisted in the National Guard he be sent to a medical examiner, who will make a careful and thorough examination and will state whether he is satisfied that the applicant is within the required age limits and conforms in every respect to the requirements for en - listment. If in the opinion of the medical examiner, the applicant is disqualified in any particular, he will be rejected by the recruiting officer. If doubt exists as to the applicant's age, he will be required </seg>
            <seg id="p029">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 29 to furnish competent proof other than his own oath. Officers enlisting unfit or unqualified men willfully or carelessly are liable to trial by court martial (Pars. 339-340 N. G. Reps.). When a Medical Officer is not available for making the physical examination required before enlistment, any graduate of a Medical School may be secured, the state paying fifty cents for each applicant so examined when a proper voucher is presented. National Guard Regulations â Wearing of Uniform: Paragraph 54 7 prohibits the wearing of the uniforms issued to members of the National Guard except at drill or other official occasions and prohibits the wearing of mixed uniform and civilian dress. Uniforms must be habitually worn by all officers and enlisted men who attend Armory drill or other military formations for the purpose of receiving credit for Armory instruction 4. Actual Participation in Armory Instruction: Section (b), Para- graph 491 N. G. Regulations, permits but one officer, one non-commis- sioned officer and one private of a company or similar unit to be given credit for drill, at a diill period, for work other than participation in the drill or other instruction. Actual participation for not less than one and one-half hours, exclusive of rests and interruptions, is required ot all other members of the unit in order to be entitled to drill pay. Maximum Monthly Pay Drills: The (5) pay drills referred tc in the last two lines of Circular Letter 51, M. B., 1921, and the note at the bottom of the first pace of G. O. 15, Nebraska, 1921, apply to company officers and field officers. Captains and Lieutenants not be- longing to organizations are on a monthly pay basis and must attend not less than four ( i) drills or satisfactorily perform other equivalent duties each month to be entitled to the four-thirtieth of the monthly base pay of their grades as prescribed in the Regular Army.

General Orders No. 18 The attention of all concerned is called to the importance of the following: 1. Standards of Physical Kxnmination: Sp^ial Regulations No. 65, W. D., having been superseded by A. R. 40-105, for the examina - tion of applicants for entrance into the National Guard, the latter will be strictly observed. 2. Mobilization of the National Guard: Special Regulations No. 55, W. D., having been supersÂ°ded by Cir. 3, If. B., W. D., dated Nov. 18, 1920, pending a revision of the former, it is desired that each individual officer have a copy of the latter and a copy be on file at thf&gt; headquarters of each unit. Sufficient copies have been dis - tributed for this purpose, but if any officer is without a copy request should be made to this office for one. 3. Riot Duty: Carefully prepared lectures on riot duty should be given all units, based on Military Protection (W. D. Doc. 882) and a Treatise on Riot Duty by Col. Bellews. 4. Records: The condition of the records of most units were reported as unsatisfactory at the time of the encampment, especially as regards completeness and accuracy. Attention is invited to Par. 346 N. G. Regs, and Sec. 93 Act of June 4, 1920, in connection with the Annual Armory Federal Inspection, which occurs soon after the beginning of the new calendar year. 5. Courts-Martial System: Although the Manual for Courts- Martial. U. S.

Re-;s. 1919, govern as to pun - ishment limitations for National Guard units, not in Federal Service, rather than the provisions of the Courts-Martial manual. </seg>

O. 15, Neb., 1921. The following alternative course is prescribed, to be conducted by the State Instructor if there is a hitch in the functioning of the Training Center Course: Jan. 1 to Feb. 28, 1922: Riot Duty â Military Protection, W. D. Doc. 882 (Page 62, War Dept. Doc. No. 974). Mar. 1 to April 30, 1922: Guard Duty â M. I. G. D., W. D. Doc. 466 (see Page 50, W. D. Doc. 974). May 1 to June 30, 1922: Infantry Drill â I. D.

Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, 1922: Minor Tactics â (Page 229, Vol. 1, Wal - dron and I. D. R., to be studied in connection with map problems). (b) NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS' SCHOOL School for non-commissioned officers and specially selected pri - vates, first class, to be conducted in each unit at least twice per month (except for July, August and September) in the subjects found in the two volumes of Waldron's Platoon Training, (Manual for N. C. O.'s and Privates and other Service manuals to be used whenever necessary as supplementary text books when there are not sufficient of the former). The subjects will be given as a correspondence course, under the direction of the unit commander, if it is found impracticable to conduct armory sessions. In either case, certificates of proficiency should be given to individuals when they actually complete and really become proficient in the different subjects. In order to coordinate non-commissioned officers' school with the preparatory course for a Reserve Corps Commission (soon to be announced) the following allotment of subjects is prescribed: Jan. 1 to Feb. 28, 1922: Interior Guard Duty and Military Cus - toms (M. I. D. G., Waldron and Chapters 1 and 7, N. C. O.'s Manual). March 1 to March 31, 1922: Military Hygiene â Pars. 45 to 78 and 565 to 616, Field Service Pocket Book (W. D. Doc. 605). </seg>
            <seg id="p041">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 41 April 1 to June 30, 1922: Drill Regulations (including practical demonstration in conducting the drill, explanation of movements be - fore executing them and correction of errors after execution). Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 1922: Topography (including practice in con - struction of scales; making of road sketches and contoured positions, and In the reading and use of maps and sketches) â Grieves' Military Sketching and Map Reading. 3. The services of Instructors and Sergeant-Instructors should be used to the greatest extent possible. Although they have no authority for giving orders and commands in a disciplinary way, there are no objections to their giving drill commands as assistant to the National Guard Instructor, acting as guide at drill or as member of a group requiring team work, (such as signalling, patrolling, tent pitching, transmission of messages, etc.). . Their commands and demonstrations, however, should be considered as being given for the purpose of imparting the knack of the idea to those who are later to give the same commands or demonstrations. For this reason as many officers and non-commissioned officers as pos - sible should be present. In no case should the drill be turned over to the Federal Instructor while school for the National Guard In - structors is being conducted elsewhere. The work of the Instructor or Sergeant-Instructor is to exemplify and is not to be continued along any particular line (except to advise) after the ability to give the necessary commands or demonstrations has been mastered by the National Guard instructor. Skill in the giving of certain commands and demonstrations, can be obtained only by repeated practice; among those of that class are those for physical drill, close order drill, bayonet fighting, tent pitching and small arms firing. Service in the Regular Army is supposed to have Imparted that required skill. W. A. McDANIEL, Lt. Col., Inf., D. O. L. Instr., Inf., N. N. G.

The health of the entire command was almost perfect, and the rations were beyond criticism. There was practically no interference with the civil ad - ministration, and the functioning of the civil courts was not suspended by the Military authorities. The activities of the Intelligence Section and the Military Commission were energetic, but always conducted with order, regularity, impartiality and dignity, as attested by the fact that in a habeas corpus proceeding instituted In the TTntyed States District Court for the District of Nebraska, the proceedings and sen - tences of the Military Commission were in all things affirmed by the Court.

            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 242 Hugh Seymour and Ernest Watson having appealed from the finding of the military commission to the United States District Court in and for the District of Nebraska, Lincoln Division, the following memoran - dum opinion of the Court is published for the information of all concerned: MEMORANDUM OPINION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, LINCOLN DIVISION. United States on relation of Hugh Seymour, Plaintiff vs. Edward H. Fischer, Sheriff, et al, Defendants. No. 374 Law. United States, on relation of Ernest Watson, Plaintiff vs. Edward H. Fischer, Sheriff, et al, Defendants. No. 374 Law. Munger, D. J. These are applications for writs of habeas corpus by two persons who have been committed to a term of imprisonment in a county jail of this state. The facts leading up to the imprisonment are as fol - lows: The go\ernor of the state had issued a proclamation declaring the existence at Nebraska City of a state of lawlessness and disorder beyond the control of the civil authorities and that the local officers had applied for military assistance to be placed in control of that territory for the restoration and maintenance of law and order. The proclamation therefore declared the territory to be subject to martial law and ordered the national guard of the state to occupy the terri - tory for the purpose of restoring law and order. After the troops were in possession of the territory, the governor authorized the appointment of military commissions to try offenses against the public peace and violations of any military rules and regulations. Each of the petitioners was charged with violation of some of these regulations, one, in retaining in his possession arms, equipment and munitions of war, and the other in keeping openaprohibited place of business, and each was found guilty and sentenced, and the commit - ments are in pursuance of these sentences. The petitioners were not employed in the military service and were citiz ens of Nebraska City. Th state courts at Nebraska City were open during all the time of mili - tary occupation. After the petitioners had served a portion of their sentences, the governor issued a proclamation reciting that violence and disorder had ceased at Nebraska City and he therefore terminated martial law and withdrew the troops. The chief claim of the petitioners is that their continued imprison - ment violates the due process of law guaranteed to them by the Four - teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, (1) be - cause martial law did not exist at the time of their alleged offenses; </seg>
            <seg id="p243">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 243 (2) because the military commission had no power to try them, and (3) because sentence by the commission could not outlast the period of military occupancy. Due process of law depends upon circumstances and varies with the sub ect matter and the necessities of the situation, and imprison - ment of citizens by the military commander may be lawful in some cases, Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U. S. 78. Art. 4, Sec. 14, of the Ne - braska constitution, makes the governor commander of the military forces of the slate and authorizes hi nito call out the militia to execute the laws and suppress insurrection. Sec. 3904 of the Compiledl Stat - utes of Nebraska (1913) authorizes the governor as commander-in-chief of the militia to employ it in the defense or relief of the state or any part of its inhabitants or territories and gives him all the powers neces - sary to carry into effect the provisions of that chapter of the statutes. Sec. 3913 of the same chapter provides that the militia may be called into service in time of war, invasion, riot, rebellion, insurrection, or reasonable apprehension thereof, and Sec. 3916 authorizes the gov - ernor to proclaim any portion of the state in a state of insurrection whon in his judgment the maintenance of law and order will be pro - moted thereby, and the militia are employed to aid the civil authority. Under such powers the governor may make the ordinary use of soldiers to suppress insurrection and his declaration of the existence of a state of insurrection is conclusive. Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U. S. 1; United States v. Wolters, 268 85 Pac. 190; State v. Brown, 71 78; Luther v. Borden et al, 7 How Fed. 60; In re Moyer. 35 Colo. 159 W. Va., 519, 77 S. E. 243; Ex Parto McDonald, 49 Mont. 454, 143 Pac. 947 Was the proclamation of the governor the declaration of a state of insurrection, or were the military forces called into service merely as aids to the civil officers for the purpose of assisting them in enforcing the laws? The proclamations do not use the word "insurrection," but the condition described of lawlessness and disorder beyond the control of the civil authorities and the declaration of martial law, are equivalent to a declaration of the existence of that organized resistance to authority known as insurrection, In re Charge to Grand Jury, 62 Fed. 828; Alleghany County v. Gibson, 90 Pa. 397. When a state of war or insurrection exists and the governor has legally called into action the military forces of the state, the will of the commander becomes the controlling authority in the occupied ter - ritory so far as he chooses to exert it, subject to the laws and usages of war. New Orleans v Steamship Company, 20 Wall. 387; United States v. Diekelman, 92 U. S. 520; Luther v Borden, et al, 7 How. 1; United States v McDonald, 265 Fed. 754; In re Egan, 5 Blatchf. 319, Fed. Cas. 4303; Commonwealth v. Shortall, 206 Pa. 165, 55 Atl. 952; </seg>
            <seg id="p244">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 244 40 Cyc. 383, 390. As said by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U. S. 73, of the powers vested in the governor to suppress insurrection: "That means that he shall make the ordinary use of the soldiers to that end; that he may kill persons who resist, and, of course, that he may use the milder measure of seizing the bodies of those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring peace. Such arrests are not necessarily for pun - ishment, but are by way of precaution to prevent the exercise of hostile power." Does the military power in the occupied territory which is de - clared under martial law extend to the trial and punishment of of - fenders against regulations made by the military commander? Some cases are cited in support of the proposition that the military forces can do no more than to arrest and detain offenders against the laws of the state until they can be delivered to the civil authorities for trial, upon the restoration of peace and order. (Franks v. Smith, 142 Ky. 232, 134, S. W. 484; Ex Parte McDonald, 49 Mont, 454, 143 Pac. 947). No doubt the commander may avail himself of the courts as a means of trial, but he may also institute tribunals during the emergency to deal with offenders in the district. The Grapeshot, 9 Wall, 129; New Orleans v. Steamship Co., 20 Wai. 387; United States v. Wolters, 268 Fed. 69; Winthrop on Mil. Law (2nd Ed.) 1295, 1301; Davis on Mil. Law 308; State v. Brown, 71 W.

This is especially true of offenses against the military regulations, such as these petitioners committed, acts which are not offenses against the laws of the state. In cases of military occupancy during war or insurrection, the pass - ing of the military lines by persons without permission, the possession of arms and ammunition, the sale of intoxicating liquors, may cause the commander th eloss of a battle and yet these acts may not offend against the local laws. The usage in time of war has been to make regulations covering offenses in violation of the laws of war or of military discipline. Winthrop on Mil. Law (2nd Ed.) 1310, 1311. Can the sentence of imprisonment by such military tribunal be continued after peace is declared? This question has not been the subject of many reported decisions. The power to punish serious of - fenses by imposition of the death penalty is well understood and the lesser punishment of imprisonment for life has been sustained. Ex Parte Oritz, 100 Fed. 955. It is stated that during the civil war such military commissions acting under the authority of the United States held trials and entered judgment in more than two thousand cases. Winthrop Mil. Law (2nd Ed.) 1302, and that sentences of imprisonment for terms of years and for life were imposed (id 1313). See also Davis on Mil. Law 313. In cases of serious offenses, it is </seg>
            <seg id="p245">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 245 not doubted that the sentence of imprisonment may continue during the war or insurrection. If the punishment is inflicted but a few days before the establishment of peace, it would seem absurd that sen - tences, otherwise just, should at once expire. While the necessity for crushing of further resistance may have passed, the reason for continuance of sentences therefore given has not ceased. The power of the military commander to make a lease of enemy city property extending beyond the termination of the war was sustained in New Orleans v Steamship Company, 30 Wall. 387. The conclusion is, that assuming the acts of the military court to have been done in accord - ance with the laws of the state, there is nothing in the exertion of this power which contravenes the right of due process of law guar - anteed by the Constitution of the United States. The rule on the defendants to show cause why the writ of habeas corpus should not be issued will be discharged. MEMORANDUM ON TRIAL OF CIVILIANS BY MILITARY COMMISSIONS From the Experience of Nebraska National Guard in Military Occupation of Four Mile Precinct, Including City of Nebraska City, In Otoe County. Nebraska. From Jan. 28. 1922 to Feb. 15, 1922, Nebraska City, Nebr., April 5. 1922. From: E.irl M. CUne, Major, 134th Inf., N. N. G. To: Whom It May Concern (Care Adjutant General of Nebraska): Subject: Memorandum on Trial ot Civilians by Military Commissions. Introductory Note. For the benefit of officials who may be hereafter charged with the duty of the maintenance of Martial Law within any prescribed District of tha State of Nebraska, and thereunder the trial of civilians by military com - r.iipsions, and subsequently the defense of the acts of such military com - missions, I note herewith a few matters relative to the experience of the Nebraska National Guard in sucl' matters, in the occupation of Four Mile Precinct, .ncluding the City of Nebraska City, all in Otoe County, Ne - braska, from January 28 to February 15, 1922. Declaration of Martial Law. In view of the litigation which subsequently took place regarding the validity of the proclamation of the Governor, creating Martial Law, in </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 246 the above described District, it seems to me that any subsequent proc - lamation of a Governor of Nebraska declaring Martial Law should be dif - ferent In some respects than the proclamation of the Governor of Ne - braska, dated January 28, 1922. This proclamation describes a condition oi insurrsctior; v. itliout actually denominating it as such. The proclama - tion declares Martial Law unequivocally, but it seems to me that if this occasion ever arises again, that the proclamation of January 28, 1922, should bo fo'lowod in this respect, and that also the proclamation shoul-J incorporate the evact words of the constitution and the Revised Statutes of Nebraska in the proclamation itself. By that I mean, the words "in - surrection, riot, etc., as used ind the constitution and statutes should be incorporated in the proclamation. Reference ia made in this matter to Article 4 Sectior. '4 of the Constitution of Nebraska, and Sections 3904. 3913, 3916, Rfeviset- Statutes of Nebraska, 1913. Except lor this point, the proclamation ot January 28, 1922, is considered sufficient. It was deter mined sufficient by Federal District Jundge Munger in the cases of the I'nited States of America ex rel Watson vs. Fischer, et al, and the United States of America ex rel Seymour vs. Fischer, et al, but I believe, tha* foilowlog the constitution and statutes, as above suggested, will eliminate in any mture proclamations any danger of the proclamation being de - clared insufficient. Proclamation of Military Commander. Martia! Law in a Military District is the will ol the Military Commander in that District. The proclamation ot Lieut. Col. Douglas, as Military Commander of Four Mile Precinct, dated January 28, 1922, is no doubt legally sufficient, on all matters covered therein. It is suggested, how - ever, that paragraph 6, relating to the countinuance of civil Courts bo c'ir.iiraud iroin publication, although such Courts continue to function as usual. Martial Law o! the character invoked at Nebraska City is an a'.soiu;- rora or Martial Law. A military District is created. The civil Courts do not function, except where permitted by the Military Com - mander. The civil Courts are not open, to take jurisdiction of cases, ot v.:-.ich the Military Commander wishes to take cognizance. Paragraph 6 o : ' th" proclamation ol' Lieut. Coi. Douglas, permits the raising in any - subsequent legal proceedings of the question of whether the civil Courts were actually closed. It seems to me that paragraph 6 should eithor be &lt;&gt;: litt d or that a rtat^ment should be made to the effect that the civil Courts are closed as to all cases which th.? military commander may, ir. exercise of his powers, determine properly within his jurisdiction for th.&gt; purposes of the military occupation. It is p.lso suggested that the validity of any proclamation depends upon its publication to interested parties, and that hereafter publication be </seg>
            <seg id="p247">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 247 proved by affidavits of newspapers publishing proclamations, and by affidavits 01 parties distributng proclamatons, such as that of Lieut. Col. Douglas, and that these affidavits be kept in the proper military files. To illustrate what I mean in this regard: If the litigation, growing out of the Nebraska City cases, had been carried to a higher Court, and it had become necessary to prove publication of the proclamation of Lieut. Col. Douglas, publication of the same in the two Nebraska City news - papers could, of course, be proved, but distribution of the proclamation by the persons actually performing the act would now, after this lapse of time, be more difficult, and no doubt, later on, practically impossible. Governor's Proclamation Creating Military Commission. The effect of Judge Monger's Decision in the Watson and Seymour cases, and his opinion as expressed during those trials, might indicate that the proclamation of the Governor, dated January 30, 1923, was un - necessary because if martial law were legally established, the inherent right to try persons violating the rules and regulations would go with such establishment of martial law. However, the proclamation of the Governor, dated January 30, 1922, leaves no question on this point, and also leaves no question on the point of the right of the Military Cor mander to take cognizance of infractions of the laws of the State of We - braska, necessary for the purpose for which military occupation is main - tained. This proclamation is considered sufficient and may, I believe, be safely followed in all respects. Order Creating the Court. The special order of Colonel Thomas, No. 14, dated February 2, 1922. is a necessary part of the procedure creating a military commission for the trial of civilians. Paragraph 1 is considered sufficient in all respects, as is also paragraph 2. In connoot'on with paragraph 2, it may be stated that my invest igntion of military commissions, in connection with the Seymour and Watson cases in the Federal Court, convinced me that military commissions for the trial of civilians should never be composed of less than three members. Winthrop on military law states this to be I he universal custom. For this reason, it seems to me that paragraph 3 is a bad paragraph, and that the three members of the commission should !&gt;p present when trial is had, or if it is desired, to allow cases to proceed to trial with only a majority ol the commission present, that the com - mission should be composed of at least five members. Attention is again directed to the fact that the commission appainted in special order No. 14, was composed entirely of men admitted to practice law in Nebraska, and that this fact gave that commission standing and prestige generally, and made it easier to defend the findings of such commission. The Charge Sheet. Th^ charge sheets as used in the Nebraska City cases are considered </seg>
            <seg id="p248">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 248 sufficient in all respects. However, it is to be emphasized that too much haste was shown in the preparation of the same. By that is meant, the filing in of the information in the blanks. Numerous errors are to be round in this respect. The charge sheets should be very carefully scrutinized by an officer of legal training before the same are served, to eliminate any of the errors, now found on the charge sheets, in the Nebraska City cases. Attention is also called to the fact that it is very vital for these charge sheets to show service of the same upon counsel for the accused, if he has one, and this also illustrates the necessity of having it show frequently In the record that the accused had counsel. It is suggested that if another such occasion ever arises that the blank forms for charge sheets be printed, and not mimeographed, and it will thereby be easier to keep a correct and good appearing record oi the case. The endorsements on the charge sheets are considered satisfactory and sufficient. Military commissions being military Courts, and endorsements should follow as nearly as possible the procedure of Courts Martial. At - tention Is particularly directed, however, to the endorsement of the Gov - ernor on each of the charge sheets, with the view that an Improvement may be made in this respect. As these endorsements now read, they begin as follows: "Reviewed, February 14, 1922." It will be recalled by officers connected with the occupation at Nebraska City, that this re - view by the Governor, or appeal to the Governor, was had at the request ol some of the several defendants. It is suggested that where this is the case that after the word "reviewed," that these words be added "Raviewed by the Governor of Nebraska, on appeal and request of the defendant , February 14, 1922." Not all of the Nebraska City defendants appealed, and of course, in such cases, such insertion could not be made, but in cases where such appeal was perfected at tho request of such defendant, such insertion is considered advisable for ihe following reason: Such appeal would show, in a measure, submis - sion to and acknowledgement of the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the Governor, as proper reviewing officer of the judgment of the Court. This particular point did not come up in the Seymour and Watson cases, but xjc considered raising it, had the cases been appealed, and it seems to me that R is a point worth considering, and desirable to make the record absolutely clear upon it. Attention Is also directed to the fact that the endorsements of he Governor show appearances, of counsel, this being for the purpose of showing that there was an actual hearing by the Governor, and that his approval was not merely a perfunctory or formal matter. Proclamation Terminating Martial Law. The proclamation of the Governor, dated February 15, 1922, terminal ing Martial Law, in the District created, is considered sufficient in all respects. Attention is invited to the fact that this proclamation by the </seg>
            <seg id="p249">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 249 Governor as Commander in chief of he military forces of the State, commands the Sheriff to retain the prisoners in his hands until the ex - piration of iheir sentences. This also appears in the endorsement of the Governor on the charge sheet, which makes it serve as an order of com - mittment. As in the Nebraska City cases,, copy of the charge sheet with all endorsements thereon, of all prisoners, should be served upon the Sheriff, and his receipt taken, not only for the prisoners, but for the charge sheets, which are his orders of committment. Procedure in Writ of Habeas Corpus. II upon the termination of military occupation, application is made for writ of habeas corpus, as in the Seymour and Watson cases, proper re - turn to the application for the writ must be made. To draw such a return in the short time generally allowed, is a matter of some difficulty. Reference is therefore made to the answer and return of the respondents lo petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the cases in the District Court of the United States, for the District of Nebraska, Lincoln Division, en - titled United States of America ex rel Watson and ex rel Seymour vs. Fischer et al. These returns are considered sufficient. In the prepara - tion of such returns, it was considered necessary to set out a complete history of the military occupation, and of the particular prisoner for whom the writ is applied. Legal Propositions Involved in Habeas Corpus Action in the Watson and Seymour cases, it appeared that the following legal propositions were involved, and the following references were submitted by counsel for the respondents to Judge Munger in support of the legal - ity of the trial, conviction and the imprisonment of Watson and Seymour. These references are herewith noted for the benfit of any one who sub- sequently is obliged to meet the same issues as appeared in those cases. The opinion of Judge Munger is exhaustive and convincing and forms the basis for a valuable precedent in this kind of litigation. 1. The Governor has the power 1 to call out the military forces of the state to suppress riot, disorder and insurrection. The state possesses the inalienable right of protection and self preservation from the acts of lawless persons, banded together, when local civil authorities are inadequate to put them down.
