         <seg id="p008">STATE OF NEBRASKA ARSON INVESTIGATIONS The year 1940 made arson history in Nebraska. It was not because of, the great number of convictions, 18 against a peak of 24 in 1937, but rather because of the detection of a ring that has baffled the office for ten or more years. Also the year has been outstanding because of the high degree of cooperation with other state and local officials. In the course of 64 investigations in 38 counties, county sheriffs ably assisted in 33 fires, county attorneys helped in 7. More than 44 firemen, including the arson squad at Omaha and the fire inspector at Lincoln, were very helpful, also 19 police officers, two special investi - gators from outstate, four state officials and five representatives from the fire marshal's office. All fires of questionable origin were investigated. It is noteworthy that they were fewer than in recent years. No women were seriously under suspicion. Six boys confessed to setting three fires and their cases were referred to juvenile courts. There were two fires charged to insane per - sons who were committed to asylums. Ten men were sentenced to 24 years in the penitentiary or reforma - tory. Three cases are yet pending and one man was acquitted for lack of evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt." The value of property in volved in fires of unknown origin was $782,957, with insurance for $461,980 and estimated loss of $294,683. Thirty-three mutual insurance companies were interested and 44 stock fire companies. Twenty-four fires were rural and 40 were in cities or villages. Of the 64 questionable fires it was certain that 21 were intentional, with eight others highly suspicious. Eleven seemed to be accidental or the results of carelessness, while two were traceable to faulty electric wiring, two to natural gas, four to lightning and the same to spontaneous com - bustion. In 12 cases there was insufficient physical evidence to make an intelligent guess as to origin. Thurston Elevator Plant On the morning of July 20, Sheriff Elliott of Thurston county tele - phoned that an attempt had been made to burn the Heyne elevator at Thurston. All but one foot of fuse had burned but had gone out before reaching a plant of gunpowder, gasoline, and oily rags. Early suspicions were dismissed as the investigation proceeded. Finger prints were identi - fied as belonging to a former convict in the Missouri penitentiary. The sheriff of Burt county had a rumor through a jail inmate. A filling sta - tion operator at West Point had overheard part of a conversation among strangers. There was a car with a Sarpy county license, some stolen hogs, a retrieved farm tractor and a weird widow of South Omaha —all with slightly related parts in the picture. </seg>
         <seg id="p009">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION After two months of patient work by many cooperating law enforce - ment agencies the story unfolded. Oliver, Al, and Lee Watson confessed that over a period of years they had been setting fires for Walter Mose - man, head of a lumber and grain corporation at Pender, for stipulated fees. In the Thurston case they had taken along Lee Jasper, the man who left his fingerprints, to burn the rival elevator at Thurston. Con - fronted with the 'proven facts Walter Moseman, along with the Watson brothers and Jasper, confessed. The community in which he had grown from a boy to a wealthy leading citizen was amazed. Social and financial influences were brought to bear but to no avail. Walter Moseman, the Wafsons, and Jasper are paying the penalty in the state penitentiary. Too much credit cannot be given to the local and state officials who con - tributed toward developing the evidence in the most outstanding arson case ever tried in Nebraska. But especial credit goes to Deputy Frank Baldwin for his persistent efforts against discouragements and frequently flagging interest-of his associates. All fires of unknown origin are not even presumed to be incendiary. The fire marshal's office is as much interested in proving that a barn fire resulted from spontaneous combustion of uncured hay as in proving that it was set on fire to collect insurance or for enemy malice. That is the chief reason firemen or citizens should carefully observe evidence before it is.destroyed.in the fire and call the Lincoln office immediately for assistance." ; . •. • ¦ NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM The prairie states are reluctant to feel the serious side of fire pre - vention when contrasted with the industrial centers. Yet it must be ad - mitted that food! stuffs and raw materials are as essential as munitions. Millions of dollars worth of wheat, corn, wool, hides, and grains are in bonded storage in elevators, storehouses, and private granaries of Ne - braska. All have an important place in state and national economics. All are subject to fire losses whether through accident, arson, or sabotage. Upon firemen rests the responsibility of protection. ... In industrial states programs of mutual aid are being developed so that the fire fighting facilities of neighboring towns are available in case of .'.'great fires.- The practice is cheaper than purchasing rarely needed apparatus for possible emergencies. In those states an inventory of all extinguishment equipment and available man-power, is. on file with the state fire marshal's office. Nebraska fire departments are notably co - operative, but perhaps the degree of cooperation may be further developed. </seg>
         <seg id="p010">STATE OF NEBRASKA VOLUNTEER FIREMEN SCHOOLS, j Six regional schools were planned for March 4 to 12, 1940, but the Tecumseh date had to be abandoned because of weather and roads. j! At Norfolk 47 departments were represented by 237 firemen. At Ainsworth there were 88 men from 16 towns, at Alliance 94 registrations from 16 departments. At McCook 92 firemen came from 16 towns and at Fairbury 23 departments were represented by 109 volunteers. In all there were 619 firemen from 118 departments. j The programs were quite informal and generally in response to indi - cated local needs. In each case there was an inspection of a building with planted hazards which laid the foundation for the proven fact that careful inspection averts fire hazards. Also a hypothetical fire was fought by setting up size and location of a residence, with a known wind and weather condition, stated fire equipment and personnel, exposures, water . j supply, etc. ] J. Burr Taylor and Chief Harry. (Smoky) Rogers were furnished j by the Western Actuarial Bureau of Chicago as instructors. Secretary ! Beals of the sponsoring League of Nebraska Municipalities had charge of . registration. Charles Martin, an Omaha fire insurance man, gave a demonstration of common fire hazards and afforded an attractive enter- j tainment in magic. ! State-Wide School at Grand Island Three days, April 22, 23, and 24, were given over to a state-wide fire school at Grand Island. A large attendance was not encouraged but 55 departments were represented by 219 actual volunteer firemen. The course offered at the regional schools was expanded by daily inspections for hazards, by hypothetical and actual fires on each day. A volunteer department with chemicals extinguished a fire in an iron clad garage, another group of volunteers with a selected chief put but a fire in a brick building with a booster line. On the third day a heavy fire developed in the basement of a mattress factory. A 750-gallon pumper was manned by a department of hastily recruited volunteers under an experienced chief. Gas masks were invoked as well as rescue work and penetrating lamps. First aid was demonstrated. There was an address on arson investigation. The chemistry of fire was discussed and a demonstration of the hazards of hot tractor fuel handling was made by state experts. Smoky Rogers and J. Burr Taylor came from Chicago without ex - pense to Nebraska to have general charge of the instruction work. Local i </seg>
         <seg id="p011">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION assistance was used in conducting out-of-door evolutions with -water streams, ladders, and small tools. Chief John Townsend of the Minne - apolis Salvage Corps conducted demonstrations in salvage. There were demonstrations of gas masksj and resuscitator by dealers in attendance.

The emer - gency has developed a cheap trailer-pumper which experience is proving to be successful, jit is being- urged for many.small communities that are not justified in purchasing a booster truck. ¦ '-.

'¦¦.'¦ The Nebraska Compensation Court holds that a volunteer fire depart - ment is an arm of the city government and that firemen are rated as city employees. As such they come within the compensation laws for acci - dents while in line of duty. The mayor and council may, by resolution, ordinance, or by {letter, instruct the fire chief to use his judgment in taking men and equipment out of the corporate limits, thereby insurance follows. There shall be a system developed under authority. A single fireman who rushes into the country without knowledge or consent of mayor, chief, or captain is assuming his own responsibility. . If firemanship is to assume the dignity that it merits in all com - munities, company officers and men should be selected who are repre - sentative citizens.! Fire prevention and fire: extinguishment are serious responsibilities. I The Nebraska Volunteer Firemen's Association is considering active sponsorship of future regional fire schools, thus relieving the state fire marshal of the responsibility and treasury drain. </seg>
         <seg id="p012">STATE OF NEBRASKA HOME INSPECTION BY SCHOOL CHILDREN Continuing the project of "Home Inspection by School Children", an inspector visited twenty-one schools of the smaller towns in Lan - caster, Johnson, Nemaha and Richardson counties during Fire Pre - vention Week. Fire hazards about the home were discussed before the high schools and sixth, seventh and eighth grades, usually in one body. Special em - phasis was placed on dangers of careless handling of gasoline and tractor fuel and starting fires with kerosene and tractor fuel. Home inspection blanks were distributed to the pupils to take home and, with the help of their parents, fill out and return to the teachers. The teachers were asked to analyze the reports and use them for a fire, prevention lesson. Blanks for making a summary of the reports were furnished the teachers and these were sent to the office of the State Fire Marshal. A check of the reports shows that about eighty per cent of the blanks were returned to the teachers, and all but two of the schools I reported to the State Fire Marshal. In the schools visited, from sixty - five to ninety per cent of the pupils live on farms. ! The home inspection blanks contained ten questions. Below is f. given a summary of the replies received by the State Fire Marshal. Yes No 1. Is there an accumulation of paint or greasy rags j in the house or outbuildings? 5% 95% 2. Have the chimneys been cleaned this fall? 57% 43% 3. Do stove pipes pass through attic or ceiling 35% 65% 4. Are unused stove pipe holes covered with metal caps? 99% 1% 5. Are floors under stoves protected by metal? 76% 24% . j 6. Are ashes piled against buildings? 1% 99% 7. Are gasoline and tractor fuel kept in ALL-RED containers? 83% 17% : 8. Is kerosene or tractor fuel used to start fires? 55% 45% 9. Is gasoline used to clean clothes? 22% 78% 10. Name all of the fire hazards about the house and outbuildings. Special attention should be given to question 7. Article 66-107. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, provides a penalty of </seg>
         <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT .OF FIRE PREVENTION not more than $50 fine, or imprisonment in the ounty jail of not more than ninety days, for putting gasoline, benzine or other such high ex - plosive oils in any but red containers with the name "GASOLINE", "BENZINE", or. whatever name such explosive is known by, printed in large letters. The same penalty is provided for putting kerosene in any such marked containers, and the penalty 'applies to both buyer and seller alike. The reports show that seventeen per cent of the people disregard - this law. The importance of its observance is indicated by the fact that twenty-six people were burned to death in Nebraska during 1940 by the careless handling of explosive oils, and ninety-five others were seriously, burned. Because of the volatile character of hot tractor fuel, it is classed with gasoline. Replies to question 8 show that there are many people using kerosene and tractor fuel for starting fires. PLANS FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS APPROVED The department has examined and approved plans for twenty-three public buildings, such as school houses, auditoriums and theaters, as to exits and seating facilities. This work has been done upon the request of architects arid local;authorities. While there is no law requiring the ' approval of plans before the building is constructed, the law definitely does require that the state fire marshal shall see that the exits in public buildings are adequate and accessible. ¦-;¦" The tendency is for bulk storage of "gasoline to be moved from rail trackage to uptown sites with resultant hazard to the business or resident sections of towns. Village councils should provide in advance against dangerous, locations which will result in increased insurance rates. ; Beatrice is the latest city to enact a complete new code of ordinances which adopt by reference all the laws and regulations governing the. state fire marshal's office, ¦ ;¦¦;' A few Nebraska fire'departments are incorporated.. That fact does not free them from control by the city adtninistration or state laws.' Their only; advantages accrue as to ownership of property. i </seg>
         <seg id="p014">STATE OF NEBRASKA ' RURAL ELECTRICAL INSPECTION BUREAU DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION ¦ The Rural Electrical Inspection Bureau has had its third year as an • auxiliary service of the Department of Fire prevention. The bureau's | primary function is to inspect electrically wired farmsteads on the REA power lines. It was set up in November, 1937, at the request of farm patrons of the power districts in operation at that time. Since then each new district that has organized has requested this inspection service. The inspection bureau is self-supporting and operates solely on a free basis without profit. During the past year there were 3,939 original / inspections and 599 re-inspections on farmsteads that were wired for the first time or converted from farm lighting plants to 115-230 volt service. There had been requisitioned and inspected 9,935 farmsteads up to the first of the year. In 1,450 cases errors were discovered and re-inspec - tions made before clearances were issued. Visual inspection is not con - sidered adequate and testing meters are required to be used in all cases. With these testing outfits, it is possible to determine dangerous conditions ; in the wiring installations that may, otherwise, be overlooked. The j amount of load on each circuit is checked along with high resistance conditions, reversed polarity, open conditions, cross feeds, series, and short circuits. Service and distribution panels receive special attention to determine their adequacy, that they are properly installed, and free from all defects. Proper fuses are required on all circuits for adequate protection. The fee collected for these inspections is $3.50 for each original in - spection and $1.00 for the re-inspections required. The inspectors re - ceive $2.50 for the first inspection and the $1.00 for the re-inspect on. One dollar goes to the office for supervision, office expense, and equip - ment. During the three year period 34 training schools were held to, in - struct wiremen and prospective wiremen on the fundamental principles as set up by the National Electric Code. These schools were usually three-day sessions and acquainted the wiremen with the requirements necessary to pass inspection according to the code. Chas. M. Horham, Chief Inspector, has had full charge of these schools, which were made possible through the cooperation of the Vocational Education Depart - ment. During 1940 the inspection work was carried on in 27 districts which includes 40 different counties of the state. The following table shows the number and type of inspections made in the different rural public power district for the three years the inspection bureau has been in operation. </seg>

         <seg id="p016">STATE OF NEBRASKA RURAL FIRE PROTECTION The law as passed by the 1939 legislature for organizing rural fire protection districts is again printed for reference. It has proven highly successful where tried and results are already apparent from reports on file. Twenty-one districts have been organized and most of them are in actual operation, although some have not yet raised enough tax money to pay for equipment. Without exception fire departments have done the active work in organization. They are volunteering their services and are maintaining the equipment. The latest to file petition is Blue Springs. Interest is keen at Firth and Minatare. Equipment adapted for rural tire fighting has been purchased in sev - eral communities through donations by interested farmers. Some of the smaller cities are still reluctant about furnishing rural protection. Perhaps Grand Island leads in wide farm service and in assistance to neighboring towns. In very lew cases are charges for services attempt - ed by volunteer companies. Nearly eighty percent of values involved in farm fires result in total loss as against a corresponding loss ratio of less than seven percent where fire protection is available within municipalities. Nebraska's chief industry, farming, merits every protection possible. ORGANIZATION OF RURAL FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS Legislative Bill No. 336 Section 1. A majority of the electors of any district, territory, neigh - borhood or community in the state of Nebraska, which is equivalent in area to one township or more, outside of incorporated cities and towns,' are hereby authorized and empowered to form, organize, establish, equip and maintain rural fire protection districts for the protection of their lives and properties against damage or desruction by fire, and to dissolve such rural fire protection districts. Sec. 2.

         <seg id="p019">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION _ , , . , _ , _____ __ , , _ . . LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS i ¦ ¦ ' -'¦. ¦¦ The valued policy law which has long been on the statutes was enact - ed to discipline insurance companies for over writing fire insurance. Therein it was intentioned and has served some purpose. But inasmuch as it admittedly encourages incendiarism, the evil results seem to outweigh the purposed good. In adjusting fire losses tax liens should be recognized by law sub - stantially the same as mortgage clauses. The law should be amended providing for condemnation of tax in - cumbered properties if they are actually community fire hazards and have been so declared by state or local authorities. 1 A code of safe electric wiring should be established by law through the acceptance of the National Electric Code as best evidence of good practices. -..- A state law regulating the use of fire works would be of assistance to municipalities which can not regulate sales.of firecrackers outside city limits. Compressed gas systems are coming into general use in the state but without authority of any regulatory state agency. Inefficient installations offer tremendous life and property hazards. ;-.. Motorized transportation of volatile fuels has become the divided re - sponsibility of the state railway commission, the agricultural department, the labor bureau, the highway patrol and the fire marshal's office. Ade - quate regulations have been adopted by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission but there is no police power to enforce thefn within Nebraska. Tractor fuel is an unclassified hazard and outside the statutes. The tax on premium income of fire insurance companies for the support of the department of fire prevention is inadequate, discriminatory, and confusing., No revenue system can do : even-handed justice. Law enforcement. can not be measured by advantages accruing to individual companies. j -',-.. ;1 </seg>

SCHOOL HOUSE FIRES There were jtwelve school house fires during 1940; seven of them ; were rural and five in cities and towns, with a total loss of $63,622. About three-fourths of the loss was covered by insurance. In six of the rural schools, there was a total loss of building and contents. Two boys confessed to setting fire to their home school be-, cause they did riot want to go to school. It is supposed that two other buildings were set afire but the cuplrits have not been apprehended. These two buildings burned on the same night, the fires starting within an hour and only eight miles apart. On the morning of January 14, at 12:30, fire broke out in the school building at Friend. It is not known whether the cause was from spon - taneous combustion in the coal bin or defective electric wiring. Very cold weather with drifting snow handicapped the firemen and the build - ing and contents were completely destroyed. The loss was given as $40,000 with $29j000 insurance on building and contents. . -r ANALYSIS OF RURAL FIR^ Rural fires !to the number of 404 were reported by fire chiefs from 78 counties. In 60 per cent of the number of fires, there was a total loss. Fifty-two per cent of the value of the property was covered by insurance. The: amount of loss not covered by insurance totaled $247,892, or 31 per cent of the value of the property involved. Insurance companies reported 1,451 rural claims paid amounting, to $599,227. The losses reported by insurance companies do not represent the actual losses paid for fires that happened during the year 1940. Insurance companies report losses as they are adjusted during that period. The'losses paid amount to 23 per cent of the insurance carried on the "property. . | . ¦¦¦ • - ' ¦;•' - • ¦'. . ¦¦':.:. •':•:' \ ' '¦¦'•¦ Ohiowa volunteers have purchased a used truck and developed a good fire rig that is doing good 'service on rural calls.

         <seg id="p032">STATE OF NEBRASKA Cheap construction of buildings and equipment is causing many fires in Germany that are not attributed to incendiary bombs. A million dollar shipment of imported silk went through Nebraska on a single train. Careful fire protection was afforded in transit. The first of the year, 1941, finds four Nebraska county seat towns without organized fire protection. But Hayes Center is interested. Farmers should not undertake to purchase and own fire trucks. Organized fire departments in the cities and villages should own, maintain, and operate the rural equipment. National Defense is taking many firemen through conscription and volunteer enlistment. Chief Bob Van Fleet of Hastings is captain of Company G, Infantry, at Fort Benning, Georgia. A recent opinion by the Nebraska attorney general holds that a present serving volunteer fireman, or one who has retired after five years of faithful membership, may be excused from jury service. Some firemen and some village officials have been embarrassed be - cause of careless issuance of five-years service certificates. Tax exemption is not a subject to be lightly treated. Automobiles driven by firemen have no privileges over other traffic except on errands in connection with fires and in proveable emergencies pertaining to firemanship. </seg>
