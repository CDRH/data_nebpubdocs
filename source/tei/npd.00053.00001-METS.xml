In order to make all Dcpart- ore uniform, this liit nnium was in 1921 made by Examining Ilo;it Athletics i: 3111111 ion h. Department an made possible by State rulea and regulations made in accordance with \ V.tn of Sessions Uws of 1919 A short summary of the activities of each Bureau will be given hen eferred to that made to the Secre- Directors HEALTH. At the beginning of the biennium, this Bureau consisted of six di- visions, the sa preceding biennium. However, the Legisla- ture of 1921 by appropriations made possible the establishment of a Child Hygiene Division and this was organized July 1. 1921. This work was carried on by one Public Health Nurse and one clerk stenographer until the acceptance by Governor McKelvie of the Sheppard-Towner funds, February , 1922. Plans for the disbursement of these funds were made immediately following acceptance, but on account of the delay necessary in, getting the same actually in our hands, very little work was accom - plished before Jun« so, the close of the biennium. Plans were fully made for the employment of four experienced public health nurses, three of </seg>
            <seg id="p013">10 these will be attached to the Division of Child Hygiene, with one of them working in conjunction with the Visiting Nurses Association in Douglas County, and one attached to the Child Welfare Bureau. On account of Nebraska being accredited and placed within the Reg - istration Area of the Federal Government for births and deaths, the Di vision of Vital Statistics has been somewhat enlarged and is now doing a much more effective work than ever before. Expansion in the Division of Laboiatories has been necessary on ac - count ot increase of work. Thirteen hundred tests were made in 1918 and over twenty-lour thousand in 1921. No charge is made for making tests. thus giving to every person in the State the best of laboratory service. Child Welfare. This second biennium of the Child Welfare work for the State was attacked with a working knowledge of the problem gained by two years of earnest effort to find the greatest need in a state wide way of the children of Nebraska and to take the hardest work first. We have workeil in city, village, and country communities and in isolated places that can scarcely be called communities so far removed are they. It has been ■ large part of the activities of the Child Welfare Bureau to deal with homeless and worse than homeless chilcren and work lor the best pos - sible environment and conditions for the dependent, neglected, abused, defective and delinquent children of Nebraska ; always trying to cling to, build, and use the natural home of the child where these children should be raised to good manhood and womanhood under proper supervision Every neighborhood should feel that the destiny of its own unfortunate children is in the hands of the best peop.e of the home community. Some parts of Nebraska are yet very pioneer and the work is han to reach but the automobile, the daily mail carrier, and the telephon are doing their work and no place is inaccessible to those who real! want to find a way to help. Social Service. The inspection of State, Charitable and County Institutions has been carried on by special inspectors and members of the Bureau of Child Welfare. So many of these institutions affect the children that we thot best to have them inspected by this Bureau. The Department has so little power to compel the cleaning of jails and lock-ups, that little real good can come from inspections until a Legis - lature sees fit to give some state official power to condemn jails and lock-ups close them promptly and keep them closed until proper, </seg>
            <seg id="p014">11 clean and adequate jails be supplied. I find many jails still in use, which were condemned years ago, and no change has been made in the conditions. Why? Because our present law has no power granted the Department to compel a change. Recommendations are useless without power to enforce Examining Boards. Here is centralized the records, and licensing of ten of the professions M Mate. Over 300 complaints have been investigated and adjusted, brought for practicing without license. Five of theaa were lound "not guilty," and lines paid in six cases; the others are now pending on appeals. Nine hundred twenty-nine persons were licensed ing the last eighteen months. Annual renewal fees are collected from five professions: Dental, ; Chiropractor, $2.00; Pharmacy, $1.00; Optometry, $1.00; Enibalm- f. $2.00. All fees thus collected are used in keeping the records, at - ldance by Board members to National Board Mee ings, making investl- irrying on necessary work of that profession. I believe It the advantage of all professions to have reewal fees, provid - ls.-d entirely for the necessary work in keeping records and standards of the profession. Athletic*. ulations, and a lull and complete set was made up and ready when the Law went into effect July 27, 1921. This was a bill presented and spon - sored by the ex-service men of the World War, and the Department, by appointment as Commissioners and Inspectors, placed upon their should - ers the responsibility of assisting in cleaning up the sport in this State. The rules have been rigidly enforced. The "fixer" and "cooker" have been entirely eliminated and and complaints of dissatisfied audiences reduced to the minimum. Swearing, smoking and betting are eliminated and all crowds have been unusually orderly. So carefully has the physical examination been conducted that but one bad accident has resulted In over 300 contests. State Racing Commission. The Legislature of 1921 created a State Racing Commission whose duties are to promote the horse breeding industry and supervise racing A law legalizing boxing and wrestling was enacted by the Legislature and its enforcement was placed in the hands of the Department. io\vi-r was delegated to the Department, in the making 01 rules and .1 lifl! &gt;l kluc-h </seg>
            <seg id="p015">12 1 ! v other than at State and County Fairs and Agricultural Associations. Th Governor appointed the Commission, but the Law provides that they mak a biennial report to this Department. Rules and Regulations wer adopted by the Commission and were strictly enforced, reducing th&lt; number of undesirable horsemen to the minimum. Owing to the part cular provisions in this Law, the report will show activities up to am including November 30, 1922. On the whole, the work accomplished by the Department of Publi Welfare has been more than gratifying to the Secretary. The exceeding! practical manner in which the work has been carried on, the untiring el forts of those who have toiled night and day to meet problems confronl ing them, and the true loyalty displayed by every member at all time has been the only means by which surh telling results could be accon plished by so few people. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">DEPARTMENT PUBLIC WELFARE 13 BUREAU OF HEALTH I. H. Dillon. M. D., Chief of Bureau. During the year ending November 30th, 1921, tne State's public health •ettritiea were administered by the following Divisions: Administrative offk-e. Division of Epidemiology, Division of Vitai Statistics, Division or \ cnereal Diseases, Division of Sanitation and the Division of Laboratories. The Division of Child Hygiene and Public Health Nursing was organised July 1st, 1921. The Administrative office of the Bureau was charged with general rvMaa of the work of the entire Bureau, with promulgating and en- ing Rules and Regulations for the control of contagious diseases ant he prevention and abatement of sanitary nuisances, with the administra - ion oi the law providing for the physical inspection of all of the schoor n of the state, with the preparation and distribution of bulletins jflets throughout the state furnishing information on the various health subjects. The Rules and Regulations which became effective July 19th, 1913, were coniinued in force unchanged until September 20th, 1921 when some WM were necessary. These were published and distributed in of a supplement amending the 1919 Rules and Regulations. The report of the physical inspection of the school children of the e of this year were as follows: Total number of children enrolled in the districts reporting 159,960 Total number of pupils examined 148,560 Number of pupils found with defective eyes 21,988 Number oi pupils found with defective ears '5,712 Number of pupils with defective nose and throat 34,951 Number of pupils found with defective teeth 65,505 It is impossible for this Bureau to carry on any active follow-up work in connection with these defects. However, in thirty counties of the state the Red Cross have one or more community nurses working who were able to do a great amount of follow-up work and their reports In - dicate that quite a large per cent of the defects were corrected in those counties. </seg>

Official notice from the Bureau of Census, admitting Nebraska into he Registration Area for births was received December 11, 1920, the satisfactory test having been completed by two representatives of the "ensus Bureau, who estimated, after searching and checking the reports n tlu» DiWsion of Vitai statistics, that Nebraska was receiving better ban Sii'r birth registration. On September 13, 1920 the state was ad- into the registration area for deaths n gaining admission into the registration area, Nebraska was red to file 'ranscripts of all birth certificates with the Bureau of tis, for which, a fee of 3c per copy was to be paid to the state. For 1920 and 1921, the Division of Vital Statistics received from the ?au of the Census. $2,411.37. The amounts, being received at various n transcripts were sent to Washington, were credited to a cash und. from which lund, a transcriber at |70 per month was paid. The ■emaining money is applied upon rental of the Hollerith equipment. The Hollerith inadiines. however, were not installed until June 9, 1922, but a contract for the equipment was made during December 1921. months ot 1921, arrangements were made with the S Bureau of Omaha to furnish clippings of births from the entire Such clippings are received twice a week, and are used as a check iKainsi certificates tiled. Nine hundred follow-up letters to the parents. id beca reported through the clippings, but no certificate I ound in the files, were sent. Through this source of information about hree hundred certificates were secured. This plan is a salutory means this Division has a way whereby secured, therefore th*&gt; plan \sa a birth certificate, and notifying the ijuaintins the physicians that knowledge of unreported births are two fold value, that of securing the physician of his delinquency Much energy has been expended tion. While the law requiring the rej in the way of publicity to registra - istration ot births has been in effect for the past seventeen years, still many parents do not know of Its ex - istence, or benefits. This Division has secured the third decennial revision of the Inter - national List of Causes of Sickness and Death. The list, in conjunction May F. Hyland, Director of Division. </seg>

Special attention has been given the editing of causes of death, compiling figurts on infant mortality and maternal deaths during the year 1921. Still greater re - search and study, such as analysis of rales, making of charts, should be given all figures which are compiled by this Division, so that statistics would mean more than a compilation of figures. From experience in the work, it would seem a practical and logical plan to have in the personnel of the Division, or in the Bureau of Health, a field agent, whose activities might be in connection with some other Division or Bureau. By personal contact with the local registrars, learn ing conditions in certain communities, the field agent could relieve the Division of much correspondence from MM ol which, it is now impos sible to secure the necessary information I During the period of time from December 1, 1920 to November 30. the tollowing certified copies and letters were issued by this Dion: Corrections on birth certificates by request of parents 761 Additional data required letters „ 1,180 General information letters 849 Packages of supplies sent physicians and registrars 1.328 Packages of transportation permits sent licensed embalmers.... 134 Disinterment permits issued 185 Letters to undertakers requesting death certificates 260 Letters to delinquent undertakers 600 During the period of time from December 1, 1921 to June 30, 1922. thf following certified copies and letters were issued by this Division: Certified copies of birth certificates Issued 20} Certified copies of death certificates issued 144 &gt;rtifled copies of birth certificates issued 307 307 copies of death certificates ls-iued 197 197 Certified copies of marriage certificates issued 6 6 Certified copies of divorce certificates issued 1 &gt;tters to physicians requesting birth certificates 4«r, Requests for birth verification for school purposes 26 Requests for birth verification prior to 1903-1904 4 Letters and name cards sent to mothers 14,141 Certificates of registration sent to mothers .... 23.567 </seg>

These 335 supplies make public water available to a large per cent of the total population of the state so that a large responsibility is placed on the 335 operators in maintaining a supply that is always safe for domestic use. Practically all of these water works are owned by the municipalities, there being but five privately owned plants in the state as far as we can find. In checking over reports of analysis made by the Laboratory for the first ten months of 1922 we find 370 samples submitted from private sup - plies for analysis. Of these 160 or 43.5% have shown contamination to such an extent that recommendations were made for purification or th" use of the well discontinued. During the same period 183 samples sub - mitted irom railroad supplies, of which 46 or 25.2V, failed to pass the drinking water standard, 48 samples from schools and other institutions of which 19 or 39.6% were unfit for use and 493 samples from public sup - plies The publir supplies showed 115 or 23. 3 r / r ot the samples con laminated to such an extent that an investigation was advisable. Where possible visits were made to these places and sanitary surveys made with view of locating source of trouble and recommendations made for im- vement. In every case recommendations were made and a method or isi'ncv puriflcsition suggested.
