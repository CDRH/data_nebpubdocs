Section 6781 — Boundaries of Division One: K'ater division No. 1 shall consist of all the lands of the state by the Platte River; and also all other lands lying south of the and South Platte rivers that may be watered from other superfi - subterranean streams not tributary to said Platte River." Section 6782 — Boundaries of Division Two Kater division No. 2 shall consist of all lands that may be watered e Loup, White, Niobrara and Elkhorn Rivers and their tributaries other lands of the state not included in any other water division." For convenience in the adjudication of claims and in the distribution of water these divisions have been subdivided into twelve water divisions denominated 1-A, 1-B, 1-C, 1-D- 1-E, IF; 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, 2-D, 2-E, 2-F, as shown on the accompanying map. </seg>

            <seg id="p008">8 IRRIGATION. During the past biennium, we have been favored with a good supply of water for irrigation purposes on the North Platte River. In the early part of the season of 1911 a shortage was felt for a short time, due partly to the lateness of the spring rains and the cool weather in the mountains, holding back the melting of the snow. This shortage oc - curred during the latter part of May and the early part of June. The Pathfinder Reservoir was being filled at this time by the United States Reclamation Service and the shortage was partly due to the fact that the needs of the canals on the North Platte River were under-estimated. The local representatives of the Reclamation Service did everything in their power to correct this condition at once and it lasted for only a short more than that the water which was stored in the Pathfinder gervoir in excess of the needs of the Government project was turned down the river during the months of July, August and September, thus giving the canals in Nebraska an ample supply of water throughout the months of July, August and part of September, when the natural flow tthe river would have furnished less than one-half the amount of ter needed. E season of 1912 on the North Platte River was more favorable tion for the reason that the snow fall in the mountains during W of 1911 and 1912 was a great deal above the normal, and that all during the irrigation season was also above normal. The Pathfinder Reservoir was filled during the early spring to very nearly its capacity and the outlet gates were later opened up and during the entire irrigation season the river ran bank full, by far exceeding the use of all irrigation ditches along the North Platte and Platte Rivers, including the North Platte Reclamation Project, and water running throughout the river the entire length of the State. The flow of the river at Bridgeport did not drop below 5000 cubic feet per second from July first to November first, while 1500 cubic feet per second, passing Bridgeport, would have amply supplied the needs of all the irrigators east of that point during the past season. The Gov - ernment Reclamation Service charged nothing whatever for the use of all this storage water. The above conditions demonstrate clearly the fact that with the Pathfinder Reservoir to supplement the natural flow of the river all of the irrigable lands in this valley can be furnished with water and a shortage will be unknown. The present administration has </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage 9 Bimes been highly in favor and encouraged the buying of storage n the Pathfinder Reservoir by irrigation ditches along the North River for supplemental appropriation. The United States Gov - t passed a law permitting this and the Secretary of the Interior me limit of January 1, 1913, by which time all applications for the ;e of storage rights in the Pathfinder should be on file with the nent of the Interior. To arouse more enthusiasm during the past summer in the purchase of storage water rights the North Platte Cham - tr of Commerce ran a special train from North Platte over the Union cific to Gering. Notwithstanding these facts, however, the ditch companies have been slow to take advantage of this opportunity and only a few have made application for the purchase of water at this time, but it is to be hoped that an extension of time will be granted by the Reclamation Ser - vice in which the ditch companies may make such applications. Ethe last few years the North Platte Valley has forged ahead very in intensified farming. The second largest beet sugar factory United States has been built at Scottsbluff. Thousands of tons ot re raised annually in this valley and delivered to this factory. CThe raising of sugar beets, potatoes and other crops have necessi - ted the irrigation of the same during the months of August and Sep - tember when the normal flow of the river is very low. Without the use of storage water to supplement the direct flow of the river appropria - tions now held by the canals, it would be impossible to raise and irrigate these kinds of crops. It is this imperative need of storage water that will soon confront the irrigators along the North Platte River. Under the present conditions, much of the land being held in large tracts, it is impossible for the entire area of irrigable land to be brought to the highest state of production. This can only be accomplished by decreasing the size of the individual farm, the ideal unit being about eighty acres. If all the land susceptible of irrigation in the North Platte Valley in Nebraska could be brought to its highest state of cultivation, it seems probable that with the assistance of the Pathfinder Reservoir practically the entire flow of the North Platte River could be utilized, and this valley made the most productive section of the state and the most productive irrigated section in the United States. During the past season, this office has made actual field exam - ination and surveys of all the canals throughout this valley and the land irrigated thereunder, which disclose the fact that there are now 600,000 acres subject to irrigation lying under canals which are already con - structed and in most cases ready to serve the land; but the surprising fact which this work revealed was that only 230,000 acres were actual - ly being irrigated the past season. Nearly all of these canals are in operation to some extent and all of the canals can be put in first class operating condition at a very nominal cost. It would seem from these facts that instead of spending large sums of money to develop new enterprises at a very high cost per acre of </seg>
            <seg id="p010">I i i ! ! ! - </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage 11 land actually irrigated that new inducements and encouragements should be given toward the development of the land which now has ditches built to supply water to the same and only lacks the proper management and insured water supply to put the same in the list of intensified farm units. Aa the country develops and the farmers acquire experience in irriga - tion, the duty of water will be materially increased. It is a fact that by actual measurement one of the largest projects in the state in the season of 1911 delivered to the land more than five acre feet of water per acre. In my judgment, the greatest amount of water actually needed for irrigation purposes under the most intensified farming methods should be -limited to two and one-half acre feet per acre. The canal companies should each maintain a satisfactory headgate and measuring device near the head of the canal, as required by the Irrigation Laws, and also have a competent canal superintendent, whose duty it should be to turn out the water to irrigators, as they need the same, and keep a careful record of the amount of water in acre feet applied to each piece of land. This data would be of great value to the farmers throughout the irrigated section, and allow them to arrive more closely at the exact amount of water needed for the different crops, and the greatest duty that can be derived from the use of the water. Kreral tracts of land in this valley have become seeped because of of too large an amount of water for irrigation purposes by the and the carelessness of the irrigators themselves. ehis condition is constantly growing worse by reason of the com - 1 of high line canals and the irrigation of the tablelands thereun- The surplus water from over-irrigation on these higher lands is illy finding its way back to the river through the sub-soil, and is slowly but surely raising the water table on all the low-lying lands in this district. In practically all of the towns along the river, the water table is now so close to the surface of the ground that the maintenance of basements is impracticable. This condition can only result in making the soil alkaline and rendering it unfit for farming purposes until some drainage system is installed. It is impossible to lay the blame of the seepage -upon any one canal for the reason that the water appears in greatest quantities on the low-lying lands close to the river, or what is ordinarily known as the first bottom. It would therefore seem that in order to curtail this seepage question a more careful use of water for irrigation purposes be exercised and of not applying any more to the land than is actually needed for beneficial use, as the continuance of care - lessness and extravagant use of water for irrigation purposes is fast working a hardship upon the owners of the low lands. The only limit which our laws put upon the amount of appropriation per acre was from 1895 to 1911, one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of land arrigated, running continuously through the entire irrigation season. The legislature of 1911 amended this law, placing a limit of three acre feet of water per acre in the aggregate during one calendar year. </seg>

            <seg id="p014">14 Report of State Engineer It is recommendd that this section be further amended, limiting the amount of any appropriation to two and one-half acre feet in the aggre - gate during one calendar year for each acre of land which any appro - piration ' shall be made to cover. The irrijrators on the small streams, both in the northwestern and southwestern portions of the State, have suffered to a certain extent from a shortage of water, but since many of them secure their supply from streams whose flow is intermittent, this condition will always prevail un - til provisions are made for the proper storing of the flood waters, and also the natural flow of the streams outside of the irrigation season in NMTToirc. Too much stress cannot be laid upon the benefits which can be de - rived from such storage reservoirs. A notable example is the Kimball Irrigation District, located on the Lodge Pole Creek in Kimball County. This Lodge Pole Creek is a small stream fed by springs and having a very small normal discharge. The Kimball Irrigation District by the construction of their reservoir have secured a water supply sufficient to irrgigate 12,000 acres, and this from a stream whose normal flow doe* not exceed fifteen cubic feet per second and for a considerable part of the irrigation season is much less than this. Inhere are also many valuable reservoir sites along the Frenchman and Stinking Water Creek in the southwestern part of the State, •l fact, on nearly all the small streams within the irrigated territory. question of storage reservoirs brings up the proper construction of The present irrigation laws require plans for all dams more than ten feet in height to be approved by the State Engineer, but no penalty is attached to the construction of such dams without having obtained such approval. This law should be amended, so as to provide a severe penalty for the construction of any dam without having obtained the State En - gineers' approval, and the limiting height of ten feet should be stricken out. A notable example, which demonstrates the need for such a penalty is found in the hydro-electric plant which was constructed by the City ot Valentine for municipal lighting purposes. Power was to be obtained by means of a dam thirty feet in height across Minnechaduza Creek. The plans for this dam were presented to the office of the State En - gineer and were disapproved. Notwithstanding this fact, the City pro - ceeded to let the contract, the dam was constructed, the plant was com - pleted and the reservoir filled with water. The action of the State Engineer in refusing to approve the plans was justified by the fact that the dam failed as soon as the reservoir was filled and before the water had been turned into the wheels at all. The accompanying cuts illus - trate fully the weakness of the design and the manner in which the failure occurred. ■Jp to within the last few years very few diversion dams have been by irrigation ditches, but of late the increased value of water has sitated the building of these diversion dams and the controlling </seg>

In order that the rights of all appropriators can be protected, it is necessary that the designs of all diversion dams le construction of the same be approved by the State Engineer's and I therefore wish to emphasize the above recommendations. Elie ideal way of handling an irrigation canal is under the irriga - listrict system. Up to within the last two years, there were very rrigation districts in this state, but during the past biennium many e older canals which have been operating for many years hav* 1 ;ed from a mutual company or corporation into an irrigation dis - formation. Under a mutual company or corporation it is impossible to get the co-operation and enforce the use of the water by the people under the canal and the payment of maintenance dues. Under the district forms tion, however, the lands included within and under the district, and which are susceptible to irrigation are specifically described and bonds are voted for the purchase of the canal and water rights for the land. Interest and principle on these bonds, together with the maintenance tax for the operating expenses for the district are collected by the County Treasurers of the County in which the canal is located, and the delinquent taxes in this way become a lien upon the land the same as any other county or state tax. In this way every land owner who has land included in any dis - trict must pay his share of the taxes and maintenance and operating ex - penses of the canal. When a person is compelled to do this he is going to use the water and get the best results therefrom that it is possible to obtain. This insures the early development of the lands in any Under a mutual company or corporation a non-resident land owner may refuse to buy water rights and refuse to develop his holdings, but simply sit back and allow his land to increase in value, while the ad - joining resident land owners are working hard and improving their own holdings, and are thus assuming all the risk that there is to be taken. This is unfair and leads purely to speculation which should be avoided as far as possible. Many mutual companies have failed by reason of these non-resident land owners refusing to buy water and develop their lands. Emong the old canals which have lately come into the irrigation t formation or are at present proceeding to change to this sys - f operation are the Nine Mile Canal &amp; Reservoir Co.; Short Line tion Co.; Culbertson Irrigation and Water Power Canal Co.; Mc- Irrigation and Water Power Co.; Tri-State Canal Co.; Belmon; Co.; Alliance Irrigation Canal &amp; Water Power Co., and the North Irrigation and Land Co. Ksre has been only one large irrigation project built in the state the last two years. This is the Kimball Irrigation District, lo - 1 Kimball County, near Kimball, Nebraska. </seg>

The actual normal flow of this stream II compared with other streams in this state, and yet there is I irrigation on Lodge Pole Creek compared to the amount the creek, than there is on any other stream in the state. g'he Kimball Irrigation District built a large dam directly across ! Pole Creek, forming what is now known as the Oliver Reservoir, ocation of this dam was picked because of the natural lay of the it this point. High bluffs coming down on both sides of the stream id an ideal place for the dam. The dam itself is forty-five feet in height, forty-nine hundred feet in length, and is composed of earth with inside slope of one and one-half to one, and outside slopes of three to one in the main part of the dam. The inside or water face of the dam is faced with reinforced concrete to protect it from the wave action. I wo canals extend down the valley, one on each side of the creek, ming all of the irrigable land to a considerable distance on both of the town of Kimball. The Oliver Reservoir was completed on nber 8, 1911, and enough water stored to furnish water for irriga - urposes to all the lands which were available and ready for irriga - uring the past season. The bonds of the Kimball Irrigation District were ready for the market just after the bottom had fallen out of the irrigation securities in the summer of 1910. It is a deplorable fact that irrigation securities are hard to dispose of for the reason that so many wild cat and promo - tion schemes have been attempted and pulled off in irrigation lines. It is a noteworthy fact, however, that no Nebraska irrigation project has S failed, in its payment of bonds. This is largely due to the laws i we have in this state and the general state supervision given espe - to irrigation districts and in fact to all irrigation enterprises the state. At the present time the State Treasurer of our state is authorized under and by virtue of the laws of this state to purchase municipal and school bonds with state money. It is to be hoped that the next legis - lature, and it is so recommended, pass a law requiring bonds of irriga - tion districts to be registered in the office of the State Auditor the same as municipal bonds, and when approved by the State Auditor, the State Treasurer shall be authorized to purchase these bonds the same as any municipal bonds. Kthe encouragement possible should be given to the formation ation districts and the raising of the standard of irrigation se - and under this proposed form of state inspection and registry ition bonds they should be of a very high class of securities. Bbraska is so situated that its larger streams, which are used illy entirely for irrigation purposes, have their origin in states west, being in general Colorado and Wyoming.

When irrigation was first started in this state the South Platte River flowed as much water near the city of North Platte as the North Platte River did. Today, with the exception of an occasional extraordi - nary flood, the South Platte River is dry. Some of the first irrigation ditches which were built in this state were along the South Platte River between North Platte, Nebraska, and Julesburg, Colorado. Many of these canals have been abandoned or partially abandoned for the reason that no water can be obtained during the irrigation season for irrigation pur- This shortage of water is due to the development of irrigation along the South Platte River in Colorado. There have been many reser - voirs built in Colorado, so that now all the water, even the flood waters, of the South Platte River are stored within the borders of that state and none of it is allowed to run into Nebraska. This condition exists even though the ditches in Nebraska have an earlier priority, or a prior right tthe use of the water over the ditches in Colorado, which have been con - victed within recent years. This same condition is fast becoming apparent on all of the other above mentioned streams. It will only be a question of time until a shortage of water on all streams arising in Colorado and Wyoming will be noticed within this state. The Government Reclamation Service stands ready to and does recognize priority on streams and water sheds re - gardless of state lines. This is the only just and equitable solution that can be found for this problem. The state of Kansas has fought against Colorado on the Arkansas River for a number of years to establish their right to the use of some of the 'Aater of the Arkansas River. At the present time the State cf Wyoming has a suit pending, relating to the right to the use of the Larami? River, from which canals in Colorado have diverted water for use in Colorado. Yet even Wyoming will not at this time recognize any claims to water by right of priority of use in Nebraska on streams aris - ing in Wyoming and flowing into this state. It is recommended that the coming legislature make an adequate appropriation, so as to enable the Attorney General to bring suits against the States of Wyoming and Colorado, compelling them to recog - nize the priority of use of water on streams regardless of state lines. This is necessary in order to protect the rights of different irrigation canals within the State of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage 21 Bridgeport, Nebraska, October 30, 1912. To the Honorable State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage, SUte Engineer, Secretary. Conforming with the usual custom, I am submitting, herewith, my official report, covering a review of my experiences with the flow in the North Platte river during the past three years. My reasons for including the year 1910 in this report is for compari- son, and for the further reason that the flow of the river has been par- tially controlled by the Pathfinder reservoir for this period. The mean daily inflow of the Pathfinder reservoir, in second feet. for the past three seasons, is approximately as follows: 1910 1911 1912 June 3278 4676 12,934 July 414 1135 4,429 August 268 359 1,865 September 375 277 1,199 The mean daily outflow of the Pathfiinder reservoir for the same l—inni was as follows: 1910 1911 1912 June 2500 3250 3750 July 2100 3400 5700 August 1950 2600 6300 September 1800 2400 5650 The mean daily inflow of the Pathfinder reservoir, in second feet. in one year with another of the three years, and assumed to be the amount of water available for the Nebraska canals, as follows: 1910 1911 1912 June 1027 2060 2430 July 1056 2430 4150 August 555 1553 5725 September 510 1165 5125 The government project, the Inter-State canal, has approximately a maximum discharge of 1300 second feet, and the above discharge measurements for Whalen is exclusive of the amount of water taken by the Inter-State canal. Comparing the inflow of the Pathfinder with the flow into the State of Nebraska, it can be seen, for the months of July, August and Sep- tember, that the mean daily discharge into Nebraska included storage </seg>
            <seg id="p022"/>
            <seg id="p023">Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage 23 S'he amount of water needed during the months of June, July, Aug - nd September to supply all canals, varies materially during the sea - lepending on the amount of rainfall, wind and temperature, and the of crops. Also the seasons vary to a great extent. Seasons of and 1911 required more irrigation than the season of 1912. On an average, after July 10th of each year, it will be quite cer - tain that no canal having an appropriation dating later than 1890 can draw water from the direct or natural flow of the North Platte or Platte rivers. The purchase of storage water will be the only guarantee against • dry ditch. Bis estimated that the Inter-State canal will require not less than 3 acre feet to mature crops in an average season, and all the taking water from the Platte or North Platte rivers in Nebraska jquire not less than 300,000 acre feet to supplement the flow of rivers after July 10th of each year. Unless the Nebraska canals make application to purchase storage capacity in the Government reservoir before January 1, 1913, according to the present ruling of the Secretary of the Interior, they will be dry canals after July 10th in an average year. The Pathfinder reservoir has a capacity of 1,025,000 acre feet. frhe amount of water stored in 1910 (storage began April 17) approximately 256,000 acre feet In 1911 the total amount stored 390,000 acre feet In 1912 the reservoir was filled. The filling be- February 8th and was completed July 8th. Rior to the year 1910 I drove over the areas under the Tri-State and tate canals, and the amount of vegetation growing on a quarter of that land in a season could be hauled off in one or two hay - racks. In 1912 I passed over the same ground. I found over half of the areas under the Tri-State and Inter-State canals farmed and producing all kinds of crops, amounting to at least 800 hayracks full of alfalfa hay, for the season, or 32,000 bushels of potatoes, or 2400 tons of sugar beets to the quarter section of land. Et is not the intention of this report to mislead; on the contrary, to reliable information, and it is impossible for one who has seen such formation to refrain from giving it at least a mentioning. BThe distribution of water in my division for the season of 1911 was quite so strenuous as the season of 1910. However, the season of required close attention, and with the exception of a few days in the early part of June, there was just enough water to supply the canals needing water on the North Platte and Platte rivers as far as the Goth - enburg canal, which favorable condition was due to the Pathfinder stor - age reservoir. ■e season of 1912 was a rainy one, the river was bank full to Nov. prospects of continuing so until the 1st of December, having an &gt; discharge of more than 5000 second feet since July 1st Conse- </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 qnently the water commissioners of my division have had a very quiet season. Before closing I wish to make a few suggestions for the good of the work. A self-registering river gauge would be very beneficial to the service at Bridgeport and near the state line. It would furnish a continu - ous record of the gauge heights, and in connection with frequent gaug - ings would not only give the water superintendent great assistance in keeping the discharge under the best control, but the seepage data would be of great value. A self registering gauge would also be valuable at North Platte, E present law relative to the compensation of water commissioners been very satisfactory, and I wish to suggest a change. The &gt;uld pay the water commissioner, but still have the commissioner nt of the district in which he operates. I The law pertaining to the duties of the water commissioner would more satisfactory if changed so as to give him more duties to perform. As it is at present his duty is to open or close gates in order to divide and deliver the amount of water needed, particularly in the time of scarcity. The difficulty with such limited duties is that it is hard to keep a man for this work, since he cannot afford to keep himself in readiness to act im - mediately on notice, to close or open gates in time of scarcity, and be paid only for those occasions. He may not get a call during the season, and yet he must be ready, for a call for his services must necessarily be very important, and a delay may cause serious damage. In order that the office may be attractive to the kind of men who would be valuable to the service, he must receive reasonable remuneration to hold him in readiness. He should have authority, in addition to his present duties, to patrol the district for which he is appointed, watch the use of the water under each canal, see there is no waste, that the water b being placed on the lands entitled to it under the appropriations, p a record of the flow of the canals in his district, thus conserve the of the water. Let him be paid by the day and fix a limit for the season, and valuable results will be attained. The time is coming when the water for irrigation will be handled by the acre foot, and then it will be necessary for the water commissioner to devote his whole time to handling the water and keeping a record of every acre foot used in his district. In closing, I wish to acknowledge the courtesy of Mr. Andrew Weiss, U. S. Project Engineer, in furnishing daily reports of the river discharge at Whalen and the Pathfinder reservoir.

            <seg id="p025">25 Crawford, Nebraska, Nov. 30, 1912. D. D. Price, Sec. State Board of Irrigation. Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: — I herewith submit my official report for the biennium ending November 30, 1912. E people of this district are slowly gaining a knowledge of the of irrigation and also are improving in their methods in the ion of water to the land. The streams of ths part of the state, ig of the Niobrara River, White River, Hat Creek and their tribu - taries are all small streams and during the months of June, July and August (which is usually considered the main part of the irrigation sea - son) are often so low that there is but little more than enough for do - mestic purposes. But the people having ditches are learning that they can obtain good results by irrigating at any time when the ground is not frozen, so are using the water early in the spring and late in the fall; they have also demonstrated the fact that a thorough irrigation of alfalfa Kthe fall insures three good crops of hay, or one crop of hay and one seed, the following season. Some few have built storage reservoirs to hold storm and winter wa - ters and many more are planning to build them. Some of the plans are on quite an expensive scale for private capital, but I think a good many will be built in the next few years. I think the time will come when the full flow of the streams in this part of the state will be used for irrigation. Bhe amendment to the irrigation law requiring the users of water to headgates and measuring boxes has been a great help to the water issioners in distributing the water according to priorities, though I had lots of trouble to get the law enforced. In fact, not all the ditches have suitable headgates and measuring boxes yet, but I think all will have before the next season. Another trouble I have had in the last two years has been to get commissioners that would look after the distribution of the water without fear or favor. But the last ones ap- Ed are doing the work quite successfully. Therefore, the complaints en the different users of water are very much less than they were years ago. Yours respectfully, </seg>

            <seg id="p027">27 NORTH PLATTE PROJECT— NEBRASKA-WYOMING. ghe North Platte Project for the irrigation of lands in the North Valley is being developed under the Reclamation Act of June 17, This project, as it is at present planned, will consist of a storage oir and two canal systems, covering lands in eastern Wyoming estern Nebraska. The storage reservoir is located in central Wyoming, at the junction of the Sweetwater and North Platte Rivers. This reservoir is formed by the construction of a dam known as the Pathfinder dam built across a nar - row canyon in the North Platte River, about 47 miles southwest of Cas - per, Wyoming. This dam is of the arch masonry type, with a maximum height of 218 feet and a crest length of 432 feet and contains over 60,000 cubic yards of masonry. In addition to the masonry dam there has been an earth dike constructed across a saddle a short distance south of the Enry dam. The dam and dike have both been completed. The reser - has a capacity of about 1,070,000 acre feet and covers about 22,000 The Interstate unit covers about 129,270 acres of irrigable land north of the North Platte River, between Whalen, Wyoming, and the divide be - tween Red Willow and Indian Creeks, in Nebraska. Water for this unit is diverted from the river at Whalen, Wloming, by means of a concrete diversion dam with overflow crest 300 feet in length. Joined to the south end of the concrete dam is an earth dike 2,000 feet in length, with two and one-half to one side slopes. The reinforced concrete headgates of the Interstate canal join the overflow dam on the north. These diversion works were completed early in 1909. Rit the intake, the Interstate canal has a capacity of 1,400 second feet, capacity is maintained for 28 miles, where it is reduced to 1,200 d feet. Successive reductions in the canal capacity are made there - after, in accordance with the requirements. At the ninety-fifth mile the capacity is 800 second feet. At this point the main canal connects with a chain of three reservoirs, of which the first and third are now under construction, and which supply the Low Line canal and laterals, in the vicinity of Winters Creek and eastward beyond Red Willow Creek. Reser - voir No. 1, called Lake Alice, has a capacity of 14,000 acre feet and reservoir No. 3, known as Lake Minatare, is being built to a capacity of 67,000 acre feet. The High Line canal is a continuation of the main canal beyond Lake Alice to a point in the NE»4 of Section 36, Township 22 North, Range 52 West, a distance of 36 mlies from the diversion point at Lake Alice.

The first district Piins 17,840 acres of irrigable land, located between Whalen and the hills, north of Torrington, Wyoming. This is a Carey Act segrega - and is under the control of the North Platte Canal and Colonization Company. The United States delivers water to the headgates of this company's laterals under speciat arrangement. The remainder of the land under the Interstate Unit is divided into three lateral districts as follows: First Lateral District extending from the Sand Hills near the state line in Wyoming to Dry Spotted Tail Creek, in Nebraska, and containing about 36,760 acres of irrigable land ; the Second Lateral District, extending from Dry Spotted Tail Creek to Winters' Creek, and containing about 34,100 acres of irrigable land; the Third Lateral District, containing all the ir - rigable land east of Winter's Creek, about 38,000 acres. The First Lat - eral District was opened to irrigation in 1908 and the second in 1909 and 1910. A portion of the Third District was opened to irrigation in 1911 and an additional amount in 1912. The remainder of this district will be opened in succeeding years as rapidly as completed. In addition to the lands in the above districts there are about 2,540 acres of irrigable land in small tracts, which will be opened to irrigation as soon as prac- The following table shows the land opened to irrigation in 1912 and prior years Of the above 48,200 acres under the Reclamation Act, and 5,534 acres under the North Platte Canal and Colonization Company were in crops in 1912. The present rate of payments for land under the Reclamation Act E follows: Building charges $55.00 per acre, payable in ten annual HmenU, beginning with $1.00 per acre, and increasing by units uni - ly to (10.00 per acre in the tenth and fianl installment. Operation and maintenance charges are at present $1.25 per acre each year. This rate is regulated by the actual cost and is expected to decrease as the system becomes settled and seasoned, owing to the substantial charac- ter of construction adopted. The Fort Laramie Unit, the construction of which was conditionally K roved by the Department, will comprise a canal system on the south of the North Platte River, which will cover about 107,000 acres of rable land, situated between Whalen, Wyoming, and a point south ebraskm 84,669 acres yoming, U.

            <seg id="p031">31 of Minatare, Nebraska. The Main Canal will take out of the river at the Whalen diversion dam directly opposite the intake of the Interstate canal. The capacity of the canal at the intake will be about 1,370 sec - ond feet, which capacity will be gradually diminished to the end of the canal. The land covered by this canal will include 59,000 acres in Wyoming and 48,000 acres in Nebraska, of which 7,000 acres in Wyoming and 37,400 in Nebraska are in private ownership. On account of the large proportion of land in private ownership, the unit is approved only on condition that 95 per cent of the private land holders will pledge their land for the building charges of the irrigation system and to dispose of their holdings in excess of 160 acres to parties qualified to make water right applications for this land under the Reclamation Act. Ehe irrigable land under the North Platte project is divided into units of approximately 80 acres of irrigable land. Under the Re- Lion Law one person cannot obtain water for over 160 acres of whether it is in private or public ownership. Practically all land under the Interstate Unit has been entered un - der the homestead law, but there are occasional vacant units yet avail - able for entry. Land is reserved from all forms of entry under the Fort Laramie Unit. There are, however, many opportunities to purchase private lands, or lands upon which final proof as to residence and cultiva - tion has been made, both under the Interstate and Fort Laramie Units. Purchasers should make themselves familiar with local conditions, the Reclamation Law, and the various public notices relating to the lands prior to making purchases. Careful preliminary investigation may save much misunderstanding and resulting troubles and difficulties. As a rule, a person should not attempt to settle on the average unimproved reclamation homestead with a working capital of less than $1,500 or $2,000, and a larger sum would be required in many cases. It must be remembered that ordinarily it will take the products of several seasons to pay for improvements, machinery and seed, and the returns from these unimproved western soils are usually light for the first several years, while the expense of preparing the ground for irrigation, seeding to alfalfa and purchasing necessary farm equipment is correspondingly heavy during this period.

            <seg id="p055">Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage 53 WATER POWER During the last two years a great deal of publicity has been given to proposed water power developments along the lower Loup and Platte Rivers by the newspapers. The Board has held hearings on all the dif - ferent proposed power projects in the above territory and have disposed of many of the older claims, which have been outlawed by reason of non - use and non-compliance with the irrigation law. The outcome of these hearings and contests has been to allow the first project on the lower Loup, which is commonly known as the "Columbus Development,'' to H. E. Babcock, who is backed by Henry L. Doherty and Company of New York City. This proposed project diverts the water at a point on the Loup River southwest of Genoa, Nebraska, and returns the water to the Loup River just west of Columbus. rThe next project is what is known as the "Boggs Filing," backed by Commonwealth Power Company and George G. Moore of Detroit, Michigan. This proposed project diverts the water just west of Colum - bus from the Loup River and makes the development of power north and a little west of the city of Schuyler, returning the water to the Platte River in that vicinity. The third project is what is known as the "Fremont or Richards Fil - ing." Under this, it is proposed to divert the water from the Platte River south and east of Schuyler on the south side of the river and make the development of power in the bluffs on the south side of the Platte River south of Fremont and return the water to the Platte River in that vicin - ity. Mr. Richards is backed by Kountze Brothers, bankers, in the de - velopment of this proposed project. Ellis leaves free for development without any conflict one with the three large water powers, but, as yet, no signs of actual work of uction has developed under any one of the above. The great interest taken in the proposed development of these large water powers in the State has increased the interest in water power throughout the entire State. Numerous filings have been made on small water power sites and actual developments in many cases are being made at the present time. The importance to the State at large of the development of water power cannot be over-estimated. At present, prac - tically the only industry in the State is agriculture and this condition will prevail until such time as large manufacturing industries are able to se - cure advantageous conditions in regard to power, as are available in other fThe amount of power which could be developed from the Loup River e would more than supply the present demand of the central and east portion of the State and also attract manufacturing interests by rea - of cheap power.

            <seg id="p057">Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage 55 developed in this State on account of the exceeding high cost of operation, due to the high cost of manufacturing power. Numerous small water plants are at present furnishing electricity for lighting purposes to many small towns throughout the State. There are still a large number of these small water developments which are yet unimproved, the develop - ment of which would furnish cheap power to small cities. All the en - couragement possible should be given to the development of water power wherever available. At the present time, the State has no official records to show how much water power can be developed on any of its streams. A survey of the important streams, which would show the amount of power that could be developed and the various locations where power plants could be built advantageously would undoubtedly stimulate the development of wa - ter power. KThe present laws in regard to the prosecution of the work of con - tion on applications to appropriate the waters of the State for power oses should be amended, so as to leave no room for any dispute as to her or not the applicant was complying with all the requirements of the law. It is further recommended that a law be passed prohibiting a non - resident or foreign corporation from procuring, purchasing or holding any interest in any water right within the State. This will enable the State Railway Commission to completely regulate all power and irriga - tion developments in the State. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">56 Report of State Engineer HIGHWAYS Pader the present law this Board does not have charge of the high - urther than the supervision of the building of State Aid Bridges. has been a great deal of talk concerning the improvements of roads throughout the state, and the interest taken during the past two years would seem to indicate that some action will be taken by the coming legislature for the establishment of a highway department in this office. The soil conditions in this state are of such a character that goo&lt; earth roads can be built and maintained at a very moderate cost. Unde the proper supervision the building and maintenance of good earth roa&lt; will cost no more than is at present being expended upon the highwa system of this state. At present the major portion of the money whic is paid out upon the roads is expended under the supervision of roa&lt; overseers. These road overseers are almost invariably men who hav little or no knowledge of the proper methods of road construction am who are elected by the voters of their township without any regard t their qualificatins. If the amount of money which is being spent at the present time could be used under the supervision and direction of a competent road builder and this continued for a period of five years throughout the ttate, we would have as a result the finest system of dirt roads in the world. This system could be maintained at a cost far below what the counties are now paying for their road work by an efficient plan of drag - ging. Permanent roads, such as brick or concrete, are out of the ques - tion on account of the necessity of improving so many miles of road in each county at once and the extremely high cost of these materials. Macadam roads, while cheaper, are still very expensive to build and more expensive to maintain than the brick or concrete. Under a traffic of motor driven vehicles a macadam road goes to pieces very fast and is leas satisfactory than an earth road. It is recommended for the consideration of the legislature that this office be given charge of the highways of the state and that an assistant, who shall be a capable engineer and understand thoroughly road build - ing and construction, be authorized, together with such other assistants and help as may be necessary to carry on the work. It is further recom - mended that the present office of road overseer be abolished and that the road work in the various counties be placed entirely under the su - pervision of the County Highway Engineer, to be appointed by the County Commissioners or Supervisors, subject to the approval of the State Engineer. This last provision is necessary in order to prevent the office of County Highway Engineer from becoming a political office, rather than an office to be held by virtue of a man's qualifications. It is further recommended that it be made the duty of the County </seg>
            <seg id="p059">57 Highway Engineer to oversee all road work and especially the dragging of the roads, and the dragging to be done at the right time, and that a proper fund should be provided for by the County Commissioners of each county to enable the carrying out of this work within their own county. The work to be done by the additional assistant, who may be added to the State Engineers' office, and who might be called State Highway En - gineer, will be entirely of an advisory nature, conferring with the County Highway Engineers and giving them the benefit of his advice and ex - perience, except any work in which state money is to be expended, which should be entirely under the supervision of the State Highway </seg>
            <seg id="p060">58 BRIIK.ES In Section 6139 of Cobbeys' Annotated Statutes of Nebraska, 1911, it is made the duty of this office to furnish bridge plans to counties upon request of the County Board for any bridges that they may desire. This section was enacted by the State Legislature of 1905 and an appro - priation of $3,000 was made for preparing a set of standard plans. These plans were prepared and the remainder of this appropriation allowed to lapse; these plans were to be furnished to the county for the actual cost of preparing the same. Section 6141 of Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, 1911, being a bill enacted at the 1911 session of the eLgislature, it is provided that all bridges shall be constructed so that they will sustain a load of not less than twenty tons. The enactment of this law rendered valueless all plans which had been prepared previous to 1911 in this office, none of them being designed to carry a twenty ton load. Although this section is somewhat indefinite as to what is meant by load of twenty tons, this office has interpreted the same to mean a concentrated load, which would be a twenty-ton traction engine with axles 11 ft. 6 in. centers and 8 ft. gauge, two-thirds of the load to be carried on the rear axles and dis - tributed over twelve feet in width. These are the dimensions of a twenty-ton traction-engine, which is considered to be the heaviest con - centrated load coming upon an ordinary highway bridge. A standard set of plans, together with a number of special designs, have been prepared to meet the requirements of different counties during the past two years. Several counties have ordered sets of these standard plans, but by no means all of them. This law should be amended so as to compel the counties to obtain all plans for bridges from this office. This will give us uniformly designed bridges throughout the state and will thus guarantee the safety of all bridges and their carrying capacity. The necessity for this is shown by the fact that each year there are a number of bridges, which fail under the twenty-ton-traction loading, and these failures are invariably accompanied by injuries to the men in charge of the traction engine and not infrequently lives have been lost. It is also a fact that under the present system of county bridge letting each bridge company either files their own plan and bids upon the same, or the county board adopts a plan furnished by some bridge com - pany, and all of the bidders base their bids upon these plans, and also un - der the general bridge laws, specifying the way in which bids are to b&lt; received, it is next to impossible for any one to determine who is the lowest and best bidder. The responsibility and reputation of a bidder, together with his past experience, should always be taken into consider- </seg>
            <seg id="p061">59 plans furnished counties by bridge companies are always general and all details are left off; in many cases they are merely a sort of picture of a bridge, and none of the sizes and heights of the members are given, and the specifications are always a joke. This is in no way a reflection on the bridge company, but is merely a matter of self-preservation, which is permitted under the present biidge law, each company having to fight and use any method that they may to get a contract. By adopting a standard set of plans and specifications throughout the entire state compelling all biidges built within the state to comply with the same, will work to the benefit, not only of the people of the state, but also to the bridge companies, themselves, for the reason that each company will be placed upon the same footing and will be bidding upon the same plans and specifications. There should also be a state I Mr of bridges and an adequate appropriation made for this office ble it to furnish standard plans and specifications to all counties " charge and also furnish an inspector free of cost, to inspect the vhile under construction and to advise with county boards in let - f contracts. This will in no way detract from the power of the t county boards or interfere with them, but will enable them to e better work and better results for the money expended. Kere should be a penalty fixed and made the duty of some officer to the law against the building of bridges which do not meet with ndard requirements. This office during the past two years has furnished inspectors on bridge work to counties requesting the same at the actual traveling and hotel expenses while away from this office to do such inspection work. Several counties who have procured plans for bridges from this oflkv, have also had inspection work done. Under the State Aid Bridge law enacted by the legislature of 1911, there was created a levy of one-fifth of one mill per annum on each dollar of assessed value of the Grand Assessment Roll of the state. This amounted to about (85,000 for the year 1911 and $90,000 for the year 1912. The proceeds of this levy constitute what is known as "The State Aid Bridge Fund," which is used in the construction of bridges over streams one hundred and seventy-five feet in width or more, providing the county or counties desiring to construct such a bridge pay one-half of the cost of construction and the state pay the other half. The fol - lowing counties have made application for State Aid and action taken in regard to each of these applications is shown in the appended list, which is made up in the order in which the applications were filed: 'ounty imt ;.

These bridges have also been designed to carry a twenty ton traction engine or a uniform live load of eighty to one hun - dred pounds per square foot of floor surface, depending upon the length of the span. This law has done more than any other to stimulate the interest of counties in the building of permanent bridges, and sets an excellent ex - ample of the form of bridge construction in this State, and it is to be hoped that it will eventually work a reform towards the building of per - manent bridges in the State. The contract prices of all of the State Aid bridges which have been let have been very satisfactory and fairly uniform; with two exceptions, the contracts have been let at a figure below the cost, as estimated by this office, the exceptions being the Arlington Bridge in Washington County and the Loup City Bridge in Sherman County, which contracts were let at a fair price to the contractor, county and State. At all of the State Aid bridge lettings, there has been plenty of competition, and with the exception of the first-attempted bridge letting at Spring-view, Keya Paha County, where the bids seemed to indicate previous agree - ment between the bridge companies represented, the competition has been genuine. This would indicate that it would be better for counties build - ing large bridges to let the contract for each bridge separately, rather than to attempt to build such structures under a yearly contract, as is the custom at present. </seg>

            <seg id="p064">62 BRIDGEPORT AND BAYARD STATE AID BRIDGES, NORTH PLATTE RIVER, MORRILL COUNTY For the above two bridges, this office prepared a design of two concrete bridges, one being a girder bridge, consisting of twenty-three 33 ft. spans with twelve-foot roadway and a turn-out in the middle of the bridge. The other design consisted of fifteen 50 ft. concrete arches with a twelve- foot roadway and a turn-out in the middle of the bridge; both bridges to be approximately eight hundred feet long with an earth fill at the end, made by reason of the narrowing of the channel, approximate - ly fifteen hundred feet long. Bids were received and opened at Bridgeport on February 20, 1912. The lowest bid was submitted by a contractor, who had no experience, whatever, in building structures of this character, and who lacked the necessary financial backing to handle the job. His bid was so much be - low the actual cost of the bridge that it was evident that he would have 6 unable to complete the work, and for these reasons his bid was ed. The contract was finally awarded for both bridges to J. L. n of Lincoln, who bid only on the girder type of the bridge. Spe - ttention is called to the design of this bridge and the detailed for the same follow. Erhe construction of these bridges has been delayed by reason of high r in the North Platte River throughout the entire summer of 1912. material for the bridges is practically all on the ground and the con - or will push the work to completion as soon as the weather condi - permit. </seg>

Bids were received and opened at Wahoo, Nebraska, May 25, 1912. The con - tract was let to Stupp Bros. Bridge and Iron Co., St. Louis, Mo., for the •tod bridge with creosoted wood block floor. Special attention is called to the design of this bridge, plans of which follow. The concrete piers are of special note, resting on two sixty inch and one thirty-six inch steel tubes filled with concrete. Ice breakers are very effective and should withstand a great amount of hard treatment by the ice. Long spans were used so as to balance the cost of the piers with the spans and also to give plenty of clearance and not cause any ice jams. This is one of the very largest highway bridges undertaken within the state. At the present time all of the foundation work for this bridge is prac - tically complete and the placing of the steel will begin immediately.

            <seg id="p091">Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage 87 DRAINAGE At the present time this office does not have any general supervi - sion over drainage work, with the exception of draining of lakes of a certain size which might be of more use and value as pleasure resorts and for fish culture than the land which, they cover would be for agricultural During the past few years there have been a large number of drain - age districts formed throughout the State. In many cases these have been formed for the purpose of straightening out and shortening the channels of small streams. Several instances have come to the atten - tion of this office where several districts have been formed for the straightening out of the channel of the same stream. Different engineers were employed to work out the plan and locate the drainage ditches of each different district. The district higher up on the stream would often build a canal of larger cross section than the one lower down the stream, which should have been designed to carry more water than the upper one. This shows clearly that one or the other of these canals was not built to the best advantage and economically. Pifferent questions like this arise which are greatly influenced by cal people, who desire special favors and privileges and the best s for drainage as a whole are not accomplished. It is recommended i law be passed compelling all drainage districts to file an applica - setting forth all the facts pertaining to their proposed drainage project and that the same be acted upon by the State Board, the same as an application for irrigation or power purposes and that the drainage dis - trict be required to file detailed plans of their proposed project, and that the same be approved by the State Board, subject to any change which they may see fit to make before the construction work can begin. In this way the drainage work of the entire state will be put under the su - pervision of the State Board, and the State Engineer may go upon the ground and make such surveys and examinations as he may deem neces - sary, so as to enable him to recommend to the Board and the Drainage Districts the best plan for carrying out the proposed project, which opin - ion will be unbiased by any local conditions or favors that might exist otherwise. Thus a uniform plan for the straightening of the channels of different streams can be successfully worked out throughout their en - tire length. Surveys might be made by the State Engineer's office of different streams and all low and seep lands, showing the best and most feasible ways of draining and straightening and shortening the channels of creeks, so that proposed districts could be formed more easily and to a better advantage than they are under the system which is in use at this time. </seg>

In these tables, the claims and applications have been arranged in each water division by streams in alphabetical order, and the appro - priations on each stream are arranged in order of their priority and for that stream only; but in the table immediately following the priority is given for each water division. Vlange numbers refer to ranges west of the 6th Principal Meri - unless otherwise indicated. Shose having docket numbers are claims made covering rights ■ed under the law prior to April 4, 1895, and those having appli - numbers are applications for permits to appropriate water under the law of 1895. These tables will be found valuable in ascertaining relative rights of appropriate™ from any stream. </seg>

An acre foot is water one foot deep upon one acre of land. I acre foot equals 43,560 cubic feet, equals 325,851 U. S. gallons, second-foot will supply 1 acre foot in 12:1 hours. IU. S. gallon &gt;■ 231 cubic inches. cubic foot = 7.48 U. S. gallons. 1 cubic foot of water weighs 1,000 ounces or 62.5 pounds avoir- 1 U. S. gallon of water weighs 8.355 pounds avoirdupois. ■horespower is equivalent to raising 33,000 pounds one foot in mute. 1 second-foot falling 8.8 feet is equivalent to one theoretical horse - power. 20 per cent of the theoretical horsepower is generally allowed for the friction of machinery, etc., leaving 80 per cent for the net horsepower, therefore one second foot falling 11 feet = one available horsepower (80 per cent efficiency). About ten per cent of this is lost when converted into electrical energy. k horsepower = 746 Watts = .746 Kilowatts, volt ampere = .0013405 horsepower. The approximate rate of flow of water in open channels may be found in observing the velocity of a float on the surface of the stream. The velocity is greatest at the surface and least along the bottom and sides, being there retarded by friction. Careful experiments have shown that the mean velocity is about 84 per cent of the maximum central surface velocity. The mean rate of flow is at six-tenths of the depth measured from the surface. The most approved formula for determining the flow of water in canals is Kutter's: v In this formula v = the mean velocity in feet per second. Kthe hydraulic radius or mean depth in feet = the area of cross n square feet divided by the wetted perimeter or width along &gt;m and sides in feet. iprovea lormula tor determi 's: 1.811 .00281 ] 1- 41.6 H | n s ■ } Vrs f .00281 | n 1+^41.6+ } ' I • I vr J </seg>

This value has been found to be .025 for ordinary irrigation ils and about one-half this quantity for flumes of unplaned lumber.

This is based on the theory that the effective length / of a rectangular weir being less than its true length owing to a contraction of the area if the weir be increased in urtion to its depth i since contraction increases in this ratio) and so as to balance the loss due in contraction, the flow through the weir will remain the same as though the weir were rectangular with - ■ n. The conditions called for in placing a rectangular weir must bs nearly fulfilled with a trapezoidal weir, but the distance of the sill of the weir from the bottom of the canal must be at least three times the depth of the weir, and in length must be at least three :he depth of the water flowing over it. Eweir seems to &gt;me excellent qualities, the chief difli - connection with it being the same as arises in using the rec - weir, namely, that where silt laden water is employed this may ove the front board of the weir. This weir may be used as a nd for fairness of measuiement is especially adapted to use on canals. </seg>
