Pleasant, comfort- and good equipment are essential for best results; but a good teacher is the one absolutely necessary requirement for an entirely successful S school. The task of taking charge of from five to forty children, com- ing from home training as varied as is the educational ideas of the community; of controlling and teaching this heterogeneous collection of youth, many a one of whom has proved in his individual capacity to be beyond the controlling and teachin this is a problem requiring for its complete solution an educated mind a skilled touch, a keen perception, a tender heart, and a tactful appli cation of all the attributes of the successful tea rotter Wajres for Teachers. — The wage paid public school teachers is so far below that paid in other lines of employment, for a sponding degree of education, skill, applied energy, and devotion to cause, that the commercial world and other better paid professions draw largely each y&lt; ar from the front teaching ranks. Ten thousand three hundred and fifty-five different teachers w&lt; re last year teaching in Nebraska public schools. Nearly one-third of that number were replaced this year, end a like number will be needed next year to fill the vacancies caused by marriage, failing health, death, better employ - ment, or other cause.

CERTIFICATION OF TF.ACH KS We are now ready for an advanced step in certification. A very I important step wns taken in c&lt; when the present certification law went into operation five years ago. The uniform state examina- tions for the issuance of county teachers' certificates is the system now recognized throughout the country, as one which is impartial and uniform in requirements and effective in operation. It takes away from the issuance of teachers' certificates all local ym pathy which, under the old system, often resulted in undesirable re- sults in certification. When the certification law went into effect in 1905 because of the necessity at that time for filling the schools with legally certificate;! teachers, concessions v in credits and the extension of privileges in the examination. We are now at the place where such concessions are no longer necessary Every teacher holding a certificate should be required to give evidence of the same qualifications required of every other teacher holding the same kind of certificate. Those who claim concessions on account of superior privileges for preparation should be asked to pass the test as all others who are applicants for the same kind of certificate. We have now on file in this office about 65,000 different records in the examination scries. These records represent at least 4,000 names now carried on the examination files. The duplicates come because of transfer of teachers from one county to another. There are about 40,000 different names and addresses now carried on the examination record. Of this number approximately 20,000 are active That is, they are the names of teachers actively engaged in school •work or are names of candidates for certificates who have not com- pleted the examinations. There are approximately 2,000 withdrawals from the teaching profession each year from those who hold county certificates. The number of those who attempt the examination but find themselves insufficiently educated to meet the tests are approz mately 4,000 per year. i)uring the past biennium 38,000 registration numbers were assigned. This is in excess of the preceding biennium by about 2,000 During the biennium 152,821 answer papers have been submitted These average about three pages each, making a number of pages of written manuscripts read and valued by the examining committee about 500,000. Since the certification law went into effect in 1905 nearly 400,000 manuscript papers have been read, with a total approxi- mate page of manuscript read 1,250,000.

There are in Nebraska sixteen educational institutions issuing state certificates. The standard for issuance of these state certificates is set by the University of Nebraska for other universities and colleges and by the state normal schools for other normal schools. It is im- portant that these standards be carefully set and as carefully adhered to by ihe state institutions. The siate examining; conn ■at under the law approves the c&lt; rtificatien of teachers in nized on a basis of state institutions. This committee has been caused great deal of annoyance and confusion by the lack of a uniform course of smdy in the normal schools with strict ad! rules in the graduation of students and the issuance of state certifi- sua cates. During the past year the state normal school board has adopted a uniform coui idy for iHe four stale normal schools and 1 established regulations under which no student is to be graduated from any one of the normal schools until his recoxd been approved by the state examining board.

If our rural schools are to have trained teachers, we must not only train a large number but must continue to do this each lue to year. Our cities and towns will continue to be partly provided with trained teachers from normal schools, colleges and universities, and by teachers who have had succ&lt; ssful experience in rural school work This drain upon the rural schools cannot be stopped.

The weekly literary program, the social events, basketball, base ball, and tennis, were all encouraged and directed by the faculty. There was absolutely no aristocracy in the Alma junior normal. Teachers and pupils mingled together on the most friendly terms of equality. A large majority of the teachers were working for second and third grade certificates, a few for first, and several were taking the life branches. A marked characteristic of the whole bunch was their earnestness, their evident determination to accomplish that for which they were in school.

Ell The Broken Bow State Junior Normal is located in Broken Bow, the county seat of one of the largest counties in the state.

The O'Neill district is now out of debt and a new modern high school building is certain to arise shortl 1 The attendance for the past two years has been about the same as for the two years immediately preceding, though tha names of our pupils vary from year to year in a surprising manner. Only about two- thirds of those who attend a considerable portion of the v.hole term take the trouble to complete examinations for credit. Of the 323 students who have received credit during the past four years, only 10 students have attended every year. Twenty have attended three years, 53 two years and 240 only one year. Just about half of th attendants each year are new students While the need for these schools is certainly very great, there la also need of greater stimulus to attend. Salaries in rural schools are now much higher than in any other schools in the state in proportion to work and preparation required. Is it not the duty of the sta.e ask for better preparation on the part of rural teachers and to offer them the opportunity to meet the new demands? Few children with only eight years of schooling are competent to teach other children. Perhaps the most satisfying experience connected with these schools is the eagerness for help which most of our pupils manifest. To most of them it means great sacrifice to attend school. They are. therefore, thoroughly in earnest, and it is a pleasure to aid them in their efforts to improve themselves. Perhaps our greatest weakness has been in a failure to develop social interest. Our students have been rather serious-minded and our faculty are all missionaries, hence the duty and drive and drudge have been rather too prominent. VALENTINE JUNIOR NORMAL. W. T.

These 65,000 records represent the registrations of teach - ers throughout the various counties and, as I have stated, one teacher may have several different records by reason of having taught in that many counties.

Th shows that we are now carrying upon the records of the examination from 40,000 to 45,000 individual records which are cither dupllca or are the records of parties who have dropped out of the teachir profession.

            <seg id="p109">60 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT 4 &gt; y very materially and is a source of great annoyance to the office, the county superintendent, and to the teacher. We have now in the office probably a thousand answer papers without any identification number, or an incorrect number. These are papers, the author of which we have not been able to discover. We write to county superintendents, sending headings of the papers, but in some cases they are unable to have the paper identified. These latter make up the thousand or more papers which we now hold as unidentified. Also, the source of grades through the normal training courses, through acceptance from other states, and from the second grade or elementary state certificate, causes some confusion. This is inevitable. The ninety-two county superintendents of the state cannot be expected to understand and keep in mind at all times the law governing exam - inations and certifications. Recommendations In view of the above facts, I submit three recommendation First — That the examination record in the etate superintendent's office be carried solely with the individual. That all designation of county be removed from these examination records. This would quire that the fees be separated. One for examination and a separate fee for registering the certificate Second — That the number of examinations be materially dimin- ished. I suggest that four in a year or, at the utmost, five would cover every need of the state at this time. These should be distributed approximately as follows: One in the winter, say January or Feb - ruary; the second in April, the third in June, the fourth in July about the close of the summer schools and a fifth in October. I believe it would be even possible to dispense with the April examination. I suggest that these examinations be given covering a period of three days. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday would be the most con- venient for all concerned. Third — That all certificates be issued and filled out by the state superintendent, but that in order that they may be validated in any county they must be presented to the county superintendent and regis - tered by him for that county. In this connection I would suggest fur - ther, that all certificates be made to expire on the first day of July, no matter what time they are issued. The third grade certificates might be discontinued. The second grade and the first grade certifi - cates should be continued and their period of validity should be placed upon the certificate when issued by the state superintendent. Such a certificate would give to the teacher at once free opportunity to com - pete and become a candidate for any school in the etate for which the grade of certificate held by her would qualify her. It would not be necessary for her to wait for a transfer or a re-issuance of certificate. </seg>

What this community has done other communities in Nebraska can do. Why not begin next spring to circulate a petition for consolidation of schools? It must come and will come sooner or later. In time, save in exceptional communities, the one-room building will be a thing of the past. Following are some quotations collected from parents of the Sholes district: "The system is indeed a success. My children never learned as </seg>

From one and all comes, "They learn faster and are more contented and interested in the work." They like it better all the time; farmers hired men to husk corn last winter that their boys might stay in school. Was that very often done before? Row of Overshoes Worn by Transported I'upils at Sholes of the intermediate room says: "My children learn fully twice as fast now under the same teacher as they did before." One farmer says, "I can't keep my children home any more. They like the asso- ciation with others of the same age and same degree of advancement." Here is a strong point in favor of consolidation. The great evil of the small rural school lies in its non-social character. It is wholly un- able to furnish each of its pupils that educative influence that comes from association with many of the same age and degree of advance- ment; it cannot have in its many small classes, enough of honest and helpful competition to establish a standard to which many a bright pupil would raise himself, and fails therefore to bring from him that supreme effort which develops and ennobles, and which comts only from a vigorous contest with his fellows. Another farmer says, "There is simply nothing like it. It's the only system. The little ones can go more regularly in winter because the older boys take them even on stormy days." Another says.

To do all this we need to take into the body a certain amount of various kinds of food which will supply the needs of the bones, muscles, brain, and all parts and organs of the body. Some of this food we take In Its natural state just as It grows. Some must be cooked to make it of good flavor and easy of digestion. Some food may be taken either raw or cooked. Under ordinary conditions, wtth the average person, the requirements of the body demand seventeen ounces of solid food and five pints of water each day. Two Great Classes of Food In the first class are all those foods which possess or have pos- sessed aik'd tlip organic foods, such as meat, potatoes flour, etc. In the other class are the inorganic foods, or those which io not contai of water, salt, etc I. Organic Foods 1. rroteids. Animal and vegetable foods which contain albumen in large amounts are railed proteids. These an- tissue builders. White of an egg is the purest albumen In this class. Other examples are milk, cheese, eggs, meats, fish, cereals, peas, beans, and lentils. 2. Carbohydrates. The sugars and starches are called carbohy - drates. They furnish the energy and maintain heat. They include vegetables, fruits, cereals, sugars, and gums. I'ats and Oils. These store energy and heat to be used as needed. This class includes butter, cream, fat of meat, fish, cereals, nuts and olives. II. luorjfanic Foods Mineral Matter f the salt Water makes up two-tbirds of the weight of the body The Composition of the Air Before going to anything as complex as the composition of the body, let us study the air with which we are more familiar. Air, which we cannot feel, taste or see, is made up chiefly of two elements: Oxygen and nitrogen. About one-fifth of it is oxygen and four-fifths nitrogen. There Is also a very little ammonia, sulphur gases, watery vapor, and carbon dioxide. Here are some experiments which may be performed to thow the composition of air Experiment I. Drop a piece of Ice Into a glass of water. Notice the moisture collecting on the outside of the glaas. From where does it come? </seg>

The same may be observed when the U niperature falls. The moisture collects on objects in the form of dew or fro Experiment 2. Insert in the tightly fitted cover of a jelly glass a email lighted torch or wick several inches long. Watch it closely as it burns and finally goes out. What is the cause? The oxygen in the air in the jelly glass is entirely used and the fire therefore goes out. Without the oxygen of the air, there would be no Cre. Without the large proportion of nitrogen, fire would burn with a great explosion and too great rapidity Experiment 3. Put a piece of fresh lime about the size of an egg Into a pitcher and upon it. pour a small teacupful of water. When the lime has crumbled, pour a pint of water into the pitcher, stir thoroughly, let settle. Half fill a glass with the clear liquid. L'sing straw or other tube, force the breath slowly through the lime water In the tumbler.

If we could arrange a thermometer under the kettle and measure the heat, we could tell just how much heat is required to make the water one degree hotter. This amount of heat is called a calorie. The body must be kept warm. We know there is no fire to keep it heated, 60 there must be another method. In the body the food is the fuel, and as it is eaten and digested heat is produced. The heat of the body is measured just as the heat of the water was Just as air and water are mail*- up of certain elements, the body 1b also composed of different elements united in certain proportions. In the body there are 6 J u percent of oxygen, 81% per cent of carbon, 10 per cent of hydrogen and 3 per Beat of nitro^i n. Three per cent Is made up of the following: Calcium, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium, magnesium, iron, and fluorine.

Bread is a perfect food except it lacks fat; we therefore spread •with butter. There are two kinds of bread known since the time of Lot as unl«avened and leavened. I'nleavened bread is a mixture of water and flour, baked, resulting in a hard.tough material. Leav- ened bread has been made for nearly two thousand years. To the water and flour is added a leaven or ferment to hasten and perfect the raiding. There are different ways of procuring this ferment or yeast. </seg>

Place the milk in a warm but not hot place. The milk will begin to froth, showing that yeast from the air Is growing in the milk. This kind of yeast was used to mix with the dough before com - pressed yeast was made. Experiment JO. Fill each of three jelly glasses one-third full of thin flour and water paste. Dissolve slowly one dry or compressed yeast cake in one-half cup lukewarm water. Add one tablespoonful to each jelly glass, stirring vigorously until small bubbles appear.

Watch results and compare the contents of the three glasses noting the number of bubbles.

Note a st 1 flying from the tall, feathery - plants. We call them plan w ants. Like plants t 1 the dust-like material observed flying from the plants are their seed The seeds of these plants are called sport ants with which we art familiar all have names, and belong ■&gt;on their different characteristics. t classes depending u 11 plants in the it ly are also divided into classes and All of the smallt and simplest plants are in the first lass and are named Bacteria. Uacteria are so small that a ngle plant can be seen only by the f a microscope to magnify it many times. They take their food rom the air or surrounding material, then give off as waste products pases or liquids. These waste products may do harm or good. In the case of ptomaine poisoning we see the harm they do. Another common example of the work of bacteria is the souring of the milk. f In the second class are found the yeast plants with which we are all familiar. We put the yeast in the bread. It grows, and while growing throws off alcohol and a gas which is called carbon dioxide. The bubbles of gas cannot break through, so they raise the whole mass of do The third class are the moulds which form a velvet-like sub- stance in bread, on meat, leather and canned goods. Other forms of mould are mildew, ringworm and moulds on the skin. We performed some experiments which show favorable and un- favorable temperatures for the growth of these plants. Sunlight and draughts of air retard or destroy germ life. We conclude then that the best way to avoid germ life in food is either to keep the food in a refrigerator or very cold place, or else to boil or bake It before using. The best way to avoid the germ life in the various rooms of the house is to air thoroughly the rooms, admit all the sunlight possible, and keep as free from dust as possible. All that has been said of the house applies to the barns and milk rooms as well. Attention will be called later to the pure food laws which are requiring cleanliness in the handling of milk, butter, meat and all foods. CAWING AND PRESEHVING &gt; Successful canning and preserving depends first upon the destruc - tion of all bacteria, yeasts, and moulds present In the vegetable or fruit; and secondly upon perfect sealing so that no new germ is ad - mitted. Great care must be taken in order to prevent the spoiling of any foods kept for winter use. The first precaution is to use earthen cr granite ware utensils, and to use silver or wooden spoons only, for itirring. e warmth and moisture. an&lt; </seg>

To cure such disease a corrected diet is of as great importance as medicine. It is of great importance in caring for the sick or convalescent to select the cleanest and daintiest of glass, china, silver, and linen when arranging the tray. It is important also to serve easily digested foods. Liquid foods milk, lemonade, fruit juices, oatmeal water, beef tea and egg-nogs are among the best The semi-solid foods are the gruels made from corn-meal, oat- meal. Imperial Granum, flour, starch, crackers, or arrow-root. They are heat producing. Care should be taken not to serve them when there is inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Greatest care must be exercised in the giving of solid foods, especially during convalescence. The danger is that too much will be given. Among the best foods are fresh eggs cooked soft, dry and ailk toast, chicken cooked until the flesh falls from the bone, custards ices, and ice creams.

This bulletin Is one of the series Issued under the co-operative plan of the University of Nebraska and the Department of Public Instruction in encouraging the work in Agriculture and Home Economics through the public schools. Copies are furnished free to managers of county and school district clubs and to other persons who are interested. For Information relative to the work and the meetings of the county and state organiza - tions apply to the county superintendent of the respective county. A later bulletin will tell more of the state meeting to be held January 17-22, 1910. The Sewing Contest at the State Meeting. Premiums will be awarded for 1. A sewing apron; entirely hand made, no machine work. 2. A "Domestic Science" apron; machine made, may have some hand work 3. Work apron (with sleeves, and buttoned in the back) Including hand and machine work on the garment. 4. Washable eofa-pillow cover with top and back sewed together on three sides. I. Plain wash shirt waist. It should be remembered in all this work that even stitches, strong sewing and neat finish are of greater importance than expensive trimmings. When aprons and waists are finished there should be no raw nor unfinished seams, no basting threads, and no gathers which have not been stroked. Materials may be shrunk before cutting, but the finished article should be sent to the contest unlaun'lercd. In shrinking colored goods, put salt in water, let goods partly dry, then iron. Each article becomes the property of the contestant at the close of the contest. She should therefore make it of such size as to be useful to her upon its return. Many helpful suggestions in cooking and sewing may be found in University Bulletin, Series XIII. Number 14," which was distributed last year. INTRODUCTION'. </seg>

The forenoons will be spent in the kitchen of the Home Economics Building where demonstrations, practical cooking and serving, and lectures will be given. The afternoons will be devoted to work in nursing and sewing. A full description of the courses offered will be published in the premium list for the state contest to be held next January. A course in agriculture for the boys will run five days. Instruction ■will be given in improved methods of corn culture, soil culture and the feeding and care of farm animals. Eligibility. — Each county girls' and boys' association may send one girl and one boy as delegates from its association. The delegate must be between the ages of 12 and 21 years and must be chosen by a com - mittee appointed by the county manager. The delegate must have won some premium or taken some active part in the county contest. The county association or delegate must pay railroad fare to Lincoln And return, and board and room while attending this course. Explanation. — Nearly 40 counties have active girls' and boyB* organizations and for that reason the number of delegates must be limited so that the classes will not be too large for effective work. The members of the class will be expected to take notes at the lectures and from these notes prepare a report which can be read before some meeting in their respective counties. Special arrange - ments will be made to give the girls and boys as much helpful inform - ation as possible. If the weather is pleasant several points of interest In Lincoln and different departments in the University will be visited. It la suggested that the delegate from each county look after exhibits from her or his county. We appreciate the courtesy of the departments in offering this course and hope that every county where a girls' and boys' contest tl held will send one delegate to the girls' school and also a delegate </seg>

Needle 8 or 9 and thread No. 60 for gingham end 70 or 80 for India linen. Thimble, scissors pins, pin-cush Material Suitable — Checked apron gingham — 27 inches, $ .08 to $ .10 per yard; India linen — 27 inches to 32 inches, % .10 to % .12 per yard. Cutting. — Cut apron to reach bottom of skirt when finished, as It will shrink in washing. Fold the material in the middle lengthwise snd lay the pattern on according to the diagram placing the side marked double on the fold of the cloth. Allow % Inches all around for seams and hems. The diagram shows 32-inch material. If ging - ham is used it will require 2% yards. The band should be made the waist measurement plus 1 inch. This amount is calculated for an pron 36 inches Ions. More material should be allowed for a longer apron. Making. — Baste all seams and hems carefully before stitching Join the side gores to the front in French seams. • To do this place the wrong sides of material together and stitch \'a inch from the edges on the right side. Trim edges smooth and turn the seam in. Baste and stitch the second time on the wrong side far enough below the first stitching that the raw edge will not show on the right side (1-16 inch.) Now baste and stitrh hem ( »i inch wide, with v 3 Inch margin turned in) around sides and bottom of apron. Before gathering trim the top to fit the waist curve in front. This varies with the individual, \i inch in the middle will probably be sufficient. Fold the apron and slope off from middle to sides. Mark middle of top with pin, or notch. Gather % inch from the edge, using one thread. Make gathering thread when fastened 16 inches long. Place the right side of the band on the wrong side of the gathered apron and the middle of the band on the gathered portion and baste in 'i inch seam on right side. Place on band with seams on right side, and middle of gathers on middle of band, and baste. Fold the band over (% inch margin turned in, making band one inch wide) and baste even with first seam.

It may require some change in the slope. Stitch in a plain seam on wrong aide. Overcast edgt s and press op( n. Baste hem and stitch around outside and neck of bib the same width as on bottom of apron. To attach the bib, fold from lower edge to right side a margin M inch wide and place it on wrong side of band at the top and in the middle. Baste; stitch two rows. Finishing. — Draw all threads throush to wrong side, tie in double knots and trim closely. Press the apron. RngggWtioM to Teachers and Parents. — This apron is the style used by the students of Home Economics in the University of Nebraska. It has proved to be the simplest and most practicable kind of apron. The bib protects the waist and requires no buttoning or pinning. The ties are easier to keep in order than a band with buttons. The corners are rounded to prevent catching in doorways, etc. The round pocket does not hold bits of lint and dust as one with square corners. There are many other suitable materials beside the ones named, but these are commonly used. Attention should be called to the fact that care - ful measuring, basting and tying of threads are essential to any well finished garment. Directions for Making a Work Apron By Gertrude S. Rowan, University of Nebraska This apron should be as nearly as possible the style shown in the Illustration. A simple pattern may be cut at home by following the measurements given In the diagram. If desired one may procure a pattern of the same general style. Lay pattern on material according to diagram. In cutting allow seams % inch wide, \ x k inches on backs, and 2&gt;&gt;4 inches on the bottom for hems. Cut bias pieces for finish at the neck 1 % inches wide. Baste front, sides and back to - gether, also shoulder seams. Fit apron. Begin all basting at the top of the garment, and baste from top down. Finish belt and insert in under arm seam at the waist line. After making changes stitch the seams. Piece sleeves, gather top between seam and notch, also gather the bottom. Put on the cuffs, and insert sleeves in the arm holes, placing the seam 2 % inches in front of under arm seam. Turn hem on backs % inch wide and on the bottom 2% inches.

Before making up a shirt waist of washab'e material it is ad - visable to shrink it by thoroughly dampering and pressing with a hot Iron. If it is not desirable to shrink all of the material, the neck band «hould be shrunk.

BISHOP, State Superintendent THE CORX FLAXT The Legend The corn, or maize plant, is one of the most important of the cereals. The term cereal comes from Ceres, who was the goddess of grain and the harvest. She was the mother of Proserpine, who was a young woman of great beauty. While she was gathering flowers on the plains of Nysi she was kidnapped by the god of the lower regions, I'luto, and r carried to his realms to be his Queen. Ceres, her mother, was stricken with grief and searched all over the world for her daughter. Sh« finally shut herself up in a temple and refused to be comforted. Ab she was the goddess of grain and harvest, this caused a universal famine. Jupiter, who was the superior god, finally had Proserpine returned to her mother, but. unfortunately, she had eaten part of a pomegranate, which condemned her to spend a part of her time In the lower regions, but allowed her liberty to be with her mother In ■unshine, the remainder of the tin In this myth of the ancients, Proserpine represents the grains of seed which must be planted in the ground, "the lower regions." For a part cf the time the stalk comes above the ground and bears the grain in the sunshine "the time when Proserpine Is with her mother. the Goddess Ceres." The American Indians have a very beautiful legend about the corn, with which most children are familiar. The story is told in the beautiful poem, "Hiawatha." by Longfellow. It would be a good plan to read this story of Mondamin to the children and have it thoroughly understood History Indian corn, or maize, was not known in Europe, Asia, Africa, or any of the eastern world, until after Columbus discovered America. He found the Indian cultivating this strange plant with its golden ears rnd silken streamers in all parts of the new world from Chili to l New England. It is supposed to have originated in the Peninsula of Yucatan or some territory near there. Corn is the same kind of a V re.

There are about forty (or other number) of acres in this corn field, which is an average corn field in this neighborhood. The rows of corn are three feet, six inches apart, and the hills are three feet, six inches apart in the rows (or other distance the teacher may suggest) In most of the hills are three stalks of corn, but in a few there are four, in a less number two. and occasionally one. In walkin through the corn, I found three hills that had no stalks, showing tt seed corn was not planted, or if planted, it either did not grow or the young plants were destroyed. There was an average of three stalks to a hill. The stalks were five fwt, six inches tall and three and a half inches in circumference, having ears three and a half feet from the ground. The cars had shacks of ten inches average length, and the tips, eighteen out of twenty-eight ear?, were covered by the husks The majority of the husks on the ears with covered tips were coars and harsh, while the husks on the ears with uncovered tips w coarse and few in number.

Sweet or Sugar Corn — (Zea Saceharnta) This kind of corn is known best by the translucent, horny appear - ance of tne kernels and their more or less crinkled, wrinkled or shriveled condition and sweet taste. The first sweet corn cultivated In America was secured from the Susquehanna Indians in 1779 by Captain Richard Eegnall, who accompanied General Sullivan on hi3 expedition to subdue the Six Nations. (Who were the "Six Nations," and where did they live?) Sweet corn is used mostly for roasting ears and for canning purposes. It is eo seldom that we now cook corn in any other way than by boiling or frying, that we scarcely remember why the term "rcasting ears" is used. The Indians roasted the corn in the ashes. The husks were left on. Our ancestors found it convenient to roast the corn in the same way in the old fireplace. Camping parties often enjoy this treat. It is a matter of Interest to know that Nebraska produces more ■wcet corn for seed than any other state in the union. Flint Corn This is a very hard variety with smooth grains. It is grown most where the climate is cold and the seasons short, as it matures earlier than the dent varieties. It is the kind that was raised by the Pilgrim fathers in New England. It is sometimes used in Nebraska in the place of sweet corn because it matures eariy. At some of our corn chows in the west and north parts of the state some excellent exhibit* have been made of various colored flint corn. Dent Corn The most common field corn in Nebraska is the so-called Dent corn. It received this name because of the slight indentation at the top of each kernel. This depression is caused by the grain beginning to harden at the point that is in the cob. Flint corn begins like pop - corn to harden at the surface, thus leaving a small hard outer surface. </seg>

If the ear tapers rapidly toward the tip and 1 w kernels it is a sign that the corn is degenerating. The shank should be smooth and small, but large enough so that there will be no danger of the ear falling from the stock. The shape of the kernels should be uch that they fit snugly together from tip to point. The shape of tho kernel has much to do with the net amount of corn that can be grow on a given cob. If the kernels are square, round, or too pointed they do not fit closely together. It is important in planting corn to have the kernels the same size otherwise the planter will not drop the same number of kernels, and the stand will be uneven. Teachers could well have a number of contests in corn judging before the farmer's institutes are helB In their sections. This will arouse interest and give the boys practice in judging so that they may select the best ears of their own corn, both at county contests and at the state contest at Lincoln, January 17-22, 1910.

To create a demand abroad for our corn it was necessary to send speakers and demonstrators to show foreigners how to use corn. If you were sent abroad to get people interested In. buying corn, how many uses could you name? The United States bulletins and the Nebraska Corn Book may suggest uses of which you may lot think. Corn is used in the manufacture of over 100 different articles. The teacher may help pupils trace corn through some of the various processes and to different markets of the v/orld. On the map follow the possible routes of travel of Nebrask'a corn products. This can be used for composition work and for geography as well Besides being used to make corn meal, hominy, starch, whiskey glucose, etc., corn is used for making linoleum, and rubber for heels of shoes. !t may be interesting to know that a preparation from the epongy pith of corn is used in making explosives, and another prepara- tion of pith is used under ! plat ond tends to stop projectiles from the cannons. If a hole is made below the surface of the water the pith swells and helps to fill it up. The husks are used for mattresses and the manufacture of paper They are sometimes woven or braided into mats. Any district school can afford this material for manual training purposes. Husks may bomeiimes take the place of raffia for practice work. Pupils will find pleasure in weaving a husk rug fcr the school house floor. We must not forget the great use of stalks for fodder. In some states corn fodder is cut green and stored in air-tight structures called ■llos, where it is kept until winter when it is fed fresh and green to stock, especially milk cows. Cows fed from ensilage (food from silo) give more milk and more butter fat than when fed on dry fodder. The great bulk of corn is fed to animals. The farther from a good market that corn is raised, the larger per cent of it is fed. (Have pupils give reasons.) A bushel of corn will, under favorable condi - tions, make about ten or eleven pounds of pork. This means more to Nebraska than it does to Illinois because of the difference in freight to Chicago. How much farther from Chicago is Hastings than Bloomington? If hogs are worth five cents a pound how much can a farmer afford to pay for corn to feed these hogs, counting that a bushel will make ten pounds? If corn is worth 60 cents a bushel, how much must hogs be worth per pound in order to make it profitable for a farmer to feed them his corn?

It is recommended that these recipes be tried several times during the month until the results are as nearly perfect as possible and also that the work may be done quickly. Remember the table of measurements as It is given in the General Plans, and that all the measurements are to be level full. Read and etudy over the instructions in the first bulletin. In addition to the work In Cockery, the first four cf the eight fundamental stitches, which are called running, overcasting, basting and beroming, are studied. The cloth, thread and needles required for doing the work are enclosed. Read the directions very carefully before attempting the work, and be careful to keep the work as neat and clean as possible. The sewing Is to be returned with the report card in cooking. Nebraska lfciys' and (iirls' Cluh. E. C. BISHOP. April 11, 1910. Superintendent. </seg>

The first four: running, overcasting, basting and hemming are studied In this first lesson. Running and Overcastin, Materials required Percale: 6 Inches long and 3 inches wide. Thread: No. 60 white cotton. Needle: No. 9. Running The running stitch is a straight row of even stitches, as much cloth being taken up as is passed over each time. About ten stitches to an inch Is an average size running stitch. Thread the needle, having at least twelve inches of thread, and a very small knot at the end of the thread. Begin at the right side of the cloth at the point marked (1) and take very even, fine stitches to (2). Fasten the end by taking an extra stitch on top of the last stitch.

Fill out report card and send in promptly SWEET PEAS AND HOW TO GROW THEM By Val Keyser In order to encourage the cultivation of flowers by our Nebraska boys and girls, a few suggestions concerning Sweet Pea culture are added to this bulletin. There is, perhaps, no other flower that furnishes such a variety of colors, and which ran be grown under such varied climatic condi - tions, as the Sweet Pea. If properly cared for, a short row of Sweet Peas will furnish beautiful, fragrant bouquets for the adornment of the houee from May to August. It requires so little attention that we cannot afford to miss the pleasure of having these flowers. Varieties There are dozens of valuab varieties of S-s"eet Peas which can juses. The varieties known as the rongest growers and most profuse as separate varieties or mixed. It be secured from any of the seed h Spencer Type are considered the s bloomers. They can be purchased Is almost always better to buy different varieties and mix the seed to suit one's fancy. It is very Interesting to work out the color combina - tions in this manner. Planting Perhaps the most Important step in the guccesful growing of Sweet Peas is to have them properly planted. The following direction* shou.d be carefully observed. Die; n trench ton to twelve inches deep and at least one foot wide. F&gt;'1 in the bo'.iom of this trench four to tlx Inches of well rotted manure, taken from the cow rtables. Cover the manure with about two inches of good soil and pack this down firmly. Then fill in with a little !ocse din, perhaps a half inch, and plant the seeds. Place them about three to the inch in the trench. Cover these with about two and one-half inches of well firmed soil; thla will leave the trench slightly hollow, which will aid in watering. Be sure to use plenty of water so that the manure in the bottom of the trench will be thoroughly soaked. It will heat slightly and hasten th» germination of the peas. Dig the trench the long way north and south. It Is, as a rule, better to have the rows running north and south. A double row from eight to twelve inches apart is usually best. If the trench is carefully prepared the seed can be planted on each side and the trellis placed in the center to support both rows. </seg>
            <seg id="p259">210 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Care and Cultivation Sweet peas are climbers and need a trellis for 6upport. A strip of woven wire fence, thirty inches high is excellent for this purpose. A strong stick can be set at each end of the row to support the wire. Keep the ground well hoed and moist until the peas are two to three Inches high, then apply a top dressing of well rotted manure, being careful not to cover the vines. The ground must be kept well watered, not flooded, neither should it be allowed to become dry and bard. As soon as the peas commence to bloom, the flowers should be clipped. A neglected flower will furnish a seed pod in a few days. These pods should be carefully picked off and the period of bloom will thereby be greatly lengthened. Insect Enemies and Disease Sometimes Sweet Peas are Kverely damaged by mildew; in which case they may be sprayed with a weak solution of Bordeaux Mixture. The most serious trouble, however, is the Red Spider, which can be largely prevented by the use of water. \Vhere hydrant water is used so that the pressure is sufficient, by watering the vines from the bottom up, the work of the spider will be greatly lessened. In cases where hydrant water is not accessible, the vines should be sprayed in the game manner with some forced spray. A small pump for this purpose Is quite inexpensive. Where the vines are badly infested, a solution of soap-suds in which a little tobacco is dissolved, will kill the spider. General Suggestic The reason for planting the rows north and south is to avoid di - rect rays of the sun. Sweet Peas will do well when partly shaded. They like a cool, moist climate. Care should be taken not to place the trench near the roots of large trees as this trench, made as above described, will furnish a very rich soil, which would encourage the growth of the trees and sap the fertility and moisture which should go to the support of the Sweet Peas. If the above directions are carefully followed, an abundance of beautiful, fragrant flowers should be produced. </seg>

These report cards are to be returned during July in the self-addressed envelope. Bacteria, Yeasts, Molds: Canning and Preserving. Before going to the work of canning and preserving it is well to understand the pro - cess thoroughly and to know the conditions which make so many pre- cautions necessary. Successful canning and preserving depends, first, upon the destruc- tion of all bacteria, yeasts and molds present in the vegetable or fruit; and, second, upon perfect sealing so that no new germ is admitted. Great care must be taken in order to prevent the spoiling of any goods kept for winter use. The first precaution Is to use earthen or granite ware utensils. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 213 and to use only silver or wooden spoons for stirring; second, cook thor- y al so that all gc life is entirely destroyed; third, with boiling water the glass or ran in which the material is to be kept, fill the hot r ptaole ovi r full while the ma- terial is at boiling temperature, and al the rect ptacle at once.

Other forms of mold are mildew, ringworm, and molds on the skin. Sunlight and draughts of air retard or destroy germ life. The best way to avoid germ life in food Is either to keep the food in a re frigerator or very cold place, or else to boil or bake the food before using. The best way to avoid the germ life in the various rooms of the house Is to air thoroughly the rooms, admit all the sunlight pos- sible, and ke«p as free from dust as possibU All that has been said of the house applies to the barns and milk rooms as well Since this germ life Is so commonly present In putting up fruits for winter use, great care must be exercised to destroy all germs in the Jars or glasses and covers, and to prevent any others getting in while the fruit is being stored To prevent germs in the fruit a reliable recipe should be carefully followed.

Begin at the edge farthest from the folded edge and overhand the edges of the buttonhole closely, taking the stitches three threads deep. Have no knot. Begin at the same place, put the needle in the material with the point toward you, draw it half way through, take the two threads at the eye of the needle and carry them under the needle from the right. Draw the needle out so the thread is drawn from you to bring the loop thus made to the raw edge. Have the stitches an even distance apart. Work around the corner by slanting the stitches so the buttonhole Is rounding at the end. When the end is finished work across the side to the point opposite where the buttonhole was started. This end is finished with a bar. To make the bar, draw the needle down through the first loop, then up through the last one, and draw the stitch tight to bring the sides of the buttonhole close to at three more stitches in the same plaoe. Work four buttonhole stitches over these threads, having the loop on the edge of the buttonhole. Draw the thread through on the wrong side and fasten firmly. Make the other three buttonholes in the same way. Buttons To locate the buttons pin the material with the buttonholes on the piece to be used for the buttons with the two hems exactly overlapping. With pins indicate the location of the button. The center of the button should come in the circular end of the buttonhole. After the four buttons are located, and it is certain the buttons and buttonholes will be opposite when finished, then sew on the first button as indicated in the cut. Double the thread and tie a small knot in the end. Put the needle through from the right side first, then back through the button in order to hide the knot. Place a pin across the top of the button and sew over It, always keeping the threads straight and running parallel with the direction of the buttonhole. Sew through each pair of holes five times; take the pin out, then bring the thread out between material and button and wind thread around the stitches underneath the button several times. This prevents the buttonhole wearing the threads through bo quickly Sew the remaining three buttons on In the same way. Button the two pieces together.

VAL KEYSER, Superintendent Farmers' Institutes University of Nebraska. July 0 WEF.DS he old saying, "The Weed follows the Plow," has stood the test of time and experience. When Nebraska was a wild prairie, un- molested by man, very few weeds were found; but as the plow broke the soil, weeds came in from other states by railroads, by streams, by birds, rabbits, horses, and other animals, until at the present time they have become a serious pest Any plant out of place might be considered a weed; for instance. oats or corn in a potato patch could be considered a weed, as such plants would doubtless be injurious to the best development of the potato crop. However, from the farmer's standpoint a weed is "any Injurious, troublesome, or unsightly plant that is at the same time useless, or comparatively so." Weeds cause considerable loss by: 1. Robbing the soil of plant food and moisture that should de- velop the croj 2. Reducing the value of the farm by making it unsightly, un- profitable, etc. 3. Choking out other crops by shading and excluding the sun light. 4. Increasing the cost of every operation on the farm, as har- rowing, fanning, plowing. Harboring many Insects or fungus diseases which later attack cultivated plants 6. Poisoning or injuring stock, tainting milk, irritating th« mouth of stock when eating hay containing weeds One should always bear In mind that preventing weeds from coming on to the place Is much more profitable and sensible than to try to destroy them after they have once gained a foothold. However, </seg>
            <seg id="p271">222 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT any weed can be destroyed by persistent effort and a perfect under - standing of its nature and habits. The farmer should always plant seed that is free from weed seed. No weed seeds should be allowed to mature. When animals are transferred from one farm to another their hair should be carefully examined for cockleburs, burdocks, etc. This is especially true of horses and sheep. Every precaution should be taken to prevent the introduction of weeds. A short rotation of crops is without doubt the most sensible and practical method of pre - venting or eradicating most of the common \ve e ds and insects which infest the fields of Nebraska. CLASSIFICATION' AND METHODS OF DESTRUCTION Generally speaking, weeds are divided into three classes — annual, biennial, and perennial. Annual: When speaking of annual plants we mean those which live but one year and then die down. Black Mustard, Great Rag Weed, and Foxtail for examples. These can be destroyed by stopping the production of seed. However, it will be necessary to watch them very closely, as the seeds of some annual plants can live in the ground for a number of years. As these seeds are moved near the surface of the soil by plowing and harrowing they will begin to grow. There - fore, by merely cutting off the tops each year and thus preventing seeding, one only reduces the number of weeds. If the plants have been allowed to seed, some farmers practice burning off the dead weeds and in doing 60 destroy a great many of the seeds that would otherwise form plants. They then plow shallow, leaving the seeds near the surface. This causes the seeds to germinate quickly, when they can be destroyed by shallow cultivation. Many farmers do not put any crop on the land when they are treating it as mentioned above, but in most sections this is considered a needless waste. Crops that can be cultivated the greater part of the season, such as corn, potatoes, beets, cabbage, etc., ran be raised at the same time that the weeds are being destroj-ed without materially interfering with the operation. These annual weeds usually grow where the ground has been plowed. Therefore, it does not seem wise to allow ground to remain without a crop after it has once been broken. Sometimes such weeds as Foxtail, Barnyard Grass, and many others are often allowed to go to seed in gardens, potato patches, etc. These can be destroyed by mowing a short time after the harvesting is done. Biennials: These are plants that live two years and then die. They spend the first year in storing up nourishment which they use the second year in producing a good crop of seeds. A great many biennial plants, such as radishts, have fleshy or taproots. Examples of biennial weeds are wild carrot, burdock, and wild parsnip. These plants are often caused to spread or send out more shoots when cut off above the ground. If cut off below the crown with a </seg>
            <seg id="p272">INDISTRIAL EDUCATION 223 spade, dandelion digger, or hoe they generally die. In the fall of the first year one will often see biennial plants sending up small shoott upon which to produce next year's seed. They should be cut below the crown with some sharp instrument at this time, as they are more tender than they would be a year later. Biennial weeds are easily destroyed by putting the ground into such crops as beets, corn, potatoes, etc. They are, however, often found in fence lines, old hay meadows, waste places, etc.. where it it impossible to cultivate. In such places the mower, spade, fire, etc., can be brought into use Perennials: Plants which live from year to year for an indefinite length of time are called perennials. Some of the immense trees In the forests of California and Mexico are known to be hundreds of years old. Canada Thistle, Soap Weed, Quack Grass, and Yellow Dock are examples of perennial weeds. Some perennials die down each winter, while others keep a rosette of green leaves above the ground the entire year Many of these plants not only produce seeds, but also have "un derground stems" that travel throueh the soil and send up shoots at irregular distances. Quack Grass Milk Weed, and many other weeds are propagated in this way. Oth rs reproduce themselves by sending out roots wherever a joint of th out roots wherever a joint of th stems touches the ground. To de- stroy weeds of this class, all prot ction of seeds must be stopped and etrc in most cases the roots and other parts below the surface of the ground must be destroyed. The production of seeds can be prevented by mowing before the seeds are formed. One must pursue different methods when destroying the portion below the ground, as much depends on the size of the piece of ground infested, the character of tc. The following suggestions can be beneficially th en combating weeds of the perennial class f Where only small plots are affected, tar or building paper can be laid on the ground over the plants, and small pegs driven into the ground alone: the edges to hold the paper in place. The roots can also be dug up and removed. Certain chemicals, such as crude sulphuric acid, coal oil, and carbolic acid have been u=ert very successfully, their great drawback being the expense necessarily involved when applied. 5V When the plot is near the barnyard it is often advisable to place a hog lot over it. If the hogs are fed on the worst infested place they soon stamp out the weeds. Another method commonly used in pasture is to place lumps of rock salt on the areas affected. The rains dis solve the salt, which either hinders materially or entirely destroy* the weeds. As the cattle generally visit the ?alt several times in the course of a day, they stamp out the remainder of the weeds. Of The building of hay and straw s'acks upon small patches has met with limited success. Sheep, hogs, and the unlimited use of the hoe and spade are to be recommended. In fact, any method that ■will keep the plant from coming above the ground for one season will destroy it forever. Where larger areas are infested, "smother crops" </seg>
            <seg id="p273">224 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT are often used. Examples of these crops are Hemp, Buckwheat, Millet. Cane, Milo Maize, Sorghum, and Kaffir Corn. When this method is to be employed, the ground should be stirred from early spring until the crop is sown. This cultivation can best be done with the plow. disk, and harrow. When the plow is used it should be very sharp, otherwise the roots and vines are dragged to other parts of the field where they may again start to grow, hence enlarging the area inf' Sow the seed at such a time as will encourage quick germination.

The purplish white flowers of the horse nettle which appear from June to October resemble those of the potato, to which it is closely related. It grows from eight to twenty-four inches in height and its branches are covered with stiff hairs and sharp spines or "stickers.' The leaves are shaped somewhat like those of an oak tree and have spines on the larger veins. The seeds are produced on the branche in little berries. The plant is also reproduced by rootstocks which send up shoots at irregular distances. This plant thrives best in loose, sandy soil which is easily penetrated by its roots and it is very little affected by ordinary cultivation. It can be destroyed by pulling grubbing, and spudding and by the use of smother crops. DOCKS (Genus-Rumex) Curled Dock There are many kinds of docks but the two most common in this cc section are the pale-leaved and the curled. Both are perennial. The leaves of the pale-leaved species are somewhat paler and larger than the curled, wrinkled leaves of the curled variety. The pale green flowers appear during June and August.

I Chinch bugs are more numerous and do much more damage in seasons than in wet. They have caused thousands of dollars of afee to crops in this state. They may increase in number for three our years, and then almost entirely disappear. There is a white ;us called the chinch bug fungus, the growth of which is favored by seasons. This fungus grows on the body of the chinch bug and ;it. The fence lines arcund the fields should be kept free from all trash and rubbish, and the weeds should be mowed and burned. Chinch bugs rarely ever do serious damage to the oat crop. But in seaeonB favorable to them they do serious damage to wheat, rye, barley, and forage crops. When the wheat is cut about the 4th of July, they may pass from th:a field into the cornfield. AVhen they appear in such ■umbers, it is advisable to plow a strip ten to fifteen feet wide between ween the infested field and the cornfield. Plow a furrow through this broken ■trip, making the sides as vertical as possible. Pulverize a narrow itrip on each side of the furrows, dig holes two feet deep in the bot - tom of this furrow, about ten to fifteen feet apart. The insects upon reaching the ditch will tumble in and are unable to climb up the steep •ides. They can then be killed by dragging a log up and down the furrow with a horse. These which fall into the deeper holes can be </seg>
            <seg id="p290">destroyed with coal-oil. Some farmers place a tar line between tha affected fields and the first trench. This will prove very effective. CITWORMS The cutworms vary In color from light brown to dark brown. They ri a smooth skin and often stripes running the long way of their es. Cutworms injure the plant by eating off the leaves and often the plant off close to the ground. They work at night and spend the day time curled up under clods, or bury themselves just beneath. the surface of the ground The eggs from which these worms are hatched are laid in grass lands late in the season by grayish-brown moths. These eggs hatch the same fall and the young larvae live on the roots of grass until severe weather sets in. They then bury themselves in the ground until the next spring. The number of broods varies from one to three, depend- ing on the Bperies. In most cases the larva has reached its maturity ■the first of July, after which it pupates. The moth appears toward latter part of the season. It is always advisable to plant a field affected with cutworms late in the season, as they are most injurious the year following sod. Early plowing is one of the best method* of preventing it from destroying the crop. Poisoning has also proved effective. When a field is located along the side of a meadow, it has been found effective to poison fresh clover with a solution of one pound of Paris green to fifty gallons of water and sprinkle along the border rows. It is also beneficial to mix one pound of Paris green with thirty pounds of bran and apply to the field with a drill. GRASSHOPPERS There are many forms of grasshoppers, but the same methods of destruction apply to practically all. Grasshoppers are so generally known that it is not necessary to give a description of them in this bulletin In the fall the female lays her eggs in bunches or pods in th» ground. These pods contain from twenty to fifty eggs and are usually buried about one inch deep. The eggs are usually deposited along fence rows, ditches, waste corners, meadows, etc. The hoppers ar» hatched the following spring. At first the damage of the nymphs, ss the young hoppers are called, is not very noticeable but after they grow older their presence is often disastrous to certain growing crops. Grasshopper </seg>

It consists only of a long sheet iron pan fastened to two runners and having a strong piece of cloth fastened to the back of the pan to an upright frame. Place water in the pan and add enough coal-oil to form a thin film over the surface. Hitch a horse to one of the outside runners and bring a rope from the other outside runner to the hame-staple of the harness. As the hopper dozer is dragged through the field many of the grasshoppers fly against the apron and drop into the solution. The hopper dozer has proved most successful on alfalfa and clover fields. Certain fungus diseases have proved effective in some localities. WHITE GRUBS The life cycle of white grubs is very interesting. The eggs which produce them are laid by the female "June Bugs" or "May Beetles." These beetles are thick-bodied and brown in color. They are often seen flying about electric lights, lamps, etc., at night. The beetles live but </seg>

The eggs ar are generally deposited two inches in the ground and hatch In from ten &gt;m ten days to three weeks. The young grubs eat roots of grass the first season. They hibernate as a larva and appear in the same form 1 the next spring. In June or July of the second year they puj.ate and during August they appear in the adult stage. The adult usually does not leave its birthplace until the next spring, when it comes forth in the form of a "June Bug."

            <seg id="p293">244 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT feeds on the young roots. These insects are often found in our lawn grasses but not in sufficient numbers to do great damage. After the ground is broken up and planted to corn, we find them attacking the hills of corn in great numbers. They may not only destroy the roots of the young plants, but often eat the grain itself before it has ger - minated. They remain in this worm or larva stage for two years. They then pupate or pass into a dormant stage. This generally occurs late In the summer — July or Angust. After three or four weeks a long, brownish beetle, known as the click-beetle, comes forth. This beetle either buries itself in the ground or hides under rubbish, or in other sheltered places. The wireworms do not confine their ravages to corn alone, but Injure almost every crop on the farm. After the worm has once attacked a plant no poison can be applied that will kill the worm and yet not injure the plant. As the larva lives two years, rotation of crops does not entirely eradicate this pest, which often does its worst damage the second year after plowing. When the sod is plowed in the fall it is often advisable to sow to winter - wheat. If clover or oats follow the winter-wheat the two years neces - eary to develop the larva will have passed. The ground should be fall plowed as this will turn the pupa to the surface where they can be eaten by birds and destroyed by freezing. When it is necessary to replant the corn, it is advised to straddle the old rows. The worms will stay around the old plants for some time if left; otherwise, they would immediately attack the corn last planted. The first planting can be plowed out later on. STALK-IiOKEIt Adult Moth of the Stalkborer Because of the nature of its injury this pest is sometimes called the "Heart Worm." The stalk-borer attacks wheat, oats, timothy, pota - toes, corn — in fact, a large number of plants with soft or pithy stems. The larva fs from an inch to an inch and a quarter in length and of various shades of purplish brown, the color depending on the age </seg>

This oest is easily recognized by five white stripes running the entire length of its back and a white stripe on each side extending back from the fourth segment. The mouse-colored, night-flying moth of the stalk-borer lays the eggs that produce the larvae . These eggs are laid in the fall in the grass and either hatch the same fall or next spring. The larvae live on weeds and grasses when first hatched, but when more mature attack cultivated crops. Plants injured by the stalk-borer usually turn white at the top, although the remainder of the plant may remain its usual color. This light color of the top is due to the larvae boring into the stem. Corn is usually attacked when it is less than two feet high. The stalk-borer enters through a small hole made in the stem and burrows upward from this entrance.

When the heads of timothy and other grasses begin to turn white, due to^the presence of the stalk-borer, it should be made into hay and removed at once. It is very seldom that an entire field is destroyed, as the ravages of the stalk-borer are usually confined to the borders. CORN-ROOT APHIS The corn-root aphis, also known as the corn-root louse, is a pest which has been rapidly increasing the last few years. Plants affected by the corn-root aphis will appear yellow and warped. No other signs may be visible, as the aphis works on the roots, where it sucks the liquid nourishment from the plant The corn-root aphis is a soft bluish green insect. It is so sluggish and helpless that it is unable to make its own way about. Therefore it is carried from place to place by the common red field ant. This ant does not injure the corn directly, but it takes care of the eggs of the aphis which are laid in the fall. Very little injury is done by the aphis wh* ) very slowly, but when the field ant and root aphis work in conjunction great damage is sometimes done. The first gent-ration of aphis is wingless; the second generation contains both ■winged and v.inglfss young. Aphis are also known to produce living young which lay the eggs in the late fall for the ants to store away. There arc about twelve generations in one season. One female will give birth to ten or fifteen living young nee the corn-root aphis is found in greater quantities on ground which has been in corn several years a short rotation period in corn Is advisable.

            <seg id="p295">246 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT plowing, either spring or fall, together with deep disking is one of the best known preventives. This method of cultivation destroys many of the ant burrows which contains the- eggs of the aphis. It will also rid the field of weeds upon which the young root lice feed until the corn begins to grow. XORTHKRX CORN-ROOT WORM The northern corn-root worm is about as large around as a common needle and varies in length from one-half to three-fifths of an inch. It Is white throughout with the exception of its head, a spot on the last segment, and the top of the first segment, which are of light brown color. The beetle lays the eggs that produce the larvae in the cornfield about one inch beneath the surface of the ground, where they remain throughout the winter. : In June the larvae come forth an attack the roots ot The corn-root worm dots its greatest damage during the months cf June, July and August.

When wind strikes a field in which corn-root worms have betn working whole plant falls, often exposing the injured roots. This uprooting of the corn is often incorrectly attributed to wornout soil. Of a heavy rain the short, lacerated roots will give way and the stalks lodge. These pests are easily destroyed by a rotation of crops, as they eat nothing but corn roots. When the corn root3 are removed they etarve to deuh.

The footless larva of the bill-bug is white, with a hard, dark brown head. It feeds on the roots of timothy and other grasses. The larva pupates in the fall, and the winter is passed in the adult stage. The bill-bug attacks the em and leaves of the corn plant. Working with its head down it eat long, irregular holes in the stem and tissues of the young plant which is very noticeable as the plant de - velops. The damage done each year by these pests varies greatly. Late planted corn is rarely greatly injured by the bill-bug. This is a very common practice among experienced farmers. However, there is cne species found in low, swampy places that attacks the corn as late as June. Fall plowing is injurious to the development of all known spe - cies of bill-bugs. </seg>

The potato beetle is about three-eighths of an inch long, very plump, being almost as wide as it is long. It is light yellow in color with ten black stripes running lengthwise of the wings. The larva, are ugly, soft, slim creatures. They are dark red when first batched but become lighter in color as they mature. There are generally two genera- tions in one season, although some authorities have reported three. The beetles hibernate; that is, pass into the "resting" stage in the ground generally at a depth of eight or ten inches. Thty appear again early in the spring. At this season they fly a great deal during the warmer part of the day. These flights generally take place before the potatoes appear above the ground. As soon as the potatoes are up the beetles turn their attention to the tender sprouts. After a few days of feeding, the female deposits the eggs, which number from five hundred to one thousand in a single year. These eggs which usually hatch in from four to seven days are deposited on the underside of leaves. The larvae which pass through four stages, mature in from sixteen days to three weeks, after which they pupate. They remain in the pupa stage about ten days.

Chickens, ducks, skunks, snakes and toads eat potato bugs with relish. However, these natural methods are not sufficient to completely control the beetle, and sprays are often resorted to in order to save the crop. A very effective spray can t made by mixing one pound of Paris green and one pound of lime with one hundred gallons of water. This solution should be applied with a y hand sprinkler or a spray pump. </seg>

            <seg id="p331">282 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT SELECTING POTATOES FOR THE CONTEST (By Val Keyser. ) The first thing is to study the score card and become thoroughly acquainted with the requirements of the card. This score card was drawn up for the boys' contest work, it being necessary to have a standard by which the exhibitors and the judge can be guided. As soon as you are familiar with the essential points which compose a good exhibit, place the potatoes which have been chosen as worthy of consideration on a table before you, and carefully select best tubers which conform to the regulations of the score card. I two exhibits are equally good in all respects, except size, the larger potatoes will be given first place unless the judge should deem them too large. It has been found that medium-sized tubers of proper shape usually cook bitter and are more profitable for seed and for market. This applies to early varieties rather than late Score Card for Potatoes Variety Name Value Bcore Scor Uniformity of Exhibit 10 Trueness of Type 10 Shape of Tuber 15 Size of Tuber 15 Eyes Skin Texture of Tuber Soundness 10 I I Freedom from Blemishes I 15 | Totals I 100 Contestant's Name Date Explanation Score Card of Uniformity of Exhibit — Select twelve potatoes that are uniform in size, color, and which have uniformly well defined eyes of the same depth. Trueness to Type — Each potato should be typical of the variety to which it belongs, i. e., the characteristics should be clearly de- fined, enabling one to easily identify it. Shape of Tuber — The shape of the potato will depend largely upon variety, but the flat-round or oval shape is favored, becai these shapes usually give best quality tuber Size of Tuber — As a rule, select medium-sized potatoes, but two exhibits are otherwise equal, choose the larger, unless pota </seg>

            <seg id="p355">306 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT We are also indebted to the Nebraska Corn Improvers' Association for their work with us, both in financial support and in co-operative assist- ance. The Nebraska Farmer, the Twentieth Century Farmer, the Nebraska Teacher, and the Nebraska School Review have been very helpful in their co-operation. The state press has also been a large factor in promoting the interests of the work. County farmers' insti- tutes, women's clubs, and other organizations have united with county and city superintendents, and teachers generally, to carry out the work In their respective localities. We are also indebted to a large number of citizens, business organzations, and commercial clubs throughout the state for material assistance in providing for local and state conven- tions and contests. Over 32,000 Nebraska boys and girls are now enrolled in the state. county, and school district clubs and in various lines of work in agri- culture, domestic science, and manual training. Many of the young people who took up this work with us nearly six years ago have com- pleted their education in rural, graded, and high schools, and a large number have finished state normal and university courses and are now numbered among our teachers, business men and women and are help- ing others who are younger and new to the work The action of numerous boards of education providing for regular courses in agriculture, domestic science, and manual training, in the public schools of the state, is appreciated as a recognition of the efforts of the Nebraska boys' and girls' clubs to secure that training which has been too long neglected as a part of public school education.

Fourteen of these have laws requiring it to be taught in the rural schools; twelve require it in the graded schools; Texas designates schools with less than 300 scholastics as being required to teach it; ten states require it taught in the high schools; eleven more states are planning to pass such laws.

This should bo continued in the work in t jects which educate in more than mere art, and at the same time give art its best recognition. The course in grammar and composition should be vitalized by providing for the reproduction, in written and oral statement, of the associations of the child in his play, his work, and other home and school relationships. The proper use of nouns and verbs will then come to the child as a necessary accomplishment for the expression of his own thoughts which are a delight to him in both meditation and expression. Such work will help to eliminate the terrors of writ - ten composition and oral recitation. The technical study of agriculture Bhould not come before the high school and should be technical in only the agricultural high school. The whole problem in elementary industrial education is one of adaptation to the environment of the schools. Any form of industrial education whkh ia closely related to the development of the broader life of the child and which can be correlat - ed with the regular work of the public school should become a part of the general education of the child. The boy and girl educated in the city should receive in their educa - tion such introduction to agriculture as will acquaint them with the importance of agriculture as our great national resource, and give them a vision of rural life which will furnish an outlet for their ambition to find a place in the business and social world outside of the bounds of — —■•.*- «v t/uii,.uui in IUL' WUIK in OOOK- keeping.

When properly presented these become a very interesting and ; ication in home economics of as great value to the girl as to the boy.

            <seg id="p361">312 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT to the recognition that agricultural education pays as a business invest ment. The gaining of knowledge concerning agriculture has led to tt ( development of a science and an art. which offer to the student a fascinaating study, an intellectual development, and a moral which places agriculture in the foreground as a basic science and in higher degrees of development, as an In Nebraska wo now have more than four hundred high schools offering courses in agriculture. In establishing these courses we work- ed from the generally accepted idea that agriculture is so dependent upon geography, geology, botany, physics, chemistry, and zoology, that a fair knowledge of these subjects is necessary before the student is in the right attitude and position to take up the study of agriculture. Thia yet applies in considering agriculture ;is a technical science. But in i considering agriculture as related to primary anil second it is my opinion that agriculture should be the introductory or bas branch in el-imuiaiy science. With the proper introduction and Ution through the study of elementary agriculture, our boys ami girls will approach the study of botany, geography, physics, ph&gt; i chemistry, domestic science, geology, of interest and an attitude of love ; of interest and an attitude of love and intensity that will bring from these various branches result* which \ these various branches resulis which cannot be secured from the child who approach subjects witho subjects too often appear as drj •who approaches these subjects without such introduction, and to whom subjects too often appear as dry, dead matter yielding only mental scipline and class credits.

The Indian Uprising of 1884. , 5 The real cause of the uprising of the Indians in 1884 may not be generally known but according to Miss Sickels story it was due to the fact that Rose, the daughter of Red Cloud was compelled to make bread against her will in this school. Red Cloud was the chief of the Indians but was very unpopular among them. If they had had their way he would have been killed long before this. As it was he relied upon the white man for protection. 5 As mentioned above, the making of bread was alloted to Rose but to this she objected strenuously. One day after refusing to do her work she was ordered by Mies Sickels to go back to her baking; Bhe obeyed reluctantly but later sent for her father. In order to settle the dispute as to whether or not Rose was able to perform this work she was taken to the agency physician who decided that Rose had con - gumption. It was plain that the physician had been influenced by fear of Red Cloud in making his diagnosis. Nevertheless, Red Cloud had gotten "heart-bad" toward the white man. "Heart-bad" being Interpreted means, "I have nothing to do with you." * He therefore called a council of all the Indian nations and six tine by Mr. McGillycui .".gent of I vation and was given everj odation which thi could provide.

We view with satisfaction the establishment of additional normal schools which will render unnecessary the long continuance of junior normals and similar temporary institutions for the training of teachers. "We favor greater simplification and uniformity in the certification of teachers. "We favor the administration of the affairs of all state educational institutions for delinquents by a non-partisan board of control, which will appoint as heads of such institutions men and women of exper - ience, education, and broad human sympathy for those under their charge.

Assignment of Exhibit Space, For collective exhibits the amount of space which will be re - served in each lot will be indicated by the number of regulation cards (22x28 inches). This will be wall space. The exhibitor may fill this space by such arrangement of his exhibit as he desires. For work that cannot be mounted on cards, the exhibitor will be allowed to use shelves or floor space equivalent to the amount of space In - dicated by the number of cards 22x28 inches. 3. Labelling of Exhibit Cards and Exhibit The name of the respective school or county should appear on each separate card board of mounted exhibits. This should appear in large le'ters on each card. Each article in the exhibit should show in which grade work was done and may bear whatever data the ex - hibitor desires as to name of pupil and conditions under which the work was performed. 4. School Work. The work exhibited must be work done by pupils as a regular part of the school work done either during school hours or at home from instruction received in the regular work of the school. </seg>

We have made no attempt in the county to organize boys and girls clubs anil give special attention to agriculture and domestic science and provide local contests in the same. With the amount of supervision, school visitation in a county the size of this, clerical work, etc.. it seemed to be unwise to attempt the additional work occasioned by such organization, as poor, inefficient progress in such work is worse than no work. We have been working for a gradual and constant growth in our educational system. We have been urging be'ter quali - fications of teachers because with the teacher rests the success or fail - ure of a school generally. We have worked for bettor and closer grad - ation and classification of our rural schools. Our efforts have not been fruitless. The reading circle work as selected by the reading circle board has been carried in the county without alteration. For the pas few - years the work has been written work to be sent to the county super - intendent for his inspection. We have not found the reading circle meetings a success and only by request of teachers in the same school are any held. Frequently in these we find that the work has been covered only superficially. Formerly questions were printed with the mimeograph and a copy sent to each teacher at stated times, and last year the reading circle note book was used very satisfactorily and will be used this year. Many teachers have advanced from a plain certificate to a with credit or from a with credit to a with honor certificate by means of the credits earned in this work, to say nothing of the professional advancement made by such reading and a good beginning, with sev - eral volumes of a professional library. The matter of a coun-y high school has been talked of, but noth - ing definite has yet been done. Consolidation has not been attempted. A new four-room school building has just been completed at the little town of Brunswick, which will afford ample school room for some years. Dis ricts number 17 and 102 are building new rural school houses this year. Neligh expects a ward building in the course of a few months.

EDITH A. LATHROP OOLFAX COUNTY. The teachers of Colfax county hold eight teachers' meetings in V the county each year. Almost every teacher in the county is enrolled in one or more of these meetings, reading circle work as outlined by Thiry-six teachers completed th the reading circle board. Prac tically every school in the county possossis a school library. The nor - mal training course in high school in providing rural teachers has been The course of study is in use The teachers are made familiar with it by work in the teachers' institute and provides for a discu i sion a every teachers' meeting.

There are weak places to be strengthened before ideal conditions can be brought about in the rural districts. The educational spirit is growing stronger each year. There is a de - sire for better schools on the part of the parents and a demand by school boards for more professional? trained teachers, teachers of ex - also a willingness to increase ; he salaries of such teachers. This is a natural result of the progress that teachers themselves have made along this line. In view of the fact that one-third of our teachers are beginners each year, we welcome the X. T. class pupils as teachers and find that they, though Inexperienced, have a definite purpose in view, in vi are enthusiastic, willing to work and interested in the results of their teaching. I have been pleased to note that most of them, as soon as practical, continue their training at some good normal school. The reading circle work has been carried on very systematically for a number of years. All the teachers witli a lew exceptions do the reading, pn paring the work carefully and thoroughly.

This is shown earti year by the interest manifested at county, district, and state associations, in 'he reading circle work, and in the annual teachers' institute. The surplus of teachers at the opening of school in Sep'ember Is not as large as formerly, but only a few inexperienced teachers are employed each year. It is true, however, that, since a limited amount of normal training is required in our stale and since normal training courses have been put into certain high schools, school boards have come to realize that the election of a "beginner" is not necessarily an unwise step. After the opening of school work in September, the extra supply of legally qualified teachers is very small, since those who do not secure school positions here go to other counties or engage in other employment. &gt;n </seg>

The attendance of teachers at Junior Normals and the Normal Train - ing Courses in the High St lools in connection wi.h the pressure brought to bear by the new cer iflcation rulings is bringing us a stronger, more intellectual, be-t'er trained class of teachers than the county - could ever boas; of before. In the older sections of the county, 'he people are beginning to see the wisdom of consolidation and in two districts consolidated in the spring of 1910, one a rural and one a village school, a nice brick two etory school house takes the place of the two old frame ones. A woman holding a life certificate and with a number of years of varied experience in rural, grade and high school work is principal of the school receiving a salary of $75 per month while her assistant, a well qualified teacher receives $50. In .another consolidation a better equipped building takes the place of the old ones and a teacher, a graduate of an eleven grade High school is at the helm this year drawing a salary of $55. This las June th's school graduated an eighth grade class of five pupils, two of whom held first and second ranks among the graduates of the county, the school uself holding first rank among the schools of the county graduating eighth grade pupils. The teacher of this class was Miss Una Richards, a gradua'e of the Benkelmsn High School.

As we secure stronger and more experienced teachers, our County Teachers' Association grows better. Live officers with a local interest in the success of the meetings have furnished us good programs and we have promise of some good things for this year.

Along the industrial line we have sixty boys enrolled in the corn growing contest and thirty-five girls in the cooking contest, there is much interest displayed along these lines. Several of our town schools have science clubs and are doing splendid work. We are plan - ning an interesting meeting in this department this fall and hope to have our state superintendent with us. The compulsory education is carefully looked after and the law observed Emphasis is laid on the cleanliness of school buildings, the beau - tifying of the grounds, the best means for ventilating and heating. Districts are urged to furnish the best equipment possible as they are 6o much aid to the teacher in interesting the pupils and developing their minds and their bodies. The decorating of the school room is very essential, for children surrounded by pleasant and inspiring en - vironments can do more and better work. It also trains them to look for the beautiful and higher ideals in life. Teachers are urged not to be content with anything but the very best qualifications within their power. Consolidation of districts wherever possible is urged that they may be thereby able to pay better wages and receive the best in - struction and hold longer terms of school. Emphasis is laid on the importance of thoroughly mastering the eighth grade before trying to take advanced work. The requirements for an eighth grade promotion are nothing below 65 per cent with an average of not less than 7 5 per cent. C. F. STILWKLl County Superintendent GAGE COUNTY Few counties in the state are larger than Gage. Only two have more school districts. We number up to one hundred end sixty, but on account of consolidation of two districts we have really one less than that. This, our only example of consolidation, falls a little short of the ideal owing to the omission of the very important matter of provision for transportation, and the long distances greatly affect attendance. However, there is every indication that conditions are going to be improved. We belong to the Southeastern Association, and since it usually meets at our county seat, it has been the general custom to let this take the place of any formal county association, while reading circle work is the medium for smaller gatherings. The interest and attend - ance of teachers at the various associations and meetings is measured here, as everywhere else, by their interest and effectiveness in any other line of their work. Comparatively few schools boards are quite convinced to the point of allowing teachers to attend meetings on ful </seg>

True it is, that it 1» still difficult to find experienced teachers for the schools, and school* in the shadow of home for the teachers, but these very normal stu - dents are supplanting the mediocre teachers right along as most of them are cheerfully willing to work anywhere just so they have an opportunity of trying to make good. It is trite to say that about the only difficulties with the course of study arise from failure to follow it. In the one year for the new course, teachers have made a commendable effort to grade their schools so that it will be comparatively easy to locate the pupils in the course in the future. As for the matter of the daily program so closely related to this question of the yearly program, that is, the course of study, we have the usual difficulties to meet. It is not so impossible to sit down and write out what appears to be a good pro - gram, but some trouble usually occurs in the practice thereof. Of course this is generally due to scanty preparation of the plans for the day's work, and that is to be the burden of a great part of the work in this county this year. Gage county has always insisted on a high grade of qualifications on the part of teachers and we have arrived at the place where we do not need to consider third grade certificates. For years the number of such has been very small and lately none except in name hav» been granted, that is, an applicant may never have taught nor had normal training and so must bear the name of third grade on the certificate, but the certificate is in every way the equivalent of a sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p627">562 ond grade and is so considered. We hope that this pl'an will be one means of increasing the efficiency of our teachers. The Boy's and Girls' clubs of Gage county are an important factor In the educational work. This year we have one of the large clubs in. correspondence with the state office, besides a much larger one which is working on a smaller scale with the county superintendent. We are not just sure how much of a show we can make — have not thought of that yet — but we are doing a lot of work. It is hoped that it will be possible to have a few picnics during July at various places in the county in order to bring together as many of the work - ers as possible to talk over the work with one another and the su - perintendent. It is firmly believed that there was a strong eighth grade class this year. The plan of centralized examinations was not the one usually practiced in this county, but most people feel that there is a great advantage in it. Every town in the county wrote the state examination and over two hundred and fifty new students are ready to enter the various high schools. The difficulties of enforcing the compulsory attendance law are not insurmountable, I should say, but the time taken in writing letters, personal interviews, second and third notices to teachers and parents and the proper recording of the same, take time out of all proportion to that which can be given to any other work of the superintendent's office. Conditions in Gage are in excellent shape In this line, 1 under - stand by comparison. There is a most delightful prospect of big improvements this year. Already two new buildings are in process of construction, beau - tiful modern ones: several schools are putting in new heating plants of approved design; many school boards are considering seriously the question of playground apparatus. Miss Anna Day, my immediate predecessor, emphasized specially the eighth grade work and the boys' and girls' work to such good purpose that these affairs need only continuance of direction. She also brought the grammar work to such a point that we almost never hear the complaint that the country students in high school are no - ticeably weaker than the town children in that particular branch. Some pet theories of mine for the immediate future are, the teach - er's plan book, quarterly eighth grade examinations, and a crusade on written work. The first needs no comment. For the second, I would wish to conduct quarterlies on the same plan as the final for those who would like to take them, letting them form the basis of promotion the same as In cities. The chief advantages of this plan would b encouragement of regular attendance and the regular steady perform - ance of work, not a spasmodic cramming at the end of the rear.

GOSPER COr XT Y Gosper County's School Officers' Association was organized the 10th of June, 1905, the school boards of the county being called to- gether at tha* time to consider the adoption of a course of study. After the work which they had come together to perform ha 1 been at- tended to, the members of the school boards present adopted a uniform list of text books for the use of the schools of the county, made ar- rangements to have the books of said uniform list kept at the office of the county superintendent, considered certain other matters of in- terest to the schools of the county and before adjourning organized a permanent association which was to meet in the future at the call of the county superintendent, whenever, in his opinion, the welfare of the schools of the county demanded i's attention </seg>
            <seg id="p632">565 Our County Teachers' Association is not a very heavy organiza- tion numerically. Being situated as we are with a number of large and prosperous towns having excellent high schools (Lexington. Bertrand, Oxford, Arapahoe and Cambridge), near the county lines in the coun ties immediately surrounding us, and having but two small towns with no legally organized high school in the county, the ma jority of our teachers are supplied to us from the sur rounding towns mentioned above; and teaching as they do in tht&gt; part of the county adjacent to their home towns. attend teachers' meetings there, it being more convenient for an to come to the county seat for that purpose Consequently the only teachers who attend the county meeMnss are working in the two towns of the county, or in the territory immediately tributary to thtse towns. Hut what we lack in numbers we more than make up in enthusia as in all counties, the most progressive teachers we have are )nes found attending ifae ftate and District Association meetings.

But although each circle is Tiall in numbers, 1 am happy to be able to report each large in pro- 1 work accomplished )i matic effort to provide libraries for the schools of The fir the county was made in the winter of 190."), at which time the schools, generally, by mtans of the "basket, or box social," raised money for and purchased small libraries. By 1908, the schools of the county, with two exceptions, had libraries ranging in value from $3T&gt; to $125, and each year the county spends from $300 to $500, mostly raised by some sort of school entertainment, in keeping them up. These libraries seem to cover the range of human knowledge pretty thoroughly, as on their catalogs we find books ranging all the way from "Sun Bonnet Baby" primers to encyclopedias It is gratifying to me to be able to report that the financial con- dition of the people of the county is such that they can carry on their schools without aid from the state In the fall of 1905, a course of study was put into the schools of the county for the first time, from which time down to the present it </seg>
            <seg id="p633">566 has been in use with varying success, dependent upon the efforts of the teacher along that line. Each month review questions are Bent out to the several schools covering the work of the month as laid out in the course. Accompanying 'he review questions are the poems to be studied the succeeding month; both questions and poems are furnished to the schools by the county free of cost. Results have shown the advantages of a course of study when followed conscientiously by tl teacher. By far the greater majority of the schools of the county observe only four special days: Thanksgiving, Christmas. Washington's t&gt;irt day and Lincoln's birthday. The schools taking a vacation for Thank giving and Chris'mas. the exercises in observance of these days art held the day the schools close for such vacation. The Christmas day exercises sometim&lt;s reach quite imposing proportions with trees and nts in addition to the program rendered by the pupils. Although patriotism is the keynote of all these special exercises, it is especially emphasized on the birthdays. The standard for qualification for teachers is the same as that of the state board of examiners for county certificates. I find that "Credit" and "Honor" features are a great incentive to more strenuoi &lt;ffoits on the part of teachers, every teacher in the county putting forth her best efforts to reach one or the other of these points; and I observe when these are reached, they seem to feel the added strength the effort has given them, and a goodly proportion of them go a step or two higher un'il some have reached the dignity of a professional state certificate. Consolidation has been agitated in two townships of the county, but the agitation has no* advanced beyond that point of bitterness that is invariably engendered among neighbors when any radical reform tending to subvert long established custom is advocated in the com- munity. The main, the most effective, argument so far advanced in favor of the change seems to be the expense of the operation free high school law: "If we have a consolidated, a township school we can maintain a high school of our own and save the free high school tuition to the several districts entering into the consolidation save to ourselves the cost of board and incidentals for the pupils from home, and above all, have our children at home under our own control et the age when they need our care the most, and not in ord« to gi' a little education, be compelled to send them air strange-s whose only interest in them is the $3 a month they bring to the high school district Each year since the present free high school law has been in operation, there has been in this county about Si) applicants to pre - sent themselves at the eighth grade examinations, of which about 25 on an average, have received free high school certificates. These upon receiving their free high school attendance certificates have deposited them in the high schools of Lexington, Bertrand, Holdrege, Oxford. </seg>

Many ranchmen have homes in Hyannis and move their fam - ilies from the ranch into town and live here during the school year. Whitman is maintaining a good nine-grade school and is almost ready for another grade. Miss Carrie A. Drake, the principal, is a teacher of long experience.

The schools are all followin a daily program and have spec ; the Nebraska course of study, using al exercises for certain days of im- portance.

The compulsory law is enforced, but without trouble. People seem to understand the law and to know why the stare is so interested in the education of the children. Eighth grade examinations are held under the direction of the state superintended and pupils are passed only upon merit. This year we held an eighth grade commencement for the county at Hyannis, at which some twenty-two received diplomas. We find this a great in - centive to good work. Most all of these will enter the hie;h schools of Hyannis or Whitman. H. R. DKLLIXCER, County Superintend GKEKLKY COIXTV Free Hijrh School Attendance Many of the boys and girls take advantage of the free high school law each year. When some pupil of a district secures a certificate and attends high school it has an encouraging effect on the rest of the pupils to finish the eighth grade and at'end high school. As a rule when a pupil of a rural school enters high school that district can depend that others will follow soon if there are many children in the district. In this way the high school law, by creating a desire to fin - ish the grades, is a help to rural school pupils as well as the one who Is in high school.

The county is twenty-four miles square and the territory is divided in*o 102 school districts. Fairbury, the county seat, is located near the center of the county and is just fifty-seven miles southwest of Lincoln. The assessed value of the county for 1910 was $6,781,844. This valuation is so divided among the various districts that it is sel - dom necessary to levy the limit of school taxes in order to run the schools. Seven districts paid the limit of taxes for school during 1909, ■while the average levy for the county was a fraction over 11 1-2 mills. The schools of the county for the year 19(10-10 wore in charge of 1S4 ttachers, who were very loyal to the county requirements. Over 100 of the number attended the state association last year, while a number who did not attend this meeting attended the district asso - ciation at Beatrice. The plan for conducting the reading circle work was changed from the section plan to the general plan in 1908. An average of three general meetings are now held each year and in addition to the discus - sion of the regular work some leading educator is asked to give a lec - ture. This makes it more pleasant for teachers and keeps up profes sional in'erest betier than the small district cr section meeting. The school library has been attracting attention during the past three years. During this time $1,629.84 lies been expended for library books. A number of schools lad libraries ;r.-ior to this Use. A re - port was asked for April 2S. l&gt;10, which showed that there were- 4,71!* books in the school libraries. A number of bocks have been purchased since that time which will make the number much larger. In order to make the reading of the library books more effective library cer - tificates will be issued during the coming year. A written review of the book will be required The normal training course in the Fairbury high school has helped to raise the teaching standard. Only one normal training student has failed during the past three years. The school can no: supply the dema T, so i f is necessar to import teachers each year. The qualifieati i s is the same required by the state Each school in the county was supplied with the Nebraska course of study for 1909. The course seemed to be very effective and the results were satisfactory in most instances. A special day program book was also placed in each school and in many of the schools the observance of special days was a feature of the year's work. The industrial work for boys and girls has be&lt; n carried on for three years and the results have about doubled each year. </seg>

The orders now placed for the coming year and the prospects which will be orders later will bring the number near the forty mark. Patrons are learning that it is a good investment to place a modern heating plant in their school room. The health and comfort enjoyed by children and teacher cannot be compared to the cost. The sani tary water jar has also found its way into many of the schools. Th« private drinking cup is coming as fast as could possibly be expected. Over $1,000 has been collected during the past two years from entertainments and box suppers. Practically all this amount has been expended for pictures and other articles which have added to the ap - pearance of the different rooms. Forty-one districts are supplied with organs and two with pianos. The planting of trees and beautifying the school grounds has no* been given as much attention as it should have, although many trees have been planted and cared for of late. All buildings erected during the past few years have been in most ises properly planned, especially in regard to heating and lighting Two buildings are now under construction and in each case the com - mittee in charge consulted an architect, who gave the best of plans for convenience, heating and lighting </seg>

It is a comparatively old or ganization, honored by the members, and each year the work is en u red into with enthusiasm. Reading circle work is conducted along lines adopted by the association, using the recommendations made b the reading circle board as a basis. Usually four local and four gen eral meetings are held during the year. At the latter programs of spe - cial music and addresses are arranged besides the regular reading cir cle work. These meetings bind the teachers together in their interest and efforts, and develop their individual powers by interchange o ideas, renewing of enthusiasm and gleaning of knowledge from th experiences of those older in the work. The social feature of such gatherings is found to be valuable. Much emphasis is laid upon free use of the Nebraska course of 6tudy.

It was decided upon as a good plan that every teacher's name be placed upon one of the programs during the year. One teacher was to present a subject, then three or four different teachers were expected to discuss it. A few weeks before the association, personal letters were sent out asking the teachers whose names had been placed on the program for the dis - cussion of a subject to discuss a special phase of it. We found this plan very successful, for in this way every teacher present felt respon - sible for the success of a certain part of the program. The North Platte Valley Teachers' Association is held at Bridge - port. Morritl county, early each spring. Our teachers are always anxious to attend this and the educators who come to help us in these meetings speak in glowing terms of the enthusiasm of the western teachers. Only a few of our teachers attend the s'ate association. When the N. B. A. convened at Denver a tew of our teachers wen able to at - tend. All teachers are required to do the state reading circle work. Circle meetings are held in all of the towns once each month, where all teachers who are in adjoining districts join, other teachers follow the note book plan. It is gratifying to know that all districts have at least s'arted a school library, having complied with the law and spent the required nts per pupil for library books and many districts spend more than this. Mont teachers, some time during the year, give an enter - tainment and buy books with the proceeds. Because of the state aid that is received for the weak school dis - tricts of the county, most all children are given the privilege of at leasi a five months' term of school; whereas if no aid was received many dis tricts would be unable to maintain a school at all, for in a tYu the revenue for school purposes during the year is less than I ever, this condition will not long exist.

We have three or four large districts where the district is financially able to furnish transportation and the plan would be ideal, but the people seem to let the few disadvantages there may be stand in the way of the many great benefits, however, we feel that something is being accom - plished along that line when these large districts are influenced to build two or three school houses instead of dividing the district. Eighth grade examinations are conducted in four towns of the county and all pupils have the privilege of attending where it is the most convenient for them. I do not know of a single instance where it was impossible for an eighth grade pupil to reach one of these points for examination. 1 think there is nothing that serves so much to bring the pupils into the high school when they have finished their element - ary course, as the way in which the eighth grade examinations and graduating exercises are conducted There were thirty-five graduated nd most of them are now in high from the eighth grade last sprin school.

R. C. Kl.N'C County Superintend PAWNEE COUNTY Pawnee~county comprised seventy-eight school districts, flv which are fractional districts. Of the seventy-five school houses in the county sixty-nine are frame buildings, four brick and two stone Several new school houses have been built within the past few yea and several districts are planning to put up new buildings in the nea future. Eight heating plants have been installed in our schools recently four being rural schools, and so far they have proved very satisfactory The majority of our schools have wells on the school grounds. On district has a cistern with a pump and sink in the corner of the sch room. The water is pumped out a little while before school begins and used to clean the building, and a fresh supply of water is ready for use by the time school opens. Of course the water is filtered, and this year the teacher has promised to see to it that all pupils use individual cups for drinking. An effort is being made to secure individual drinking cups throughout the county, and where there is no well on the school grounds to have school boards install covered water tanks with faucet Twelve years ago, under County Superintendent Utterback an effort was made to establish school libraries in all the schools in the county. These libraries have been added to year by year, until now there are but two schools in the county without excellent librari Later an effort was made to secure good framed pictures for the school rooms. The schools themselves secured these by means of socials, and nearly every school has some good pictures. There are two schools in this county that do not furnish text books and only four that are not well supplied with maps, charts and all needed supplies. Needless to say that these four are the schools that hire the cheapest teachers procurable.

Wheeler county being one of the younger counties in the state o Nebraska is of necessity somewhat more sparsely populated and schools are farther apart than in older counties. Teachers associations have therefore been greatly neglected owing to widely scattered schoo houses and the fact of teachers being far part and having to trave long distances to attend even local meetings. These conditions are however, continually improving and a fairly strong association has been formed during the year. The association will take up work at the be ginning of the school year in earnest. Districts have been slow to vote library funds for the purpose c providing libraries for the pupils, but many of them have raised mon^ by means of box socials and put in a fine set of books, thus relieving th taxpayers, providing entt rtainment for the young peoples' winter erei Ings and obtaining a more costly library than the regular fund woul have done.

STACKHOrSI Superintenden DAVID ( ITV This being the first year of my connection with the David City schools I am In a position to speak only in a general way concerning school affairs. The records left by my predecessors point to the fact that til' 5 enrollment has been practically at a standstill for several years. Th~ free high school law, as it is familiarly called, has added about twenty five to the high school enrollment, while the number in the grades is just about where it was five years ago. Our low enrollment in the grades is due to a flourishing parochial school in the heart of thi city. The compulsory attendance law gives us very little trouble as parents and children alike seem to feel the need of the advantages of an education. I feel that the high school course of study could be somewhat modified so as to make it more attractive to somo who should be in high school, but who are not. Our buildings are all comparatively old, judged by th construction, but have been kept as near up to date as it is possible to keep old buildings. Sentiment here very strongly favors a ncu high school building and I feel confident that bonds will be votei within a year. At present we are installing manual training and do - mestic science and these with our regular work, make our condition very crowded. The school library contains 2-"&gt;m voluin </seg>

It is not so much a growth in the enrollment that is noticeable as it is the improvement in the equip - ment and the replacing of the old building with a new modern struc - ture. The new building was erected In 1905. Bonds were voted to the amount of $17,500, but after the building was completed a"d equipped with new furniture and desks throughout about $23,000 had been expended. There are fourteen rooms besides cloak rooms in the building; six of the rooms are used for the grades. The high srhojl has ample room. There are for its use an assembly room that will seat about 100 pupils, three large recitation rooms, a laboratory and a library. The building is heated throughout by steam heat and thus far it has been very satisfactory. The janitor who has been here for the past eight years reports that it has not yet been necessary to dismiss school on account of not being able to keep the building com - fortable. All the rooms are very well ventilated, through ventilating shafts placed in the wall. Electric lights and water have recently been placed in the building. Drinking fountains are now used and the undesirable drinking cup has been laid aside. The school also has plenty of ground, occupying a five-acre tract. The grounds are quite well kept, the janitor being employed during the whole year. On the grounds are about 200 trees.

The high school prepares for university entrance, review of the common branches is given and also some work in preparation for business life. It also offers normal training under the direction of the state department. Music is given throughout the grades and chorus and glee club work in the high, school. Industrial education will undoubtedly become a part of the school course in the near future. The boys of the high school maintain an athletic club devoted to athletics and a high standard of student work. The girls have an organisation called the Girls' Tri-Club, to which all high school girls are eligible.

The student may choose these, with some restrictions, from a possible forty-five. While only thirty points are necessary for gradua - tion, the majority of students have more. The opportunity to choose the work pursued does not leave the so-called hard studies without pupils, though it must be acknowledged the tendency is to take the lighter work.

The following year we wen placed on the three-year accredited list and the school spirit etil growing, the twelfth grade was added the next year with three boyi as the first graduating class in 1910. Two large Catholic parochial schools get two-thirds of the pupil in the grades, but one-third of the high school are Catholic and ove one-third are non-residents, attending under the free high schoo law. This past summer the east wing, a two-story frame structure was built and the old part refloored, painted and papered.

Our course of study in general coincides with the high school manual. We are accredited with thirty-two points at the state uni- versity. The most of our boys and girls make good these credits when they are in attendance at other schools. In the first year of high school work we deem it best for the present to have no Latin and only one-half years' work of algebra.

Above the basement, the rooms not shaded by the adjoining build'ngs are quite well lighted and all are steam heated. The renMlation of the buildings seems to have been seriously slighted by the architect.

T lie several laboratories for chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, agri - culture, physiology and elementary science are well equipped for their work. The library, supplemented by the city library, within one bloc from the high school building, is one of the very valuable aids to ot high school work. The course of study differs from the one suggested in the state manual most largely in that it offers much wider election than is in - dicated there. This is possible in our school of fifty teachers and assistants to a degree that would not be wise in schools with a few teachers.

Music is taug throughout the school by a special teacher. This is the fourth year for normal training in the high school. Last year there was a class of twenty-one members and this fall there is a class of twenty-three members. There were nine normal training graduates in the class of 1910 and all arc now teaching on good cer - tificates earned before they were graduated. The senior members do the state reading circle work, atUnd teachers meetings and associa - tions the same as other teachers.

Now that the majority of the patrons are familiar with its provisions, the difficulty of administering it effectually ha diminished. In 1909 the board of education established a graduated seal wages for the teachers of the grades. Increase of wages may granted for increased efficiency as teacher or for evidence of improved scholarship. A minimum wage of $4."&gt;i per year and a maximun •wage of $.")8o per year was established for the teachers, while ward principals may receive $»1&lt;i per year. White this system ha- force but a year, its results are already apparent in better work ir the school room and a desire to advance along scholastic lines. Altogether the outlook for the next two years is encouraging educational lines in this city. GEORGE E. MARTIN Superintend* VKl.UiH Neligh has always been an active educational center, and tr public schools have never lacked the hearty support of the people. Tt city has experienced a very rapid growth during the past ten year ■ ially, and the school has kept pace with that growth. Two buildings are now in use for school purposes and bonds hav recently been voted to erect ward building in the west part of towr This building will be ready for occupancy about January 1, 1911. Free high school attendance is not as large this year as in th« past, due perhaps to the change in the law. The janitor of the school has been named truant officer and every effort is made to enforce tht compulsory education law. Nothing in the line of school work received more hearty support from the pupils than normal training. A class of nineteen was grad - uated from this department in 1910, and a like number are carrying the work during 1910-11. The high school course of study follows the recommendations o the high school manual with a few exceptions. Bookkeeping is not of fered in the ninth grade, but is offered in the twelfth grade as i business course, including commercial law, arithmetic, etc. This i given instead of chemistry. No German is offered, four years of Lati being required. General history is given in the tenth grade, on semester of English history in the eleventh and American history i the twelfth. Civics is taught in connection with American history. CHARLES A.

PRICK Superinter ULYSS1 - The growth of the school during the past lew years has marked by greater enrollment and better working facilities. During the past three years the high school enrollment has increased from thirty-four to fifty-six. The school census of 1909-10 gave us only 815, while the en - rollment during that time was 219, with an average daily attendance of 172. We have twenty-five attending under the free high school law and many other tuition pupils in the grades. Our outside tuition, during this school year, netted us over $700. The building is a brick, steam heated structure erected in 1898 on seven acres of ground. The front part of the ground is covered with beautiful young trees. Good walks connect the school building with all parts of the town. Eight rooms of this building are used for school purposes, th laboratory being in the basement. While the lighting is very good, w have nothing: modern in ventilation. The library consists of over .",00 volumes, besides sets of inter - national encyclopedia and world history. Library is especially strong in American history reference. A four-year course' is carried with twenty-eight points required for graduation. The course as it stands today is good for thirty points. Class of 1910 received thirty-one university credits. While not a normal training school, pupils are required to pas? examinations for a second grade certificate before graduation. All the members of the last three classes have successfully pass this examination. With a good school spirit, pleasant associations of pupils and teach - ers and an up-to-date board of education we expect great things for the future. E. G. HOPKINS. Superintendent </seg>
