REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

Officers and Members: 

We are again assembled in our annual convention, being 
the thirty-third annual meeting of the Nebraska State Horticultural 
Society. Since our last meeting two of our members 
have answered the last roll call, and their familiar faces 
will greet us no more. During the past year our genial friend 
and co-worker, Henry Eicke, also our esteemed ex-secretary, 
R. N. Day, have passed away. The latter part of the preceding 
year E. E. Sanborn and Paul Stoltenburg were called to 
their reward. By some oversight their death was not reported 
until after our last annual meeting. These were all 
life members and among the pioneers in horticulture in this 
state. They will be missed from our numbers. </seg>

BEPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 

PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS. 

The last legislature made appropriation whereby the state 
could buy a permanent home for the state fair, and we as a 
part have our part of it. We may now fit it up so it will be 
Bre attractive to our visitors and more convenient for oorves. 


The tables should be remodeled as fast as practicable, and 
a better quality put in place of what we now have. 

The Society should take some action in providing a suitable 
case in which cut flowers may be kept in good condition 
for several days instead of a few hours as at the present time 
when they are exposed to the wind, dust, and heat that often 
prevail during state fair time. 

EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 

More experiment stations should be established as fast as 
the Society can maintain them and keep up those already 
established. It is my belief that all business connected with 
the experiment stations should be referred to the executive 
board. The wants of the stations should be in their hands 
in time for them to report at the annual meeting with their 
recommendations. 

PERMANENT OFFICE 

Our legislative committee, together with those of other 
state societies, should make an effort to have the next legis- 
Kre provide a building where the societies may have perent 
offices. 

DELEGATE TO OTHER SOCIETIES. 

E)ur Society should be represented by at least one delegate 
other state and district meetings, and provision made for 
(ring their legitimate expenses. 

The following amounts have been received for membership 
fees and turned over to the treasurer: </seg>

KEPORT OF COMMITTEE ON OBITUARIES. 

Whebeas, It has been the will of the Almighty God, the 
ruler of the uui verse, to take from our midst four nieinl 
aud co-workers of our Society, Mr. Henry Eicke, Paul Stol 
tenberg, E. E. Sanborn, and R. N. Day, therefore be it 

Resolved. That we gratefully remember the services they 
have rendered our Society for its interest and success. 

As one after another of our members thus falls by the \vayside 
we can but mourn for them as for brothers who ha\r 
toiled with us for the transformation and enriching of our 

beloved state. 

Paul Stoltenberg was born in Holstein, Germany, February 
11, 1825; died June 11, 1900, on his farm four miles north 
of Irvington, in Douglas county. He came to Daveuport. 
Iowa, in the year 1848 and Omaha 1855, where he took up 
farming ten miles northwest of the city, where he also 
planted a large, fine orchard of apples, cherries, grapes, and 
plums. 

In the death of Mr. Stoltenberg Nebraska lost one of the 
old reliable pioneers, one that was always willing to a&gt; 
others, always looking forward for an advancement and improvement 
iu fruits and flowers. He was a great lover of 
new and rare things, always looking for some improved varieties. 
His memory will long be remembered among all that 
learned to know him. He is survived by his wife and four 
sons, Henry, Charles, George, and Edwin, and three daughters, 
Minnie, Melia, and Mary. 

Mr. Henry Eicke was born in Germany, March 3, 1831 ; 
died August 21, 1901. 

The death of Mr. Eicke removes one of the pioneers of Nebraska. 
He came to Omaha in 1856 and took up farming in

large orchard, and a visit to his fruit farm was always a delight. 
His courtesy, fine apples, cherries, and vineyard were 
always a delight to the many friends that in the years past 
so often visited with him. He was always cheerful, and 
often he told of the times he used to have with the Indians

of the Douglas County Agricultural Society. </seg>

ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 

By Chancellor Andrews. 

Mr. President and (Ikntlemen — I do not wish to have 
these words exactly formal. It has been the custom of my 
predecessors and myself every year since this organization 
began to meet on these grounds, to pronounce a few words of 
welcome; and, of course, when a custom is kept up for so 
many years, there is a danger of becoming hackneyed. For 
my part, I do not want these words to be hackneyed ; I want 
them to be very hearty for this reason, among others: This 
university exists upon the bounty of the agricultural interests 
of the state, and we are ingrates, as well as bad citizens 
in general, if we do not recognize that condition. 

It seems to me that the work this organization — and the 
people who make it up throughout the state — is doing, is one 
of great importance to our bod}' politic in a number of particulars. 
In the first place, the profits from this sort of work 
in the state are rapidly growing, and I believe are destined 
to grow until the interests represented by people such as you 
will lead the general agricultural interests of the state. 

But there is a peculiar reason why I am interested in this 
work, and why I know a great many others are: That is the 
cultivation you give to the sense of the beautiful in the world. 
The man engaged in horticultural work is in constant touch 
with the beautiful things of nature, and his whole life ia 
made better and nobler thereby. </seg>

            <seg id="p027">
26 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Then, again, you are teaching the agricultural people more 
and more the great value of intensive cultivation. The people 
engaged in agricultural work generally in the 1 state have 
paid too little attention to methods of cultivation ; it is time 
we should stop land-skimming and begin land-cultivation, 
and you gentlemen who are gathered here to-day are preaching 
that gospel in your several localities. The ordinary 
farmer does not pretend to be much of a horticulturist ; does 
not consider himself adapted to that sort of work, and I think 
if we look far enough we shall find the cause. I may not be 
able to give all of the reasons, but two or three of them occur 
to me. It seems to me that one reason why more fanners 
and others do not have gardens and do not take more interest 
in horticultural work is that we are still in the old English 
age. I do not mean you ; I mean the other fellows ; the fellows 
who have not gardens; the ordinary farmer, college professor, 
doctor, lawyer, living in the village or in the country 
where there is plenty of land, and who are taking no pains 
to have gardens and fruit. I say one reason why we do not 
have them is that we are still living under the old English 
idea that in small gardens all of the work must be done by 
hand. The average farmer when he sets out to have a garden 
selects a little patch a few rods square close by his house and 
fences it in, thus precluding all possibility of horse labor and 
making it absolutely indispensable that all of the work 
should be done by hand. Of course he goes in just as I did. 
I had a small garden a year ago. Well, along in June my 
work was pressing, but I said, "Those weeds have got to come 
down." So I took the hoe one evening and worked at it just 
as long as I could see. All the neighbors turned out to look, 
and they said it was a sorry sight. No doubt it was, but I 
did get rid of an enormous crop of weeds. I got up the next 
morning fearfully tired, my work was piling up, and so the 
weeds were allowed to grow. I confess that at the end of the 
season it was a mighty bad looking garden, and if the drouth </seg>

            <seg id="p028">
27 

ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 

had not gotten rid of the weeds I might have been arrested 
for breach of the peace. 

I think that is the trouble with many farmers ; they do -not 
have their gardens in such shape that they- can introduce a 
horse cultivator, and of course do not have time to give them 
the necessary amount of hand labor. If they would lay their 
gardens out in long rows so they could drive a horse between 
them, the hand labor would be reduced to a minimum, and I 
think they would get on much better in the garden industry. 

Another reason is that they have no .idea, because they 
never sit -down to count up the profit — the actual profit — of 
gardening if it is carried on economically, in supplying the 
family with that element of food which is most wholesome. 
They have never taken account of the very important part 
that a good garden will play in the support of a large family 
during the year. This leads me to say that people engaged 
in agriculture usually are very much at fault in not keeping 
any books; or keeping any exact accounts of the debits and 
credits of the different departments of their business. If 
farmers would do this, and then try keeping a good garden 
for a year or two, they would be surprised at the value of 
the garden products in making up the family accounts from 
year to year. 

Gentlemen, you are always heartily welcome on these 
grounds, not only as an organization, but as individuals. 
Come and see us. We are trying to do a little something to 
push forward the great work in which you are engaged. We 
can't do as much as we should like, but we are doing a little 
something and we should be glad to have you all come as 
often as you can, at any time of the year, and see what we are 
doing here and at the farm. 

I congratulate you, Mr. President and gentlemen, upon the 
numbers present here to-day. There is certainly at least three 
times the number I saw here a year ago to-day, and it is a 
delightful thing to see that the revival is spreading. 
[Applause.] </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

By President G. A. Marshall 

Feli/)W Workers — In the way of response I wish to extead 
thanks in behalf of the Society to Ilie Chancellor and to 
the authorities of the university for the very cordial welcome 
we have received at their hands from year to year. Wf 
have met here for so long that it seems like coming home to 
a sort of family reunion, where we meet to renew acquaintances, 
to review past work and experience, and to compare 
notes and sum up the results and thus be better prepared for 
future work. I wish to repeat that coming here is like coming 
home; that the very campus and buildings seem to say 
welcome, and especially this lecture room, which through the 
kindness of Dr. Bessey has opened its doors to us all these 
years. In behalf of the Society I also wish to thank the professors 
of this institution for their able support from time 
to time. 

The remarks of the Chancellor in regard to a lack of in 
terest in gardening and horticulture generally are certainly 
timely and good. I think the main reason why there is not 
more horticultural work done is — as he so well stated — that 
we are sleeping too much in the old ruts; going on the old 
style a little too much. 

The jtast year has been one of varied experience and varied 
results. Strawberries and cherries ripened before the dry 
weather, and were fine. The extreme heat and dry weather 
cut the raspberry and blackberry crop short and seemed to 
threaten the quality and yield of all later fruits. But later, 
when the rains came, the fruit grew rapidly and developed 
to fair size and good quality. 

Peaches and apricots seemed to be abundant throughout 
the eastern and southeastern part of the state ; also in newer 
parts where trees were of fruiting age. The dry season 
seemed extremely favorable for the Earopeu type of plums;

they were very tine everywhere. The per cent of a crop of 
fruit was about as follows : Strawberries, 75 per cent, quality 
fair to good; cherries, 60 per cent, quality good; currants, 60 
per cent ; gooseberries, 75 per cent ; grapes, 90 per cent, quality 
fair; American plums, 90 per cent, quality fair to good; 
European plums, 100 per cent, quality good ; peaches, 100 per 
cent, quality good ; apricots, 80 per cent, quality fair ; apples, 
50 per cent, quality fair to good. 

PROSPECT FOB NEXT YEAR. 

The stand of strawberry plants for next year's fruiting was 
cut short by the dry weather, but the plants are large and 
fine. The extreme cold in December injured the peach buds 
in some sections. With these two exceptions the prospects 
are favorable for a good crop of fruit the coming season. 

EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 

While I believe the experiment stations should be carried 
on in various parts of the state as started, yet some of the 
most needed fruits and plants should be tested in more tMn 
five places in the state. I do not think it wise, however, to 
spend more than a moderate sum of money in direct exj 
mental work, but think we should operate on some plan of 
systematic gathering and disseminating of results of pri\ 
experiments that are being conducted on thousands of farms 
all over the state. I would recommend, therefore, that this 
Society consider the experimental project at this meeting. 

We should be in closer touch with adjoining states and 
their societies. We should have a delegate to the state meeting 
of each of our boundary states at least. A deleg;i 
report of these meetings is well worth the cost of getting it. 

I would also recommend that the premium list be thoroughly 
gone over, and that a list of premiums be offered for 
winter varieties to be shown at our winter meeting </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Chancelloe Andrews — You speak of the crop of fruit being 
40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 per cent; are we to suppose this to b 
such and such a per cent of the maximum crop, or do you 
take the average crop as a basis? 

The President — The average crop; yes, sir. 

HORTICULTURE IN THE FARMERS' INSTITUTE 
WORK. 

L. D. Stilson, York. 

Mr. President — Having been assigned this subject, I shall 
endeavor to treat it as I see the work and have seen it in the 
past. Some of us older institute workers recollect some of 
the snags upon which we almost stranded in past years, and 
I feel somewhat differently to-day in regard to this work 
from what I did some years ago. Some of us recollect with 
what tenacity some of our horticultural speakers would talk 
apple growing in far western sections to the exclusion of 
other vital topics, and with what wonderful speed they could 
clear the hall of hearers. This line of work I do not believe 
in. 

If we take the broad-gage view of this subject, and include 
shade tree and ornamental planting, small fruits, and decorating 
home, school, and church grounds, as well as tree fruits, 
then I am in favor of such work and think a short talk along 
these lines would be valuable and interesting in every institute. 
I believe the speaker on this line should be brief and 
to the point, covering fifteen to thirty minutes, and then allow 
sufficient time to answer questions. 

Our best institute work this winter is being done by speakers 
who occupy not over thirty minutes for any subject, and 
our work is going with a snap and push never before attained. 
</seg>
            <seg id="p032">
HORTICULTURE IN THE FARMERS' INSTITUTE WORK. 

31 

In localities where the fruit industry is of more importance 
than some other farm crops, it should be given more time; 
say one speaker taking the subject of orcharding, and another 
the general line of work, as in the central and western counties. 
This would fully occupy one of the four or five sessions 
of the institute, which would be a large proportion as compared 
with other farm topics. I think an arrangement of 
this kind would be acceptable to the general management of 
the institute force this winter, and I think a conference of a 
committee from this Society with Professor Burnett on this 
line would be of value to the cause. 

It is essential to the greatest good of the institute work, 
and of the horticultural society as well, that no personalities 
be allowed. Don't ask to have any man placed on the 
institute work simply because he has an axe to grind, or because 
he is a hail-fellow-well-met, but because he can do the 
cause good. I should be glad to see some active member of 
this Society attached to the institute force, especially in the 
middle and eastern portion of the state — someone who can 
say a great deal at the right time, and then answer questions. 

I do not think a speaker should be allowed time at an institute 
to talk commercial orcharding; the man interested 
in that line should come here for that kind of discussion. But 
rather, I would have him give instruction regarding the family 
orchard and fruit garden, and urge the general farmer to 
supply his own family with fruit and beautify his home with 
trees and flowers. A talk of this kind is equally valuable to 
the homes in town; a talk short, sharp, suggestive; then 
answer the questions. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

FOKEST TREES ON THE FAKM. 

G. A. Slayton. 

Though Nebraskans, during the past decade, have proven 
themselves preeminently "tree-planters," and have well 
earned that title as their proper cognomen, yet it is to be 
feared that the enthusiasm so manifest in this direction a 
few years ago is subsiding, and that the necessity for enceuraging 
further effort still exists. 

One of the principal reasons why fewer forest trees are 
planted now than a few years ago is, no doubt, because of the 
immutability of land holdings. In many of the eastern counties 
of our state, instead of each quarter or half section l&gt;eing 
occupied and tilled by the owner, as should be the case to insure 
the highest and best development of its agricultural resources, 
much of the land is owned by capitalist! who are 
either non-residents or live in the cities, the land being 
rented. And in far too many cases both owner and renter 
seem to care more for what can be taken off the land than for 
its development in the direction of a more desirable home. 
For a number of years the financial conditions were so unfavorable 
for nearly all kinds of farming operations that 
many farms passed from the hands of the homesteader or 
early settler into the enlarging lists &lt;if the capitalist or speculator, 
and the annual renter is becoming common where the 
land owner lived a short time ago. Such a condition is unfavorable 
to the best use of the land, and decidedly averse to 
the development of an interest in tree planting. 

But as to the advantages and profit of the planting of forest 
trees by the owners of all farms, whether occupied by 
owner or renter, there is no question. The experience and 
observation of the writer have been chiefly in the southeastern 
horticultural district of the state, and whatever suggestions 
are made will, of course, apply more directly to that 
</seg>
            <seg id="p034">

FOREST TREES ON THE FARM. 

Forest tree planting may have objectively several reasons, 
and the choice of varieties will depend largely upon the object 
in view. Often, however, more than one object can be attained 
by one planting, as trees intended especially for shade 
or shelter may be of such character as to be of great value for 
timber or fuel, and also add to the beauties of natural scenery 
by being ornamental. 

If there is any one tree that can claim preeminence as a 
shade tree alone, that tree is the White Elm. When slightly 
isolated from ite companions, on ground which from it* 
nature or location is likely to remain in permanent pasture, 
in a few years it acquires a size and form that make it an 
object of beauty, and ite inviting shade will be eagerly sought 
on summer days by man or beast. Ite rapidity of growth and 
toughness of fiber, which enable it to withstand storms of 
wind and sleet with a certainty of little damage, make it a 
favorite tree for shade in the pasture. 

If the entire farm is tillable, it may be desirable to plant 
a grove for the purpose of shade which can be so placed that 
different fields, as used for pasture in the rotation of crops, 
may, by a lane, or general arrangement of fields, in any case 
include the grove. If such a plan is made, the grove might 
very properly include black walnut, ash, and elm; and if at 
the same time the grove may be made use of in the winter as 
a shelter belt on the north or west of buildings or yards, or in 
summer as a wind-break on the south of orchard or garden, 
then other varieties might be added. Of deciduous trees, perhaps 
the soft maple and Russian mulberry ; also a row or two 
of evergreens. 

The Cutalpm Speciosa, though producing abundant shade 
and most excellent timber, is more satisfactory when planted 
in a grove alone for timber purposes than for shade where axposed 
to the tramping and running of stock. 

There is abundant evidence, as one looks over the hundreds 
of treeless pastures in our state, that we can not urge too 
strongly the planting of trees for shade. Occasionally shade

NEBRASKA STATK HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

trees are found in very undesirable locations, as in dense 
rows along public highways, preventing the mud from drying 
up in the traveled track and causing it to remain slippery or 
to become cut up in ruts. High untrimmed hedges may be 
desirable in some places, but never along public highways. 

The planting of groves or shelter belts is not as common a 
practice on our older improved farms as is desirable, or as 
their value warrants. When first occupied, many small 
groves were planted on these lands as a protection from the 
cold north winds of winter, in most cases the grove also 
sheltering the small family orchard as well as garden and 
farm buildings. Desirable and useful as was the planting of 
these groves, in most cases the trees were of very undesirable 
varieties, and the space occupied by them far too limited to 
produce the most desirable results. A more prodigal use of 
the land for these purposes, even now. will prove only the 
highest economy. There is little danger of any farm owner 
making the area planted to a carefully selected variety of 
forest trees too great; and if for every tree cut down three 
more were planted, as is said to be the requirement of law in 
at least one of the countries of the Old World, the farmer, as 
well as the farm, would be the better for it. 

These shelter groves are especially recommended for planting 
on the south side of orchards. Though in large orchards 
the trees, to some extent, become self-protecting from our hot 
south winds, yet a good grove of ample dimensions and of 
such varieties as will make a dense wind-break as well as 
possess good lasting timber qualities, if placed at a sufficient 
distance from the fruit trees — not less than fifty feet — will 
prove of great value to the orchardist. The value of these 
groves as a protection to farm stock need scarcely be mentioned 
and can only be fully realized by the farmer who becomes 
possessed of their use after wintering his herd a few 
seasons sheltered from the northern blasts only by th&lt;» 
shadowy delusion of a barbed wire fence. </seg>

FRUIT GROWING IN NORTH CENTRAL NEBRASKA. 

FRUIT GROWING IN NORTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA. 

J. L. Coppoc. 

Mb. President and Gentlemen — I was thinking while 
Rev. Harrison was speaking that the Great Horticulturist 
did not go out of the business away back six thousand yean 
ago, but that we may look forward as well as backward to 
His work, and rejoice in the thought that all through eternity 
we may inhabit a land where there are fruit trees. I congratulate 
you on this thought. 

In regard to the President's statement that the country 
had been settled fifteen or sixteen years, I wish to say that 
between thirty and forty years ago the people from Iowa and 
farther east began to stick themselves away up along the 
north line of the state along the Niobrara river and its tributaries, 
and they brought with them the idea that obtains in 
nearly all new countries : "We can't raise fruit here." And 
the community generally accepted that idea, but some venturesome 
ranchman, not having the fear of public opinion 
before his eyes, took the risk of planting an orchard in order 
to demonstrate to those people that it was possible for a man 
to sit in his own family circle and consume fruit that was 
raised by the consumer. The result is that up in the northern 
part of Holt, Rock, and some of those other counties we have 
men to-day who are gathering rich harvests of fruit from 
their orchards. I will mention the name of Mr. L. D. Elliott, 
who has been for almost as long a time as the President gives 
the country credit for having been settled up, gathering fruit 
from his orchard — Iowa Blush, Wine Sap, and a few Ben 
Davis. He is not only gathering fruit, but he is gathering 
enough so that he has sold enough to bring him in reasonable 
returns for his work. 

Six or seven years ago it was my privilege to visit an orchard 
within about six miles of the north line of the state, </seg>

with the most l&gt;eautiful Ben Davis, Wine Sap, Iowa Blush, 
and some other varieties that I do not remember now. I am 
sorry to say that the night I staid with this gentleman there 
came a hail storm which ruined almost the entire crop. 

I would refer you also to Captain Greeley, an old soldier 
with one limb, who the past year sold f2,000 worth, mainly 
from fifteen acres of irrigated land. Can any of you gentlemen 
in the southeastern part of the state beat that? If you 
can, hold up your hands. I don't see any. ¦ 

In the south part of the county — by the way, I should say 
that north of the river, where all of these gentlemen reside of 
whom I have spoken, conditions are very different from those 
south of the river. The topography of the country is entirely 
different, being a high, rolling plateau, 150 feet to water, 
with a heavy clay soil. South of the river it is sandy, the 
country consisting mainly of sandhills and plains or plateaus 
where the water comes up almost to the surface, and in rainy 
seasons oozes out so that we have little ponds or reservoirs 
of water. 

In the south part of the county there are two conditions, 
or sets of conditions, which obtain largely along the Platte, 
if I am not mistaken. I was along there in 1857 and 1858 
and I noticed along the Platte, also in many other portions 
of the state, especially in the western part, conditions very 
similar to those which obtain in Holt county south of the 
Elkhorn river. These two conditions which confront the 
fruit grower in that country are, first, the sand. Now you 
gentlemen living in the southern and eastern part of the state 
will say : "That settles the matter." No; it does not settle it. 
We have settled it there to our satisfaction, and I believe we 
can prove to your satisfaction that we have settled it rifiht. 
That is, we can raise fruit on the very sandiest land by proper 
planting, cultivation, mulching, manuring, fertilizing, etc. 

Ent to say to you that the government experiment in 
culture in the sandhills is in our county. I had the

there Banksian pines that have made an average annual 
growth of two feet for nine years. Last year thew grew considerably 
more than that, and they are right on the top of the 
sandiest kind of a sandhill in that part of the country. Under 
the shade of these Banksian pines which have made such a 
rapid growth there are Bull pines, Arborvitaes, Scotch pines, 
and various other kinds of trees, showing that, while we are 
living in the sandhills, yet we may look forward with hope to 
the time when that country will not be as barren as it appears 
at the present time. 

Furthermore, the county that has produced the greatest 
value in agricultural products in a single season in the United 
States, seventy years ago consisted of shifting, white, burning 
sand. Yet ten or twelve years ago that wh county was the 
banner county of the United States in the value of its agricultural 
products. I refer to Burlington county, N. J. 

Another thing. The largest crop of corn that was ever produced 
in the history of the world, so far as we have any record, 
was produced on land just as sandy as any we have in 
Holt and adjoining counties — 25~&gt; bushels of shelled corn to 
the acre was raised in South Carolina, in the Awteritmn .1 ;//¦/-culturist 
contest some years ago. Two or three years before, 
the land upon which that corn was raised produced five bushels 
to the acre; they called it "starvation's half acre," am! 
by proper management, fertilization, etc., that land raised 
the largest crop of corn ever produced on the same amount 
of land in the world, so far as any record goes. 

Furthermore, in our part of the country the only fruit trees 
that are producing fruit to any extent are the trees that were 
planted on land just as sandy as this land where the govern 
ment experiment is being made in the sandhills. In 18JU ¦ 
Mr. Earl planted a number of trees two years old on very 
sandy land, and for the last four years he has been gatheri ug 
fruit from that land. Again, a Mr. White, ten miles west of 
Chambers, planted an orchard in 18M; this year he gathered

had it not been for the rosebugs which cut the cropshort materially. 
Still he put enough apples in his cellar so that he 
could not only feast on apples all winter, but distributed a 
good many to his neighbors. I say these things not only to 
let you know what we are doing, but to encourage people up 
there. At some time you may want to call on us for apples, 
and, gentlemen, you shall have them freely. 

Perhaps I ought to say a few words in regard to the proper 
management of this kind of land. I planted five hundred 
apple trees last year, most of them on this kind of land. The 
year before it had been in potatoes and pretty well manured. 
I don't mean manure piled up on it like you do on clay land, 
but perhaps there had been twenty loads to the acre scattered 
on the land. I measured the growth of those trees just before 
I came down here, and yearlings cut back to 18 inches sent 
forth limbs which measured in the aggregate, 13 feet, 4 inches. 
I don't know whether that is a very good growth or not, but 
it seemed so to me. How is it, Mr. President? 

The President — It is a very good growth. 

Mr. Coppoc (continuing) — You can see something of the 
possibilities of planting fruit trees on that land. I don't believe 
in this thing of sending off to Iowa or New York, or 
even down here to you gentlemen, for our fruit. Of course, 
we like to patronize you, but I believe we ought to patronize 
our own institutions, and I think the best thing our farmers 
can do is to plant orchards. The time is coming when they 
will realize this; in fact they are beginning to realize it, for 
they are sending out large orders for fruit trees, notwithstanding 
the discouragements that some of them have met 
with. 

I think the orchard should be mulched in the fall with 
barn-yard manure. Put it on pretty thick; three or four 
inches, perhaps, and then in the spring plow it under and 
cultivate thoroughly. As to when to stop cultivating, I am 
not going to say ; I think" I stopped a little too soon this year. 
Cultivate anyway during the growing season and get all the </seg>

growth you can ; then in the fall repeat the operation, putting 
on more manure and plowing it under in the spring. There 
is one thing, however, that should be guarded against, and 
that is allowing the mulch to get too close to the tree. I find 
that the field mice take advantage of every opportunity t&lt;&gt; 
skin the trees. I have had a number of trees killed in this 
way. The mice will go clear down into the ground to get the 
bark. 

This process of manuring and plowing under should be 
continued until you see the ground has enough manure, then 
put on a little lime; say, for instance, two bushels of un 
slacked lime to the acre and then let it lie a year, which will 
dissolve all of the plant food and put it in shape so the roots 
of the tree can get hold of it. Then, after the trees begin to 
bear, you may sow blue grass if you want to. I don't think I 
should, unless I get more light — nor clover, nor anything 
else. I should keep on cultivating. 

Now, the other difficulty is alkali. Avoid the alkali if you 
can; it is poison to trees, and to anything else, in fact It 
requires a good deal of work to get rid of it, but if you cant 
find a place for your orchard where it is more favorable, go 
to work on the alkali ; it will pay you richly, even on the 
alkali. And by the way, we are not the only people who have 
alkali. As I said a while ago, they have an immense amount 
of it up the Platte river, and if I can say anything that will 
be of any benefit to any one who has this difficulty to contend 
with, I shall be glad. I have experimented with it considerably 
and gone to a good deal of trouble to ascertain the best 
methods of handling it, and there is a way to get rid of it. 

The black alkali is the most poisonous to plant life. It is 
carbonate of soda, and one- tenth of one per cent in the soil 
is about the limit in which plants will grow. White alkali is 
sulphate of soda, and of this there may be one-half of one per 
cent in the soil without destroying plant life. So if you can 
change the carbonate to sulphate by some chemical process, 
you will put it in shape so your plants will not be destroyed. </seg>

            <seg id="p041">
40 


To do this, draw the original soil from around the tree, and 
hank it up with soil from another source that is free from 
alk;ili. and pour some sulphuric acid around the tree. Do not 
get it too close, say six or seven inches from the tree, and then 
be sure that you have a drain so that the water will run off 
and not stand around the tree. It will be but a little while 
until you will see that the black alkali, or carbonate of soda, 
has changed its nature and is now sulphate of soda, which 
will leach out of the land very easily. You will also notice 
that the fertility of the soil is increased wonderfully, because 
wherever there is this alkali you will find there also plant 
food like potash, phosphates, nitrogen, etc., which are absolutely 
essential to the growth of plants. But if you leach out 
the carbonate of soda without changing it to sulphate, you 
will find that the plant food goes with it. 

Just a word more. There is another way in which yon can 
save your trees in the alkali land, and that is hy wrapping 
them with paper. Common aewapapen will do, and when one 
paper rots off, put another on. They should be wrapped from 
a little above the surface to a little below it, as the injury 
from alkali is always near the surface of the ground. I make 
these suggestions that any one who has this alkali land may 
make the tests and see whether my statements are true. I 
thank you for your attention. 

Sir. L. A. Goodman, delegate from the Missouri State 
rticultural Society, was introduced and spoke as follows: 

Mr. President — I am glad indeed to greet you in the name 
of the Horticultural Society of Missouri. Your work is our 
work ; and our work is your work. Especially in northern Missouri 
we are trying to build up what we term a sort of western 
horticulture. In doing that we have succeeded in making 
a good many mistakes, but I think we are coming now to a 
point where we may begin to see definite results. 

The first thing to be considered in any country, I think, is </seg>

            <seg id="p042">
FRUIT (iUOWING IN NORTH CKNTRAL NKBRASKA. 

41 

varieties of fruit in a climate to which they are not adapts 1. 
On- this first point we have made a great many mistakes all 
through Missouri. There are certain varieties of apples, for 
instance, tha.t are not adapted to the western climate, and it 
is useless to go over and over again the experiments that we 
have passed through in trying to grow these varieties. 

I think you will coincide with me when I say the next point 
to l&gt;e considered is the soil. I know there are certain soils in 
Missouri where I am just ;is sine to raise a good orchard and 
get profitable crops from it as I am to raise corn or wheat 
•¦acli year. So we are trying to study our soils and see which 
arc best adapted to fruit and orchard planting, and we are 
coming to believe that the subsoil is even more important 
than the soil itself. Many times man may help make the soil, 
but no man can make the subsoil; consequently it is only 
when we have the proper subsoil that we are sure of having a 
plantation that will give us proper returns for years to come. 
That jKtint has been impressed on me during the last ten or 
fifteen years, and I believe I can go where I can select the 
proper soil and subsoil and feel sure of what the results 
will be. 

Then the next point to be considered is, what varieties do 
best on these various soils? I am sure also in this regard 
that there are certain varieties that are sure to succeed on 
soil of a certain character, while there are certain other vari 
eties that are just as sure to fail. For instance, take the 
Clayton, which is one of our profitable coming apples in I 
souri ; put that on a heavy clay subsoil with a rather poof 
soil, and it is almost sure to make a failure. Put it on a 
red soil with a red subsoil, and it is almost sure to succeed. 
I can point to two orchards in Missouri where the Clayton 
has not only paid more money, but has actually given more 
bushels of apples year after year for fifteen years than the 
Ben Davis. Now, what would you do in that case? Yon 
would never plant Ben Davis on that soil. Let the other </seg>

            <seg id="p043">
42 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

which is worth more money, bushel for bushel, than the Ben 
Davis. I know two orchards, also, in which the Jonathan has 
proved very successful. And I would say to those men, 
"Never plant Ben Davis or any other variety, on that land 
except the Jonathan, for which you can get the top of the 
market all the time." So I say the adaptability of the different 
varieties to certain soils and subsoils is one of the 
most important features we have to study in connection with 
this great orchard problem. 

Then, we have come to the point — as you are beginning to 
realize in Nebraska — where we believe that the more we can 
plant, and the more people we can get interested in a cerliiiu 
locality, the better it is for us. Take for example a locality 
where a man can find from five to eight thousand acres 
of orchards within a certain limit; what happens? We have 
a hundred men down in there trying to buy our apples, and 
it is no trouble at all to sell. Every day or two some buyer 
comes along and asks you what you will take for an orchard 
of 5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 bushels of apples. The result is 
that they all go, and every one is pleased. In that way a 
community of interests is developed in a large way in our 
orchard plantings. This is one of the strong points in our 
orcharding now in the West, though entirely different from 
what we were led to believe in the East ; that is, that the more 
tipples we have in a given locality, the less the price will be. 
This trouble of over-production has been a bugbear ever since 
I was a boy. I remember in western New York we sold 
apples for 6± cents — the old sixpence — per bushel. I left 
western New York, and eight years after that they sold them 
for 75 cents a bushel. I have seen the same results in southern 
Michigan, and the same results in Jackson county, Missouri. 
When I started in the orchard business my neighbors 
told me when my orchard got to bearing I would never be 
able to sell the apples. The result was that when my orchard 
got to bearing I could sell my apples for more money on the 
trees, without being touched, than my neighbors could get </seg>

FRUIT GROWING IN NORTH CENTRAL NEBRASKA. 

43 

for theirs picked and hauled to town. I sold this year 16,000 
bushels of apples, and had no trouble whatever in disposing 
of them for more than the market price. 

I am sorry to tell you, also, of some failures we have had ; 
especially in southern Missouri, the "land of the big red 
apple.". Not more than one-half of the orchards planted in 
that Ozark region are really upon the proper soil and subsoil. 
Too many times there is a sort of hard-pan below — or 
what we know as hard-pan — which causes the trees to die. 
So it is not all success ; not all on one side. Many are meeting 
failures and saying that apple growing is a failure; but 
wherever they study the character of the soil and subsoil, 
and plant varieties adapted to that soil and subsoil, and take 
care of their fruit in the proper way, those men are making 
money and making it right along. 

And so I greet you in this matter, and assure you that the 
more apples you raise up here in Nebraska, the more we shall 
sell in Missouri, and the more certain it is that we shall hold 
the great market for apples out here in this western country. 

Mr. O. H. Barnhill, of Shenandoah, la., delegate from the 
Iowa State Horticultural Society, was introduced and spoke 
as follows : 

Mr. President and Fellow Horticulturists — It is hardly 
necessary to say that I am glad to be with you. Horticulturists 
always enjoy getting together, and their meetings are 
always profitable; at least I have always found them so. 
This is the fourth meeting I have had the privilege of attending 
this winter, and have also visited a number of experimental 
stations. Yesterday I had the honor and pleasure 
of visiting J. Sterling Morton, the Father of Arbor Day, and 
I assure you I had a very pleasant and profitable visit. I 
think you should act upon the recommendation of your president, 
and appoint delegates to as many state meetings as </seg>

            <seg id="p045">

NKBRASKA STATE HORTICTLTURAL SOCIETY. 

possible. A local horticultural meeting is a good thing; a 
district meeting is better; a state meeting is better than a district 
meeting; but a meeting where there are representat 
from a number of states is letter yet. Where just a few people 
from one locality get together, they are apt to be rather 
narrow in their views; but where the j&gt;eople are gathered 
from different localities, the discussions will take wider 
range, and much better information will be gained. 

I have been very much interested in your discussions since 
I have been in this meeting, but 1 wish to criticise your program 
in one particular; you have too many subjects. You 
would find it much more profitable if you had fewer subjects 
and would discuss them more thoroughly; get the opinions of 
different individuals from a large scope of territory. 

One speaker stated that the people in many places did not 
want horticultural speakers, and some might think that a 
good reason why horticulturists should not be sent there, but 
I do not see it in that light. Over in China the natives do 
not, as a rule, welcome the missionaries with open arms; yet 
we do not think that is any good reason why we should not 
send missionaries over there. I look upon this institute work 
in the same light. These horticulturists are missionaries. 
The men who leave their business and spend time and effort 
in attending these meetings should be looked upon as 
missionaries. 

I wish to say a word in regard to Mr. Harrison's paper. I 
wish he could read that paper in every farmers' institute in 
this state and Iowa. I heard a professional man say that he 
had attended political meetings, stockmen's meetings, and 
horticultural meetings, and he was impressed with the high 
character of the horticulturists. They are a higher class of 
men than will be found in any other kind of meeting. They 
are very temperate ; you hardly ever find one who drinks, and 
very few of them even'use tobacco. I think the occupation in 
which they are engaged has this effect on character. 

I shall not take your time further, but simply say that I 
pm very glad indeed to be with you. </seg>

REPOKT FKOM PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION 

J. H. Hadkinson. 

Mb. President — Having been in charge of the Nebraska 

horticultural exhibit as your superintendent, 1 herewith sub- 

mit report of work done and expenditures in this department. 

On May 7, 1901, I was appointed by Mr. E. L. Vance, Com- 

missioner for Nebraska to the Pan-American Exposition, on 

recommendation of your honorable society, and took up the 

preliminary work in June. •Commencing with July, I took 

up the work in reality. As you know, the appropriation for 

the Nebraska exhibit was not made by our legislature until 

early in April, therefore it was too late to get winter fruits. 

and the distance to ship being so great it was decided not to 

put on exhibit, early small fruits, as they are soft and wilt 

down quickly. In the middle of July I arrived in Buffalo 

and commenced preparing space for the exhibit which we 

filled shortly afterwards. This space, consisting of 540 

square feet, with table space for 520 plates, was kept filled 

from this time till the close of the exposition, November 2, 

during which time the following varieties of fruit were 

exhibited : 

Applet 58 varieties 

Crab apples 14 

Pears 4 

Peaches 14 

Plums, named 88 

Plums, crosses and hybrids 104 

Apricots 12 

Nectarines 2 

Grapes 8 

Currants 2 

Buffalo berries 1 

The exposition being located in the center of the fruit belt 

of the United States, our Nebraska exhibit created no little

REPORT FROM PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 

On the day of my appointment the sum of $2,500 was 
pledged for this department, thus leaving an unexpended balance 
of $190.02. 

The success of this exhibit is largely due to unity of action 
by the commissioner, Hon. E. L. Vance, and the Nebraska 
State Horticultural Society, they rendering me every 
assistance within their power, thereby making this work 
pleasant and agreeable for myself and assistant. 

To Mr. C. H. Barnard, the field man, great credit is due, 
also to the fruit growers of the state who contributed so liberally 
of their best fruits in so discouraging a season. I wish 
to return my personal thanks to all who have contributed in 
any way to the success of this exhibit, and trust the following 
list of awards will speak for themselves as to the merits of 
the same: 

GOLD MEDALS. 

Nebraska State Horticultural Society, for display of fruits. 
Theo. Williams, Benson, for display of hybrid plums. 
Youngers &amp; Co., Geneva, for display fruits. 

SILVER MEDAL. 

Marshall Bros., Arlington, display of apples. 
J. M. Russell &amp; Co., Lincoln, display of peaches. 

BRONZE MEDAL. 

C. H. Barnard, Table Bock, display of apples and pears. 
Wm. McCormick, Blair, display of fruits. 

HONORABLE MENTION.

HOKTHTLTURAL GLEANINGS FROM THE PANAMERICAN 
EXPOSITION. 

By J. H. Hadkinson. 

It was my privilege and pleasure to serve the state of Nebraska, 
and the State Horticultural Society, as superintend 
ent of horticulture at the Pan-American Exposition at 
Buffalo, therein giving me a good opportunity to gather 
items for this subject. 

First of all I must say that Nebraska is not looked upon 
by eastern j&gt;eople in general as having even the preliminary 
qualifications for fruit growing of any description; therefore 
the Nebraska fruit exhibit at Buffalo was a marked surprise 
to those i&gt;eople. And while it may seem egotism on my pair. 
I firmly believe that the exhibit at Huffalo will do us more 
good for the amount of money expended than any exhibit we 
could have made outside of those far eastern states. I am 
truly sorry, as a middle- west man, that all of the middle-west 
states did not respond to the appeal of P. W. Taylor, as su]»erintendent 
of horticulture at the Pan-American, and make a 
showing side by side. For instance, if Iowa, Kansas, and 
Colorado had made an exhibit alongside Illinois, .Missouri, 
Wisconsin, and Nebraska, what an advertisement it would 
have been.for this section. 

I will here quote the words of an Iowa visitor at the exposition 
: "You Nebraska people have lots of grit to exhibit 
alongside Ontario and New York." My response was, "If 
Iowa and the middle-west had displayed some of the same 
kind of grit, the middle-west would have been benefited 
materially." 

The Illinois people made themselves felt at Buffalo; so did 
Missouri ; and Wisconsin and Nebraska created no little surprise. 
Wisconsin's Wealthy and McMahon White, and Nebraska's 
Ben Davis, Jonathan, and Missouri Pippin were a 
surprise to say the least </seg>

GLEANINGS FROM PAX-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 

49 

The Nebraska exhibit of plums, named hybrids, and 
crosses, were a source of surprise and admiration to all horticulturists. 
Most of these were supplied by Mr. Theo. Williams 
of Benson, to whom Nebraskans Mght to take off their 
bats, as the scientific men of other states have donr. in 
knowledgment of his wonderful achievements in derelopiag 
plums. He is truly our middle-west Burbank. 

This exhibit was awarded the American romologiral So 
ciety silver medal, or highest award. Iowa, Boath Dakota, 
Wisconsin, Illinois, New England states, and part of Can 
ada are aware of his works and profiting by them more than 
we are here at home; and I must say it is time for us to wakeup 
and grasp these valuable varieties that have been bred and 
created right here at home. When the Division of Pomology 
of the Department of Agriculture will prepare and exhibit 
wax models of these plums that have ben created by Mr. 
Williams, I am sure we ought to take more interest in them. 

While I have dwelt at some length on the plum qaec 
this is not the only Nebraska fruit on exhibit which commanded 
attention. The size of the Elberta i&gt;eaches exhibited 
by Youngers &amp; Co. was a source of great astonishment 
was also the Russell peach, exhibited by J. M. IJussell A I 
of Lincoln. This peach was pronounced by Mr. Powell, superintendent 
of the New York State Experiment Station 
be equal in flavor to Stump the World, which is certainly a 
high tribute to a peach originated in Nebraska — the center of 
the "wild and woolly west," as looked upon by our eastern 
friends. I hope our exhibit left an impression which will remove 
from the minds of many their erroneous ideas of our 
state horticulturally. 

Even Professor Bailey, in his Cyclopedia of American Horticulture, 
casts a doubt upon propagation by budding in this 
state. I am sure this is entirely wrong, but wish to appeal 
here to the propagators present for their experience and obsevation 
along this line.

tirely to the state of Nebraska, though I have observed the 
results in a great many other places. I have visited all of the 
principal nurseries of Nebraska and Kansas, as well as a 
good many in Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois, and my experience 
is this : That we get better stands of buds, and in certain 
lines of trees can grow better trees than can be grown anywhere 
else in the United States. That is putting it pretty 
broad, but I believe I know what I am talking about. We 
can grow as good cherries right here in Nebraska as can be 
grown anywhere in the United States, with the possible exception 
of Huntsville, and I don't believe we need to take off 
our hats even to Huntsville. We have been propagating 
plums, cherries, pears, peaches, apples, roses, and different 
sorts of shade trees by budding whenever we wished ; peaches, 
plums, pears, and cherries exclusively by budding. Professor 
Bailey is on the wrong track. I have never seen but one place 
in my travels where budding was any more successful than 
here in Nebraska, and that was Grand Junction, Col., where 
they have absolute control of the moisture. 

G. A. Marshall — Our experience is just about the same as 
Mr. Brown's. I have noticed in going through the nurseries 
in the East that our stands of buds are just about as good, if 
not a little better, than they have there. I have visited the 
nurseries around Rochester, Fredonia, and other so-called 
nursery centers of the country, and every time I come home 
from there feeling that Nebraska has the ideal soil and climate 
for the propagation of nursery stock in any manner, 
and especially by budding. Take the apple, for instance. It 
is the easiest thing in the world to bud apple and get a perfect 
stand; we never count on anything less than a stand. 
The apple is one of the fruits which the eastern people claim 
is hard to propagate by budding, but here it seems to be 
right at home. 

L. M. Russell — I would just like to add a word. I haven't 
seen any better trees come from any place in the United </seg>

GLEANINGS FROM PAX-AMKIUCAX EXPOSITION. 

Mr. Stephens took a trip to Huutsville, where they make a 
good deal of noise about budding cherries. On his return he 
went through our blocks of buds, and he said he didn't see a 
better stand of buds in Alabama anywhere than we had. Of 
course, at that time of year their trees were a little larger, 
because their season is earlier. Our trees may not get quite 
as heavy in the top, but there is no place where they can produce 
a better root than we can in Nebraska. The same is 
true of other trees. Our experience is mostly with the cherry, 
peach, pear, and plum, and I think we can grow just as good 
trees as can be grown anywhere. 

P. A. Muephy — When I was a boy I did considerable budding 
in New York state, and I find that the work has to be 
done here about a month earlier than there, in order to have 
good success. I think nurserymen coming from the East have 
a great deal to learn about the method of getting buds to 
grow in Nebraska. If the nurserymen of Nebraska learn the 
proper time to do the work, I think they will have just as 
good success, and even better, than in the eastern states. 

Mr. Hadkinson (continuing) — Prof. Bailey gives us due 
credit for freedom from fungous diseases, which, of course, 
is no more than our due. Nebraska's fall sunshine gives 
flavor to our much esteemed Jonathans, which are the ideal 
of the epicure. Even eastern orchardists admitted their quality 
to me in Buffalo, saying, "These are good ; just about as 
good as our Baldwins and Greenings." This, you know, is a 
great admission, coming from our eastern friends. 

I must here state that our field man, Mr. C. H. Barnard, 
sent me some Baldwins from northeast Nebraska which, in 
flavor, were as good as the eastern Baldwin, and pronounced 
by New York horticulturists to be fine. Why can't we grow 
more of them? Northeastern Nebraska sent very fine apples 
for exhibition ; I must say in size, the largest, and quite free 
from imperfections. 

I will here give you a list of the four winter varieties standing 
first in the following states: </seg>

Missouri — Ben Davis, Gano, Winesap, Jonathan. 

Kansas — Bon Davis, Huntsman, Jonathan, Wolf River. 

Washington — Baldwin, Spitzenburg, Ben Davis, Greening. 

Nebraska — Bin Davis, Missouri Pippin, Winesap, Jonathan. 


Oregon — Baldwin, King, Wolf River, Wealthy. 
New York — Baldwin, King, Greening, Spitzenburg. 
Connecticut — Baldwin, Russet, King, Northern Spy. 
Wisconsin — Duchess, Wealthy, Wolf River, M. W. Green-

Illinois — Ben Davis, Grimes Golden, Jonathan, Winesap. 

New Mexico — Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, Jonathan, Wolf

Maine — Baldwin, Northern Spy, Greening, King. 

California — Newtown Pippin, Baldwin, Winesap, Ben 
Davis. 

Virginia — Newtown Pippin, Baldwin, Winesap, York

Ontario — Baldwin, Northern Spy, Greening, King, 

Nora Scotia — Gravenstein, King, Ribston Pippin, Nonpareil. 


I will now pass from the apple to diseases of the apple, 
plum, and peach as found east. While we are troubled with 
codling moth, plum pocket, and plum gouger, we have little 
to fear in the way of injury to peaches. When once we get 
a crop set we are reasonably sure of results. Some eastern 
states have the apple maggot, which bores through the fruit, 
honey-combing it so it is unfit for use, with only small black 
spots appearing on the outside to mark its existence. 

In the East plums drop badly and are subject to rot; this 
is due largely to the damp climate. Peaches are subject to 
yellows. It is needless to say that these diseases are unknown 
in Nebraska. 

Trees — both forest and fruit — grow more slowly in the 
East than here, and attain a decidedly different form, apple 
¦ especially being more branched, with flat heads. Travel-</seg>

GLEANINGS FROM PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 

ing east, one begins to notice this change while crossing Illinois, 
and it becomes more pronounced the farther east one 
goes, until in New York it appears in its full form. 

Pears are grown largely around the lakes, while grapes are 
certainly in their glory along the southeast shore of Lake 
Erie, though in some places they are attacked by disease. 
Great quantities of grapes are made into grape juice. Even 
the small growers press out the juice (when grapes are a drag 
on the market) and sell to the manufacturers of grape juice, 
grapine, and its kindred products. I am told that nine cents 
is considered a fair price for 8-pound baskets of grapes. 

Returning to the apple as it appears on exhibit, New York, 
Illinois, and Ontario put up large exhibits. The fruit of 
New York was not so highly colored as that of Ontario and 
Illinois, but was solid in appearance. Green apples and blue 
plums seem to sell best in eastern home markets, which accounts 
for these varieties being planted in large quantities. 
Although green apples are the predominating varieties 
grown, yet Baldwin, Northern Spy, and King are largely 
grown, and even the much-abused Ben Davis is being planted 
extensively, though it does not appear to prosper as it does 
in the home of its first love — the West. I suppose this is 
because it appreciates the glad hand of welcome extended to 
it by the Middle West in its early days. This apple is sought 
for by export buyers more than any other variety, and Mr. 
Hoag, of Lockport, N. Y., a grower and large buyer for export, 
says that the Ben Davis is sought for in England on 
account of its peculiar flavor when cooked. He ships la 
apples south, small ones north, Ben Davis in quantity to England, 
and medium sized, firm fruit to Germany. Culls are 
taken by the driers, and these in turn ship the cores and peelings 
abroad and to home concerns for making apple butter, 
jellies, etc. Many cores are shipped to Germany. 

The highly colored exhibit of Illinois attracted the eye, 
and the fine exhibit of Ontario of fruits in general deserves 
commendation as well as a fear of rivalry by their eastern 
neighbors. </seg>

New Mexico and Nova Scotia had on exhibit some fine 
Bpecimens free from scab and other diseases, making a fine 
showing. 

Washington placed on exhibit some large apples, the varieties 
differing very much in form from eastern and middlewest 
apples. Their Ben Davis are elongated, also their Bellflowers 
; but I must say the flavor was not up to that of the 
Nebraska Jonathan. 

Wisconsin had on exhibit some fine Wealthy, which for 
flavor and color were hard to beat The Mclntosh Red of Ontario 
was a rounder apple than ours, also elongated somewhat, 
and dark red. 

Virginia had some fine Winesap, Newtown Pippin, York 
Imperial. Missouri Pippin is being introduced into Virginia, 
and from early products promises to be profitable. Ohio 
growers claim that this variety dies out when about eight 
years old. 

Baldwin is probably the variety which changes most in 
growth and appearance, Maine Baldwins being decidedly red 
and flat, while those from Connecticut differ in appearance 
as much as Stark and Winesap in color and form. 

I can not pass on without quoting the remarks of the general 
public who exclaimed at the large varieties such as Wolf 
River, McMahon's White, and Alexander, not looking farther 
for smaller varieties of more value, and it is with me an unsolved 
problem whether it pays to exhibit scientifically. We 
could certainly attract more attention and please the general 
public better by exhibiting only those varieties having no 
further value than size. I saw a picture which attracted my 
attention. It was a rural scene, with Mr. Ben Davis and Miss 
Kieffer linked arm in arm, coming down the road in holiday 
attire, cutting a wide swath. Messrs. Baldwin, Esopus 
Spitzenburg, Louise Bonne, d'Anjou, Angouleme, Northern 
Spy, Greening, and others were sitting on a rail fence with a 
tearful look, envying their more joyful neighbors who were 
eniovintr life The moral of this is applicable to the Middle </seg>

location. 

There is an old saying, "A prophet is unknown in his own 
country." Whether this is true or false, I know a person 
can leave his native state and find out what they are doing 
at home. One day at the exhibit I was attracted with the 
great interest taken by a young man, and making up an acquaintance 
found he was from Valentine, Neb. He had 
emigrated there in 1890 from New Jersey. His previous occupation 
was that of working in an organ factory. Now he 
has 160 acres of land, a good herd of dairy cows, and last, 
but not least, a fine orchard of 175 trees of apples, crabs, and 
cherries. His cherries bore first year from planting. He 
also reported others doing similar work in what is known as 
the sandhills of Nebraska, and generally looked upon as a 
country where fruit trees will not prosper. 

I can not close without remarks about horticulture in general. 
We have in our state a grand opportunity to develop, 
expand, and take in more territory for horticultural purposes, 
and I think it is the duty of our Society to go out into 
the highways and hedges and try to extend our horticultural 
work to all corners of our state. I believe the state is divided 
into too large districts hortieulturally, and will here give 
my opinion as to further divisions: No. 1 could easily be 
divided north and south ; No. 2, east and west ; No. 3, north 
and south ; No. 4, east and west ; No. 5, north and south ; part 
of No. 6 added to No. 4 ; No. 7, north and south ; No. 8, north 
and south; No. 9, north and south. There are so many 
varied conditions in our state that we could do a good work 
looking up these corners. 

I came in contact with a good many persons who visited 
the exposition from northeastern Nebraska and reported the 
successful growth of Wealthy, Oldenburg, and Whitney, in 
Cedar, Dixon, Dakota, Wayne, and Thurston counties.

South Dakota, and I am crank enough to state that we could 
derive great benefit from his work for the beautifying of our 
farm and city homes in Nebraska. It is not so much because 
we do not have the facilities for beautifying our homes, but 
because we do not make a judicious use of the things at hand. 
If the gardeners for a Russian prince can make beauty of the 
common woodbine, why can not we adorn our Nebraska 
homes with what we have at command? 

HOW THE TREES CAME TO NEBRASKA. 

By Dr. Charles E. Bessey. 

It is a fact that all kinds of plants have some means of 
traveling, and that is done, not by the movement of the plants, 
but by the dispersal of their seeds. 

The migration of plants is by means of their fruits and 
seeds, and nature has displayed in these structures much 
of ingenuity and variety in order to secure migration. Thus 
many plants provide their seeds or their fruits with wings or 
other devices (such as the fluffy down of the fruits of the 
thistle and their relatives, and the similar down on the seeds 
of the cottonwood, the milkweeds, etc.), by which they are 
able to float for greater or less distances in the air, especially 
when the air is moving, as in winds or storms. The winged 
seeds and fruits of plants are therefore common means for 
carrying the young plants, which are tucked snugly in the 
seeds, away from the parent plants. Sometimes in open countries 
like that of the Plains such winged structures are carried 
for many miles, and accordingly we find that many kinds 
of plants migrate in the direction of the prevailing winds. 

Another common method of plant migration is by means 
of seeds and fruits which are sufficiently light to be easily 
floated upon the water. Thus many of these structures are </seg>

57 

HOW THE TREES CAME TO NEBRASKA. 

and even, where they are very thoroughly protected against 
the effects of salt water, they have been known to float for 
hundreds or thousands of miles in the waters of the ocean. 
There is no doubt at all in the mind of the naturalist that the 
many species of plants which are found in the islands of the 
sea have been brought there by means of their floating seeds 
or fruits. On the Plains we find that many mountain plants 
have come down the streams from the West, and such plants 
occur in very considerable numbers on the islands and along 
the banks of these streams. 

Still another device is that of the edible seeds and fruits 
which attract animals of all kinds. The flesh which comprises 
portions of many fruits is a bait which attracts the 
bird or quadruped, as also the edible contents of many seeds. 
We are familiar with the distribution of cherries of various 
kinds. Birds love the juicy flesh of the cherry, and habitually 
pluck the fruit from the tree, fly to some convenient 
stump or stake, and, there driving it into a crack, are able to 
clean the flesh from the stone. The stone soon falls to the 
ground and eventually springs up into a new tree. In the 
East it is a very common occurrence to find that within a few 
years every fence row is fringed with cherry trees which 
spring up from the stones scattered in this way. In like manner 
the nut-bearing trees are distributed by squirrels and 
other animals which feed upon the edible contents. Acorns, 
hickorynuts, walnuts, etc., are carried for considerable distances 
by squirrels and other rodents, and all such seeds 
which escape the sharp teeth of the little animals eventually 
have the opportunity of springing up and developing into 
trees. Man himself takes part in the distribution of plants in 
this way. He eats an apple for the fleshy fruit and throws 
the core away. In this he is doing precisely what nature intends. 
When a hungry boy eats up the apple, core and all, he 
is defeating nature's purpose. The flesh is the bait to secure 
the carrying away of the precious seeds which are contained 
within it, and when once the carrying has been performed the </seg>

flesh is of no more value to the seeds ; so man may as well eat 
the flesh, but nature designs that he shall always throw the 
core away.

I have carefully gone over the trees which are found wild 
in Nebraska, and examined their seeds and fruits with reference 
to their means of dispersal. The list is as follows :

DISCUSSION OF METHODS. 

I have from time to time spoken of the particular methods 
by which forest areas extend their margins, and I need not 
repeat more than sufficient to give a mere outline at this 
time. In most cases where trees are moving forward there 
is in advance of the edge of the timber a margin of weeds. 
In these weeds the grasses which form a sod are destroyed 
and in a short time there is no sod in this belt. Quite soon, 
shrubs of various kinds appear in this weedy border, and they 
also hold the ground against the grasses. A little later the </seg>

seeds of the adjacent trees which find their way into this belt 
of weeds and shrubs germinate and start up into young trees, 
so that at this time we have small trees intermingledwith 
the weeds and shrubs. Sooner or later these trees, as 
they grow older, begin to over-top the shrubs and weeds, ami 
finally they choke them out, so that we have this curious condition; 
that whereas the weeds and shrubs formed a good 
nursery in which the young trees grew ; when these trees became 
older, they turned about and entirely destroyed the 
weeds and shrubs. In this manner forest areas are extended, 
and we see here one very good use for weeds. 

CITATIOX OF FACTS. 

I need not repeat what you all know so wall, as to the natural 
spreading of the timber in this state. This matter has 
been discussed again and again in this society, and very many 
of you have furnished me with the facts which I have cited in 
previous papers. Suffice it to say that during the past summer 
the forestry party, sent out by the Bureau of Forestry of 
the United States Department of Agriculture, found that 
there is evidence of such natural spreading in all portions of 
the state. 

I think some members of this party entered upon this work 
having some doubts in regard to this matter, but if there 
were such doubts, they were entirely dispelled after the first 
two weeks of study of the natural bodies of timber in the 
state. 

I may profitably quote here from letters which I have received 
from investigators in other states, in order to showthat 
this movement of trees is not confined to this immediate 
locality. Prof. Blankenship, of the Montana State Coll 
in a letter written to me some time last year, says: "I was 
over a great part of the territory of Alberta in Canada this 
summer. In tracing the mountain flora northward I was 
surprised to find the forest area there of very recent growth. 
A few veare ago I was up in the sub-arctic forests between </seg>

            <seg id="p062">
61 


Quebec and Lake St. John, and these showed every evidence 
of age; not so much in the size of the trees as iu the great 
mass of fallen and moss-covered timber which practically 
made it impossible to travel across the country. In the country 
about Edmonton, Alberta, and southward to the plains, 
the trees are not only small, but there is none of that fallen 
timber characterizing the Hudson's Bay region, while prairies 
are interspersed throughout, and increasing in size and 
frequency southward." This shows that the same conditions 
are to be found nearly a thousand miles further north upon 
the Plains, and that there, as here, the trees are pushing out 
into the open land. 

In an earlier communication the same observer describes 
the conditions of the forests of southern Missouri, and states 
that in many places on the border line between forests and 
prairies the forests are passing up the ravines and meeting 
behind knobs which lie between the ravines, and that then 
from all sides the forest trees encroach upon these open areas, 
eventually covering them. In many places these knobs are 
still bare and are known as "bald knobs," while a short distance 
back the knobs are plainly but very recently covered 
with trees. 

Prof. Edward M. Shepherd, acting state geologist of Mis 
souri, in a letter to me some time last summer, confirms this 
statement of Prof. Blankenship. He says : '-There is no q 
tion whatsoever in regard to the fact that our timber plats 
have spread in a remarkable manner since this country was 
first known. I have first the evidence of an early settler, who 
was the first white man, so far as we know, to penetrate into 
the territory now called Greene county. He speaks in his 
journal of his visit here in 1819, and describes more or 
less explicitly the condition of the country, showing that the 
timber has since spread to a considerable degree. I also have 
the evidence of old settlers who have pointed out to me square 
miles of area at the head of some of our rivers and streams 
now covered with dense timber that were in their early day 
rolling prairies." </seg>

            <seg id="p063">

RKSUI.TS. 

I think it quite safe for me to say that as a result of the 
study of the native forest trees of Nebraska, we may say with 
confidence that the great number of our trees have eomc 
in from the southeast, and that they have followed the great 
valley of the Missouri westward from the Mississippi valley 
proper and then northwestward into Missouri, Nebraska, and 
Iowa. If we examine a map of the state on which we have 
traced the distribution of the different kinds of trees, we find 
that a few of them just touch the southeastern counties and 
extend from there southeastward into Missouri. Others have 
entered Nebraska for one or two counties and no more; and 
still others which are very common in the Missouri forests 
have pushed up perhaps a hundred miles or more into Nebraska, 
some going up the Missouri river itself and others 
pushing westward up the Nemaha, and also up the Blue and 
Republican rivers. 

In the west end of this state some trees have pushed in 
from the Rocky Mountain forests. These have in part followed 
the mountain ranges known as the Pine Ridge on the 
north and the Wild Cat Mountains on the south. Others 
have followed down the streams for a greater or less distance. 

The trees which have come into Nebraska from the eastern 
forests in this way are the common Red Cedar, Pawpaw, 
probably all of our Willows which attain the dimensions of 
trees (six in number), one Cottonwood, Basswood, all of our 
Elms (three in number) our Wild Apple, four species of 
Hawthorns, Juneberry, Wild Cherry, Choke Cherry, Wild 
Plum, Coffee Bean, Honey Locust, Red-bud, Sycamore, two 
species of Buckthorn, Buckeye, one of our Maples, Box-elder, 
Sumach, two species of Walnuts, all of our Hickories (five 
in number), all of our Oaks (nine or ten in number), Ironwood, 
Blue Beech, and possibly one Birch. Here are fiftysix 
or fifty-seven species of trees which have without much 
question come into the state from the forests of the Missis- </seg>

sippi valley. The trees which have come into the state from 
the Rocky Mountain forests number but ten species, but they 
have made much less impression upon the forests of the state 
than those which came from the eastern forests. Those which 
belong to this list are the Bull Pine, the Western Red Cedar, 
four species of the Cottonwood, Buffalo Berry, one Maple, 
and two Birches 

THE ORIGIN OF ARBOR DAY AND ITS RESULTS. 

By Hon. J. Sterling Morton. 

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Society — I was 
very much gratified to receive the invitation of your Secretary 
to be present and address you to-day upon the subject 
just named. 

On the 4th day of January, 1872, thirty years ago this 
month, it was my pleasure at a meeting of the State Board of 
Agriculture of Nebraska to introduce the resolution which 
created and named Arbor Day. There was some discussion 
as to the name. Some suggested that it be called Sylvan Day. 
I contended that Arbor Day covered all trees, while Sylvan 
would only describe forest trees; and the object of having 
a particular day set apart sacred to tree planting was to 
concentrate the public mind on that one subject. I presume 
the 4th of July, if it had been celebrated along through the 
year, would never have become such a patriotic anniversary. 
The idea was to concentrate all the thought of all the commonwealth 
on a single day, upon the very important topic of 
tree planting. 

It was fortunate for me and fortunate for the proposed anniversary 
that at that time the executive chair was filled by 
Robert W. Furnas, than whom there never has been a more 
devoted horticulturist, either in this state or any other. Consequently 
he issued a proclamation setting apart the day </seg>

            <seg id="p065">
64 


inn;. The Hoard had offered awards or premiums for the 
greatest number of trees planted on that day, to be found in 
good condition by the committee at the time of the next succeeding 
state fair, amounting to between one and two hundred 
dollars, as I remember. I think there were four premiums 
all together. 

The result of that first Arbor Day showed cuttings and 
trees planted to the number of more than three millions in 
the state of Nebraska. There have been many succeeding celebrations 
of the anniversary, wherein many more trees have 
been planted, until I think the statistics in the hands of the 
Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture show that upon 
this anniversary in this state, during the thirty years of its 
celebration, there have been nearly twenty -five billions of 
trees and cuttings put out. 

It seemed to be so practical, seemed so unlike all other anniversaries, 
because, instead of celebrating a thing past, or 
commemorating something our ancestors had done, it stood 
with its face to the future and pronounced a benediction for 
posterity. It became popular in other states, until now it is 
celebrated in every state and territory in the American 
Union. It has also gone abroad and is celebrated in India 
and some of the islands of the sea. So that I think it is safe 
to say that the results have been all that you, or I, or any 
one, however enthusiastic on the subject of arbor culture, 
could have hoped for. 

Mr. Barnard suggested that I prepare a paper to read to 
you on this occasion, but in the parlance of commerce I am 
very "long" on yesterdays and very "short" on to-morrows, 
and therefore could not promise him to prepare a paper ; but 
I have brought with me a paper which I prepared for the 
superintendent of schools in New Jersey, and which was read 
there on the celebration of Arbor Day, and if not antagonistic 
to your feelings I will read a part or all of it. It has

TREES, 

The interdependence of animal and vegetable life is strenuous 
and constant — continued human life on this globe 
without plant life is an impossibility. And yet there is relentless, 
never-ending war between the animal and the vegetable 
kingdoms. Man and all the beasts of the field make 
perpetual battle against plant life in every form. Forests, 
foliage and fruits are the spoils sought. Man boasts bis triumphs 
over the rough asperities which the primitive woodlands 
present to the pioneer. The axe fells the giant trees, 
and the arms that swing it glory in their strength. The persistent 
intellect and zeal which directs the arms vaunteth 
itself victor over all plant life, superior to all vegetable 
forms and forces. But man's victories over trees are of short 
duration. Relatively — when centuries are counted only as 
small change in the exhaustless treasury of Time — it is but 
a short time since every individual in this world was a part 
and parcel of the vegetable kingdom. All the happy and all 
the heavy hearts of humanity which to-day pulsate with 
pleasure or throb with anguish were, only a few years since, 
parts of that vegetable world, and are now only representing 
destroyed and assimilated plant life. But our victory endureth 
a day only. To-morrow we shall return to plant food 
again, and enter once more into vegetable life, captives of 
the Tree Kings. Thus there is a continuous round of existence. 
Like great wheels the cycles revolve and we appear, 
now in the animal and then in the vegetable world, as mere 
mites in the stupendous machinery of the universe. The 
glow of beauty on the cheek of youth to-day may to-morrow 
tint a rose growing upon that youth's grave. We die, we are 
buried, and down into our very graves the kingdom of the 
forest and the field sends its fibrous root spies, its pioneers 
and sappers and miners. The grand oak, the majestic elm 
tlrrow out their arms and foliage to wave and shimmer in the 
sunlight and deploy their roots and rootlets and the atfen-

uated tentacles of flowers and grasses at their feet to invade 
graves and bring them food and strength from the tired 
forms that sleep therein. 

In the great printing establishments, newspapers and books 
are stereotyped. The type are de-individualized and massed 
in one solid plate. From that the impression is taken, and 
then the plate broken up and again melted, and moulded 
into other plates, upon which to print other thoughts — more 
newspapers and more books. So nature this summer issues 
a new series of flowers and foliage, and, enameled by the 
deft fingers of the wind dipped in sunshine, publishes a 
grand edition of golden corn and luscious fruits, and in au 
tumn will break the plates, in winter destroy its forms 
wholly, and by another summer have all its substance melte&lt; 
down and moulding for another edition of beauty, strength 
and gladness to the world stereotyped. The substance is th 
same, the expression and forms new — the reproduction o 
life through death, of beauty from decay, and of happiness 
out of sorrow, corrected, reissued, and perfected. 

Man's interference with the operation of natural, as well 
as his interdiction of the free scope of economic laws, always 
brings him pain and penalties. His wanton destruction of 
forests in all ages has been invariably punished by infertility, 
by floods, and by droughts. The Holy Land, once fruitful 
and beautiful, populous and contented, now barren and 
desolate as a desert, pleads silently with us to profit by the 
error of its tree-destroying peoples. They cut down and destroyed. 
They neither nurtured nor planted. The vineyards 
no longer ripen their purple clusters upon her hillsides, an&lt; 
the olive grove and palm no longer decorate her valleys. Destruction 
has been followed by desolation. The Orient, re 
membering the denudation of her lands, warns the Occiden 
of the danger of destroying always and never conserving no 
replanting her forests. What did come to the East will jus 

as certainly come to the West when her forests and wood-

lands have passed away. </seg>

THE ORIGIN OP ARBOR DAY. 

A love of trees should be so cultivated in civilization that i t 
shall become an acquired transmissible trait. It can be «o 
intensified by study and thought upon the supreme influence 
of trees upon humanity as to be made part of our nature 
and thus be made hereditary among all the peoples of the 

Savages never planted, barbarians never conserved forests. 
It was left for civilization to ascertain, assert, and uphold 
the value of tree life to human life. And so far civilization 
has been loath and stupid in practically taking up the 
solution of this vital subject in all its wonderful omniformity. 
Take this tree, then, into the schools. Teach the young 
mind the beauty and value of the young tree. Teach the boy 
and the girl how to secure tree seeds, how to plant and how to 
nourish new forests, groves, orchards. Teach the pupils of 
the public schools how much of public weal depends 
upon the conservation of our woodlands. Teach them 
the wondrous economy of leaf-mould and moss in dense forests 
as storehouses for rainfall, guards and supporters of 
springs, rivulets, and rivers. Teach how the sun sends 
down its rays among the leaves and draws moisture therefrom 
for new clouds and storms of refreshing rain. 

The growth of a tree is as the growth of a community. In 
the former each obscure branchlet and twig contributes its 
mite to the upbuilding of the great trunk and the strong 
branches, and also to the glorious crown of foliage, flower, 
and fruit. So in building up our states and cities even the 
humblest citizen contributes a needed and essential element 
of growth and vigor. An oak this summer enlarges its circumference 
through the labor of its leaves. They catch the 
light of the sun and incarnate it with the dews of night 
within the solid prison wall of its circumference. Autumn 
comes, the foliage perishes and passes away ; the leaves lived 
their day and are dead. But winter sees recorded another 
annal of vigorous life, and the new concentric layer tallies 
another vear in the a°t? of the oak. Twists and branches </seg>

have been killed for want of light all along the lower trunk, 
and only the great body and big limbs have added grace and 
strength. But twig and branch and leaf have all performed 
duties, and each has contributed to the solid increment of 
grain and fiber. 

The striking parallels existing in human and tree life 
have been noted in all civilization. And so man's similes for 
all that is beautiful and useful, desirable and immortal, 
have been, since written language began, its leaves, its libers, 
and its folios, largely drawn from sylvan life. The Tree of 
Knowledge, the Tree of Liberty, the Tree of Life have been 
planted in all poesy, and they have all bloomed in all literature 
from the remotest of historic times. Authors not drawing 
comparison, metaphor, and figures of speech generally 
from tree-life and plant-growth have been rare indeed. A perfectly 
formed tree with its sheltering arms swinging and its 
many-voiced leaves singing in the breeze while it reaches upward 
into sunlight, and, like a proud parent, shows us the 
lustrous glory of its ripening fruit, has also a lower life invisible 
to us all. Deep down in darkness and dampness its 
rootlets are groveling, among graves, seeking with ravenous 
hunger everywhere under the ground for dead and decaying 
forms and feeding thereon with unbridled gluttony. We 
see only the majestic body, the stately head crowned with the 
sun's gold, and forget the manner of its support and nourishment 
by the unseen multitude of workers in the lower levels 
of this vegetable bonanza king. And as the elm and the oak 
thus lead an upper and a lower life, so doth mankind generally. 
His perceptions reach out for knowledge as do foliage 
and branch for light and air. His reason stands passion's 
storm as sturdy trunks the tempest's fury, and holds to the 
right and truth as the tree to the soil and subsoil. His intelligence 
scales the firmament and tells the story of the stars. 
It descends into the profoundest depths of the sea and reads 
in rocks the secrets of bygone fauna and flora. It wrenches 
the secrets of creation from the grip of mvstery, and unfolds </seg>

like a map the methods and laws of Nature. And in the 
better man this upper intellectual life dominates always. 
His mentality — like the tree top with its foliage, flower, and 
fruit, and not his appetite — confers benefactions and bestows 
blessings. Beautiful, symmetrical, entrancing like a grand 
Oak in autumn when its foliage is a gorgeous wealth of crimson, 
purple, and old gold, is the evenly balanced mind of a 
mature man, who in temperance and tranquil study has, during 
a useful life, grown strong in knowledge, in truth, in 
honor, and in faithfulness. 

Symbolizing liberty, trees were planted during the French 
Involution as memorials of the overthrow of despotism and 
the foundation of popular government. And now, celebrating 
the centenary of that Revolution, France, with a refreshed 
and revitalized democracy, has ordained the planting 
as a national festivity of more liberty trees. But the French 
people are least prepared, except the Irish, to eat of the Tree 
of Knowledge of self-government, of all the races of the civilized 
globe. Commemorative trees in France have been 
short-lived since Nobert de Pressac planted at Saint-Gauden 
a poplar in memory of the Revolution, and since Louis XVI. 
imitated him in presiding at the inauguration of a similar 
monument in the garden of the Tuilleries. For the Convention 
cut down the Bourbon trees, the Directory chopped 
down the Convention trees, and Napoleon III. destroyed all 
those planted by the Revolutionists of 1830 and by the Republicans 
of 1848 in order to plant commemoratively for 
himself. The liberty trees which France ordains just now 
may not be more enduring than their predecessors. And, in 
truth, although the Abbe Gregoire has published a volume 
laudatory of this particular sort of historical arboriculture, 
the idea of planting commemorative trees in France was an 
emigrant from the United States. It went over there from 
America when the colonies were in rebellion against 1 
land. A former town clerk of London carried out the same

the memory of the criminals at whose execution he had 
assisted. Villages, it is believed, have derived their names 
from trees. Thus Allestree and Oswetry are traced to 
Aethelheard's Tree and Oswald's Tree, and in the Saxon 
Chronicle the battle which is known as that of Hastings is 
described as having been fought "aet thaem haran Apuldron" 
— at the Hoar Apple Tree. From this "Apuldron" again, 
come the place-names Appledore, Appledrom, and Appuldurcombe. 
Trees were wont to mark the sites of markets. Thus 
Kippix, in Yorkshire, is described in Domesday Book as 
Chipesche — that is, Chap or Market Ash; and Martock, in 
Somersetshire, may be only a slight corruption of Mart Oak. 
Many of the oldest of oak trees are boundary trees, like the 
great shire oak which once stood at the meeting place of 
York, Nottingham, and Derby. Elms were formerly planted 
at the junction of three roads, in memory of some celebrated 
event A venerable one flourished, up to the beginning of 
this century, near Deane's Almshouses at Basingstoke. This 
elm was alleged to have been planted either in the year of 
the Revolution or as a memorial of the discovery of the Gunpowder 
Plot. The habit of which it was an instance dates, 
however, much further back than even the chronicles of England. 
Abraham, on the occasion of his covenant with 
Abimclcch, planted a tree, and agreeably, no doubt, to the 
institutes of the patriarchal faith, proceeded to "call upon 
the name of the Lord." The custom became so general that, 
owing to its leading to idolatry, the "green trees" were commanded 
to be cut down. The Greeks had their famous oracle 
of Jupiter at the Oaks of Dodona. 

Aubrey, the Carolinean antiquary, tells us that in his day 
fathers planted trees at the birth of their children. Thus 
the "grove of ashes without Roulington-Parke were planted 
at the birth of a son" to William, Earl of Pembroke, who 
lived in the reign of James I. To this day the Sakalavas of 
Madagascar plant the "Fragrant Wood" at the birth of the </seg>

            <seg id="p072">

same custom by setting out a clove tree at the birth of each 
child. In this way a rude register of the ages of the families 
was kept, and so highly esteemed that in 1775 a general insurrection 
broke out when the Dutch, in pursuance of the 
policy of raising the price of cloves by diminishing the crop — 
they no doubt were protective tariff advocates — ordeml 
twenty-five thousand of these "birth trees" to be hewn down. 
The Hudson's Bay voyageurs, in honor of dignitaries eon 
nected with the fur trade, were in the habit of trimming tall 
trees along the river banks, and cutting on these "lobesti* 
the name of the person to whom they were dedicated. It is 
not carrying the theories of the folklorists to unjustinablo 
lengths, if we recognize in all these customs the germ of that 
Tree Worship which was at one time almost as universal 
the veneration for fire and water, and which is still a living 
cult among a great many rude races. It exists in America. 
and was once a widespread belief in Assyria, Greece, Poland, 
Germany, Scandinavia, France, and Persia. In England it 
was so persistent that, in the eighth century, St. Boniface 
found it necessary to chop down a sacred oak, and not long 
ago an oak copse at Loch Saint, in the Isle of Skye, was held 
in such awe that no person would venture to cut the smallest 
twig from it. In many parts of Africa tree worship is in full 
vigor, and in India and Ceylon the Bo tree is worshipped. 
Some of the Chittagong Hill tribes hold the bamboo in like 
esteem, and in Siberia the Ostiaks and Yakuts offer sacred 
firs all manner of gifts. In the Philippines and Fijis we 
find the same faith, and, as everyone knows, the worship of 
the oak was so important a portion of the Celtic rites that 
the word "kirk," now softened into church, has been derived 
from "Quercus," an oak, while even as far north as Lapland 
the remains of a dendrologic creed are not entirely effaced 
by Christianity. It was, in short, a form of Nature and the 
most pleasant of all its many shapes. In the course of ages 
it has been altered and softened, until it only survives in </seg>

or breaks out in the scarcely less harmless craze of one generation 
rearing "liberty trees," which are in due time cut 
down by the generation which succeeds it. 

The almost infinite possibilities of a tree germ came to 
my mind one summer when traveling in a railway carriage 
amid the beautifully cultivated fields of Belgium; a cottonwood 
seed on its wings of down drifted into my compartment. 
It came like a materialized whisper from home. Catching 
it in my hand, I forgot the present and wandered into the 
past to a floating moat like that which had, years and years 
before, been planted by the winds and currents on the banks 
of the Missouri. That mote had taken life and root, growing 
to splendid proportions, until in 1854 the axe of the pioneer 
had vanquished it, and the saw, seizing it with relentless, 
whirling teeth, reduced it to lumber. From its treehood 
evolved a human habitation, a home — my home — wherein a 
mother's love had blossomed and fruited with a sweetness 
surpassing the loveliness of the rose and the honeysuckle. 
Thus from that former feathery floater in mid-air grew a 
home, and all the endearing contentment and infinite satisfaction 
which that blessed Anglo-Saxon word conveys — that 
one word which means all that is worth living for, and for 
which alone all good men and women are living. And the 
eottonwood, which has been always the pioneer to assault 
the plains and turn prairies into forests, ought to be held in 
the highest esteem by all the dwellers of the rich lands which 
stretch from the Missouri river to the mountains. 

In strenuously speaking for the conservation and propagation 
of forests, sentiment and statistics — like summer and 
winter — bring, alternately, intense enjoyment and great reasons 
for despondency and sorrow. Preaching trees and tree 
culture is one thing; the practice, quite another. 

All civilized men consume forests and forest products. 
Few men conserve — fewer still plant forests. 

Each day in the United States we destroy — consume in 
factories, railroads, in fences, farms, and buildings — thirty </seg>

            <seg id="p074">

thousand acres of timber. The sun sees at even-tide thirty 
thousand acres less than at the preceding dawn. 

Practically, then, what shall we do to preserve this earth 
as a place where man and other animals may continue to 
abide — for with the total extinction of woodlands must couie 
total extermination to the animal kingdom. 

We must take forestry into the public schools. It must become 
an essential thing in American education. Arbor Day 
should be observed practically and devoted to tree planting 
and tree culture as sacredly as Christians devote Sunday to 
the worship of God. 

We plant trees for posterity. And their needles will, from 
year to year, embroider the earth beneath their giant trunks 
with the memory of our faith in forestry. The winter winds 
will sing softly through their emerald crowns; and in summer 
glad birds will home and warble amidst their verdant 
boughs. And when our monuments are sought by remote descendants, 
we may have the epitaph of Sir Christopher Wren, 
at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, uttered and re-uttered in 
our behalf, amidst the flashing foliage of great forests and 
the purpling glories of ripening fruits in vast orchards : 

"Si queris monumentum circumspice." 
If you seek my monument, look around. 

I have seen a public statement to the effect that Governor 
Furnas and your humble servant had been the cause of a 
great deal of wasted money among the farmers of Nebraska 
by advocating the growth of the white pine upon the prairies. 
The best talker in favor of the white pine, properly planted, 
is the white pine itself. You can't expect to make a forest, 
either of pines, or catalpas, or anything else in the way of 
trees, unless you prepare for the creation of forest conditions. 

In 1892 I planted 10,000 white pines, yearlings, purchased 
of Douglas &amp; Sons, Waukegan, 111. I put them in rows four 
feet apart, four feet between the trees in the rows, and cultivated 
them each way for three years. During the drouth 
last summer you could go in among those trees — which now </seg>

            <seg id="p075">
74 


average 15 to 22 feet in height — and you would find no signs 
of drouth, but everywhere a thick carpet of needles which 
had fallen, and under that cool soil and plenty of moisture. 
Those trees are planted as nearly as may be as God planted 
the great pine forests of Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsi 
— close together, so that this hot sun, and the hot wind 
that travels over the country here for so long a time during 
the summer can not harm them. And I venture to say that 
those who see that grove twenty years from now will see 
every tree there worth a great deal of money. 

I have a white pine, planted at Arbor Lodge thirty-eight 
years ago, which stands by itself where the hot sun of summer 
can beat upon it, and the hot winds sweep it on every 
side all day long, and the annual growth recorded by that 
tree will not average a quarter of that recorded by the pines 
planted close together. They have been measured, and many 
of the annual growths have reached three feet in a summer. 

I will say that much for the white pine. I do not say that 
it will grow when set out by itself, a single tree, isolated in 
the hot sun, subject to the parching winds that blow from 
the southwest every year; but I do believe that everywhere 
in Nebraska, either with the white pine or any other tree that 
will grow here, you can raise a forest provided you make arrangements 
in your planting which will eventually give forest 
conditions for the trees. 

Me. McIntosh — It is only fair to the author of such an address 
to say further of his work in this country that in addition 
to giving us Arbor Day and the beautiful sentiments 
that cluster around it, and the splendid practical work that 
grows out of it, you all know that it has been the privilege 
of Mr. Morton to sit in the highest council of the nation for 
four years as Secretary of Agriculture. And it was more 
through his influence than any of us will ever know, perhaps, 
that that wise executive system of setting apart reservations 
of timber in the few districts of this great country yet occu- </seg>

            <seg id="p076">

THE ORIGIN OF ARBOR DAY. 

pied by timber was carried out to a much greater extent 
than ever before; so that the nation for all time is under the 
highest debt of gratitude to Mr. Morton for the influence exerted 
in this direction. We should never lose an opportunity 
to acknowledge this splendid service, and I rise to my feet 
to make these few remarks merely to remind you of this. 

And while I am on my feet I think I shall use the privilege 
to say a word in regard to one item in the paper read. Mr. 
Morton gives a vastly more beautiful idea of life than that of 
the old-time poet, who, in speaking of our bodies, said that 
we should be called to surrender up these bodies which 
should moulder in the dust and become a part of the clod 
which the rude swain turns with his share and treads upon. 
I say it is grand and beautiful rather to think that these 
forms shall go to feed the rose; that the blush of the maiden's 
cheek may again appear in the rose. While we accept that 
view, let us not forget that only that part which is nourished 
by the vegetable — this mortal body — goes to feed the rose 
and the oak. The life itself, which is the gift of God, goes 
not to tree or plant, but returns to God who gave it and becomes 
a part of immortality to reign with princes and ki 
for ever and ever. 

Mr. Marshall — I should like to ask Mr. Morton a little 
farther about those 10,000 white pines. You say they were 
planted four feet apart; is the stand perfect, or nearly so? 

Mr. Morton — It is very good except where I tried to saye 
some ancient apple trees. 

Mr. Marshall — About what is their caliber? 

Me. Morton — I think Mr. Hadkinson can tell you about 
that better than I can ; he has been there and examined 
them. 

Mr. Hadkinson — I think some of them are six inches 
through at the crown. I think the Nebraska State Horticultural 
Society could learn something about evergreens by 
visiting that grove of pines. 

Mr Morton I misrht sav that, the pruning is going on </seg>

            <seg id="p077">

right along. The limbs intermingle so that the sunlight is 
entirely excluded, and the lower limbs are dropping rapidly. 

Mb. Marshall — How high is this land on which they are 
planted? 

Mr. Mortox — It is above the river 231 feet. 

Mr. Marshall, — The reason I ask that is that I believe the 
white pine is one of the best trees we have all along the river 
counties. We have them in Washington county; Prof. Emerson 
can tell you about the trees he saw there. 

Prof. Emkrsox — When visiting Mr. Marshall's place I 
saw a few very good white pines; I couldn't say just what 
their diameter is, but they are quite large. Then we all know 
the white pine in &lt;';iss comity, at Mr. Pollard's place. He is 
here and can tell you about it better than I can. 

Mr. Pollard — I have a great many white pines, but I have 
not had as good success with them as with some others. I 
would not recommend the white pine for general planting. 
I have had the Austrian pine, Scotch pine, bull pine, dwarf 
pine, Swiss pine, and from the experience I have had, covering 
a period of thirty years, I find the Austrian pine is the 
best with me. Mr. Morton spoke about getting his trees from 
Douglas. I got mine from Douglas, too. I got trees from 
him last spring, and have had considerable correspondence 
back and forth in regard to tree planting, and I understand 
from him that they have had to discard the white pine in 
Illinois; the Austrian is about the only one that is found to 
succeed there now. I always recommend the Austrian pine, 
because it always behaves so well. 

Mr. Marshall — You are on hilly land, too? 

Mr. Pollard — I am on the high prairie. I find the pines 
adapt themselves to all sorts of conditions with us. 

Mr. Beltzer — I have had a little experience in a small 
way with pines, and I have come to the conclusion that in 
my district, up there in Polk county, I couldn't recommend 
the white pine. I have quite a few now of Austrian and 
Scotch pines that are fifteen or sixteen years old, and they </seg>

            <seg id="p078">
77 


are the only two pines that I could recommend in that portion 
of the country. They are doing very fine. I had so 
many around my place that last spring I grubbed out some 
that were six or eight inches in diameter and sixteen or 
jeighteen feet high. The Scotch and Austrian pine I think 
will do well on any of our prairies. 

Mr. Marshall — How far west? 

Mr. Beltzer — Anywhere this side of Grand Island they 
are doing fine. 

A Strangeb — In Butler county every white pine that I 
have known to be planted has died out. They become the victim 
of storms; the sleet will weigh down their branches and 
break them off. The Scotch and Austrian have stood up 
very nicely and become beautiful trees. I bought five hundred 
white pines, of which I planted two hundred and gave 
away three hundred, and I don't think any one now has a 
tree left out of the whole outfit. 

Mr. Mortox — I suppose we all understand that a large 
per cent of the pines and conifers of all sorts are dead when 
we get them. The circulation is resinous, and when once 
stopped all the water this side of Missouri will not start it 
again. They are not like the deciduous trees which you can 
resuscitate with water. I believe nurserymen have resuscitated 
small yearling pines by putting them into alcohol, but 
you couldn't get a large one drunk in a good while (laughter) . 
If we buy evergreens near home and never let the roots see 
the sunlight at all I think they are about as easily handled 
as deciduous trees; but the death of evergreen plantings in 
the state has undoubtedly occurred before the trees were put 
out, in nine cases out of ten. I do not think this is an exaggeration. 
If this Society could be endowed with the money 
that has been put into dead evergreens, I think it would be </seg>

NOTES AND SUGGESTIONS ON IMPROVEMENT OF 
FRUITS ADAPTED TO NEBRASKA. 

By Henry A. Longsdorf, Bellevue, Nebraska. 

In presenting this paper to the members of this Society, 
for their consideration or criticism as the case may be, I shall 
give in a crude way some conclusions based upon observations 
of my own and facts derived from the experience of others, 
bearing upon the selection and development of varieties of 
fruit suitable to the wants of the Nebraska fruit grower. </seg>

            <seg id="p095">

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

The successful growing of any kind of fruit, as well as all 
other horticultural products, depends very largely upon the 
selection of varieties adapted to the location of the grower, 
because we find that the list of accepted varieties differs 
very materially in the several fruit sections of a country of 
such diversified conditions as exists in the United States, and 
success is not attainable anywhere until a line of varieties is 
selected or developed which approximately reaches the requirements 
of the locality in which it is to be grown. Take 
the apple, for instance. No intelligent pomologist fails to recognize 
the fact that most of the failures attending early orcharding 
in Nebraska were due to the planting of unsuited 
varieties, usually furnished by some far distant nurseryman 
who gave to the purchaser a list of kinds, "the very best to be 
had," and well adapted to the "far distant" locality in which 
the nursery was located, but altogether unsuited to the section 
in which they were to be planted. Each well-defined 
apple section has its own popular and successful list of varieties. 
A well-posted fruit man, on seeing a car load of apples 
of assorted varieties, can readily tell in what fruit district 
they have been grown by the color and quality of the 
fruit. 

New sections almost invariably require new varieties of 
fruit The region to the north and west of us would be practically 
without apples to-day but for the intelligent effort, 
patience, and perseverance of Peter M. Gideon and othen* 
working on the same line of experiments, and it is to be hoped 
their achievements may stimulate others in the same good 
work. I have often heard it said that the multiplication of varieties, 
when we already have so many good sorts, is useless, 01 
does not pay, and only confuses the planter ; and that is true 
to a certain extent, but is it true in regard to the demands of 
our own state? Less than a score of varieties of apples will 
include all the varieties adapted to profitable cultivation in 
this state. 

The problem of successful pear growing is yet unsolved, 
and, without the creation of new varieties or the development 
of some of the more promising of the old sorts, is likely to </seg>

            <seg id="p096">
IMPROVEMENT OP FBUITS. 

95 

OTercome before pear culture will become in any degree profitable 
here. 

Peach growing, so far as a large part of the state is concerned, 
is an open and inviting field for operation, and the 
same may be said of plums, cherries, and apricots, and the 
adaptation of any of these to the requirements of Nebraska ib 
not beset by half of the difficulties which were overcome by 
successful' experiment in other fields. In case of the peach, 
the way to the successful production has been pointed out by 
a fellow member of this Society, who has given us the Russell, 
a sort of great promise, being early, prolific, and, I beli&gt; 
hardier than any we now have/excepting only the Wright. In 
the list with these two I would put the Triumph for hardiness 
and season of ripening. These three, with half a dozen other 
sorts equally hardy or hardier, but larger and of better quality, 
either new or old, would make a reasonably good assortment 
for Nebraska. 

Of plums much might be said. A great deal of time and 
careful experiment has already been given to the development 
of this favorite fruit by another member of this Society, but 
the result of his experiments and investigation has not yet 
been given to the public. The line of research and experiment 
with this fruit, looking to the creation of profitabltrieties 
for this section, is indicated by the fact that this is the 
"native heath" of a prominent group or family of the plum 
species, and therefore to the group Americana we may turn 
for the foundation of our most profitable and popular sorts. 
Outside of the Americana group of plums, I consider the line 
of Domestica as the most promising for developing new varieties 
for this section, and accidental seedlings of the Lombard, 
far superior to their parent in many respects, indicate 
what might be the result of further experiment in that direction. 
In order to show the range of possibilities in development 
without artificial pollination, I will give a bit of my 
own experience with a few seedlings of the Miner, which is 
said by some to be reproductive. From eleven trees grown 
from the seed of the same tree and planted at the same time, 
eight feet apart in a row, I have eleven varieties, quite distinct 
in foliage, habit of growth, vigor, time of ripening, size </seg>

and quality ; one only being very good, — much better than its 
parent, — four or five others of very fair quality and product 
iveness, and none of the rest of any special value, one ol 
them being a great bloomer but almost entirely barren of 
fruit. 

With the cherry, much also remains to be accomplished 
before a perfected list of varieties for this state can be secured, 
for while we are fairly supplied with an assortment 
of sour cherries, a list of sweet varieties is yet to be supplied. 
Is there no "Gideon" in Nebraska to lead us in the accomplishment 
of this desirable work? 

Another very promising field for the creation and development 
of varieties suitable to Nebraska environments is the 
Russian apricot ; for while our well-known apricots, so far as 
I know, are unsuited to profitable culture in this state, the 
Russian, being much hardier and many of them being very 
productive and of fine quality, should be easily capable of 
improvement and adaptation to our wants, and thus add 
another desirable variety to Nebraska's list of fruits. 

With these suggestions I will close, only repeating that 
in my opinion much still remains to be accomplished in this 
line before the list of varieties adapted to profitable fruit 
growing in Nebraska is too large or likely to embarrass the 
intelligent planter. Thankful for your attention to these 
rambling remarks, I leave the subject to your consideration. 

The President — Give us your experience with raspberries. 


Mr. Longsdorf — I have had best results with the Cumberland. 
So far I have not heard anyone speak against it. 
Conditions are all exceedingly favorable to the general propagationof 
theCumberland. During the two years I have fruited 
it, it has shown itself hardy and a very strong, vigorous 
grower. I have picked a number of berries that have measured 
three-fourths of an inch. It is claimed that some have 
been found that measured one and one-fourth inches, but I 
have not found any of that size. 

Dr. Bessey — I never hear this subject of new and untried 
fruits discussed without thinking of some particular 
wild fruits which I am confident are merely waiting for the </seg>

            <seg id="p098">

time when we shall take them up and do something with them. 
Here is this wild cherry, scattered all over the sandhill region, 
and it will grow very readily far east of the sandhills, 
the so-called sand-cherry — a thing, which in its wild state, of 
course, is not to be compared to our cultivated cherry, but 
why must we be always stirring over old things? Why should 
we not take things that are somewhat subject to possible improvement 
and grow them into something that is a native variety. 
Now I am confident that the best of the sand-cherries, 
as they grow wild, are as good as the wild cherry from which 
our tame cherries came. And yet, what do we do? Simply 
keep hacking back over these same old cherries and neglecting 
our native wild fruits. We are living here in a country 
where we all realize that there are some difficult problems to 
solve and jet we do not do that which from necessity there on 
the Atlantic and in Europe they had to do. We do not take 
up these wild things because we are in too much of a hurry 
to get immediate returns. Now, I remember some twenty 
odd years ago I stirred up quite a hornet's nest in a meeting 
of the Iowa Horticultural Society by suggesting that there 
was a wild apple over there waiting for some one to take it 
and bring it up to something after the fashion of an apple. 
Every variety of apple we have runs back to some kind of a 
little wild apple in Europe, and yet the American wild apples, 
probably two species of them, have been practically neglected. 
We have certain varieties that are supposed to have some 
wild apple in them. We name them crabs. Why should not 
we, in a region where there are wild apples that are perfectly 
adapted to the kind of weather ws have been having recently, 
— why should not we turn to these and try to grow them up? 
I suppose it is for the same reason that we do not grow crops 
of trees ; because it is looking ahead too far. If I start now 
to develop a wild apple into a decent apple I am certain I will 
not eat any of the apples. But if I would start doing that, 
possibly my children or my children's children might reap 
the benefit, Whv ran't we look a little farther ahead? 

There is a magnificent little sour berry, — and during this 
hot spell everybody has been wanting to get that kind of a 
sour, — the buffalo berry. If we only had that developed into 

7 </seg>

            <seg id="p099">
98 


something considerably larger, say as large as the end of my 
finger, it would be one of the best additions to our list of sour 
fruits. Looking over the state I am confident that a list of 
half a dozen rather promising wild fruits might be made, 
which are waiting for some intelligent action from some body 
of men such as you are. 

Me. Babnabd — I can say for Dr. Bessey's information, 
that we have a man in Nebraska who is doing with the sandcherry 
the very thing the Doctor suggests. What it will be is 
as yet a study, but it promises wonderful results. He has 
shown fruit from the first and second crosses, and it is remarkable 
what he has developed in three generations. Of 
course, a man who goes into work of this kind must necessarily 
be a very close student, and it is usually hard to get such 
men out to these meetings. Gentlemen, I refer to Mr. Theodore 
Williams, of Benson, and you all know what a close 
student he is. 

Mr. Longsdork — I am glad Dr. Bessey added what he 
did along that line. There is no doubt that he has suggested 
some fertile fields that are ready to work. In 1857 I sent 
some seed of this same sand-cherry to an old nursery friend of 
mine in the East, and also a lot of scions from some of the 
finest wild plums I had found. I remember one very distinctly, 
which was as good as any Americana I ever tasted 
anywhere. Unfortunately the scions were all destroyed in the 
mail. The sand-cherry seed was planted and cultivated for 
a year or two, but no improvement of them was attempted. 
If I am not mistaken, Peter Gideon commenced the investigation 
of the American crab, but afterward, from government 
or other sources, the Russian apples were brought to 
this country, and he transferred his attentions to them. I 
think, as Dr. Bessey says, that we should turn our attention 
to the investigation of the American wild crab. </seg>

OBSERVATIONS ON TREE GROWTH.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON TREE GROWTH. 

Br Benton Aldrich, Brock, Neb. 

Since 1865 my son and I have planted 100 acres of fruit 
trees, including the enclosing wind-breaks. We have also 
fifteen acres of forest trees that we planted or permitted to 
grow. The planted trees are cottonwood, red maple, red 
cedar, osage orange, catalpa, and some others for ornament. 
Among those permitted to grow are white and red elm, box 
elder, willow, ash, black walnut, and hackberry. The red 
cedar deserves special mention because of its value as a protection 
to shrubs and trees not otherwise hardy. I have a 
Berberris Mahonia and a hemlock, each planted over thirty 
years ago and now doing well without other protection. 

Laying aside the idea that the many are going to plant 
trees on plow land, or on that which can be profitably fenced 
for pasture, there are on many farms small pieces, too irregular 
and gullied for the plow and too small to be profitably 
fenced, that can be made to pay a little in at least four ways : 
in making a farm more beautiful, affording some protection 
from winds, lessening gullying, and in the production of 
fire-wood and timber. It will do little good to appeal to the 
average farmer's sense of the beautiful, and that the ill 
effects of the winds may be mitigated is too fine spun, too, 
but the gullying is in painful evidence, and promises to be 
increasingly injurious, not only from loss of soil, but also 
from impassible ditches extending farther and farther toward 
the high land. While these may be filled without tree 
growth, renewed cultivation will renew the gullying. I 
planted trees to prevent gullying thirty-two years ago with 
results gratifying to the present time. A bulletin entitled 
"Washed Soils, How to Prevent and Reclaim Them," by the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, has been of use to me. 

There are probably a few farmers who are morally and 
financially able to plant trees and who are almost persuaded 
to do so. Their need of information on the far-reaching 
effects of arboriculture on their posterity. While continually 
saving for the future, they should remember that thia </seg>

form of saving is of more importance than securing more of 
that of which they are already possessed. Before beginning 
actual work, one should secure a visit from, and the advice 
of a professional landscape gardener. Bailey's "Garden 
Making," Waugh's "Landscape Gardening," and Powell's 
"Hedges," are books for beginners, and will help in cultivating 
a taste now sadly neglected. It is not enough that a 
bit of forestry be useful, but its arrangement may also be 
such that it will beautify, thus giving it a two-fold value. 

I think you will be pleased to have an extract from the 
"Seven Lamps of Architecture," by John Kuskin, in your next 
volume. It is as follows: 

"The idea of self-denial for the sake of posterity, of practicing 
present economy for the sake of debtors yet unborn, 
of planting forests that our descendants may live under 
their shade, or of raising cities for the future nations to 
inhabit, never, I suppose, efficiently takes place among publicly 
recognized motives of exertion. Yet these are not less 
our duties; nor is our part fitly sustained upon the earth, 
unless the range of our intended and deliberate usefulness 
includes, not only the companions but the si:ccessors of our 
pilgrimage. God has lent us the earth for our life; it is a 
great entail. It belongs as much to those who are to come 
after us, and whose name3 are already written in the books 
of creation, as to us; and we have no right by 
anything that we do or neglect to involve them in 
unnecessary penalties or deprive them of the benefits which 
it was in our power to bequeath. And this the more 
because it is one of the appointed conditions of the labor of 
men that, in proportion to the time between the seed -sowing 
and the harvest, is the fullness of the fruit; and that generally 
therefore, the further off we place our aim and the 
less we desire to be ourselves the witnesses of what we have 
labored for, the more wide and rich will be the measure of 
our success. Men can not benefit those who are with them 
as they can benefit those who come after them, and from all 
the pulpits from which the human voice is ever sent forth 
there is none from which it reaches so far as from the grave. </seg>

WHY ARE WE NOT PLANTING MORE TREES? 

101 

WHY ARE WE NOT PLANTING MORE TREES? 

By L. D. Stilson, York, Neb. 

My subject, Mr. President, is something of an interrogation 
point. Questions are sometimes easier asked than answered. 
It may be so in this case. 

If I should answer this question to my own satisfaction 
it might not suit some of the gentlemen here. If I should 
answer it to suit you, in all probability it would not suit me, 
as we are looking at the question from opposite sides — I as » 
tree planter, some of you as tree sellers. 

There are some conditions found in the eastern part of the 
state which are not found elsewhere. The same is true of 
central and western Nebraska, so that I might give as a 
reason for not planting trees that which would apply to one 
locality but not to others. The decrease in tree planting is 
general over the state, so far as my observation goes, and we 
must look for general reasons. 

The great drouth of 1894-95 killed very many artificial 
groves and roadside trees. In some instances these have been 
replaced, but in most cases the ground is now occupied by 
growing crops. Many were discouraged and said, "Let the 
trees go." In other cases renters were tilling the soil and had 
no interest in planting shelter belts, screens, or groves. 

At one time Nebraska was justly entitled to the name "Tree 
Planters' State." Then, as a rule, each tiller of the soil 
was a home-owner and a home-builder. He was planting for 
a future generation. He was setting belts of timber to break 
the wind's fierce blast. Then we were a community of homesteaders. 
To-day we are a state of renters. More than onehalf 
of our soil tillers are renters, who rarely stay more than 
a year in one place, having no interest in the soil except so 
far as they can make it pay its rental and a scant living for 
their families. 

According to the present ratio of decrease in tree planting 
our prairies wilr be as bleak and bare at the end of the next 
thirty years as we found them thirty years ago. Then the 
voung man was looking forward to see how soon he could ht </seg>

the owner of, at least, an eighty acre farm, on which he could 
establish a home of his own and improve it by planting trees 
and shrubs. To-day the custom of saving money to buy land 
for a home is largely out of date, and instead young men 
seem to think it much more profitable to invest their earnings 
with insurance companies or beneficiary societies, practically 
saying that it is better to invest their money under 
the direction of others, while they continue to live as renters 
or hired hands. Such do not help improve the country by 
planting trees. 

One reason I might give why we are not planting more 
trees for fruit is that there are others like myself, who have 
become disgusted by buying trees of people from whom we 
expected to get just what we ordered. As an instance of 
this, not many years ago I bought a bill of Early Richmond 
cherry trees from a member of this Society, ordering firstclass 
trees, at first-class price, and of course naturally expected 
to get good home-grown trees ; but imagine my disappointment 
on their arrival to find a scrubby lot of foreigngrown 
dried-up stuff. I wired the shipper, at his expense, 
asking if those were cherry trees or kindling wood. At any 
rate he had forgotten to send any roots. I set six or eight of 
the best of them in new orchard ground, and the 
rest were set where they could be watered. Out of the 
fifty trees received, three grew and are now bearing, but instead 
of Early Richmonds they are the sour late cherries 
which you see in this box, and I am only sorry that any of the 
trees lived. 

Our state has been the dumping ground for nursery offal, 
and this Society should be active in trying to stop this kind 
of work. Neither should we countenance within our ranks a 
single member who is engaged in selling hybrid peaches 
grafted on soft maple roots, and trees with tin labels attached, 
or any other deception, as every such thing hinders 
the legitimate sale and planting of trees in our state. </seg>

COMMERCIAL CELERY GROWING. 

103 

COMMERCIAL CELERY GROWING. 

By Harry Black. 

Celery culture in Kearney, now quite an industry, had 
its beginning some eighteen years ago in the garden of Mr. 
J. H. Black, who, having a surplus, offered it for sale in the 
local market, where its superior quality found for it a ready 
sale. For the next few years we sold our surplus celery in 
the home market, but had made no effort to introduce it 
elsewhere. Our first efforts in this line were discouraging. 
Having, one season, more than the local market demanded, 
we sent some to Omaha. The express companies had no rate 
on celery, and charged us at the rate of twenty cents per 
bunch of one dozen stalks, and we had to guarantee the 
charges before they would accept the celery. At Omaha we 
had more trouble, the dealers refusing to handle our celery 
for the peculiar reason that it was so much superior to the 
Michigan product, and if their customers became accustomed 
to the Kearney celery they could no longer sell them the 
Michigan celery. However, instead of being discouraged, 
Mr. Black and his sons decided that if their celery was so 
much better than the Michigan article that customers becoming 
accustomed to it would accept no other, it would be 
a good idea to raise enough to be able to supply all demands 
that might be made for it, and for the last ten years have 
made the growing of celery their principal business. Persistent 
efforts have induced both freight and express companies 
to reduce their rates until we can now compete with 
Michigan celery growers on an equal basis. Wherever Kearney 
celery has been shipped it is acknowledged not only as 
unsurpassed, but as unequaled by any other. The reason 
for this is two-fold. Celery is a thirsty plant, growing best 
where there is rich soil with plenty of moisture. This it has 
on the islands in the Platte river, where the water is near the 
surface so that irrigation is unnecessary. 

Our soil is a sandy loam through which the water percolates 
freely. It is naturally rich, but we add to this by applying 
about forty cords of manure to the acre annually. We </seg>

            <seg id="p105">
104 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

prefer manure from the sheep feeding yards, if we can get it, 
but in lieu of this we use ordinary stable manure from tho 
town, where we can get it for the hauling. The other reason 
I mentioned lies in our warm days and cool nights, a combination 
in which celery delights, and which causes it to reach 
its greatest delicacy and perfection. Another reason which 
I might mention is that the Kearney celery growers all 
bleach their product with lumber. While this adds somewhat 
to the expense, it so improves the appearance of the 
celery that we find it pays, as this celery sells for ten cents 
or fifteen cents more per dozen than the Michigan celery, 
the difference being due to its superior size, appearance, and 
flavor. 

For a few years Mr. Black had no competition, but as the 
demand increased, other growers have gone into the business, 
until at the present time there are about eighteen or twenty 
growers with a total acreage of about one hundred and fifty 
acres. Much of this is shipped by express, about twenty-five 
to forty carloads per annum covering the freight shipments. 
Besides our home markets we now make regular shipments 
into the following states and territories: Montana, the 
Dakotas, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Wyoming, Arkansas, Oklahoma, 
Indian Territory, and Texas. Borne growers have 
become discouraged and quit, but others have taken their 
places, and on the whole the acreage has remained about the 
same for the past three years. 

Prices to jobbers vary from ten cents to twenty-seven 
cents per dozen, according to grade and quality. This is 
for celery washed and bunched ready for market. In car 
lots, in the rough, the price runs from fifteen cents to twenty 
cents per dozen. 

At these prices the crop generally pays fairly well, although 
in dry seasons like the present the profits are very small. </seg>

PIONEER EXPERIENCE IN HORTICULTURE. 

PIONEER EXPERIENCE IN HORTICULTURE. 

By J. L. Brown, Kearney. Neb. 

Mr. President and Members of the Society: 

I have not come prepared to make a set speech, but if there 
is any advice I can give that will be of benefit to the Socierv 
I shall be glad to give it, and if there are any points upon 
which you may wish to question me you are at liberty to do 
so. I do not really consider myself a pioneer in horticultural 
work in this part of Nebraska. The first work I did here was 
sixteen years ago. The prospects for success then were far 
brighter than they are to-day. Prior to 1886, there had been 
in this country, as I understand, seven good crops in succession. 
The first year I was here it seemed to me I had never 
seen so fine a soil for growing trees. The conditions were 
almost ideal so far as soil and moisture were concerned. Wt 
could plant a little graft in the spring, and if given good 
cultivation, by fall it would make a tree four feet in height. 
I never saw, in any country, more rapid growth or finer 
looking trees. In those days I very frequently went out over 
the country in various directions, and almost every home was 
surrounded by beautiful, thrifty looking young trees. There 
seemed to be no difticulty in making them grow, and people 
planted more largely then, because they did not know as much 
about it as they do now. In those days we could plant a 
strawberry bed and the following season the ground would 
be literally red with large beautiful berries, grown by the 
natural rainfall, and of better quality than any others in 
the market. 

Before coming here I had considerable experience in the 
matter of handling soil to make things grow, and it seemed 
to me that the prospects were very bright for successful tree 
planting in this locality. It is true that very little was 
known as to what would succeed here in the way of fruit. Our 
State Horticultural Society did not recommend anything 
north of the Platte river. In fact, at that time they did not 
seem to think that we could grow anything north of the </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

In my travels over the country, I found some old settlers 
who were from the East, and had planted the eastern varieties 
of apples, such as Maiden Blush, York Imperial, and a lot 
of those eastern sorts. The trees seemed to be thrifty and 
many of them were bearing, but in time these trees began to 
die out, and people then began to plant largely of crab apples, 
thinking they must have something hardy. We soon discovered, 
however, that it was not, merely a question of hardiness, 
that is, obtaining varieties that would withstand a low 
degree of temperature. I learned from my observations 
that there was more damage done to trees during the winter 
than at any other time of the year, but this injury was not 
due so much to a low degree of temperature as to the fact 
that the ground frequently froze up very dry, and the formation 
of our soil is such that trees planted without first 
deeply stirring the soil (as they were generally planted in 
those days) can. not reach out for food. In 1891, I think it 
was, the mercury went to thirty degrees below zero. I 
thought that was certainly cold enough to kill the raspberry 
canes, but much to my surprise they were uninjured and 
produced a full crop of fruit the next season. 

The last few years have been very severe on tree growth 
of all kinds, in this part of the country. This is due almost 
entirely to lack of rainfall. I know of places not far from 
here where there were forty or fifty acres of timber, which 
gave me a good lesson in 1894 as to the value of timber in 
breaking the force of hot winds. To-day that timber is all 
dead. There is scarcely a tree left standing. There are also 
in this vicinity orchards from which as many as four hundred 
bushels of apples have been gathered, which have been entirely 
killed out by the extremely dry seasons. Now, it may be said, 
and is doubtless true, that much may be done to retain the 
moisture in the soil, but so far as this season is concerned it is 
entirely different from anything I have ever seen. There 
seems to be no such thing as holding the moisture in the soil. 
Out on my grounds, where I have practiced frequent cultivation, 
forming a good dust blanket for the purpose of holding 
the moisture, it is three inches down to the moist earth, 
and below that the ground is as hard as the street. The </seg>

leaves of my trees are actually withered up for want of 
moisture, notwithstanding the fact that my ground was 
thoroughly prepared, stirred as deep as it was possible for 
teams to stir it, before a tree was planted on it. Now, gen 
tlemen, I don't feel like giving up this matter of tree planting, 
even though it does look discouraging, but do not know 
what can be done to promote tree growth in this climate, 
more than I have tried to do, unless it be irrigation. 

We have with us some gentlemen who are workiug in Nebraska 
in connection with the Forestry Bureau, and as 1 
am more interested in that than anything else, I should like 
&gt;to say a few words along that line. I can say for myself 
that I have been a tree planter from the time I was large 
enough to dig a hole and plant a tree. I remember when 
I was a boy, back in Illinois, when that was called a new 
country, that nearly every stream had on its bank bodies 
of beautiful timber. The first settlers in that country nearly 
all settled along the streams, preferring timber farms rather 
than going out on the prairies. Upon the prairie lands 
there were lakes or ponds deep enough to swim a horse, and 
we never knew what it was to be in need of water. The 
ground was always moist, and there was no such thing as 
dust flying when we stirred the soil. In the winter the timber 
would be filled with snow. I remember it was so deep that 
we could scarcely haul the wood out, and we often had to 
go with empty sled and break a road before Ve could get 
out with our load of logs. I remember also that the- snow 
used to stay there in the timber a long time, that is, it was 
slow in going off in the spring, and though the river was 
high and considerable water running, yet there was no 
washing of the soil and no such things as floods. But I lived 
there long enough to see a greater part of the natural forests 
destroyed, and have seen that river a raging torrent 
fifty feet deep, sweeping away houses, railroad bridges, and 
everything in its path. We had no underground source of 
water as we have here, and since the removal of the timber 
there have frequently been severe drouths, a thing that was 
entirely unknown when I was a boy. I am persuaded that, 
in all probability, it has more to do with the existing con- </seg>

ditions in our country to-day than anything else. We frequently 
hear men talking about the desirability of preserving 
the natural forests, and yet we allow them to be rapidlj 
destroyed. Last year the upper Mississippi river had less 
water in it than ever before in its history. I hear people 
talk about returning to the normal conditions of sixteen 
years ago, but I don't believe I shall live to see the time come 
when we shall have the amount of moisture that we had 
then. Now, gentlemen, I believe the thing to do is to educate 
in the matter of forestry. I don't pretend to say it is 
going to be an easy matter to make trees grow here, but I do 
say that very much more can be done in this direction than 
people are doing at the present time. One trouble with us 
is that we are not willing to take the pains and do the work 
as it ought to be done. There is a growing tendency among 
us as a people to avoid working with our hands, and it takes 
hand work to make a success of growing trees. Hand work, 
however, is too slow for the average American. We want 
to do everything in a rush ; we are not satisfied unless we 
can plow four or five rows of corn at a time. Our young men 
are learning to do something else besides horticulture. I 
would like to say, however, for the benefit of the young men 
here, that in my judgment there is no field in which there is 
a better opening for young men to-day than in that of 
horticulture. But the boys don't take to it. They don't like 
to get down fta the hot sun and bud trees or anything pf that 
kind. I find it very difficult to find young men whoare willing 
to learn that kind of work. These are the conditions that confront 
us to-day. The question is, What arewe going to do about 
it? I think we ought to be aroused to the necessity of saving 
all of the forests we have and planting all we can. It 
is true we have failures, but we also have failures with our 
corn and other crops. Let us make the best of the situation 
and try and do more in the matter of growing trees than we 
have ever done in the past. </seg>

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Cobbin — I should like to say just a word about 
my experience in Nebraska. I came to Grand Island in l 
and took a soldier's homestead about fifteen miles north 
west of that city. In the fall of '72 I went back east and 
while there obtained about three bushels of apple seed from 
the cider mills. I told the people I was going to plant Nebraska 
with apple trees. The next spring I broke two acres 
of ground, chopped it up fine with a spade, and planted the 
apple seed, thinking I would get a nice lot of young apple 
trees to graft. Soon after I planted it I discovered that the 
pocket gophers were carrying off the seed. I had quite a 
fight with them, but succeeded in getting quite a number of 
seedlings started. Later in the season the grasshoppers 
came along and almost swept them clean, and what few I 
managed to save from the grasshoppers were eaten off to the 
ground by the jackrabbits in the fall. So I had only the 
stubs left next spring. Some of them started up, and 
1 watched them carefully, hoping to get growth on them 
to be able to graft them the next season. That year the 
grasshoppers came again, and I only succeeded in getting 
150 trees out of the three bushels of seed. I planted these 
out, but found that the soil was rather wild for growing 
apple trees, and I only got fifteen trees out of the 150 grafts. 
These trees have been dying along a few at a time until 
last year, when the last one of them went This is my experience 
in pioneer tree planting. 

Mb. Young ers — Mr. Corbin seems to have the idea that 
we can not grow seedlings or trees on new land. I wish to 
say that we use new ground in preference to any other kind, 
especially for growing apple seedlings. The prairie is broken 
in June, properly fitted in the fall, and the seed planted the 
following spring. We have planted one hundred bushels 
of apple seed in this way with the very best results. I don't 
think we should say anything to discourage these people 
because they are on new land.

either of the other gentlemen who have spoken, ami 
while I am not an enthusiast in the matter of commercial 
orchards, I believe that every man can grow all the fruit 
he needs for himself, anywhere in Nebraska, if he will plant 
the right varieties. Take, for instance, the experience of the 
men who have made a success of fruit growing in this state. 
Whenever they have planted varieties that are grown in New 
York or other eastern states, they have failed. Along that 
line the experience of Mr. Russell is very instructive. Mr. 
Kussell is with us, but was taken sick last night and is not 
in the meeting this morning. When he first tried to grow 
peach trees he planted varieties that succeeded in the South, 
and his first planting was almost a complete failure. Then 
he began to experiment along the line of growing varieties 
adapted to this climate and has now had four, five, or six 
crops of peaches hand running at Wymore, and at Lincoln 
where the trees are large enough they are bearing a full crop. 
The same thing is true of our part of the state. Wherever 
the varieties recommended by Mr. Russell are planted they 
are doing well. We have some very fine orchards in eastern 
Nebraska that were planted just as soon as the sod was 
broken. I think new land is all right if it is thoroughly 
worked. There is a great deal of truth in what the speaker 
said about the western man's way of doing things. We all want 
to get over too much ground and are not willing to be 
thorough enough in our work. </seg>

FRUIT GROWING IN NORTH CENTRAL NEBRASKA.

SOME OBSERVATIONS OF FRUIT GROWING IN 
NORTH CENTRAL NEBRASKA. 

By J. L. Coppoc, Chambers, Neb. 

Mb. President and Gentlemen — When the speaker who 
preceded me was talking about the difficulties of tree growing, 
I felt like making a motion to turn this into a railroad 
meeting to build railroads up into this country so that in 
the near future we could supply these people with apples. 
I don't know anything about fruit growing in Nebraska, 
south of the line of Garfleld and Wheeler counties; in fact 
I might almost say that I don't know anything about the 
business anywhere, but as I am in for some sort of a talk 
on fruit growing I shall have to make the best of it Ten 
years ago I planted a few apple and cherry trees. The cherries 
all died because it happened to be a wet season and they 
were on too low ground. Most of the apple trees grew nicely 
until about the time they began to come into bearing. Then 
the blight struck them. I wrote to the Michigan Fanner and 
Fruit Grower, stating that my trees began to die from the 
top down, and asking them what was the matter. Their reply 
was, "Your description is so brief and incomplete that we 
can not tell, but we think it is twig blight." Soon after that 
a gentleman was kind enough to present me a copy of your report 
for 1894, and I learned from that something more about 
twig blight. I also gathered some little information in regard 
to methods of treating trees affected with twig blight, from 
other sources, but by the time I had gained this information 
it was too late to accomplish anything that season. The next 
year I visited my orchard with pruning knife, just as regularly 
as I fed my horses, cutting off every twig that showed 
any signs of blight, three or four inches below where they 
were affected, and carrying them to the stove where they were 
burned at once. The result was that before fall I had cured </seg>

            <seg id="p113">
112 


not so much to you, because you know all about it, but if 
my talk should find a place in your report, I want my people 
up thereto read it so they will not be frightened at twig blight. 
I think I have demonstrated the fact that it can be easily 
controlled in small orchards. Of course in large commercial 
orchards it might be more dangerous because one would 
hardly have time to visit the orchard every day and remove 
the affected twigs. 

I took so much interest in my inquiries as to how to overcome 
the difficulties with which I met, and in learning how 
to treat my orchard in order to succeed in securing sufficient 
fruit for myself and family, that I visited nearly every or 
chard within ten miles of my place. They were not very 
numerous at that time, but since then they have increased 
rapidly, and I have noticed almost everything that would 
tend to give me information in regard to the best methods 
of handling an orchard. Since making these investigations 
I am satisfied that even a commercial orchard in north central 
Nebraska properly managed will prove successful and 
will bring a greater return than the same number of acres, 
or even more, devoted to grain growing or almost any other 
purpose. I have not anything to say to you here to-day that 
is discouraging in regard to fruit growing in north central 
Nebraska, I don't mean to say that we have no difficulties. 
We have them just the same as they have them in other 
countries. One of the greatest is that we have that same 
fellow who told thore people fifty years ago, over in Illinois, 
that they could not raise fruit. Then he came over into 
eastern Iowa and preached the same gospel there — "You 
can't raise fruit." Then he moved over into western Iowa 
and told the people there that it was impossible to raise 
fruit in that country. He then moved over into eastern Nebraska, 
where he sang the same song. I am glad that the 
people have banished him from that part of the state, but 
am very sorry that he came over into our part, where he is 
still telling the people that they can't raise fruit. I am sorry </seg>

            <seg id="p114">
113 


for him. He is a good fellow in many respects, but he is 
certainly mistaken in that one thing, for I am sure we can 
raise fruit in our part of the country. 

In the early part of our experience, some of our greatest 
disappointments were caused by the purchase of fruit trees 
from irresponsible agents. I don't want to join in that cry 
that condemns unconditionally all fruit agents, because I 
believe it is wrong. I believe those who condemn fruit tree 
agents indiscriminately are doing an injury, not only to the 
agents, but to the farmer and to the nurseryman as well. If 
the agent is an honest man, who tells the truth in regard to 
his trees, and furnishes varieties true to the label, he may be 
a blessing and a public benefactor. If, on the other hand, 
he cares more about selling the trees than he does about 
their growth, development, and final productiveness, he is 
a curse to the interest of fruit growing. In the early days 
we have been greatly disappointed in our purchase of trees, 
but planters are becoming more careful, and now when a 
man comes and proposes to sell us a bill of trees, we want 
to know where the trees are from. If he tells us he gets his 
trees from New Jersey or New York, we tell him his trees 
may be all right, but we prefer to patronize Nebraska nurserymen 
and bid him good-day. The result is that we are 
now buying trees that are not so disappointing. 

There is another point closely connected with these disappointments, 
and it comes from the doctrine of the transmigration 
of the soul. Probably a good many of you do not 
believe in this doctrine, but up our way it has been demonstrated 
to be true. The spirit of some departed seedling 
has been known to find its way into a Duchess of Oldenburg, 
and lo and behold! the Duchess bears a little apple about 
as large around as my little finger. Of course you can not 
blame the agent because the spirits of apples cut up such 
didoes. But it is disappointing to the farmer nevertheless. 
The point is simply this, that labels have not always been 
right, and up our way it is getting so that people want to

know whether the nurseryman is responsible or whether the 
salesman buys wherever he can buy the cheapest and then 
if you order Ben Davis, Duchess, or Wealthy, if he does not 
happen to have those varieties, lie puts in some seedling or 
possibly a Transcendent crab. 

I want to give you a few instances of successful tree planting. 
There is a gentleman living about eleven miles west 
of Chambers, whose orchard I visited a few days before 
coming down here. He has Ben Davis trees eleven years old 
that will produce a crop estimated at eight bushels to the 
tree, I do not know how this compares with the yield in 
other parts of the state. 

The Puksident — It is a good average crop. 

Mr. Coppoc, continuing — He has one Wine Sap tree that 
has produced ten bushels. Also a Bailey Sweet from which 
he has had a few apples, from a peck to half a bushel, perhaps. 
He also has a Dominie. He had a number of them, but has 
only one left, and that is just getting ready to die. I want 
to say to you that you should not try to raise Dominie apples 
here. If you want this variety you had better go to Iowa to 
raise them. There is a gentleman living six and one-half 
miles southeast of Chambers who planted five hundred trees 
this spring. He told me the other day that he had not lost 
a tree out of the five hundred. I planted five hundred and 
I lost two trees. I remember reading in one of the horticultural 
reports of Mr. Youngers' success in planting trees. I 
was just rejoicing the other day that I had beaten him, having 
succeeded in saving a greater per cent of trees than he 
did. This was not on account of my superior ability as a 
tree grower, but because of our superior advantages — now 
you will pardon me gentlemen — in the way of soil and climate. 
Laughter. 

Mr. Yoincers— The next time I plant trees I shall borrow 
some of vour soil to start them in. 

Mb. Coppoc — I sold for another gentleman, fifty trees 
to one man, and the same number to another. One of these </seg>

men planted his trees on new land, just back-set, and he told 
me the other day that he did not think there was a tree 
missing. There was one just beginning to leaf out, and he 
thought it would be all right. His experience seemed to 
corroborate what this gentleman over here said about planting 
on new land. The other man planted his trees on old 
ground and lost four trees. There is an orchard twelve 
miles southwest of Chambers that has been producing paying 
crops of fruit for four or five years. Those trees h;ive 
a history. I don't know that it would be best to take up the 
time giving their history, but will briefly say that they are 
planted on land that is as sandy as anything in the country. 
There is a gentleman living two miles north of my place 
who has four Transcendent crab trees which are doing fine. 
They are twelve years old, bearing even* year, and showing 
no signs of blight. This year they have a crop of seven or 
eight bushels to the tree. 

Mr. Williams — Does the Transcendent blight with you? 

Mr. Coppoc — Yes, sir, but this is an exceptional case. 
I don't want to encourage any one to plant Trauscendente, 
for they not only blight themselves, but spread it to other 
trees in the orchard. 

Now, there are some conditions connected with tree planting 
in our country that do not exist in your part of the state. 
We have very large, broad tracts of country, plains or valleys 
as you might call them, where there are frequent rises 
of three or four feet with intervening depressions. These 
rises or knolls are always covered with sand, or at least with 
a very sandy soil. In the spring or in very wet seasons, such 
as we had a short time ago, water collects in the depressions. 
If it does- not stand on the surface it is only a very short 
distance below. You can readily see how all the fertility 
of the surrounding soil would be carried by the winds and 
by the leaching of the water to those low places, and the soil 
there is very rich. A good many people think that this rich, </seg>

moist alluvial soil is just the place in which to plant trees, 
but -when planted there they almost invariably die. The water 
does not stand in these places, it soon evaporates or sinks away, 
and the question is, Why do those trees die? 

Mr. Youngers — I believe the injury is done in the fall. 
The trees on that low ground grow very fast and late in the 
season and a very little freeze early in the fall, say in September, 
will injure them so that they will die. 

The President — How deep is it to water in those depressions? 


Mr. Coppoc — Well, that would be hard to answer. In 
some places it might be three feet. Now, it would probably 
be four or five, or possibly six feet. 

The President — If it is not more than two or three 
feet and, as you have said, during a wet time the water 
stands on the surface for a short time, 1 am inclined to think 
Mr. Youngers' statement is true. 

Mr. Coppoc — I might describe my orchard. The rows 
are quite long and run over one of these high sandy places. 
One end of the orchard is on low land, very rich and fertile. 
Just before I came down here, I measured the limb growth 
on the sandiest land I could find and also on the low land 
for comparison. Ten limbs, the longest I could find on the 
high land, measured 16 feet and 10 inches. The same number 
on the low land measured 12 feet and 3 inches. Of course 
this season has been exceptionally favorable to the sandy 

The President — I understand you planted these trees 
last April. 

Mr. Coppoc — Yes, sir. These measurements would indicate 
that the sandy land is the best so far as this season is 
concerned, though of course one experiment does not establish 
anything definite. It was my privilege to visit an 
experimental plantation in southwestern Holt county, and </seg>

and Mr. Hall will tell you, if I am not mistaken, that thep 
have been planted nine years and have made a growth of 
eighteen feet, and are growing more rapidly today than 
ever before. We have farmers all over that northern countrj 
who are afraid to plant trees because their laud is so sandy. 
Now I want to make this statement : That every orchard that 
has been successful in all our part of the country has been 
planted on the very sandiest land. The gentleman who has 
the orchard west of Chambers, that I referred to a few minutes 
ago, told me a few days ago, sitting at the hotel in 
Chambers, that when he planted those trees the ground was 
just as bare as the street. There was no vegetation on it, 
but he took care of them. He mulched them with coarse 
manure the fall after planting them, and plowed that 
manure under the next spring. He repeated the operation 
the next year, keeping the weeds down by cultivation during 
the summer, and the result is that he has an orchard that is 
paying him. So, as I said in the beginning, I have nothing 
discouraging to say in regard to fruit-growing in north central 
Nebraska. We have many things to encourage us and 
I have every hope for the future. 

Mr. J. L. Brown — The gentleman seems to think it 
strange that trees will grow on sandy land. There is scarcely 
any question in my mind but that a great deal of the sandhill 
country in the northwestern part of the state can be 
covered with forests. 

Mr. Miller — I have been trying to raise fruit in this 
country for a good number of years. This is the twenty 
eighth season I have been on my farm in this county. I 
planted an orchard when I first came here, but I fed that 
to the grasshoppers the next year. Afterwards I sent to 
the Crete nursery and got one hundred trees, and I havr 
beaten my friend Coppoc a little, for out of one hundred 
trees I had one hundred and four that lived and grew. I 
have that orchard yet. It is now eighteen or nineteen yenrs 
old, and last year I had five trees that split apart and fell </seg>

to the ground by the weight of apples. This notwithstanding 

the fact that last jreaf was a very dry year in this country; 

much drier I think than the present season. It is true we 
had no such dry winds, but we had no moisture in the soil 
to begin with. I had only sixty trees, all told, that bore 
apples last year, and of course some of those bore but very 
few, yet 1 harvested over three hundred bushels, unfavorable 
as the year was. 

As has been stated here, in the first place if you don't in 
tend to take care of trees don't plant them. Your ground 
has to be thoroughly prepared and then the weeds and grass 
must be kept away. I examined the authorities to see what 
was best to put in an orchard. In the first place I tried red 
clover, but I found that would not grow, and after experimenting 
for some time, I concluded the best thing to put into 
my orchard was a disk followed by a smoothing harrow ; the 
dose to be repeated every week. Last year I did that, and I 
had moist ground the season through, and my apples held on 
the trees well although we had an immense amount of wind. 
This year I have not disked and harrowed every week as I 
should have done, because there were no weeds in the orchard. 
There is not much encouragement to go out into the field 
and work over the ground when there are no weeds to kill. 

If you will guarantee me against just two things I will 
raise apples in this country. There is one enemy that you 
can not get ready for. You may work fifteen or sixteen 
years and get a fine orchard and in five minutes it may be 
absolutely destroyed by a hail storm. I have not had any 
thing of tb i s kind since my orchard was planted. The worst 
enemy is the codling moth. I wish the last legislature had 
made an appropriation of about $200,000 to enable the horticulturists 
of this state to invent some scheme to get rid 
of that codling moth. I don't like spraying the orchard 
every year. It is hard work, and dirty work. But I do it 
and still we have a good many wormy apples. I can say, 
however, that I don't feel in the least discouraged in regard </seg>

to raising fruit. We can raise cherries pretty nearly ei 
year, and we can raise apples every other year. I think niv 
friend Mr. Brown is blue. He started in the meeting feeling 
blue, and the only time he has looked pleasant was when Mr. 
Coppoc advised people not to send to some eastern nursery 
for trees. Mr. Brown looked pleasant then, and I imagined 
he thought, "Brown is the man to buy them of right here at 
home." 

HOW SHALL THE PLANTER-KNOW BEST WHAT TO 

PLANT? 

By G. A. Marshall, Arlington, Neb. 

In viewing the spread of horticulture in its various lines, 
from the earliest settlements of America to the present time, 
it is plainly discernible that hardiness, size, and appearance 
have steadily increased, sometimes at the expense of quality, 
however. When an old variety is dropped, it is generally to 
make room for a new one with some superior points over the 
old. It is also noticed that while some of the fruits seem dis 
inclined to leave their native habitat, yet most of the stand 
ard fruits can be induced to emigrate with man. Thus the} 
spread as civilization spreads and adapt themselves to the 
various soils and climatic conditions with which they come 
in contact. If an old variety fails in a new location, a seedling 
having sufficient vitality and hardiness to succeed under 
the new conditions can generally be grown. In this way the 
extension has gone on all these years; and now that American 
people have become awakened to the importance of fruitgrowing 
and with the rapid production of new seedlings &lt;&gt;f 
known parentage (by cross pollination) we may reasonably 
look for much more rapid progress in the future. </seg>

clearly apples in horticulture. Some of the fruits that are 
iu most common use to-day are of purely American production, 
and they originated mainly in cases of necessity. For 
instance, the European grape when brought across the water 
became so homesick that our forefathers soon found themselves 
without grapes. The result of the search for grapes 
is our Concord and its family, which are to-day feeding their 
millions of people all over this country. The raspberry and 
also the gooseberry failed to thrive when brought from Europe; 
yet we have them of American origin. 

When Peter Gideon asserted that he would extend the apple 
belt two or three hundred miles farther north by studying 
the varieties and producing seedlings from them with 
a view to hardiness, the people simply smiled with a skeptical 
twinkle in their eyes; yet his labors, followed by those 
of such men as Mr. Patton, have already extended the apple 
belt two hundred and fifty miles north. The Wealthy alone, 
which is but one of the many productions of Mr. Gideon, when 
considered as a resource in the northwestern states, is enough 
to entitle him to more real honor than we are in a position 
to bestow. 

With the result of these labors in mind it is reasonable to 
believe that it will be found not only possible, but compara 
tively easy, to produce varieties that will succeed throughout 
the West and Northwest where the old varieties prove unsatisfactory. 
It will require, however, some intelligent labor, 
untiring patience, and considerable time, 

If we are working west, we should study and select such 
varieties as will withstand dry weather, bright sunshine, 
and sudden changes. If we wish to work northwest, we 
should combine with these qualities, hardiness or ability 
to withstand a low degree of temperature, I frequently receive 
letters from parties several hnndred miles distant, 
asking what varieties will succeed best in their localities. I 
wish here to say a few words on that point by way of suggestion. 
The best and surest way to secure varieties which will </seg>

not be disappointing is to make yourself acquainted with 
those which are being successfully grown in your particular 
vicinity; and selecting such as have been proven satisfactory. 
If you are located in the newer portions of the state where 
old plantations are not at hand, it will pay you to visit those 
nearest you, with a view to selecting successful varieties. If 
unable to secure a sufficient number of varieties in this way, 
ascertain what varieties are succeeding in older localities 
having the same soil and climatic conditions as your own. 
Do not experiment on new fruits, especially from places 
where the conditions are very different, and, last but not 
least, keep an eye open to the production of new seedlings 
which will be more at home than the old. The native fruita 
shouldalso be studied everywhere with a viewto bringingtbem 
into general cultivation, as we certainly have good reason 
to expect desirable results from this. 

TIMBER PLANTING FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. 

By E. F. Stephens, Crete, Neb. 

Among my earliest memories of farm work is that of 
chopping down trees, rolling logs together, and burning to 
clear land, timber being an incumbrance rather than an 
asset to the property. For two hundred and fifty years our 
people have been engaged in the work of getting rid of the 
native timber and clearing land for general farming. Coming 
to our own state and time we still find the feeling among 
three-fourths of our people that clear land, ready for the 
plow and crops, is more valuable than timber land. I have 
even known of such extreme cases as those of thrifty orchards 
passing into the hands of people who had so little 
knowledge of the profits or pleasures of fruit-growing that </seg>

            <seg id="p123">
122 


they regarded the orchards as a detriment to the land rather 
than an improvement. 

Perhaps this feeling may be partly attributed to the results 
which follow the timber claim law. The data I have in hand 
are from nine of the eleven districts of the state, showing 
that in these nine districts 28,478 timber claims were tiled on. 
Many of these timber claims were planted and replanted. 
Figuring that they were planted once only, on a legal basis 
of 27,000 trees per claim, there would have been 503,898,000 
trees planted. Between 1885 and 1890, years in which the 
largest number of trees were planted, there were single 
¦us when as many as 100,000,000 trees were planted. 
One of our leading nursery firms sold upwards of 30,000.0&lt;iti 
trees in one season, and all nurseries had a large trade. Un 
fortunately for the final result of this work, 160 acres of 
land was granted for simply planting and cultivating the 
trees for a very brief period of time. As four years was allowed 
for the preparation and planting of ten acres, only 
four years more of cultivation was required to secure title 
to the land. In the majority of cases the primary object in 
planting was not to secure a grove for its economic uses and 
shelter, but rather to acquire land on easy terms. Ilaving 
made proof and secured title the greater portion of the 
planters ceased to cultivate, and in most cases neglected to 
maintain fire guard. 

The better class of claims made proof with -an average of 
20,000 or more living trees on each ten acres, or three times 
the legal requirement. The necessity for further cultivation 
nnd protection being removed and the timber very rarely 
being fenced, it was subject to the ravages of rattle. When 
the surrounding prairie grasses dried up, fresh green leaves 
of many varieties of timber are attractive to cattle. Foliage 
being destroyed, sunlight and resulting weeds rapidly exhaust 
the soil moisture, and ultimately a large portion of 
these tracts was seriously harmed, and many ruined. 

While the losses from this class of work and neglect have </seg>


            <seg id="p124">
123 

been very serious, there are yet a large number of timber 
claim groves in the western part of the state that are uo« 
showing about 20,000 trees for each ten acres, and indicate 
that with continued care and under favorable conditions, a 
countless number of trees lost might have been saved for 
future usefulness. 

Passing toward the eastern half of the state we find conditions 
very much more favorable. The frequent prairie 
fires which have been so destructive in the western portions 
of the state are not allowed in the eastern or agricultural 
portion, and wherever groves have been planted and received 
fair encouragement, success has been achieved. We note 
also that the keeping out of prairie fires allows the natural 
groves to increase in the ravines and to encroach upon the 
valley lands. In our own pasture lands, where thirty years 
ago there was hardly a tree larger than a walking stick, now 
the major portion of one hundred acres is so filled up with 
natural timber that there is but little grazing remaining. 
I think we may safely say that the increase in the area of 
timber lands in the eastern third of tlie state is larger than 
the consumption for fuel or timber purposes and this from 
natural causes ojilv. 

SOMK INSTANCES OF COMMERCIAL PLANTING. 

In 1872, Thomas Doane, then Superintendent of the Burlington 
System, commenced planting on his estate near Crete. 
Elms planted at that time show a circumference of 5i to 5} 
feet. At a later period he planted maple groves for windbreak 
and shelter. In 1885 groves of walnut, catalpa, ash, 
?black and honey locust were planted. His groves of catalpa 
are the largest in area which we have seen within the state. 
Where planted on very thin land, regarded as nearly worthless 
for farm purposes, the growth has not been rapid, yet 
very few of the trees have died out. They trim themselveb 
and shade the ground so completely as to keep down nearly 
all weed growth. Where planted on better soil, the larger </seg>

            <seg id="p125">

trees at this time are twenty-six to thirty inches in circumference 
and have a height of thirty to thirty-live feet. They 
seeui likely to make telephone poles within a brief number 
of years. On thin soil, not strong enough to raise good corn, 
a number of years will yet be required before these trees 
planted 4x4 and never thinned would uniformly cut good 
fence posts. 

At about the same time, Doane College adopted the plan 
of filling the ravines on lands belonging to them with timber, 
that these lands so planted might become an element of 
value and improvement to the property, rather than an eyesore 
as rough, broken, and waste lands. These groves were 
cared for four years, since which time they have successfully 
resisted weeds and all climatic difficulties, and at this time 
are groves of beauty and a valuable improvement to the 

PAWNEE COUNTY. 

In 1890, Mr. C. D. Robinson, of Pawnee City, planted a 
forty-acre post farm, as he termed it, of 50,000 osage and 
58,000 catalpa. In 1899, when the grove was nine years old, 
he commenced cutting catalpa fence posts which were four 
inches in diameter. In the next five or six years he hopes 
that many of the better class of trees will cut two or three 
fence posts each. The better trees are now twenty-five to 
thirty feet in height. They were planted four feet apart each 
way. Of osage and catalpa, on this forty acres, he has 
108,000 trees, and has never thinned. His thought is that 
when large enough to commence cutting posts, he will then 
cut every other tree one way, and later every other tree 
the other way, leaving the trees eight by eight 
feet apart, or six hundred and forty trees per acre. At this 
distance the catalpa will readily and rapidly grow to sizes 
suitable for telephone poles. The osage will require a longer 
period of time to make timber of commercial size, but will 
ultimately give timber of surprising durability. </seg>

RICHARDSON COUNTY. 

Twelve years ago, George A. Slayton, of Salem, planted a 
catalpa grove, whch has been a source of great satisfaction 
and encouragement to him. He planted the trees less than 
three feet apart in the row, and the rows four feet apart, and 
gave cultivation for a space of two years, after which time 
the foliage was so dense as to shade out all weed growth. A 
part of his planting was on inferior, badly washed side hill 
land, a portion being on the level ground at the bottom. He 
now finds that his planting was too close, that a portion of 
the weaker trees have been smothered out On the better 
class of land, however, nearly all the trees are from twentysix 
to thirty inches in circumference and from thirty to thirtyfive 
feet high, the trees of less diameter being as tall as those 
of larger caliber. On the poor land many of the trees are 
not half that height. Should he plant again, his judgment 
is that he would plant in rows not closer than four feet, 
and perhaps far enough so he could go through between the 
rows with a two-horse cultivator, since the trees after one 
year's growth are so tall that it is impossible to straddle 
them with the ordinary corn cultivator. In this way he 
would plant 1,500 to 1,600 trees per acre. After discussing 
his groves of catalpa, red cedar, black walnut, and osage, 
he gives his impression that we should not overlook the 
black walnut, the ash, and the osage. His experience with 
his groves convinces him that a young man with small capi 
tal could make no wiser or safer use of it than to plant 
twenty, forty, or eighty acres of good land with forest trees, 
that his income would commence to come in at the end of ten 
or twelve years and would continue in increasing ratio with 
advancing age. 

After commencing this article I went out and measured 
some of our own trees. I find a cottonwood in front of the 
house, aged twenty-nine years, a chance seedling catching 
in the breaking, one hundred and eleven inches in circum- </seg>

ference. Near the office an elm fourteen years old measures 
sixty-eight inches in circumference. North of the house an 
ash nineteen years old is forty-seven inches in circumference. 
The thought occurred to me to bring to this meeting samples 
of timber cut this spring. An accidental elm, growing where 
it had a very hard chance for the first eight years, shows 
sixteen inches in diameter at the age of sixteen rings of 
annual growth. A sixteen year old catalpa measures fifteen 
(inches in diameter. 

VARIETIES. 

Having planted between two and three millions of 
catalpas in different portions of the state, I am led to place 
this, for the eastern part of the state, as the tree from which 
the largest commercial returns can be secured within a reasonable 
time, that is, a return commencing within fifteen 
years, first as fence posts, second as railroad ties, third for 
telegraph or telephone poles. 

"In 1879, several catalpa cross-ties were placed in the &lt; 
&lt; '. &amp; tSt. L. Cairo division, one of which was taken out last 
summer (1899) having been in constant use for twenty 
years. Mr. J. W. Cowper, Engineer Maintenance of Way, 
officially reports of this tie as follows: 'This catalpa tie, 
taken out of the track three miles north of Harrisburg, was 
put in in 1879, in mud ballast. The wood is perfectly solid, 
showing very little signs of decay. With the tie plates and 
good ballast, these ties would, I think without doubt, last 
fully thirty to thirty-five years.' " 

DEMAND FOR TIMBER BY RAILROADS. 

There are in use to-day 780,000,000 cross-ties. Annual 
requirement for renewals 112,000,000 ties. Number required 
during the next two decades 3,000,000,000 ties. The present 
value of a railroad tie at this point is about 60 cents, varying 
somewhat with the kind of timber. </seg>

TIMBER PLANTING FOB COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. 

BLACK LOCUST. 

In our timber claim contracts in the west half of the state 
we planted a considerable quantity of black locust. On the 
loose, sandy loam soil of Lincoln county, we found its growth 
so rapid that it attained the height of twelve to fifteen feet 
in three years, with such spread of branches that it was impossible 
to cultivate longer. Way up in Kimball county, on 
the extreme western border of the state, it was found to endure 
the drouth of these arid tables remarkably well. In the 
Platte valley, near Cozad, plantations of the black locust 
have made a peculiarly vigorous growth. These are pra&lt; ti 
cally sub-irrigated by their nearness to the underlying water. 
Black locust makes trees large enough for fence posts in a 
very brief time, and when cut down they quickly renew from 
the stump, sending up shoots the first season to the height of 
from five to seven feet. On the sub-irrigated lands of the 
Platte valley, and on the loose, sandy loams like those of 
Lincoln, Logan, McPherson, Thomas, and Cherry couir 
we would regard the growing of black locust as very profitable, 
the market close at hand and ever extending, for use 
as fence posts on cultivated farms and in grazing regions. 
The first return from the black locust is quicker than from 
the catalpa. 

HONEY LOT f ST. 

This grows readily all over the state, withstands drouth' 
extremely well clear out to the western limit and on elevated 
dry table lands. We have not, however, found its durability 
as a fence post equal to our expectations. 

BLACK WALNUT. 

In the eastern portion of the state, on our richest valley 
lands the growth of the black walnut is perhaps all that could 
be expected with less rainfall than in the middle states. On 
the elevated table lands of the central and western portions 
of the state, we would regard the climatic conditions too </seg>

arid for successful planting. The commercial returns from 
a walnut plantation, while liberal sometimes, are a long 
time in coming. At Princeton, 111., Mr. Bryant called my attention 
to walnut trees forty-five to fifty years old, which 
were then only sixteen to eighteen inches in diameter. In 
our own plantation of walnut twenty-nine years old, on Blue 
valley bottom land, twenty-eight feet to water, trees are now 
from four to eight inches in circumference. 

ASH. 

The ash is an easy tree to grow in almost any part of Ne 
braska. It stands drought remarkably well. The age and 
size, however, to which it must attain before it would have 
commercial value would place returns from this timber many 
years distant. Years ago hoops were made from hoop poles, 
for which the ash was very well adapted. Now, hoops are 
sawed out of lumber made by machinery instead of being 
rived from hoop poles. 

COTTONWOOD. 

In the eastern portion of the state we find a large amount of 
cottonwood timber, sometimes in groves, oftener in single 
lines along the highways. These trees have made vigorous 
growth and are likely to be in demand in the near future for 
barrel staves. Purchasing apple barrels at St. Joseph, Mo., 
•I learn that they find cottonwood useful for barrel staves, 
and that the time is coming when these trees will be useful 
for this and rough lumber. 

EVERGREENS. 

Concerning the probability of growing saw timber from 
evergreens, in our state, I am very much in doubt While 1 
have seen beautiful plantations of the white pine in the. 
Missouri valley, yet the value of our better lands and the long 
period before returns can be secured would seem to make 
returns from this class of timber more remote than the others </seg>

discussed. Trees also cost more and are not as easily and 
safely planted as deciduous trees. 

TIMBER IN THE SANDHILLS. 

Concerning the adaptability of the loose, sandy loam lands 
of the Northwest for groves, we have never had any trouble 
in securing a full stand of trees on lands of that character, 
since soil of that nature always retains moisture enough for 
successful starting of groves. We find that on land of that 
character native grasses remain green until September or 
until frost cornea, and we were seldom able to burn our fire 
guards until after frost came and killed the grass. 

METHOD OF PLANTING. 

Concerning the method of handling raw prairie lands, our 
experience is in the direction of breaking and then planting 
the first season after breaking. In the planting of 2,500 
acres of timber, whether in the eastern, middle, or western 
portion of the state, we have found that breaking in May or 
June, rolling the sod flat that it should retain the moisture 
and rot quickly, plowing five to seven inches deep and leaving 
it rough, anywhere from September to November, pulverizing 
and harrowing fine in March or early April, was all the preparation 
that any of our soils require, and we would rather 
plant the first year after breaking, while the land is comparatively 
free from weeds, than at any later period. In extreme 
cases where haste is required, we have found it en 
tirely praclicable on our western table lands to break, disk, 
plow double depth, finely pulverize, and plant the same week 
as breaking; that trees during the early years need much 
less moisture than corn, and that where such cultivation is 
given as will conserve the major portion of the native moisture, 
there is little difficulty in starting timber in any soils 
except those heavily impregnated with alkali; that cultivation 
conserves moisture, trees with increasing size catch 
flurries of snow, moisture penetrates more and more deeply

into the subsoil ; that as the trees get large enough to require 
more moisture they find it in this natural way; that if timber 
can be protected from fire, cattle, and weeds until the trees 
are large enough to shade the weeds out, the question of soil 
moisture for groves can be solved over the greater portion 
of the state. With more rapid growing varieties of timber 
and on the letter class of soils, the period required to shade 
out the weeds is from four to six years. This discussion on 
planting and cultivation applies to holding moisture enough 
to establish trees to age of ten years. Whether timber of 
commercial size and value can be grown in western portions 
of the state, away from the irrigated or sub-irrigated lands 
along the streams, is one of the unsolved problems. 

THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT 
OF FORESTS. 

By F. H. Newell, Washington, D. C. 

Mr. Pinchot requests that I make his apology and express 
his regrets at being unable to be present with you to-day. We 
had agreed to travel together. My destination was, first, 
Cripple Creek, where I was to speak at the Trans-Mississippi 
Congress to-morrow, but at Mr. Pinchot's solicitation I 
agreed to come with him and meet you gentlemen, and he 
then threw the whole burden of appearing for him on my 
shoulders. 

In explanation of why he is not here, it will be necessary 
to say something of the policy of the government in the matter 
of forest management. As you know, there has been for 
a generation a sentiment in favor of the protection of our 
forests, especially at the head-waters of the great lakes and </seg>

            <seg id="p132">
GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENT OP FORESTS. 

131 

streams of the country. That sentiment, if I may be allowed 
to call it such, was fostered by the American Forestry Association, 
formed some fifteen years ago, but which did little 
more for a time than to keep alive that growing feeling that 
something must be done to increase and develop the public 
forests. Gradually the attention of Congress was brought to 
the matter, and laws, not comprehensive in their scope, but 
rather by piecemeal, were enacted. By and by reservations 
were set aside, especially on the high lands and mountains, 
buf it was not until the time of Mr. Cleveland, in fact not 
until near the end of his term, that the public forests received 
any serious attention. Mr. Cleveland took the position 
that our forests should be put under official protection, 
so with one sweep of the pen he created over 1,000,000 acres 
of public forests, and then left it with Congress to say 
whether the project should be abandoned or carried out. The 
result of that bold move was that Congress did finally create 
some protection for the forest reserves, and from that time 
on a gradual growth and defmite policy has been 
worked out. One result of the piecemeal method of 
legislation is that the examination of the forests which are 
included within the reserves, and which are adjacent to them 
is left to the geological survey, of which I am a member. We 
map the topography of the forests, the hills, valleys, lakes, 
streams, etc., giving their character in a general way. That 
is a preliminary work which has to do with the general character 
and value of the forests in regard to their worth commercially 
and their influence on the streams. 

The next of the three bodies or organizations which has 
had to do with the forests is the general land office, which 
was authorized by Congress to employ special officers, called 
rangers, for the purpose of keeping the fires out, and keeping 
grazing out of certain portions, but that organization is 1o 
certain degree political, as their men are appointed probably 
more for their service to the party than for their service to 
the forests * at any rate that is what the people say. </seg>

            <seg id="p133">
132 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Then there is a third organization, which has had a rapid 
growth under Mr. Pinchot's direction; that is the forestry 
bureau of the department of agriculture. That bureau, up 
to the present time, has been occupied almost wholly in studying, 
not the public forests, but the forests in general, and 
especially forests under private ownership, preparing work 
ing plans for the use of those forests, showing the right timber 
to be taken out without destroying them. It has been 
the theory of this bureau that the work being done should 
not be confined to private interests, but should extend also 
to public forests, and that such changes should be made as 
would place the forestry bureau in charge of a complete scientific 
system of forest management That matter has been 
growing along slowly until last Saturday, when it was definitely 
agreed that the parties concerned should get together 
and devise, if possible, a system by which the forestry bureau 
should take charge of, and prepare the working plans of the 
great forest reserves which are coming to embrace some 
40,000,000 acres; so you will see that Mr. Pinchot has the 
best of reasons for staying with that matter until a definite 
proposition is worked out, so that skilled men may go into 
these forests and prepare plans by which the right timbeimay 
be cut for the use of the people and the forests protected 
from destruction, and, in fact, made better by a vigorous nm&gt; 
of the ax. It is to be hoped that this union of the departments 
at work may be brought up, and that we shall have 
a complete comprehensive system of treatment of oar 
forests. 

In regard to Nebraska, of course, there are no forest reservations 
within the state, so the question is rather that of 
increasing the forests than of protecting those in existence. 
Of that work Mr. Hall can speak with a more complete 
knowledge of the facts, but it is one of the branches of the 
work of the forestry bureau which is of almost equal importance 
with that of protecting the forests. 

I wish to say that the work which Mr. Pinchot has in </seg>

133 

charge, although he is in the department designated the Department 
of Agriculture, is closely connected with the work 
that I have in charge under the Department of the Interior, 
since the forests and waters are inseparably connected 
with the best growth and development of the country. 
We are studying the waters and their conservation, 
both by the forests and by the construction of 
large artificial reservoirs for holding the floods and conserving 
the life blood of the country. This water supply 
is, and will be in the future, of incalculable influence 
on the development of the arid land and the semi -arid regions 
lying west of you, and by the artificial conservation of 
the water you have, in tilling the soil, and by bringing up the 
underground stores, lies the foundation of success in many lo 
calities of the country. To the west of you we have been surveying 
quite a number of reservoirs, for the purpose of getting 
data, such as their estimated capacity, cost, what they 
will be worth when completed as regards the arable and fertile 
land, and finding out facts upon which to base a definite 
public policy. 

As regards Nebraska, the greatest interest is in the under 
ground waters, and here we are endeavoring to ascertain the 
depth of the water-bearing horizon, which is in the Dakota 
sandstone, and to prepare suitable maps showing the exact 
condition of the different points. Also to ascertain whether, 
when that water is reached, it will rise to the surface. We 
have prepared maps for portions of the arid regions, and are 
hoping to extend the work throughout the entire plains area. 
This matter of irrigation and water supply is bound to come 
before Congress. It has been before Congress for several 
years, and various propositions have been submitted which 
will be considered in detail at this next session. Perhaps 
the plan which is in greatest favor is that of taking the 
funds received from the sale and disposing of public lands, 
which amounted to |2,000,000 or f3,000,000 last year, and 
some f300,000,000 in the aggregate, and using them for the </seg>

conservation of water by building large reservoirs and drilling 
experimental artesian wells where, in Nebraska, the depth 
of water is practically unknown. Possibly also for drilling 
such wells to ascertain the exact condition over 1,000,000 
square miles of plains area. In California there are artesian 
wells, each of which is supplying one hundred and sixty acres 
of land. While it might be too much to hope for such a thing 
here, yet this in an indication of what may be done by work 
of this character. These are some of the lines along which 
it is hoped the policy of our government, in regard to our forests 
and public lands, will be greatly broadened in the near 
future. 

Govkrxob Furnas — I should like to ask one or two 
questions. Have there been any experiments in the arid 
portions of our state? 

Mit. Newell — There have been a number of drillings 
but not deep enough to thoroughly test the matter. That is, 
they have not reached the Dakota sandstone, which is regarded 
as the great water-bearing horizon of this country. 
The members of Congress from Nebraska could do no better 
than to secure an appropriation for the purpose of putting 
down one or two wells a thousand feet or so, until we should 
know the exact structure of the semi -arid portion of the state. 

Governor Furxas — We think, in Nebraska, it is the 
duty of the government under all circumstances to make 
those experiments. Those lands in the western part of the 
state have been sold for the same price as better lands, with 
the understanding that there was a supply of water there, 
at least a subterranean supply. It has been found that individual 
enterprise was not able to reach that water, and we 
think it ought not to be demanded of individual enterprise, 
from the fact that the government sold those lands at its own 
price and the government ought to demonstrate whether or 
not there is a supply of water there to make these lands valuable. 
Everyone knows that with the application of water 
these lands are just as fertile as any lands we have.</seg>

GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENT OF FORESTS. 

135 

Mr. Newell — That brings us to the point. It is my 
province to investigate these matters and retommeud what 
may be done or make suggestions leading to the development 
of the country, but it is for you gentlemen here presv'nt to 
say what shall be done. It is for you to go to your repntative 
in Congress and say these recommendations must Incarried 
out. Without such action upon the part of the people, 
all these investigations are futile. We can say what might 
be done, but it remains for the leading citizens of the ¦tat* 
to say that these things must be done by Congress. 

Mr. Barnard — I should like to ask whether or not these 
reservoirs through this western country, that are used 
for storing a supply of water in the spring when there is an 
abundance of rain, would have any effect in the latter part 
of the season in the way of increasing the rainfall. 

Mr. Newell — I doubt if anything man can do will ever 
in the slightest degree influence the amount of precipitation ; 
yet he may vastly change the environment. For instance, by 
planting trees he changes the environment of his home. These 
reserviors may not influence the rainfall, unless possibly the 
rainfall over in Chicago would be influenced by evaporation 
from the floods here. The great problem of the semi-arid 
regions is to meet the surrounding conditions and change the 
environment by storing water, planting trees, using n 
voirs under mountains and out on the plains, and by pump 
ing water from the underground supply. While we may not 
reclaim all of the land, perhaps not 10 per cent of the goo 1 
land, yet there are hundreds of thousands of acres now ljtag 
useless that may be made to bloom and blossom as the rose, 
by using these simple means of water conservation and tree 
planting. 

Rev. Harbison — I think it is impossible to change the climatic 
conditions, and yet we can be in accord with those conditions 
so as to get the best out of them. It is not only true 
that the rainfall on these western plains is very light, but 
there axe a number of other things that militate against us. </seg>

            <seg id="p137">
136 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETT. 

When the wind is sweeping over the country at the rate of 
about thirty miles an hour the evaporation is about six times 
as great as it is during a calm, and if it is possible to raise 
these air currents to any degree and create a calm, then we 
are conserving the moisture to some extent at least. By planting 
evergreens of certain kinds we can have groves, or even 
forests, that will break up the sweep of the winds, and thus 
do much toward saving the moisture in the ground. Another 
thing, the snow which falls in the winter, instead of being 
immediately evaporated by the sun or swept away by the 
winds, can be saved. So instead of trying to change the conditions 
we must endeavor to meet them. It used to be said 
that the rainbelt followed the plow, but I want to say that 
the rain don't care a snap for the plow. A man may follow 
the plow, but he can't make a rain storm follow it. I am very 
thankful we have these delegates here from Washington looking 
into this matter to see what we need, and I hope the government 
will take hold of the work. We have plenty of land 
lying waste and a rich government, and there is no reason 
why we should not have an appropriation for tree planting. 
We need it. Our friends down east get heavy appropriations 
for the improvement of their harbors, etc. We don't care 
about having any harbors for ironclads. What would build 
one single ironclad would be a splendid appropriation for 
this great inland country, and that is what we want. Let us 
urge this matter upon our representatives in Congress and do 
everything we can to keep the subject before the minds of the 
people. 

Governor Furnas — We understand that we havegood honest 
representatives in Congress, but we believe that it is the 
duty of the government, with its scientific departments, to 
make surveys so that we would know about what amount of 
money would need to be expended to secure a supply of water. 
You have been engaged in this matter in different parts of 
the country, and can give some sort of a guess as to whether 
there is a subterranean supply of water and whether it can </seg>

            <seg id="p138">
GOVEBNMENT ESTABLISHMENT OF FORESTS. 

137 

be obtained and utilized for agricultural purposes. If we 
can say to the people that you gentlemen have been out here 
and investigated this matter thoroughly, and as scientific 
men believe that there is a subterranean supply of water 
which can be used, then we can go out with a reasonable degree 
of assurance that something can be accomplished. 

Govbenob Savage — This is a question which I have given 
a great deal of thought since I have been living in this 
country and trying to raise some crops and trees. When I 
came into this country twenty-three years ago, the people occupying 
it at that time told me that it would never become 
an agricultural country; that it was an excellent grazing 
country. As this was the principal occupation of those people 
at that time, I thought they were making those statements 
simply for the purpose of keeping us sod turners (as they 
called us) out. As the gentleman over here stated, it used to 
be said that the rain was following the plow; that as the country 
became settled, the land cultivated, and trees planted, 
the rain belt would gradually extend farther west and wipe 
out the great American desert that many of us saw on our 
maps and atlases when we were at school. I believed that 
theory, and settled ninety miles north of here, but have gradually 
changed my mind since that time. I have become satisfied 
that this country was never intended, in its natural 
state, for a white man to attempt to make a living in by agricultural 
pursuits. 

I have also studied this subject of which the gentleman has 
been speaking, that is, the conservation of the water that 
flows past us and goes ultimately into the Gulf of Mexico. I 
believe that some day, by a system of reservoirs or something 
of that kind, those waters will be kept and utilized by us poor 
people living in this country, at just such times as we 
are now having and just such times as we are liable 
to have any year. I believe, as my friend Governor 
Furnas says, that it is the duty of the government to do that. 
While he was lucky enough to get a piece of land in the east- </seg>

era part of this state, where the natural rainfall is sufficient 
for agricultural purposes, he paid probably about tlie 
same price that I paid for mine out here. He was more fortunate 
than I. Now, I believe he expresses the wish of many 
people in this country when he says he is willing to remunerate 
me to some extent for the mistake I have made in trying 
to farm in this country. 

Governor Furnas — Not your mistake, but the mistake of 
the government. 

Governor Savage— I guess the government did not know 
as much about it then as they do now. I have had some experience 
in irrigation. The gentleman from Washington says 
that one hundred and sixty acres have been irrigated by a 
single artesian well. I don't know what size artesian well or 
what size of pipe he would use for that purpose. I have used 
"ft'ater for irrigating purposes, and I know that a stream that 
¦would flow through an eight inch pipe would not cover an 
acre iu a day. I don't believe there ever was an artesian well 
made that would irrigate twenty acres of this country. I 
have turned a stream of water that could not run through an 
eight inch pipe on to an alfalfa field and let it run for twentyfour 
hours, and it would not extend as far as across the 
street. I have no faith in irrigating to any extent by 
artesian wells, but I do believe that reservoirs can be built 
by the government (not by individuals) to store up this 
water that is running by and going to waste, so that it can 
be utilized in such a manner as to supply a population that 
will cover, say one-tenth of this country. But I believe it 
is the duty of the government to do that, and I have it from 
very good authority that there is going to be a long pull and 
a strong pull from this part of the country to have the next 
Congress make provision for that purpose. 

My friend over there asked a question a few minutes ago 
in regard to the increase of rainfall. That has been answered, 
I believe, but I should like to answer a little further, if yon 
will pardon me. It is a well-known fact — perhaps not with </seg>


            <seg id="p140">
139 

these scientific gentlemen, but with us common farmers— 
that there is but one way of producing rainfall, my friend the 
Governor to the contrary notwithstanding; that is by capillary 
attraction, evaporation, and condensation by a colder 
wave of atmosphere. It is also a fact that the same amount 
of rain fell four hundred or four thousand years ago, over the 
surface of the United States and the surface of the earth that 
falls to-day. No more, no less. The only difference is that 
the air currents carry the moisture from one place to another, 
and when it comes in contact with a cold wave condensation 
takes place. No electricity, no tree planting, no sod turning, 
or anything else has ever produced one inch more rainfall 
than was produced four thousand years ago. The same 
amount of heat produces the same amount of evaporation 
from the same surface to-day that it did in all time past and 
will produce the same in all time to come. We have the same 
amount of water on the face of the globe to-day, I believe to 
a drop, that we had the day after the flood ; no more, no less. 
We have the same surface to evaporate from, the same 
amount of heat from the sun to evaporate it. 

Governor Furnas — While it is true that there has been no 
perceptible change in the amount of rainfall in the last fortyfive 
or forty-six years, yet conditions have changed so that 
the rainfall has been utilized. Cultivated land contains 
eleven times more rainfall than the undisturbed prairie, and 
as the country has been broken up and cultivated the rainfall 
has been utilized and become more evenly distributed. You 
have had more rainfall in the western part of the state and 
we have had less in the eastern portion than in the early 
days. We have suffered as much, if not more, from the 
drought this year in those river counties which have always 
been relied upon, than you have in the western portion of the 
state. We used to have what we called the June rise of the 
Missouri river. The rain that came in the early part of the 
season ran off into the Missouri, but we don't have that any 
more, from the fact that the land has been broken up and 
the soil retains the moisture. </seg>

Speaking of that matter of irrigation, it is true, as the 
governor says, that when the land is very dry it requires an 
immense amount of water to soak it up, but I think that he 
will find that after the land has been thoroughly filled with 
water, the same amount that would be required to irrigate 
forty acres the first time would irrigate one hundred and 
sixty acres, and do it better. 

SThe President — We have with us Dr. Bessey, and I am 
re we shall all be glad to hear a word from him. 

Dr. Bessey — I shall say just a word now because I have a 
paper to-night, and there are others here who ought to speak. 
All I want to say at present is just aword in regard to the possibility 
of growing trees or forests in this region that begins 
some place here and runs to the westward and north-westward, 
where trees are scarce at the present time, and where 
in my judgment, trees can be grown. Ever since I have been 
in Nebraska, it has seemed a curious thing to me that we 
have this odd country that we call the sandhill country. I 
am not certain as to how it originated, not yet certain as to 
what the sandhills used to be, but I am very sanguine of this, 
that the time is coming when in the sandhill country of Nebraska 
we shall have very considerable bodies of timber 
growing. I have an idea, although I am not absolutely certain 
of it, that there were trees abundantly scattered over the 
sandhills once. When they were destroyed (this is speculation, 
of course) I can not tell, but I do not believe they were 
destroyed so very long ago, because every little while you will 
find odd trees here and there so widely separated from other 
trees as to be explainable only on the theory that there were 
once considerable bodies of timber, and that largely pine. 

Now I do hope that out of all this stir in regard to the 
planting, the preservation, and regeneration of the forests, — 
I do hope that out of all this will come something useful. 
As to whether or not it will be possible to have considerable 
areas of our sandhill country a timber country, perhaps I 
mav sneak strain later in the meetine </seg>

GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENT OF FORESTS. 

141 

Mr. Hall of the forestry bureau will tell us what the present 
intentions of this bureau are. I do not know whether 
anybody is going to tell us about the experiment made some 
nine or ten years ago, up in a portion of the sandhills in Holt 
county, where 1 think, nine years ago, pine trees of various 
species were planted in a small body, and where to-day there 
are trees fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen feet high, 
of that planting. Mr. Hall has been there and will doubtless 
tell this audience just how large those trees are. If, on a 
small patch of sandhill country, — a patch, as I understand, 
not more than 100 feet one way by 200 the other, — we can 
grow pine trees in such a short time to such a height it 
seems to me it does indicate that it is possible to have great 
forests on our sandhills. Why would it not be a good thing 
to have reservations in what is now a treeless country, to be 
used by the government for putting out trees and have bodies 
of forests which shall be managed for the benefit of the com 
munities in which they are located. 

Mr. Clothier — It gives me pleasure to observe the interest 
manifested here in regard to tree planting in Nebraska. Although 
I am not as well acquainted with your conditions as 
some of the speakers entertained here this afternoon, yet I 
can say that I do believe trees ought to be grown in many 
parts of your state where the people believe they can not be 
grown. Last summer I made quite an extensive tour over 
the western portion of your state. I found that people who 
had been planting "timber claims," as they called them, had 
generally given up the idea of attempting to grow timber in 
that country. I would specify one locality in particular; 
that on the Sidney table land, north of the town of. Sidney. 
I found there nothing but stumps remaining of the most of 
the forest plantings. But on looking into this question a little 
more deeply than the mere surface I have made up my 
mind that the greatest reason for failure In those things was 
that they had used the wrong kind of troes in the early plantings. 
People used the trees that could be grow most easily </seg>

            <seg id="p143">
142 


from seed, generally box elder, maple, and such as those, eottomvood 
from cuttings, sometimes willow. These trees are all 
adapted to growing near water or on deep river bottom soil. 
and are not at all suitable for those high upland prairies. 
The result was disappointment; and the country has not yet 
recovered from the effect of misplaced confidence the people 
had on the subject of tree growing. You have native trees in 
your own state and you ought to encourage your nurserymen 
to propagate those native trees. I will mention only two or 
three of them. Dr. Bessey mentioned the pines, then there 
are the cedars, probably two or three kinds, I don't know how 
many, that ought to be grown in this country. Taking up the 
broad-leaved trees there is the hackberry. Ask a nurseryman 
if he can furnish you a hundred thousand hackberries, and 
he will look at you in astonishment, and say, "Nobody ever 
asked us to furnish hackberry. We don't have any call for 
hackberry." Yet the hackberry is the hardiest tree you have 
It makes a dense shade, is equal to the elm as an ornamental 
tree, and certainly ought to be propagated and planted. I 
will mention also the honey locust, which will stand the arid 
conditions and will probably be successful at least two-thirds 
of the way across the state. I would not trust it too far 
north. Then there is the Russian mulberry, a tree which will 
stand drouth and hard conditions and make an excellent post. 
The Russian olive is one of the most beautiful ornamental 
trees and hardy any place you please to plant it. These 
trees can be propagated by the millions, and the farmers 
ought to give the nurserymen encouragement to propagate 
them. 

Governor Savage — I should like to ask the gentleman if 
there are not some other trees which will grow equally in the 
western part of the state, for instance the ash, the red and 
white elms. I speak of this for fear these people will get 
the impression that he has mentioned all the trees which he 
thinks will do well in this part of the country. 

Mr. Clothier — I would add the trees which Governor </seg>


            <seg id="p144">
143 

Savage has named. I did not assume to name the whole list. 
The two elms are excellent trees to plant, and so is the ash. 
I would have to get my list before I could say how many more. 
I have found probably a dozen or fifteen good native trees 
growing in this part of the country. 

Mb. Youxgers — Did you find any native timber growing 
up on that high land north of Sidney. 

Mr. Clothier — Not on the high land. 

Me. Youngers — Still farther up on the high land they have 
native pines growing up among the rocks where it does not 
seem possible that they could grow. The honey locust has 
given as good satisfaction wherever sent, throughout the 
state, as any trees we have sent out. The elm and ash are also 
universally successful wherever they have been given attention. 


Another thing I should like to speak of is the matter of 
irrigation. The Governor said he did not believe it was possible 
to irrigate any considerable quantity of ground from 
artesian wells. In making our orchard plant in Colorado, 
we estimated one inch of water under pressure to an acre of 
land; that is, we used one hundred and sixty inches of water 
on the land when we planted the orchard. But after the 
land had been irrigated some four years, we reduced the 
amount of water until we used only about thirty inches foi 
one hundred and twelve acres planted solid trees, about sixteen 
feet apart; and since then the amount has been reduced 
from year to ye. r. </seg>

ADDRESS. 

By Robert W. Fubnas, Brownville, Neb. 

Me. President — I was assigned no subject for this meeting 
and did not expect to make a speech. It was my understanding 
that I was simply invited here to meet these gentlemen 
from Washington and make their acquaintance, 
which I have been pleased to do. The matters they have in 
hand are important ones, and those to which I have given a 
great deal of thought and have tried to do the best I could to 
advance them in practical work. How I have succeeded 
would probably be better told by some one else than myself. 

I scarcely know what to say as I did not give a moment's 
thought to any subject upon which to speak on this occasion. 
But I wish to say that we are encountering a good many more 
ills and discouragements in later years than when we first 
commenced raising fruit in Nebraska. When we first presented 
our fruits to the world at Chicago, Washington, Kichmond, 
Va., and Boston, Mass., they carried off nearly all of 
the premiums offered on the varieties we had on exhibition. 
We had the very best specimens which could be selected, 
and our trees were young, just producing their first crops, 
which could not be beaten anywhere in the world. We have 
been careless, however, and are suffering the consequences. 
I think we have not paid the attention we should have done 
to our trees. We have neglected them until insect pests 
have taken possession of a great many orchards. I know 
they have taken possession of mine and those in my neighborhood, 
and we find we have a great job on our hands now 
that we have found our enemies — twig blight and insects. I 
struggled a good while before I became a convert to spraying, 
but since that time I have been doing a good deal of it and 
with good results. I commence spraying with Bordeaux, before 
there is any sign of leaf or blossom, give my trees two 
sprflvinirs with this before anvthin &lt;r comes in sight. X then </seg>

            <seg id="p146">
145 


add Paris green to the Bordeaux after the blossom is entirely 
gone. There must be no spraying while apple trees are in 
bloom. I think the fruit is often destroyed by burning the 
blossoms with Paris green or other poisons; hence we advocate 
letting them entirely alone until the blossom is gone; 
then spray. I have become a convert to dust spraying instead 
of liquid for several reasons. In the first place it takes 
less time and money, and I think answers the purpose better. 
The dust spray is so fine that it adheres to the leaf, fruit, and 
everything there is about the tree. You have the same preparation 
and know all this just as well as I do. I think the 
Bordeaux imparts a healthy condition to the trees. I believe 
that I have done away with all the blight in my pear trees 
simply by using the Bordeaux. I am using nothing else and 
there is no blight on them to-day ; at least I have not seen any. 

I repeat that we have all of these enemies which are very 
difficult to contend with, and I frankly confess that they are 
so bad with me and in my neighborhood that I have felt 
greatly discouraged. I said the other day, if I was a 
young man starting in this work again, I did not know 
whether, with the experience I have had with insect pests, 
I would feel like engaging in fruit culture or not. But I 
love it; my friends! I love to plant a tree. I love to take 
care of it and show what can be done with it. My love for 
fruit trees and other trees had led me a great deal more 
into fruit culture than profits. Of course I finally went into 
i t extensively, with the feeling that I was not obliged to do it 
for a living. But I have made some money out of fruit culture. 
I can look back to the time when we used to get f 1 for 
a ten pound basket of grapes. That beats eighteen cents. 
And we got f4 a bushel for peaches, which beats the present 
price of f 1. I believe, however, that there is more money in 
apples at twenty-five cents per bushel than in any other crop 
yt-u caii put on an acre of land in Nebraska. Hence I am not 
disposed to throw up the sponge. I expect to still find a corner 
in which to plant a few trees as long as I live. So I say </seg>


            <seg id="p147">

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

in regard to fruit culture, that notwithstanding all these 
back-sets and unfavorable conditions, I still have faith 
enough in it to warrant me in devoting the balance of my 
life to fruit culture and the raising of trees. I do that because 
I love it. I think it is more ennobling than anything 
else in which we can engage. In fact, this applies to all that 
we obtain from the soil. I think that as we engage in the culture 
of fruit or any of the soil products, that we come closer 
to the author of all, and have more sublime feeling and rec 
ognition of the power that has created us and given us an 
interest in all these things, than any other vocation in which 
we can engage. 

I repeat that I have made no preparation for this talk, and 
have therefore been going about as I please. I feel greatly interested, 
however, in the work in which these gentlemen from 
Washington are engaged, and can frankly say that these are 
matters to which I have given much thought and particular 
attention. I am glad these gentlemen are here. I am glad 
to meet them. Am glad to know they are engaged in this 
to look after certain interests in which we are all interested, 
especially in the western portion of the state. I had a little 
discussion with my friend here on my right, when I told him 
that there was not an acre of land in Nebraska but that 
would be worth more and produce more in every respect, if 
it was irrigated. Notwithstanding the fact that we get rains 
down in the river counties, produce splendid crops, and make 
money on our farms and all that, yet there is not an acre 
but that would be more productive and more valuable if it 
could be irrigated. Give us the scientific investigation of 
these matters and then let us know the result of these investigations. 
I think the sentiment of every man, woman, and 
child in Nebraska is that if you will tell us what to do we 
will go to work and do it. We will give the delegation from 
Nebraska to understand, whatever their political faith and 
in whatever portion of the state they reside, that there is 
work for them to do in that line and that they will not be 
representing their constituents unless they do something. </seg>

Me. Harrison — Can you raise peaches as well as in the 
early days? 

Governor Furnas — Yes, sir, better. The peach is, I believe, 
a more regular crop in the last six or ten years than 
before. I came here forty-five years ago, and you could not 
raise any kind of fruit here then, if you took people's word 
for it My idea upon that subject was that you could not 
raise fruit unless you planted trees, and those who planted 
realized in due time. Occasionally we got a crop of peaches 
in the early days, perhaps one year in four. I need not say 
to the gentlemen engaged in orcharding that the peach crop 
has got to be quite an important one. I shall have more 
peaches this year than ever before and one reason is that I 
have more trees. I am quite discouraged this year with the 
blackberry. It ripens at a season of the year that we are 
liable to have excessively hot weather, such as we are having 
now, and the berries are simply cooked on the bushes. I do 
not think I shall plant any more blackberries. 

Mr. Miller — I should like to ask the Governor to explain 
the dust spray. 

Governor Furnas — I have a little machine to which I attach 
a tube which will reach to the top of the highest trees. 
It works a little wheel like a windmill, which throws the 
dust spray so fine that you can scarcely see it. 

Mr. Miller — What kind of poison do you use? 

Governor Furnas — Just the same as with the ordinary 
liquid spray, Bordeaux with Paris green in it. I think it 
takes hold much better. When yon throw liquid on the tree 
it runs all over everything and you are apt to get too much, 
while with the dust you can get just exactly the amount that 
you want. I have had better success with the dust spray 
than with the other. 

Mr. Christy — With the dust spray you use poison mixed 
with slacked lime? 

Governor Furnas — Yes, sir, I should have said that the 
•lust used is diluted with lime, ordinary road dust, or flour. </seg>

            <seg id="p149">
148 


The President — About what per cent? 
Governor Furnas — About half and half. 

Mr. Harrison — Does it stick to the leaves and twigs? 

Governor Furnas — Yes, sir; there is enough moisture in 
the green leaves at any time to hold all the dust spray you 
will need. 

Mr. Stevens — How much dust will be required to spray 
one hundred trees, say twenty years of age? 

Governor Furnas — It is put up in twenty pound boxes. 
I think my man told me that one pound with the addition 
of the dilution would spray one hundred trees. 

Mr. McIntosh — It is only fair to myself to explain that 
the difference which the Governor mentioned as existing 
between himself and me was only the difference between 
tweedle-de and tweedle-dum. It was merely as to whether 
irrigation would pay on any old thing. The claim that I 
made was that on certain poor land it was not worth while 
to irrigate for common farm purposes; that it was of doubtful 
propriety to irrigate land when the increased production 
would not pay the cost of applying the water; for instance, 
I claimed that it would not be profitable to add the extra expense 
of $4 or $ 5 an acre to irrigate a corn crop.

THE INVESTIGATION NOW BEING MADE IN NE 
BRASKA BY THE U. S. BUREAU OP FORESTRY. 

A PAPER BEAD BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 
SOCIETY, KEAKNEY, NEB., JULY 17, 18, 1901. 

By Wm. L. Hall, Supt. op Tree Planting, U. S. Dept. of 

Agriculture. 

The forest investigation now in process in Nebraska 
consists of a study of the planted and natural timber. It is 
a part of the general study of forest encroachment on the 
plains — a subject demanding investigation over at least 
twelve states of the Middle West. 

The planted timber is being studied to find not only 
what thrives best in different sections of the state, but what 
is most valuable for the various purposes for which planting 
is done. Before complete success can be regularly attained 
in growing timber it must be known what kinds of trees are 
most valuable for such common purposes as shads, wind 
breaks, and fence posts, and how fast they will grow in a 
given locality. It is equally necessary to understand the 
methods of planting and cultivation by which planted timber 
can be made in the greatest degree profitable and permanent. 


The natural timber is being studied to find what species 
occur, to what extent timber is increasing, and the conditions 
under which the increase takes place. So far as possible, 
these questions are being studied in all parts of the state. 
The eastern half offers the most attractive field because there 
the natural timber is more abundant, the country has been 
longer settled so that more information is obtainable, and the 
natural tendencies seem to exert themselves more strongly. 
But the study of these questions over the western half of the 
state is more important at this time because their solution 
for that region will throw light on the utilization of a large </seg>

            <seg id="p151">
150 


part of the non-agricultural government land in that part 
of Nebraska. So in the western half of the state the investigation 
will be prosecuted with the greatest possible detail. 

The work is done chiefly by observation. I am sometimes 
asked whether on not we make chemical analysis of soils to 
determine whether trees will grow. We do not. The elements 
of fertility are present in such quantity in all soils 
of the state as to insure the successful growth of trees. The 
chemical composition of a soil, then, is not a very important 
factor in tree growth in this region. There are, however, 
other agencies of vital importance, and these we study very 
closely. 

Fire, soil, moisture, wind, heat, and animals are the natural 
agencies that influence most strongly the growth and distribution 
of trees in this region. Fire has been the most 
important of agencies in determining the original distribution 
of the forest. Dr. Bessey argues with great force that 
fire has been the sole cause of large areas of the state being 
prairie instead of forest. This much is certain : Since 
the settlement of the country with the consequent prevention 
of fires, many thousand acres of prairie land along 
streams and ravines have naturally become covered by tim 
ber. At the present time fire is a matter of only local im 
portance. Soil is important, not on account of its chemical 
composition, but because of its physical condition. Ti 
thrive best on porous soils where their roots can penetrate 
the ground deeply. The loess and sandy soils of Nebraska 
are very favorable to trees for this reason. Water is the limiting 
factor of many species of forest trees in this region. The 
eastern species extend westward to the point where the moisture 
is not equal to their requirements, and there they stop. 
The western species extend eastward to the point where the 
moisture is too great and there find their limit. Moisture is to 
a great degree the limiting agency of both eastern and western 
species. In its influence upon trees the moisture of the 
atmosphere is almost as important as the moisture of the </seg>

            <seg id="p152">
151 


soil. Wind and heat are important only because they inten 
sify the moisture conditions. While acting indirectly, their 
influence is often so powerful as to cause trees to fail where 
they would otherwise succeed. Many of the canyons along 
the Loup river have an excellent growth of timber in spots 
protected from wind and intense heat, while exposed spots 
are barren. Animals keep young forest trees eaten off and 
the ground so trampled that seeds do not germinate. In the 
eastern part of the state where the land is not pastured, the 
forests are spreading; where it is pastured they are at a 
standstill. The effect of pasturage is not so noticeable upon 
planted timber because stock is often not admitted to the 
groves until the trees are too large to be destroyed. But the 
effect upon reproduction is as fatal in planted as in natural 
timber. Since reproduction can not take place, no plantation 
can be permanent if regularly pastured. 

The agencies just mentioned are receiving close study in 
this summer's investigation. They act differently upon the 
different species of trees, and on this account the problem 
is very intricate. But because trees are affected differently 
by such agencies as soil, water, wind, and grazing, it may be 
possible to find for every section of the state species that will 
thrive and even become valuable timber. 

That indicates the primary object of the investigation. 
We want to find out whether there are forest trees which 
will make a profitable growth in western Nebraska. There 
are over 10,000,000 acres of government land in the state. 
Nearly all of it is unfit for farming, and at least a third of it 
is poor grazing land. The part unfit for farming and grazing 
belongs to two classes. One class consists of very broken 
clay land in the western part of the state; the other cla»» 
consists of almost pure sand in the sandhill region. The clay 
land originally held a scant growth of rock pine f Pinus ponderosa 
scopulorum), and red cedar. Very little of the timber 
remains now, but the fact that it once grew is proof positive 
that it will grow again if given an opportunity. The </seg>

            <seg id="p153">
152 


sandhills, so far as our knowledge goes, have not been timbered. 
Their adaptability to trees must, therefore, be studied 
from general conditions and from planting done since the 
settlement of the country. We have one case of pines flourishing 
with great vigor under typical sandhill conditions. 
In the spring of 1890 the U. S. Department of Agriculture 
sent a large number of pines for planting on the sandhills 
in the southwest part of Holt county. One of the worst possible 
locations was chosen. The land being too sandy to admit 
of plowing, the trees were set in furrows run through 
the sod. Not a stroke of cultivation has been given since. 
The plantation contains four species, Scotch, Austrian, rock, 
and Banksian pine. The Scotch and Austrian pines are from 
6 to 8 feet high, the rock pine from 4 to 6 feet, and the Banksian 
pine from 12 to 18 feet. The trees are now entering 
upon their period of greatest growth. Their thrift indicates 
complete adaptability to the situation, and unless burned out 
they will certainly attain suitable size for lumbering. The 
conclusion forces itself that the species which are adapted 
to that location will grow on hundreds of thousands of acres 
in the sandhills where the natural conditions are precisely 
the same. 

The forestry party will give especial attention to that portion 
of the government land in the state which is not well 
adapted to farming or grazing and will bring together every 
bit of obtainable information on its adaptability to forest 
growth, and on means of foresting it in case it is adapted to 

If it is found that portions of this land can be forested 
economically with valuable timber, certainly all will agree 
that it should be done. Timber is the great want of the Middle 
West. A forest in western Nebraska would be of incalculable 
value to the entire region. It would reclaim areas 
which can never be reclaimed in any other way, and would 
make them as valuable, acre for acre, as any other land in the 
West </seg>

FORESTRY INVESTIGATION IN NEBRASKA. 

This work can not be done quickly. It will require many 
years. But it can be started soon; and the sooner, 
the better. It is a work of too long duration to be adapted 
to indivilual or even corporate enterprise. If done at all it 
must be by the state or general government. Several im 
portant considerations seem to mark it as preeminently the 
work of the national government. First, the government 
owns the land. Second, the government has already the organization 
both to carry on the necessary scientific research 
and to administer the work. Third, the government has already 
a forest reserve system covering 46 million acres. 
These forest lands are protected and kept under a system of 
culture or management in order to supply the needs of the 
people for lumber and fuel. It has been announced as the 
policy of the government to bring under such protection and 
culture all government lands, wholly or in part covered by 
forest, that are more valuable for forest than for other uses, 
and to do this as rapidly as possible. 

But that system, perfectly as it may be carried out, can 
never supply timber for a treeless region like western Nebraska. 
There the timber must be established. It must be 
planted. It would mean but a slight extension of its work 
and would be thoroughly in harmony with its present jm&gt;Ii' 
for the government to take up forest planting on land such 
as has been described. With its present attitude toward development, 
and especially toward forest management, it is 
not likely that the government would decline to establish a 
reserve for forest planting in western Nebraska, 

If a favorable report results from the investigation now 
in progress, it will furnish a basis on which to claim government 
activities along this line. With such a report the 
people of Nebraska can, through their congressional delegation 
and by direct petition, almost certainly move the government 
to begin this work. At the next session of Congress 
the question of government aid in the irrigation of western </seg>

            <seg id="p155">
154 


be among the states chiefly interested. With the question of 
irrigation the question of forest planting should be considered. 


The question of forest planting in the western part of the 
state is not a new one. It has been advocated by distinguished 
members of this Society for a number of year*. 
But the possibility of starting a forest in that region has 
been thought so uncertain, the undertaking so stupendous, 
and the means of bringing about the movement so limited 
that the matter each time has begun and ended with dis 
cussion. If the work can be done at all, the following reasons 
mark this year as the opportune time to begin. 

1. Before a year some provision will in all probability be 
made for a general classification of the semi-arid lands belonging 
to the government. Irrigable lands will be held for 
irrigation development, and the remainder sold or leased in 
large tracts for grazing purposes. Thus will pass the opportunity 
for reclaiming in the most useful way the land 
capable of forestation. 

2. With the irrigation of larger areas of western land 
will come the need of more timber in those regions for fuel 
and lumber and for the beneficial influences of forest growth 
uin:n climatic conditions. 

3. Just now the American forestry system is in its formative 
stage. If western planting is to form an integral 
part of this system its claims for recognition must be 
brought forward at once. 

4. The sentiment of the American people has turned 
so favorably toward forestry in the last few years that those 
states which are giving most attention to it are being looked 
upon with favor as places for stable investments. Land is 
most valuable in those states where a proper proportion is 
maintained between woodland and farming land. If a million 
acres of Nebraska sandhills were forested not only the 
land covered would be reclaimed but the value of every acre 
of land in the state would be increased </seg>

DISCUSSION. 

Prop. Burnett — I hesitate to open the discussion when 
there are so many men here who have spent years in the 
study of these questions. Yet I am vitally interested in the 
subject, and it seems to me that the points presented in the 
paper deserve our careful consideration. I think we ought 
not to let this occasion pass without thoroughly discussing 
the matter, and endorsing some movement that will bring 
about the results indicated in the paper. We are all interested 
in the development of the state; we are interested in 
increasing the value of any area which can be planted to 
trees, and it is a well-known fact that no agency except the 
general government is great enough to undertake this work. 
If we allow this opportunity to go by, so favorable an opportunity 
will not again be presented. If these lands go into 
the hands of individuals they can not be made valuable — not 
specially valuable. Individuals at present rent the lands 
for a few cents an acre ; the general government gets a little 
revenue, and a few individuals get some benefit. But if the 
commonwealth of Nebraska is to be benefited by these lands, 
it seems to me that some considerable portion of them should 
be set aside for this work ; and it is time enough for them to 
go into the hands of individuals when the government has 
demonstrated that they can not be held practically for forestation. 
I hope this meeting will endorse some movement 
to bring political influence to bear to set this work on foot. 

Rev. Harrison — This matter comes up at a very opportune 
moment. When we take into consideration the experience 
we have had in this country in the last thirty years and the 
results that have been accomplished, it is plain to see that we 
have been working along the wrong lines. We have never 
had anything like this before. The way is pretty clear now, 
and the question is whether congressional appropriations 
can be had for this work. I have thought a great deal about 
the matter and the idea that comes to me uppermost is this : </seg>

            <seg id="p157">
156 


To interest every state in the Union ; and instead of the government 
selling any more timber land, hold every acre of it 
and let it belong to the people but be under the care of the 
government. Never sell another acre, but put it under scientific 
forestry supervision, and let them carry on the lumber 
business in an economical manner. In this way it will be 
possible to save the forests; but if something is not done we 
are going to lose them. It would not be fair for the general 
government to give Minnesota a large tract of land worth 
several million dollars and do nothing for the prairie states, 
and I don't know that the prairie states would be willing to 
vote for any such thing. There are large areas that are not 
used and that ought to be saved, because the destruction of 
the forests is something absolutely appalling. Fires get out 
and destroy hundreds of acres. In Minnesota I think something 
is being done; I understand they have forest wardens 
whose business it is, among other things, to see that the fires 
are kept out. Another thing. Down in the Appalachian 
range an effort is being made to have the government set 
aside a large tract there in Tennessee, Kentucky, and North 
Carolina for a great national park. Large areas are being 
reserved in Colorado, Montana, and all of the mountain 
states, and it is hardly fair for the government to set aside 
these immense areas and leave Nebraska out in the cold. 
Sooner or later an appeal will be made to Congress to do 
something for all these states that have no forests, and timber 
planting laws will be created. It is the province of the government 
to create those laws, and yet something should be 
done along state lines. Parks and forests should be established. 
In the valleys we have gigantic forests, and on the 
divides we can raise evergreens. That little experiment up in 
Holt county demonstrates that the sandhills can be utilized, 
and that fruit and other trees can be grown there. Individuals 
can not do this, so I think we shall come to this proposition 
sooner or later : Our congressmen will be given to understand 
that we want a bill providing that every state shall have </seg>

            <seg id="p158">
157 


all the land they have reserved as parks and forests, the same 
to be supervised by the government. This may not affect the 
eastern states, because Massachusetts has a large forest preserve 
of her own ; so also has Pennsylvania and a great many 
of those eastern states, but they have had large appropriations 
for harbor improvements, etc., and we have had nothing. 
And mark it : At a time when everything was at a very 
low ebb ; at a time when everything was going down hill, and 
darkness and depression were all over the land, the first impetus 
came from the tremendous crops sent in by Kansas and 
Nebraska. The United States is under great obligations to 
these prairie states that helped to save the day and bring the 
return of prosperity. We ought to be recognized. We know 
ourselves that we are tremendously good, but we want the 
world to know it and the United States to recognize it 
(Applause.) 

Mr. W. L. Hand— I should like to ask Mr. Hall about a 
matter that has been discussed somewhat here in Nebraska ; 
that is, what may be done by the establishment of small reservoirs, 
or ponds and pools, by cutting off the draws? It frequently 
is the case that a draw is at the bottom of quite an 
extensive watershed — perhaps several hundred acres — and 
when we have heavy rains (as we do have occasionally in the 
spring time) the water flows off the watersheds into the 
draws. The question has been considered whether dams 
might not be built across these draws to catch the water from 
the sheds, thus forming ponds or small lakes. I should like 
to ask Sir. Hall whether this question has received attention 
at the hands of this commission, and whether they deem it 
practical to aid the foresting of the state by ponds created in 
this manner? 

Mr. Hall — I will say in regard to that, that I think it is 
considered generally that the reservoir system would be best 
carried out by the establishment of the largest reservoirs possible, 
the people applying for government assistance to establish 
reservoirs in the leading irrigation districts for the stor- </seg>

            <seg id="p159">
158 


age of large quantities of water, and then supplement that 
bj a system of local reservoirs in other places. The small 
reservoirs would not only add that much to the water supply, 
but would add somewhat to the humidity of the atmosphere, 
and I believe would have a very considerable influence in 
changing the conditions of the atmosphere so as to make 
them more favorable. The relation between this and forestry 
is very close. If a system of reservoirs should be established 
in the West on the lines I have mentioned, we should find 
very great losses by evaporation. The winds coming in from 
the southwest during such periods as we have had recently 
cause the evaporation of almost an inch of water in twentyfour 
hours. This is a tremendous loss, and so far as possible 
should be prevented. With the establishment of reservoirs 
there will undoubtedly be necessary the planting of 
timber along the shores for wind-breaks. It has been demonstrated 
that the wind very greatly increases the evaporation, 
both from the soil and from open water surface, and 
the planting of timber and the construction of reservoirs 
should undoubtedly be carried on together. 

Governor Fuunas — I think we are all agreed that we have 
had a very strong presentation by Mr. Hall of a practical 
matter in which we are all deeply interested. We might talk 
about this question all day probably, and there would be no 
difference of opinion. This Society has what we term a legislative 
committee, and I move that this question presented 
by Mr. Hall be referred to that committee and that they be 
requested to make a report drawn with more consideration 
than we are able to give it under the impulse of this moment. 

Mr. Barnard — I move that as an amendment the paper 
read by Mr. Hall be heartily approved by this Society. 

The amendment was accepted and the resolution unanimously 
adopted. 

Governor Furnas — I came here forty-six years ago when 
this country was characterized as the "Great American Desert" 
and took hold of it with a great deal of enthusiasm. My </seg>


            <seg id="p160">
159 

experiments have cost me a great deal of money, and I felt 
a little sore over an article that appeared not long since to the 
effect that myself and two others, who have been enthusiastic 
advocates of tree planting, had misled the people of this 
territory and state at the cost of many thousands of dollars 
by advocating what was not practical and could not be done. 
I have this to say: That we have grown up since that time, 
and that all prophecies have been more than fulfilled; but the 
man or set of men that starts out for experiment from an individual 
standpoint is going to find it expensive, and is going 
to make a great many mistakes. I have made many mistakes 
in planting both forest and fruit trees, but I think somebody 
has got the benefit of that work. I think I have been benefited 
in that experiment and am not sorry I made it; but I 
confess I was a little sore when I was accused, with others, 
of misleading the people in such a way that many thousands 
of dollars had been thrown away which ought not to have 
been. When I came here the country was new and very 
little was known of it; it was characterized as the "Great 
American Desert ;" and I want to say to you that it required 
nerve on the part of those who came here in the early day 
to take hold of this country and endeavor to make something 
out of it. I am proud of the results that have grown 
out of the work of the early pioneers. This young state ia 
to-day a giant without comparison, considering the length 
of time that has been occupied in its development. The results 
are absolutely without precedent. There has never before 
been such work accomplished in such a length of time 
in any country as has been accomplished in Nebraska since 
the white man succeeded the Indian in 1854, and I repeat 
that I am proud of it. (Applause.), </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

PARKS. 

A PAPEB BEAD BEFORE THE STATE HOBTICULTUBAL SOCIETY AT 

By C. S. Harrison, Pres. Neb. Park and Forest Assn. 

Within the last half centnry our modern park system has 
been created. It has a short, well-crowded history and a 
tremendous future. Something had been done by individuals, 
but public grounds for the people had hardly been a 
dream. 

There is an idea afloat in the air that people have an inalienable 
right to land, air, and water. The park gives this 
right; for it belongs to young and old, rich and poor. One 
eighteenth of the area of twenty-two of our largest cities is 
thus given to the public. High art in a crowded metropolis 
drives us back to nature. People are thus educated to love 
the country, and we hope the time is not far off when telephones 
and motor cars will give the country an attraction 
which will thin out the cities. 

Most towns have a great pride in their parks. They should 
be more attractive than the public buildings. Worcester, 
Mass., has ten of them. One is on an eminence, overlooking 
the whole city. 

Men of public spirit and wealth often leave large sums to 
be expended for their fellow townsmen. Mr. Flynt, of Monson, 
Mass. ; Mr. Hubbard, of Meriden, Conn., have left splendid 
gifts for the people, Keney, of Hartford, Conn., left a 
princely gift of nearly a section of land, and money to improve 
it This is in the care of my old friend Parker, formerly 
gardener of the Old Colony R. R. 

O. B. Hadwin, of Worcester, with his own hands, planted 
many of the trees that grace the beautiful city, and I think 
that he has donated one of the ten parks. The whole park 
business is growing. The nation is waking up as never before, 
and immense tracts are set aside for the public. 

KEARNEY, NEBRASKA. </seg>


            <seg id="p162">

The amount of money laid out in public grounds is amazing. 
The common and public grounds of Boston are worth 
more than a quarter of a billion. New York and Chicago 
have magnificent systems also. Every city, town, or village 
should have a place of public resort, adorned with the highest 
skill and finest taste. In no state is there greater need 
than our own. 

When a piece of land is secured the next thing of importance 
is to secure competent park commissioners. 

Here is where a radical mistake is made which will often 
take years to rectify. Men are often chosen because of political 
relations, or on account of friendship, or because they 
are good fellows. If competent men are needed anywhere, 
who have a thorough acquaintance with horticulture and 
the adaptation of plants and trees to our climate, they are 
needed here. 

Our climate is trying. Books can teach us but little. 
Nothing but hard experience can be our guide. As well 
choose a man for the supreme bench because he is a fair 
school master as to choose a park commissioner because he 
stands well in society and is a good and popular man. Without 
a long experience the man can not know how to buy, 
what to plant, or how to plant. He steps into a position 
which should only be gained by years of closest study and 
experience. 

However, the commissioner may be a business man and 
have a place as general manager, and a superintendent who 
is an expert may be chosen to do the work. One who knows 
how can plant and care for a park with much less expense 
than one who must feel his way every step. 

As a state we are in a raw condition when men without 
experience are placed where the most thorough knowledge 
is required.

PLAN OF A PARK. 

If a piece of land can be secured which has a native forest, 
that should be preserved intact. You can have paths winding 
in and out amid these native groups, but leave nature 
to do her best There is a fad now on the run and that is, 
a park should always be an imitation of some section of the 
adjacent country, only native trees and plants, and every 
foreigner ruled out. This is a very short-lived and narrow 
conception. It is raging just now among leading landscape 
gardeners. It may do now and then, but as a system it is too 
small, and people will find it out. While one section of the 
grounds may imitate nature we should look further and plan 
on a wider scale. 

A park should be an educator. There is no better place to 
teach children than among a large collection of thrifty growing 
plants, flowers, and trees. 

As fast as means can be secured, every tree that can be 
made to grow, every flower that can be made to bloom, 
should be planted and cared for. Even in our trying climate 
we can have a succession of bloom, so that there will not be 
a day when there will not be something to enliven the scene. 

I would have a large collection of lilacs. There are 130 
kinds now in cultivation. I have raised forty of them in 
Nebraska, and I think the whole family will do well. What 
could be finer than a large clump of these? The tree lilacs 
of Japan and China in the center, next to them those of 
strong growth, and next the dwarfs, and in your clump a 
succession of bloom from May to July. Every one should 
be labeled, and they should be planted far enough apart so 
that they will be accessible. 

Then I would have a clump of Syringas. These are hardy, 
and are free bloomers. There are over a dozen varieties, 
differing in habit of growth and time of blooming. 

The Spireaa give us another very interesting family. 
There is the Argutea, a very early bloomer, giving us a </seg>

            <seg id="p164">
163 


mound of snow. Then we have the bridal wreath, then that 
wholesale bloomer Van Houtii. Many others come in. The 
giand Opulifolia Billiardi Douglassi, and then the rear is 
brought up by the Dumnsa of the Rockies. 

I am growing eighteen kinds of evergreens, and by judicious 
planting these can all be made to grow, and many 
other kinds also. 

There should be in every park in the state a full colh 
of native trees, shrubs, and flowers. Our Nebraska flora is 
not as meager as at first view it would seem. 

We have in the East trees and shrubs which belong to the 
East, and on the West mam- of the trees and shrubs of the 
Rockies. I believe we have four kinds of evergreens, red 
cedar, silver cedar, Pinus ponderosa, and if we do not have 
the Black Hills spruce, it certainly comes down very near 
us. We have one of the most beautiful types of mulberry. 
Some growing on the islands of the Platte have a body much 
like the moose maple of Pennsylvania, with highly ornamented 
leaves. Oaks grow fifty miles west of the 100th meridian, 
and all told we have quite a collection which should 
have a section in each park. 

Again, if the ground is undulating or hilly, there should 
be a section of the Rocky mountains. There are twelve kinds 
of evergreens, and most of them under fair conditions would 
do well with us. Some of them we know are well adapted 
to our hot plains. 

FLOWEKS. 

Hardy perennials only should be used. There is economy 
in having plants that will be permanent. Gladiolas, callas, 
and dahlias are too much trouble, and do not endure the 
hot winds as well as perennials. Rhododendrons and azalias, 
which are the glory of the East, are entirely worthless in 
Nebraska. But we have, queen of flowers, fragrant and 
lovely as the rose, hardy as an oak, which will do for a substitute. 
The peony of to-day is a modern production. It </seg>

            <seg id="p165">
164 


is the triumph of floriculture. Only a few years ago we had 
but twenty-five kinds, and now over 2,000. The time of 
blooming covers about six weeks. First come tulips with 
their gorgeous beauty. Before they are through the columbines 
come in, then the peonies, after these the phloxes, 
which with care extend their blossoms from June to November. 


LAYING OUT THE GROUNDS. 

This is an important matter, and a competent landscape 
gardener should be secured, and yet, judged from common 
standards, even men of renown do make blunders. At Newburyport, 
Mass., nature planned one of the finest prospects, 
rising and beautifully sloping grounds. Now the gospel of 
landscape art is, plant for your neighbors, and for the passerby. 
Have beautiful vistas open from the roadway. The 
old English method is, build a high brick wall and shut 
everything in. Perhaps it was the absence of brick. Next 
to the road masses of willow were planted, to shut out the 
view, and then the gi-ounds were planted mostly to Golden 
Syringa8, giving the place a most monotonous appearance. 
Some gardeners carry nursery stock, some buy of a Cheap 
John, and it looked as if a big job lot was dumped on these 
beautiful grounds. We have in our state men of excellent 
taste who can be relied on. We would not fear to trust our 
Hadkinson, or Mr. Craig, of Omaha. 

As a general thing, we do not believe in much trimming, 
and yet when one has visited the Italian gardens of H. H. 
Hunnewell, Wellesley, he is impressed with th» possibilities 
of art as applied to nature, and if the park is large enough 
there might be a few examples of fine topiary work. We 
have at Fairmount, this state, as fine an artist in this line 
as you will find anywhere. Mr. F. F. Robbins has taken the 
Platte Cedar, which will stand more shearing than any tree 
we have. One tree is trimmed into a mammoth lantern, another 
is cut in the form of a large gravy dish, one is a perfect </seg>

            <seg id="p166">
165 


globe, another is a cone, and one tree is to represent a watch 
dog. This work can be done only in the open, for if you trim 
trees growing in the shade the limbs die. 

While individuals, cities, villages, and communities 
should do what they can, our state should take deep interest 
in the matter, and have a large park system. 

If you note carefully you will find that in our great valleys 
trees grow to an enormous size in a short time and seem 
very healthy. Instinctively the tree will go quite a distance 
for water, and when it can be found at from 10 to 20 feet 
from the surface it makes but little difference whether it is 
wet or dry, it will grow, anyway. 

In the valleys of the Platte, the Loup, Elkhorn, and Republican, 
there might be delightful parks and splendid forests 
of giant trees. 

Evergreens will do well on the divides. These, with ash 
and honey locust, which resist the drouth, together with the 
Russian olive, would do well east of the 100th meridian, and 
perhaps 50 miles west. 

. As to the plains of western Nebraska, we doubt not that 
with care large areas can be redeemed. The brown, silver, 
and Platte cedars, the pinon and ponderosa pines would be 
all we could ask for. With one-fourth of our great state a 
desolation something should soon be done. Other states own 
fine parks, why should Nebraska be without? Others have 
forests already grown, we must create them. We have three 
states in one, the Eastern, Central, and Western, and each 
requires a distinct system. I have no doubt that even large 
sections of the plains can be redeemed, and that parks and 
groves will yet take the place of sameness and bareness. </seg>

INSECTS IN THEIR RELATION TO FOREST TREES. 

By Lawrence Bbuner. 

Trees stand at the head of the vegetable kingdom just as 
man does at the top among the animal life of the earth. It 
naturally follows, then, that the welfare of trees is a very 
important matter to us. In their magnificence they are subject 
to the attacks of hosts of enemies, both vegetable and 
animal. In the study of trees when gathered in large bodies 
or forests a very important feature is that connected with 
these enemies of various kinds which attack them. Most 
important among such enemies to be considered are the insects. 
In their attacks upon the various kinds of vegetation 
which go to make up forests, insects affect these in their 
root, trunk, branches, limbs, twigs, leaves, buds, blossoms, 
fruits, and seeds. They also affect them as seedlings, as saplings, 
and as old and fully matured plants. Not only is this 
true with reference to the insects as affecting the different 
kinds of forest vegetation while they are alive and standing 
in place, but also in death and after they have dropped to 
the earth or have been removed from the forest and sawed 
into lumber or worked up into the various articles of commerce 
and for such other purposes for which wood is used. 

In their modes of attack upon trees insects vary greatly 
one from the other, hence each kind must be studied sep- 

rately if we would be most successful in dealing with them, 
b. .ne of them do harm by devouring the tissues of the portions 
attacked, while others work havoc by sucking the 
juices or sap from the particular parts infested. Still others 
of these enemies by their presence and irritations cause dis 
tortions of the portions attacked, or produce unnatural 
growths upon them which are known as galls. Among the 
forms which attack the main body, or trunks, of trees we 
find some which work only in the heart-wood, others which 
confine their attention to the sap-wood, and still others </seg>

            <seg id="p168">
167 


which find it most convenient for their own welfare to remain 
and work within the bark or between it and the sapwood. 
Likewise, when we find them working as enemies of 
trees by attacking the branches, limbs, or twigs, a great diversity 
of methods of attack are to be met with. Even when 
the leaves are the point that suffers, a like diversity as to 
method and portions attacked exists, for we find forms that 
confine their attention to either the one or the other side, or 
it may be to the mid-rib or to the interior of the leaf itself. 
The same can also be said with reference to the buds, s* • 
or fruits. 

In the study of Forest Entomology, or insects in their relation 
to tree growth when grown collectively in forests, we 
learn of them as enemies which may be either primary or 
secondary in their effects. We also learn of certain insects 
which, on account of their peculiar modes of life, are beneficial 
to tree growth, some directly, others indirectly. Each 
of these features, of course, will require considerable separate 
attention in order that we may include all of the distinct 
kinds or species concerned. But for the present paper 
comparatively little more can be done than the giving of a 
brief outline or statement of these various and distinct topics 
that must necessarily receive attention from the forester. 

The very great importance which attaches to the subject 
of insect enemies of trees can be imagined when we take into 
consideration the large number of species which are directly 
or indirectly engaged in their attacks upon each kind of tree. 
As an example of the immense numbers of such forms that 
may attack trees, we may simply refer to those attacking the 
apple tree in this country. By going over the writings of 
various entomologists, horticulturists, nurserymen, fruitgrowers, 
and other persons who are interested in this tree 
and its fruit, we find a list of more than four hundred distinct 
kinds of such enemies already recorded, with additions 
which are being made each year. Those attacking the oaks </seg>

            <seg id="p169">
168 


species, while the conifers are already known to be preyed 
upon by something like five or six hundred, and the cottonwoods 
and willows shelter and furnish food to between three 
and five hundreds of species. Other trees are known to be 
equally molested by similar numbers of insects. 

It is needless to state that comparatively few species 
among this great host of forms found attacking each tree 
are to be considered as specially harmful when working 
alone. Notwithstanding this comparative harmlessness of 
each of the remaining forms when considered singly, they 
are of sufficient importance when considered collectively to 
make their destruction desirable if we would grow trees 
with the utmost success. 

Ordinarily when coming into a new and unsettled country 
it is found that a fairly even balance exists between the 
different kinds of life both animal and vegetable. This has 
resulted from the carrying out of a carefully planned law 
which governs the Universe. But seldom is there observed 
in such regions any great devastation of either plant or animal 
life, at any rate not above what conditions will stand 
without materially disturbing the balance as it exists. In 
the course of a few years after the advent of man, the highly 
civilized creature that he is, matters soon change, and we 
quickly have instead one after another of the forms gaining 
the ascendency to such an extent that frequently dire harm 
results to others. This state of affairs is due to both careless 
and thoughtless interference with Nature's laws when 
they should be carefully observed and let alone. 

With this knowledge at hand it is quite natural, then, to 
expect trees which are planted in a new region more or less 
destitute of this class of vegetation, to be attacked and injured 
by certain forms of insect pests, forms that were al 
ready in the country in small numbers and eking out a 
precarious existence upon the few dwarfed and scattered 
trees which barely continued to keep alive. This new and 
ample supply of nourishing food, and the absence of a suffi </seg>


            <seg id="p170">
169 

cient army of the natural enemies to keep them in bounds, 
soon permits of their increasing in hurtful numbers. It 
now becomes quite a problem to re-establish and maintain 
the required equilibrium between the beneficial and destructive 
forms spoken of above. That we may be able to control 
conditions such as these, we should study what we find in 
nature about us and take hints from what we observe. As 
a branch of forestry we must study the relationship of insects 
to trees, together with the effects of climate, location, 
and various natural enemies of both trees and the insects 
which are known to affect them in divers ways. By doing 
this we will be able to obtain the best results from our own 
plantings and from the natural growths of the country about 

While a good-sized book might be written concerning the 
insect enemies of a single species of tree, as indicated above, 
in the present paper I shall do no more than refer to a few 
of the most important groups of these creatures, and this 
only in a general way. To attempt a complete life-history 
of any one of the important kinds, or even of those that are 
of less importance, would require the use of several pages of 
space that might be given up to more entertaining matter, 
if not to more useful knowledge to your readers. 

During the short history of our country the injuries that 
have resulted to our timber interests as a direct result of 
insect attack would amount to many millions of dollars; 
and even now with the advent of each successive year we hear 
of additional ravages to our remaining forests that are 
alarming in their magnitude. From time to time we hear 
of the almost complete destruction of entire forests, the 
trees being killed and rendered almost valueless for many 
purposes, and this the result of the attack of some single 
species of insect. Even now I call to mind a case of this 
kind. There is at present going on in the Black Hills of 
South Dakota the destruction of vast tracts of pine timber 
by an insect known popularly as the Black Hills Pine Bark- </seg>

beetle. While this insect has been at work for only a few 
years — not more than five or six — the results are already 
several millions of dollars' worth of timber destroyed, and 
the probabilities of at least that much more going in the 
same way before the matter can be remedied. 

Insects may be considered destructive in proportion as 
their attacks prove fatal to the trees attacked by them. 
Those which simply feed upon the leaves are not considered 
so destructive in their direct effects upon the trees attacked 
as are those that bore into the trunk and branches, nor as 
those that work between the wood and bark in such a manner 
as to cut off the flow of sap. True, the continued defoliation 
of a tree causes it finally to die. Even one stripping of the 
foliage from a tree weakens it to such an extent that sometimes 
other insects find a proper lodging place, and in turn 
do injuries which may cause the death of the tree thus attacked. 
Thus, a comparatively harmless insect in itself may 
be the indirect means of causing a tree's death by fitting it 
for the attacks of a second species. 

Nature has favored some kinds of insects much more than 
others. Such favored forms are accordingly much better 
prepared to hold their own in the struggle for existence. 
Some of them have been provided with natural means for 
protecting themselves against the ordinary vertebrate and 
invertebrate enemies which attack and destroy the less fortunate 
forms not so protected. These natural means of protection 
are usually in the form of glands for secreting offensive 
odors, repulsive fluids, etc. ; or in the presence of 
bristles, thorns, and other surface adornments or coverings. 
Other species are protected in their larval stage by the utilization 
of their excreta for constructing coverings or cases 
within which they live with comparative safety. A large 
majority of the insects mentioned in this paper are of the 
favored kinds, being either exceptionally well protected in 
one way or another from their enemies, or else they are 
capable of withstanding great diversities of climate. </seg>

The principal primary enemies of trees belong to the following 
groups : 

1. Beetles, which may be divided into several families, 
the most destructive being the Bark Borers, the Flat-headed 
Borers, and the Round-headed Borers, after which follow 
the Leaf Beetles, or defoliators. 

2. Butterflies and Moths, or rather their caterpillars. 
Among the moths there are forms known as "borers," "leaffeeders," 
and "leaf-miners." Some of these feed in colonies, 
while others are solitary in their habits. Naturally, the 
forms that feed in colonies are to be dreaded more than those 
which are scattered about indiscriminately over the foliage. 
The wood-borers are more destructive in proportion to their 
numbers than are others of the caterpillars. A few of these 
boring caterpillars are comparatively large and construct 
burrows fully one-half inch in diameter and a foot or more 
in length through solid oak and others of our hardest woods. 
A single borer may be the cause for death in a tree attacked 
by it. Leaf-feeding caterpillars when feeding in colonies 
very frequently completely defoliate a tree in a few days. 
While a single defoliation will not kill the tree as suggested 
above, it renders it a fit subject for attack from various 
kinds of boring insects. The leaf-miners, too, are occasionally 
sufficiently numerous to cause the entire foliage to wilt 
and drop, when the result is the same as defoliation from 
other causes. Sickly trees are most frequently attacked by 
the Bark beetles and a few of the other kinds of boring insects 
already mentioned. 

3. Saw-flies and Gall-flies. Following quite closely, 
and with somewhat similar habits to those of the butterflies 
and moths, are the larger saw-flies. The larvae, or grubs, 
of many of these also feed openly upon the foliage, some 
collectively, others singly, and affect the tree in a similar 
manner with the preceding class. Others of these insects 
inhabit galls within which they feed. These galls are formed 
on the leaves and twigs and are of special forms for the dif- </seg>

            <seg id="p173">

ferent species of the flies. The true gall-flies, however, are 
representatives of several distinct families, and with few 
exceptions cause the plants upon which they work to produce 
typical galls, or growths, within which the insects live 
and feed. These galls occur upon various portions of the 
tree attacked, as, for example, the twigs, buds, leaves, and 
even on the blossoms or fruit stems, in some instances. When 
these galls are at all numerous they must certainly result in 
materially affecting the vitality of the tree upon which they 
occur. The result is an inducement for other kinds of insects 
to take up their abode and further reduce the vitality 
and even to cause the death of such trees. 

4. Plant-lice and Leaf-hoppers. All the insects referred 
to under the preceding headings are mandibulate, 
that is, they are provided with jaws and devour portions of 
the tree's tissues. The insects included in the present 
group, instead of being furnished with a pair of jaws, are 
fitted with a jointed beak through which they suck the sap 
or juices from the portions attacked. The group includes 
quite a large array of forms like the scale insects, the softbodied 
plant-lice or aphids, the jumping plant-lice, the leafhoppers, 
tree-hoppers, and cicades. Taken as a whole, these 
sucking insect enemies of trees show a great diversity in 
methods of attack. Some of them feed openly upon the 
leaves or twigs, others within folds or even galls upon the 
leaves or twigs, which modifications of parts in the plants 
attacked are the result of the presence and irritations resulting 
from the workings of these insects. Some even attack 
the roots beneath the surface. It is needless to state that, 
when these sucking insects are present in large numbers, 
the effects upon the trees are, in many cases, outright killing, 
while in others weakening to such an extent as to attract 
some of the other classes enumerated above. 

5. True Flies. Lastly, it is a well-established fact that 
even some of the true flies and their relatives in the form of 
gall-making gnats also take quite an active part in the de- </seg>

            <seg id="p174">
173 


struction of certain species of our trees. These, like the 
gall-making insects mentioned under No. 3, affect the tree 
in a similar manner. A few flies are also known to attack 
trees as leaf-miners. 

Many of the insect enemies of trees are secondary in their 
attacks, only following after others which take the lead in 
starting them on the downward road towards death and a 
return to dust These, therefore, are of less direct importance 
than others which, on account of their habits, may be 
called primary enemies. It has also been learned that sickly 
or debilitated trees are more apt to be attacked by certain 
classes of insects than are healthy and thrifty ones. These 
latter insects may also be considered as secondary. 

A tree may become debilitated from various climatic 
causes, such as frost, hail, lack or excess of moisture, windstorms, 
etc., or it may be brought about by transplanting, 
poor cultivation, bruises, fires, and other similar agencies. 
It may also be brought about by repeated defoliations as a 
result of leaf-attacking fungi or the feeding of insects or 
other animal forms, or from the extraction of sap by various 
kinds of plant-lice, leaf-hoppers, etc., — anything, in fact, 
that injures the vitality and retards or stops its growth. 
The insects that attack trees of this class, while causing 
great losses, are usually not nearly so much to be dreaded 
as those which attack thrifty and healthy ones. They are 
more closely related to the secondary than to the primary 
enemies. 

The secondary enemies are much more numerous in species 
than are the primary ones, but notwithstanding thin 
fact, much harm and financial loss results from their combined 
attacks. 

Not only do the various insects which bore into the trunks, 
branches, limbs, and roots of trees cause direct damage by 
cutting off the flow of sap and weakening the portions attacked, 
thereby rendering the wood more or less valueless 
for many purposes, but they are instrumental in giving en- </seg>

            <seg id="p175">
174 


trance into these parts to various species of fungi, which 
quickly rot the wood and cause a still further deterioration 
in its value. 

By the agency of certain species of insects and fungi, trees 
are made hollow while the outside portions may remain ap 
parently as healthy as ever. A few trees of this class in a 
region are desirable, since they furnish retreats and nesting 
places for friendly birds and beasts, but large numbers of 
them render a forest comparatively valueless .to the lumberer. 
Such insects as ants, termites, and many beetles not 
genuine borers are chiefly concerned in this sort of work. 

Certain other insects, although they do not attack trees 
in any way, are of direct interest in connection with the 
subject of forestry. On account of their mode of life many 
species of flies, mosquitoes, gnats, fleas, and similar insects 
become indirectly harmful by attacking laborers while engaged 
in logging, wood-cutting, road building, and other 
legitimate forestry work. 

Insects of certain kinds may be either injurious or beneficial 
in their relation to trees according to circumstances. 
For example, an insect that feeds upon the pulp of, to man, 
edible fruits may be considered harmful as a destroyer of 
the fruit, but beneficial as a liberator of the seeds in order 
that the latter may reach the earth or some other place 
where growth can take place. 

Aside from being either directly harmful or directly beneficial, 
insects may be indirectly so. 

An insect may be directly and decidedly beneficial by 
carrying the pollen from the blossoms of one tree to those 
of another; by assisting in the grinding up of decay ing 
leaves and burying them where their substance can be utilized 
as plant food; by assisting in the removal of dead and 
dying limbs so as to give smooth and symmetrical trunks 
to young and growing trees. Likewise, it may be indirectly 
beneficial by supplying certain useful birds with animal food 
and thus enticing them to where they will be of greatest direct 
benefit to the trees. </seg>

While it might be interesting for the reader to have some 
of the various insects referred to here re-described and figured, 
the writer would prefer to call his attention to what 
has been published in the past. In former reports there 
have been treated more or less fully the commoner species 
which attack young trees growing on tree-claims, on farms, 
and others growing in cities and parks for ornamental purposes 
and for shade. Much the same forms which are concerned 
in injuring the above-mentioned trees are also instrumental 
in attacking our forests. 

The foregoing hints as to the various kinds of insects and 
the different conditions under which, and manners in which 
they attack trees is all right so far as it goes, but it is not 
enough. In order to be of practical value forest entomology 
must be carried on in such a manner as to be able to suggest 
methods of preventing much of this injury to our forests by 
insect pests. In fact, most of the studies as already pursued 
in this country have been principally with this end in view. 
True, much time has also been devoted to the collection and 
listing of the various species attacking special trees, and in 
the attempt to learn the life history of each. These points 
are quite as necessary as the others. In fact, they are absolutely 
necessary in all cases as a preliminary measure towards 
the suggestion of remedies, since these latter must 
be applied in accordance with the mode of life and manner 
of attack of the enemy. Remedies may be described as either 
natural or artificial. 

Natural remedies are usually self-working and are not 
under the direct control of man. They consist of climatic 
conditions, as heat, cold, humidity, and drouth; of beneficial 
insects in the form of parasites and predacious species be^ 
longing to a number of distinct types; of spiders, scorpions, 
and mites and their allies; of the vertebrate animals that 
habitually or incidentally feed to a greater or less extent 
upon the insect life as it exists in the region where they 
happen to be, such, for example, as birds, reptiles, batrach- </seg>

            <seg id="p177">
176 


ians, and some of the smaller mammals. We may also add 
to all of the above-named certain of the lower plants which 
habitually attack and destroy a comparatively large number 
of insects annually. 

Artificial remedies are such as man can suggest and bring 
into practice as aids to the natural checks mentioned above. 
These may include the use of various kinds of sprays, torches, 
and other mechanical methods which can be brought to bear 
in reducing the numbers of any particular insect when attacking 
certaip trees in the street, in parks, on farms, along 
the roadside, or in the forest. Such methods as may prevent 
the laying of eggs upon fallen timber while in the log, 
when it has been sawed into lumber, or even after the lumber 
has been utilized in buildings, vessels, or manufactured 
into various articles of commerce. Remedies of this kind 
often suggest themselves to the persons most concerned at 
the time. At all times these remedies should be made after 
taking into consideration the nature of the attacks and the 
habits of the insect to be dealt with. They must also be applied 
so as to conform with the most practical modes of logging 
and lumbering in the region under treatment. </seg>

WHAT CAN WE DO FOR OUR OLD ORCHARDS? 

By E. F. Stephens, Crete, Neb. 

We frequently hear the complaint that the older orchards 
of the state are not now as productive as ten years ago. 
Many of us come from New England and the Eastern Middle 
states where apple trees might be expected to bear fruit for 
from sixty to one hundred years. Relative to the age of 
those orchards Nebraska can hardly yet be said to have old 
orchards. 

Under our peculiar and trying conditions our orchards 
are old at the age of twenty-five to thirty years. Not infrequently 
our orchards are in decline at the age of twenty 
years. How can we handle these orchards in a way to continue 
their usefulness as long as possible and to secure additional 
profitable crops before their condition is such as to 
compel removal? 

Years ago some of the leading commercial orchardists of 
Iowa planted the apple no more than 12 ,to 14 feet apart in 
the row ; the rows 25 to 30 feet apart This, in the expectation 
that the planter would have nerve enough to thin out 
at least alternate trees as soon as their presence was detrimental 
to those remaining. Many orchards in our state 
have been planted 12J x 25, 14 x 28, 20 x 20; comparatively 
few of the orchards of the state have been planted as 
far apart as 28 x 28 or 30 x 30. At 20 x 20, 108 trees are 
planted per acre. At 14 x 28, the distance we have used 
in most of our commercial orchard work, 111 trees per acre. 
There is some advantage in close planting in rows north 
and south that the trees may help to shelter each other in 
our climate where we are likely to have occasional violent 
wind-storms. Twenty-nine years ago our first orchard of 
twenty acres was planted 12£ x 25, 138 trees per acre. 
Subsequent plantings were usually 14 x 28, sections of the 
orchard were blocks of nursery stock turned into orchards </seg>

            <seg id="p199">
198 


by cutting out superfluous trees. These orchards carried 
yet more trees per acre. We have one young orchard 
planted 14 x 14, with early bearing varieties, like the 
Duchess and Missouri Pippin, as fillers. In planting these 
orchards we were confident we should remove alternate 
trees north and south and in the 14 x 14 orchards ultimately 
both in time to prevent the alternate trees, termed 
fillers, before they did harm to the permanent trees. We 
regret to state that, like many others, we were greedy and 
did not heed the warning of our orchard foreman. Having 
lived in this orchard fifteen years, and carefully noting the 
conditions from season to season, Mr. Walker realized the 
importance of thinning the orchard earlier than I did. My 
confidence rested on our ability to conserve moisture by frequent 
culture. We had hoped to so cultivate them as to 
maintain the needed moisture a year or two longer. We 
have had sections of orchard closely planted which yielded 
at the rate of over 1,000 bushels per acre and this was a 
strong influence in the direction of close planting and later 
removal. 

During the '80's well-cared-for orchards through eastern 
Nebraska gave more satisfactory returns than during the 
last five or six years. With increasing age, breadth of 
branches, more widely developed root system, trees have 
been needing and seeking more moisture. Roots have in 
terlocked; sub-soils have been exhausted of soil moisture; 
all the trees have suffered together. The trees that were to 
remain as permanent trees have suffered equally with those 
which were intended for removal. We are now reluctantly 
compelled to admit that no system of soil culture can retain 
moisture enough to secure the most fruitful conditions with 
trees planted 14 x 28 after the age of twenty years, and 
perhaps not longer than twelve to fourteen years, depending 
on the character of the soil, seasonable rainfall, and the 
character and frequency of cultivation. In some of the 
older orchards suffering from the lack of sufficient moisture </seg>


            <seg id="p200">
199 

we have had the additional complications of fungus diseases 
of the foliage. Apparently these fungus diseases are 
more likely to secure a foothold in crowded orchards suffering 
from lack of soil moisture and lack of full and free 
ventilation. 

For the last five years we have been engaged in orcharding 
under irrigation and have noticed that as far west as 
Lincoln county, in large orchards, apple trees planted four 
years ago last spring yielded 1} measured bushels from 
single trees, and peach trees planted at the same time 
yielded two bushels. Orchards planted on sub-irrigated 
lands, that is, in valley lands where the underlying water 
is no more than five to eight feet below the surface, are yielding 
fruit of most excellent quality, of the largest size, and 
most brilliant coloring. Now, it can not be that the climate 
of Kearney, Phelps, Dawson, and Lincoln counties 
can be any more favorable than the climate of the eastern 
third of Nebraska, and in attempting to account for the superior 
productiveness of orchards having the benefit of all 
the moisture they can make use of, we can on)y conclude 
that the factor of first importance which they have is ample 
soil moisture, and that there are times when orchards not 
under irrigation have less soil moisture than they require. 
In Lincoln county, Ben Davis apple trees have yielded a 
barrel from single trees at the age of seven years, and tw». 
barrels from single trees at the age of eight years from 
planting. Although eastern Nebraska has raised some phenomenal 
crops of apples, we are evidently unable to secure 
as many bushels of apples from single trees at as early an 
age as trees produce where they have the benefit of all the 
moisture they require. Under these conditions what can 
we do for our orchards in the eastern third of the state? 
Perhaps some light may be thrown on this subject by chance 
bits of experience noted in the handling of our own orchards. 

Ten years ago we remember a row of Winesap apple trees 
across the west orchard, trees planted 12$ x 20. The </seg>

            <seg id="p201">
200 


entire row averaged 8 bushels per tree. The end tree gave 
21 bushels of hand-picked apples, windfalls were estimated 
at 3 bushels. Here we have a yield of almost three times 
as many bushels from the end tree, apparently to be explained 
only by the fact that the end tree had unlimited air, 
sunlight, and room for root growth. This row of trees had 
been planted about 15 years. In the south central orchard 
we had Winesap apple trees at the age of 15 years planted 
12 x 20 feet, that is, nursery blocks turned into orchards, 
yielding more than 8 bushels per tree for the entire rows, 
but this exhaustive crop followed by very dry seasons so 
injured the vitality of the trees that for the last five years 
these trees have yielded but little. We remember a row of 
Plum Cider in the orchard north of the stable where it wax 
very convenient to haul out stable manure, when the ground 
was so wet that it was not practicable to haul it to the more 
distant orchards, and this row of trees, receiving a liberal 
application of stable litter acting in a twofold manner as ¦ 
mulch and by leaching, enriching the ground, gave three 
surprising crops in succession. These trees in a closely 
planted orchard 12^ x 20 feet yielded in three successive 
years 8, 9, and 10 bushels per tree, an annual average production 
of more than 1,500 bushels per acre. In the year 
1886 we cleared out all the stockyards and sheep yards in 
and about the city of Crete, hauling out 3,000 loads of manure. 
Careful observation showed that this manure was 
still giving marked results 8 years later. It was particularly 
noticeable in the very dry season of 1894, that to the 
last load and to the last forkful where the loads were spread 
the beneficial effects of this manure could yet be noted in 
the stronger growth of vegetation and the ability to withstand 
the extremely trying drouth of that season. At another 
time careful comparison of adjoining rows of the same 
varieties of apple in our south orchard conclusively showed 
an increased yield of apples in one season, amounting to f 1 
a load for manure. The beneficial results of manure were </seg>


            <seg id="p202">
201 

not exhausted in one season, but continued for a series of 
years. At this moment we have three teams hauling manure 
3i miles to apply on the surface of vineyards 
and orchards. We have purchased all the straw obtainable 
within a reasonable distance, paying 50 cents a load for it, 
and hauling it 2 to 4 miles. 

We are at this time removing one-half of the trees and in 
some orchards more than half in all of our older orchards, 
and now that the spirit of destruction is aroused, Mr. 
Walker is hoping that the cutting out may not stop until 
the ten-year-old orchard is thinned. 

A careful comparison of the behavior of orchards in the 
east third of the state, not receiving irrigation, and in many 
cases not receiving sufficient culture, in the behavior of orchards 
under sub-irrigation and under ditch irrigation, 
leads to the conclusion that most of the orchards in the east 
third of the state are suffering from a lack of soil moisture. 

South of Kearney on sub-irrigated land, we this fall found 
an old orchard, the trees supplied by Major Pearman of Nebraska 
City, away back in the days when the Major was running 
a nursery at that point, We think this orchard must 
be at least twenty-five to thirty years old. It is a little west 
of old Fort Kearney on one of the oldest farms in that district. 
Here we found the largest Jonathan apples we have 
ever seen, 10f inches in circumference and with the most 
magnificent coloring. Immense Ben Davis and beautiful 
Winesaps. I could not help contrasting the large size and excellent 
coloring of these apples with the fruit raised the same 
season in our own orchards. We feel compelled to believe 
that if our farmers and orchardists should first thin orchards 
above fifteen years of age, until no more than 50 or 60 trees 
per acre remain; secondly, judiciously trim the remaining 
trees; third, haul out stable manure and mulch the remaining 
trees at the rate of one-half two-horse wagon load to 
each tree, and when the manure is exhausted apply old straw 
stacks as a mulch eight to ten feet in width of the entire </seg>

row, planning to keep under cultivation the spaces between 
the mulched rows; fourth, cultivate between May 20 and 
July 25 the remainder of the ground once a week, alternating 
with pulverizer or steel harrow or using any implement 
that will maintain such state of culture as will retain the 
major portion of the natural moisture. 

Our extensive commercial orchard interests reaching from 
near Plattsmouth on the east to some 350 miles west has 
compelled careful study of orchard conditions, and we are 
now confident that our failing orchards in the eastern portion 
of the state are suffering more than any other thing 
from lack of moisture. That the judicious use of ample applications 
of stable litter and superfluous straw stacks applied 
to old apple orchards in bearing, also a vigorous sys 
tem of cultivation, coupled with the determined warfare on 
our insect enemies, will again make our orchards productive 
and financially profitable. Perhaps I may be allowed to 
suggest that seasoned apple tree wood makes most excellent 
fuel and some of our orchards have a great many wagon 
loads to spare. 

SOME OF THE COMMON DISEASES OF FRUIT 
TREES. 

By P. J. O'Gara. 

The discussion of this paper, which deals with some of 
the common diseases of fruit trees, will be taken up under 
three general heads: 1, Causes leading to disease; 2, Fungous 
diseases resulting from injuries; 3, Remedies and preventives. 

CAUSES LEADING TO DISEASE. 

The causes which prepare the way for entrance of detuctive 
fungi are so numerous that it would be out of place 
attempt to enumerate and discuss them all in a short </seg>

paper like this. We may classify the causes which ultimately 
lead to decay as follows: 1, Mechanical injuries; 2, 
injuries due to animals; 3, injuries due to insects; 4, injuries 
due to atmospheric conditions; 5, unfavorable soil 
conditions. 

Mechanical Injuries. — Under mechanical injuries come 
pruning, grafting, and budding, injury to roots by too deep 
plowing, chafing of limbs and branches, twisting and breaking 
of branches by winds, and injuries due to hail. Pruning, 
if done in a loose, careless way, is one of the most fruitful 
sources to which the subsequent decay of trees may be 
traced. This is especially true when the wounds must of 
necessity be large. Grafting and budding are extremely 
dangerous operations, and the nurseryman can not exercise 
too much care if he wishes to be successful in keeping out 
disease. I have seen a number of young trees whose early 
decay was due entirely to careless grafting. Deep plowing, 
if done at the wrong time, may prove fatal to an orchard, 
in that it injures the roots which come near the surface. 
Many cases of "root-rot" may be traced to this sort of injury. 
Doubtless wind and hail cause a great deal of damage, but, 
while they are outside of our control, we should repair the 
injury done as soon as possible. 

Animal Injuuies. — The injuries due to animals are not 
unlike mechanical injuries. The most common are gnawing 
of the bark by mice and rabbits, breaking of branches by 
cattle, and injury to roots by burrowing animals. All these 
are, however, quite under our control. 

Insect Injuries. — Among insect enemies which injure the 
bark and wood in such a manner as to open the way to the 
entrance of fungi are the girdlers, borers, snout-beetles, etc. 
There are many insects, however, which, though harmless 
in themselves, carry on their feet and bodies the spores of 
wood-destroying fungi. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance 
that we employ all valuable remedies for keeping </seg>

Unfavorable Atmospheric Conditions. — In this western 
country unfavorable atmospheric conditions count for a good 
deal in shortening the life of our fruit trees. Drouth lowers 
the vitality of a tree which, if not killed directly, is always 
susceptible to the attacks of fungi. Extreme cold is also 
disastrous. "Sun scald," which is due to rapid changes between 
a low and a high temperature, has a killing effect on 
parts of the tree so situated as to get the direct rays of the 
sun. It is this freezing and thawing which finally results 
in the death of the cambium layer. Absence or lack of sufficient 
light is always injurious. A tree with too many 
branches shades itself to such an extent that many of the 
internal and lower branches are killed. 

Unfavorable Soil Conditions. — Among unfavorable soil 
conditions are hard soil, barren soil, soil which is too wet, 
and soil which contains too great a percentage of certain 
salts. Since locality and soil conditions determine, to a very 
great extent, the growth of an orchard, their importance 
should not be overlooked. 

FUNGOUS DISEASES RESULTING FROM INJURY. 

Two very common fungous diseases which obtain a foothold 
on fruit trees and result in their complete destruction 
are root-rot and heart-rot. 

Root-rot. — One of the most dangerous diseases I have met 
with is the root-rot, which is caused by two species of brown 
toadstool (Anaillaria mellea) and (Clitocybe parasitica 
(?) ). These fungi attack peach, apple, and cherry trees 
alike, completely destroying all the roots, and even passing 
up some distance into the heart-wood. In one orchard that 
I visited I found apple trees not more than fifteen or eighteen 
years old which were completely destroyed. I was able 
to uproot some of the trees by simply throwing my weight 
against them. 

How These Fungi Get a Foothold. — These fungi are 
well provided with means to insure rapid distribution over </seg>

SOME COMMON DISEASES OF FRUIT TREES. 

a large area. Spores are produced in large numbers and 
scattered about by winds and carried from place to place 
by insects. Each spore, under proper conditions, may give 
rise to threads (mycelium) which will readily enter an injured 
root or crown. These threads not only enter the tree 
and destroy it, but also branch out in all directions through 
the soil, seeking, as it were, for more trees to prey upon. 
From this it is easily seen that a single tree may contain 
inate a whole orchard. The part which appears above the 
ground on the crown of the tree is the fruit (sporophore) of 
the fungus, and its appearance is an indication that the parasite 
has been at work for some time, and that the tree is 
doomed. It is high time to remove and burn the tree, roots 
and all. It would be very poor policy, indeed, to let the 
tree live even if, for a year or more, it would continue to 
bear fine fruit. 

Heart-rot. — This disease is one of the most serious troubles 
that the orehardist has to contend with. Like the rootrot, 
when once it has established itself, there is little to be 
done but cut down and burn the affected tree. The cause of 
the disease is due largely to pore-fungi which enter through 
wounds in the bark and destroy the heart-wood in much the 
same way that the toadstool fungi destroy the root. 

There seem to be two forms of heart-rot, the wet and the 
dry. In the wet heart-rot the heart-wood of the tree becomes 
soft and mushy, while in the dry rot the wood becomes 
brittle and punky and may be snapped off very easily. 
I am inclined to believe that two pore-fungi (Poly&amp;tictua 
hirsutus and Polystictus versicolor) cause the wet rot, and 
that a small shell-fungus (Schizophyllum commune) and 
rasp-like fungi (Irpex lacteus, of the cherry; and Irpex pomicola, 
of the apple) cause the dry rot. In the early stages 
of both forms of heart-rot the bark of the tree does not show 
any sign of disease, and the heart may be entirely gone before 
the fruits (sporophores) of the fungi appear. 

How These Fungi Gain a Foothold. — These fungi, like </seg>

            <seg id="p207">
206 


the toadstools, produce countless numbers of spores which 
are blown about by winds and carried by birds and insects. 
These spores germinate when they find lodgment in a wound 
and produce white threads (mycelium) which bore their 
way into the cambium and heart-wood. Once within, these 
threads grow rapidly and in a comparatively short time extend 
to the remotest branches of the tree. 

I have found these fungi in great abundance on apple, 
peach, and cherry trees. The cherry, however, seems to be 
the most susceptible to the attacks of these parasites, and I 
have seen young trees not more than four yenrs old in the 
last stages of decay. 

REMEDIES AND PREVENTIVES. 

From the very nature of root-rot and heart-rot, it can 
readily be seen that a fungicide would be of no avail. Since 
this is true, great care should be taken to prevent the entrance 
of these fungi into the orchard. An ounce of prevention 
in this case is worth several pounds of cure. 

In the case of root-rot, some recommend the isolation of 
the diseased tree by digging a ditch around it, two feet deep 
and two feet wide, at a distance of ten feet from the base. 
This precaution is taken in order to prevent the spread of 
the fungus to other trees by means of its threads (mycelium). 
Another precaution to be observed is to destroy by 
burning the fruits (sporophores) when they appear. Of 
course these measures are taken in order to preserve the 
tree which may continue to live and yield heavily for some 
time. However, the safer method to pursue would be to 
destroy the tree, taking care that all the larger roots be 
removed. 

Since the heart-rot is confined to the trunk and branches 
of the tree, the spread of the disease can be more carefully 
guarded than in root-rot. When the fruits (sporophores) 
of the fungi appear on the trunk and large branches of the 
tree, they should be cut out and the wound coated over with </seg>

            <seg id="p208">
207 


white lead. If small branches become infected they should 
be cut off and destroyed, and the cut end given a coat of 
white lead. In this way the safety of other trees will be 
insured, but it should be kept in mind that the threads 
(mycelium) still continue to destroy the wood and may at 
any time produce new fruits (sporophores). If the above 
precautions are taken to prevent the spread of the disease, 
many valuable trees may be allowed to live for some time. 
On the other hand, if no precautions are taken, it would be 
advisable to destroy the affected tree. 

Whenever a tree is wounded necessarily, as in the case of 
pruning, grafting, etc., or accidentally, as in the case of 
animals, insects, winds, etc., there is always danger. Open 
rounds on a tree ought to be considered as dangerous for 
the tree as an unprotected wound on one's body. In both 
cases it is not so much the cutting or rending which injures 
as the parasitic organisms which gain entrance through 
open wounds. 

Cultivation. — In this western country where we have 
long periods of very dry, hot weather, thorough cultivation, 
besides keeping down weeds, is the surest way of retaining 
moisture in the soil. Keep the ground in such condition 
that it will diminish surface evaporation and not let a single 
ounce of water run off and go to waste. 

Replanting. — Where an old orchard or the nursery rows 
have been removed with the intention of replanting, rotation 
in crops of corn, wheat, etc., should be resorted to in order 
to free the soil from toadstool fungi which are very liable 
to be present. In case trees are to be replaced, it has been 
suggested that copper sulphate and lime be mixed with the 
soil. Wood ashes are also recommended. </seg>

STRAWBERRIES. 

Bf J. W. Stevenson, North Bend. 

In this paper I shall briefly refer to the condition of 
plants, their culture, how varieties were affected by the 
great drouth last year, irrigation, insect enemies, etc. 

My experience is confined to my own plants and observations 
of my neighbors' plants. We had a very favorable 
spring and summer for plants until July. The crop of berries 
was large, but too much rain at picking time hindered 
picking and caused a loss of several thousand quarts and a 
further loss from some of the shipments arriving in a poor 
condition. 

Beder Wood, Haverland, Bubach, Crescent, Alt. Vernon, 
and Up-to-date were the softest in shipment. Beder Wood 
and Crescent are particularly faulty in this respect. In the 
last half of the picking season they have many small berries 
which pickers overlook, and at next picking are too ripe, but 
are picked and put in with the sounder berries. We find 
that many pickers are not conscientious enough to throw 
away a rotten berry. Bubach, Jessie, and Bismark should 
be picked over every day, or they will not stand shipping. 
Clyde and Enhance, and some other sorts ripen more slowly 
and are often picked too green. Brandywine, Splendid, Warfield, 
and some other sorts may be picked over every other 
day if the picking is done thoroughly. An advantage in 
favor of the larger berries is that pickers seldom leave any 
ripe berries on the vines, and are quite willing to go over 
them every day if necessary. Very few berries of the larger 
sorts are wasted. Towards the last of the picking I let my 
pickers take the Crescent, Wood, and Up-to-date. 

We have found no sort to excel the Warfield in productiveness, 
in quality for canning, and table use, or for shipping. 
It will not stand drouth as well as many other sorts, and 
if is difficult to prevent it, the Crescent, Wood, and some </seg>

other sorts, from matting together too thickly in the row. 
It would be better to plant such sorts two feet apart in the 
row, and when enough plants from runners have been propterly 
placed, cut off all runners growing ten inches beyond 
the center of the row. We use a rolling cutter attached to a 
scantling about five feet long for cutting runners. We like 
it better than a cutter attached to a cultivator, as it is more 
easily adapted to the varying widths of the rows. We also 
use a four-tined fork for pulling up runners in the row, 
and then jerk them off by hand. We do this in September, 
once or twice. Letting runners grow as they will till plants 
set as thickly as grass on a lawn produces small berries and 
in a drouth like that of last year the plants perish. 

We will briefly mention some of the best drouth-resisting 
sorts. Crescent will stand drouth bravely if kept thin 
enough, but they are generally grown too dense. We find 
that Clyde, Brandywine, Sample, Senator Dunlap, and the 
New York stand the drouth the best. Clyde, Sample, and 
New York have very strong roots and do not make a great 
excess of plants. Brandywine and Dunlap are strong 
plants, but make too many plants if the runners are not controlled. 
The Sample is an ideal sort in plant, berry, sire, 
form, color, quality, and productiveness. It is a pistillate 
sort, medium to late in season, and needs a late fertilizer, 
such as Brandywine, Enhance, and Splendid. If none of 
these are at hand, perhaps Clyde would do, as it blooms a 
long time. We think no one would make a mistake in planting 
this sort in Nebraska. 

Senator Dunlap is a popular new sort from Illinois, and 
well tested there before being introduced to the public. It 
stands drouth admirably if not allowed to mat together too 
closely, as it is a vigorous grower and sends out a multitude 
of runners. It transplants the surest of any sort I ever 
tried. Scarcely a plant fails to grow. The fruit averages 
larger than Warfield, and quality and color good. It bears 
well for a staminate sort. It is an excellent sort for the

small planter if he will control its runners. Up-to-date is 
another Illinois sort very extensively recommended by the 
introducer and originator. It is a great plant-maker and 
stands drouth well, but is a worthless sort for fruit both in 
quantity and quality. Our plants came from the introducer 
two years in succession, and must be true to name. We notice 
a Michigan lirm recommends it highly; if he is honest in 
his recommendation, he must have a different sort from ours. 
The introducers of such new and worthless fruits should be 
barred from the confidence of nurserymen and planters. 

Carnii Beauty is a valuable new sort from the East; a 
good grower, stands drouth well, and productive of large 
berries. Nick Ohmer is a highly praised eastern sort which 
we have not found profitable, nor have my neighbors found 
it any better. Seaford is another highly-praised eastern 
sort which seems to be tender, suffering from winter freezing 
and summer heat and drouth. Jerry Rusk has been 
highly recommended by eastern growers, but we find it of 
little value. Win. Belt and Star have been highly praised 
by eastern growers, but are unprofitable. The Star is a 
vigorous, healthy grower, but deficient in fruit. The Belt 
will rust to death if not sprayed with Bordeaux. The New 
York is a new sort from New York. A large plant and 
berry. It stands drouth equal to any, and makes only a 
moderate number of runners. It would be a good sort for 
hill culture. We think it will be a valuable sort. 

Excelsior and Johnson Early are the earliest new sorts 
out. The former with us is an abundant plant-maker, but 
the berries are far from being abundant. Johnson Early is 
a much better sort for fruit, a vigorous grower, and fairly 
productive of fair-sized berries. Inexperienced growers 
would be liable to let these sorts grow too dense for fruiting 
or withstanding drouth. 

Giant is one of our best and latest sorts, which seems to 
be little known and appears in very few catalogues. If we

cut. It is a staminate sort, a strong grower, and very productive 
of large berries. It is the latest sort we know of, 
and by having it the berry season might be prolonged a week 
or more. 

The Gandy is a late, large sort. Our only objection is that 
it is not productive enough. Bubach and Jessie are valuable 
old sorts that are good drouth-resisters. We find the 
second crop of berries on them better than the first, and 
will give a good third crop. 

Glen Mary and Margaret are excellent sorts which stand 
drouth well and bear good crops of large berries. Mary and 
Marshall yield large berries, but not enough of them to be 
profitable. The Marshall may do better in hills, but certainly 
it is not a success in matted rows. The Staple — a 
seedling of the Warfield, and similar to it in plant and 
berry — will not stand extreme drouth. It will not yield 
over half as much as Warfield. 

Parker Earl has never been a profitable sort with us, 
either for fruit or plants. It is sometimes damaged by the 
winter, and often suffers from drouth while bearing fruit ; 
or if the weather is wet it will rust badly, so that at picking 
time the large number of berries are not properly matured. 
We do not think it a good sort for our state unless it can be 
irrigated when needing it, and sprayed every year with 
Bordeaux. 

The improved Parker Earl is apparently just like the common 
berry of that name in plant and berry. We hope it may 
truly be an improvement, but shall have to try it another 
year to notice any difference. 

We can not take time to describe all the sorts we experiment 
with, as there are about fifty of them at present, but 
will briefly say that the following named sorts are reliable 
and planters may depend on them : Bismark, Bisel, Cobden 
Queen, Enhance, Enormous, Mt. Vernon, Lovett, Princess, 
Saunders, Splendid, Tennessee Prolific, and Wolverton. 

Treatment of Plants After Picking.— When through </seg>

            <seg id="p213">
212 


picking, we fork out all the mulching between rows, haul it 
away, and stack it up for use in covering the plants again. 
We then use a mower to cut the tops, thoroughly hand rake 
all the leaves and rubbish and haul it off to be burned. We 
have several times tried to burn the mulching on the plants, 
but generally found it does more harm than good. It is difficult 
to get the half-rotten mulching shaken out and evenly 
distributed over the surface so all will burn off evenly without 
having too much burnt in spots. If left to hired help 
to do it, they will destroy many plants and leave many 
places untouched. After cleaning out the leaves and rubbish, 
we use a small plow with rolling cutter to trim the 
rows to a width of eight inches to one foot, according to the 
density of the plants. We immediately cultivate between 
the rows, filling up the furrows and throwing some of the 
soil on the strip of plants, and then follow this with garden 
rakes, raking the soil on the strip till the plants are nearly 
covered with earth. This prevents the soil from drying out, 
and the plants will successfully withstand heat and drouth 
for several weeks if necessary until they can be irrigated. 
Last year my neighbor raked some of his plants very clean 
after mowing them off, but neglected to rake some soil over 
them, and they soon perished in the heat and drouth. 

We never try to grow more than two crops from the same 
planting, and think it would be ruinous to hold plants over 
for a second crop without trimming the rows to a narrower 
space. The difficulty with most amateur growers is a great 
superabundance of plants which can not be cultivated, nor 
the surface of the ground stirred with a hoe, and the plants 
and sunshine soon absorb all the moisture in the soil, and 
a drouth like that of last summer must surely destroy the 
whole patch. 

New Planting. — We used a weeder, twelve-tooth cultivator, 
and harrow frequently on our new planting, and they 
prospered nicely till August. The soil a few inches below 
the surface was moist enough to ball in the hand. We had </seg>


            <seg id="p214">
213 

to plant the runners to get them to take root where we could 
not reach them with water. 

Ikbigation. — We never experienced a season when windmills 
were such a failure for irrigating purposes. Calm 
weather rendered them almost useless through July and August 
when we needed their services the most. We used a 
horse power and buckets on chains to raise water from an 
open well. This would raise about 5,000 gallons per hour. 
It would have done more, but the well would run dry in a 
little while. As the drouth continued, we purchased a gasoline 
engine and a large Curtis pump, mounted both on 
wheels, and had several four-inch pipes with five-foot points 
sunk twenty-seven feet at best distributing points in the 
nursery. We attached our pump directly to these pipes, 
and could very comfortably raise 100 gallons per minute 
and run it sixteen hours per day. The 100,000 gallons per 
day we pumped with the engine amounted to more than our 
three windmills did in two weeks. Though water comes 
within eight feet of the surface, we had difficulty in getting 
a sufficient supply, and found tubular wells insufficient. We 
found that the line wire gauze used on well points hindered 
the flow of water more than one-half. A six-inch point in 
our open well was then taken up and the wire gauze taken 
off and only the perforated jacket left on. This was sunk 
again to some depth and the flow of water was more than 
doubled. The fine sand troubles for a short time, but is soon 
pumped out and the gravel takes its place around the point. 
I mention this matter of well points and screens, as our experience 
might be of some benefit to others, particularly in 
the Platte valley. 

Insects, Rust, etc. — Dry seasons are particularly favorable 
for the propagation of insects injurious to strawberry 
plants. Last summer may have been too hot for them, and 
we hope there will not be any unusual increase in them next 
spring. After new growth starts in the spring we spray our 
plants with Bordeaux, lime, and Paris Green, and before </seg>

plants blossom we sift on lime when dew is on, which has 
been slacked with strong lye water or with Bordeaux water. 
If no fruit is in the way we add some Paris Green and flour 
to the lime dust if troubled with any insects. The lime 
seems to be beneficial to the plants, and I think it prevents 
rust. Mr. Oder, of Missouri, says he sifts packing house fertilizer 
on his plants once a year, and has no trouble with 
insects. The fertilizer is a good thing for the plants, if not 
for the insects. 

COVER CROPS 

By O. H. Barnhill, Shenandoah, Iowa. 

Three years ago I had twelve acres of three-year-old apple 
trees that had been well cultivated and had made a wonderful 
growth. When I say they had beeu cultivated, I do not 
mean that the ground had been plowed in the fall or spring 
and then allowed to grow up in weeds, but that it was frequently 
stirred and kept free from weeds from spring until 
fall. 

All went well until the frigid February of 1899, when the 
mercury hovered around the zero mark for about three 
weeks. When spring came, a number of peach trees and 
grape vines were consigned to the brush pile with the philosophical 
reflection that we must expect losses as well as 
profits. But the apple trees — surely they were uninjured. 
The wood was examined and the twigs found plump and 
green clear to the terminal buds. Yet, as the season ad\anced, 
the leaves did not burst forth and grow with that 
vigor which characterizes the healthy tree. Somo trees 
leafed out and grew fairly well, while others seemed undr 
cided. Part of a tree would leaf out ahead of the rest, which 
would slowly bring forth scant foliage and grow in a weak, 
half-hearted way, or not at all. Watersprouts sprang up in </seg>

the center of the tree, taking the place of a normal, healthy 
growth. In midsummer the sickly leaves began to fall. 

Several hundred of the worst injured trees were grubbed 
out, but not with cheerful resignation. Examination showed 
the roots to be winter-killed. After the stealing of this 
pomological horse by Jack Frost, I learned that the horticultural 
stable might have been locked with a cover crop. 

My own experience was repeated, with variations, in thousands 
of cases all over this part of the United States. All 
kinds of fruit trees and nursery stock were damaged or 
killed outright by root injury. Cover crops would not have 
prevented all this loss, but they would have prevented a 
large share of it, for where the ground was bare the trees 
usually suffered the most, and least where it was covered. 
Many a peach orchard was saved by a cover crop of weeds. 
I am a firm believer in the great value of clean culture, but 
I would rather see an orchard go into winter quarters with 
the ground covered with weeds than with the ground bare. 
The proper way to care for a young orchard is to cultivate 
thoroughly during the growing season and then sow a cover 
crop in midsummer. 

What is a "cover crop?" It is a crop grown in the orchard 
to cover the ground during the fall and winter 
months. Its manifold advantages may be enumerated as 
follows : 

(1) To protect the roots of the trees from winter-killing. 
This is its primary purpose and greatest value. 

(2) To catch and hold the snow in winter. When thus 
held in place the snow itself acts as a cover crop, also fnrnishing 
moisture and fertility. 

(3) To add humus (decayed vegetable matter) to the soil. 
Where an orchard is given clean culture the humus becomes 
exhausted and should be replenished*. 

(4) To add fertility to the soil. Cover crops which are 
Kimes furnish very little fertility, but all supplv 
which is of equal, if not greater, importance. </seg>

            <seg id="p217">
216 


(5) To prevent the loss of nitrogen and other soil properties 
by leaching. This occurs to a greater or less extent 
where the ground is left exposed and bare. 

Cover crops may be divided into two classes : Those which 
arc legumes and those which are not. Grains belong to the 
latter class and have the advantage, being easily grown. 
They are sown in August after cultivation has been discontinued. 
About the same quantity of seed is sown as in growing 
an ordinary crop, except corn, which is sown broadcast 
at the rate of two or three bushels per acre. 

I visited last month the experiment station at Ames, Iowa, 
where many different kinds of cover crops have been tried. 
Oats and rape sown in August gave the best results the past 
season, each making a large growth and completely covering 
the ground. 

My own experience with oats has been unsatisfactory. In 
1899, I sowed oats early in August, but the weather was so 
dry that fall that none grew save a little on the north side 
of the trees. The experiment was repeated in 1900, but with 
little better results. Excessive fall rains and the consequent 
rank growth of purslane seemed to prevent the oats from 
making growth enough to amount to anything. 

Last summer the ground was so dry in southwestern Iowa 
that it was useless to sow anything until the rains came, 
which was about the middle of September. Had oats been 
sown at that time, September 15, it would have been killed 
just as it was coming up, for a frost came within a week. 
Fortunately, I had sown rye, which was not killed by early 
frosts, but kept on growing well into October. On the best 
ground it made sufficient growth to cover the ground completely, 
but on the poorer soil it did not. 

Oats has the advantage over rye of not growing in the 
spring. Buckwheat is sometimes used as a cover crop, being 
sown in July, but the leaves are cut off by the first frost 
and the bare stalks afford little soil protection. 

The leguminous cover crops are vetch, cow peas, and crim- </seg>

son clover. The latter is used to some extent in the South, 
but the seasons are too short and the summers too diy for 
it here in the North. 

Vetch makes an ideal cover crop, but the cost of the seed 
almost prohibits its use. In 1899 the experiment station at 
Ames sowed a cover crop of vetch the fore part of July. 
When fall came the ground was covered with a thick mat 
of vines. The vetch lived through the winter like clover and 
grew profusely the next year. June 13, 1900, I received the 
following letter from Prof. John Craig, who was at the head 
of the horticultural department: 

"My opinion of the good qualities of vetch as a cover crop 
has been considerably strengthened by the experience of last 
winter and this spring. It produced the most ideal cover of 
any of the plants used, and I am of the opinion that the soil 
in that part of the orchard in which it was used is in better 
condition than any other part at the present time. 

"The difficulty with the particular vetch which I have used 
is the question of procuring seed. So far as I know it is not 
commercial. A considerable quantity was imported by the 
Department of Agriculture, and it is possible that seed may 
still be obtained from that source. [It can not.] 

"Hairy Vetch, Vicia Villosa, is distinct from sand vetch, 
fVicia Sativa. The latter is an annual. I am not yet sure as 
o the duration of hairy vetch. A crop sown in the orchard 
last summer is still in flower. It suggests a biennial period 
of growth and possibly a perennial. 

"I am very favorably impressed with this plant as a cover 
crop in this state, and if we can get over the seed difficulty I 
would feel like recommending it quite generally. I have 
had no experience with sand vetch, but see no reason why 
it should not succeed." 

Cow peas make the best cover crop in the South, where 
they are grown extensively. The cow pea is a leguminous 
nitrogen-gatherer similar to clover and is of great value as 
a soil-enricher. Its natural habitat is in the South and it </seg>

            <seg id="p219">

has been thought that it could not be grown successfully in 
the northern states. Scattering experiments indicate that 
it can be readily acclimated and grown in this latitude. 

E. F. Diehl, of Leesburg, Ind., has had more experience in 
growing cow peas in the northern states than anyone else I 
know of. He has had great success with this crop and enthusiastically 
recommends it. Either of the earlier varieties, 
such as the Whipporwill, will ripen seed in the latitude 
of Chicago September 1 if sown June 1, he says. They 
should be drilled at the rate of one bushel to two or three 
acres. 

E. B. Gay, of Griswold, Iowa, planted cow peas in his orchard 
July 20 the past season, the ground being cultivated 
up to that date. They grew two feet high and completely 
covered the ground, but did not make any seed. Another 
patch planted June 10 ripened seed. 

After an orchard begins to bear it may be seeded to clover, 
which of course serves as a cover crop. It might be well to 
substitute vetch for clover. The seed difficulty might be 
overcome by buying a small quantity and growing enough 
for future use. 

In conclusion, I would say that oats and rye are the cheapest 
and surest cover crops we now have. Cow peas are very 
promising, but are yet in the experimental stage in the 
northern states. 

DISCUSSION 

Mr. Hartley — I should like to ask as to whether all varieties 
were affected alike, and if not, which ones were worst 
affected by the winter. 

Mr. Barnhill — I do not think there was any particular 
difference in the different varieties. Duchess and other 
hardy varieties seemed to suffer about as bad as any. On 
the high, exposed ground, of course, they all suffered worse. 

Mr. Hartley — The only trees I lost during that hard winter 
were Jonathan ; the other varieties have ail recovered </seg>

            <seg id="p220">
219 


from the effects of it. I do not think there is a single tree 
in my orchard which received its death blow from that hard 
winter except the Jonathan, which we all know to be only 
half hardy. It seems to me that here in Nebraska we do 
not need to trouble ourselves very much about cover crops; 
just neglect our orchards from the first of July on and we 
are pretty sure to have quite a dense cover crop. It is very 
cheap, and is at least as effective in returning vegetable 
mould to the soil. A great many of the cures for our troubles 
are. so expensive that we had better not be cured. We 
only have a margin of profit at the best, and it doesn't take 
a great deal to eat up that margin. I have no doubt there is 
value in this in an experimental way, but the cost must always 
be taken into consideration. We have to take a great 
many things in a speculative way in fruit-growing, as well 
as in everything else, and make our investment on the average. 
It very often happens that after we have made our 
experiments we are either uncertain as to the benefits received, 
or know by the balance sheet that it has cost more 
than it came to. I am inclined to think that is true with 
those expensive plants recommended in experiment station 
work for cover crops. 

Mr. Mohleb — During that hard winter I had 3,000 apple 
trees and 2,000 peach trees that had been out two years. I 
cultivated the orchard until the middle of July and had it 
perfectly clean. The foxtail came up and covered the 
ground densely after that The apple trees did not suffer 
at all from root freezing, but the peach trees had made a 
very rank growth, and out of one block of 1,300 trees I lost 
850. They seemed to be killed about six inches above 
ground, although it is possible the roots were injured. Another 
block I covered with cow peas, which proved quite 
successful. It is easily grown, and as a cover crop is not 
expensive, because it only takes about a bushel to the acre, 
and the cost is from f 1 to $1.25 per bushel. Sown the first 
of July they come up in time to completely cover the </seg>

            <seg id="p221">
220 


ground. I used the Whipporwill variety and find it very 
successful as a cover crop. It is not every year that foxtail 
grows enough to cover the ground after the first of July. 

Mr. Goodman — I believe cow peas are about the best cover 
crop for summer, but they are of no particular value for 
winter. The first frost kills the leaves, and the crop is of 
very linle value as a winter protection. I use cow peas 
every year on thirteen hundred acres, but I use them as a 
summer cover crop and fertilizer; for winter cover I use 
rye. In the spring, if you wish to cultivate your orchard 
during the early part of the season, you can plow the rye 
under; or you can let it stand until it heads out and then 
turn it under. 

I believe our soil needs a summer cover just as much as 
a winter cover. I believe we can cultivate our trees too 
much. I feel loth to say this in a general meeting of this 
kind, for some are sure to jump to the other extreme and 
not cultivate enough. In fact, I think the general tendency 
is to not cultivate enough, and yet I say that you may overdo 
the thing and cultivate all of the life and substance out of 
the soil by keeping it bare and exposed during the hot season 
through August and September. I would rather have the 
weeds grow then than to cultivate year after year until you 
stir the life and vitality out of the soil. I think a cover crop 
is just as important as cultivation, and I would rather begin 
early and cultivate just as thoroughly as possible until about 
the 1st of August and let the weeds grow from that time on, 
than to have any more cultivation. With us I think it is 
more important that the ground should be protected during 
that part of the season than in winter. We turn that crop 
of weeds, grass, and stuff under late in the fall and sow rye; 
let this stand in the spring until just before it ripens, then 
turn it under and sow cow peas. Some let the rye ripen and 
then turn it under and thus get another crop of rye. These 
various plans are used in order to cover as much ground as 
possible, but I think any one of them is better for ten or </seg>

fifteen years than continual cultivation. I don't like to say 
that many of us cultivate too much ; most of us do not cultivate 
enough; but I have visited some orchards that have 
been cultivated year after year until there was no life in the 
soil. Those men didn't know what was the matter with 
their orchards. The fact is, they need a crop of clover, cow 
peas, or something of that kind to renew the soil. 

Mr. Barnard — Would the treatment you have described 
be all right from the time of planting up until the orchard 
gives out from old age? 

Mr. Goodman — The first four years, plant corn. There is 
nothing better than corn in a young orchard; the leaves 
shade the ground during that part of the season when it 
needs shade. After that, adopt this plan of rotation of cow 
peas, rye, weeds, and plowing. 

Mr. Pollard — What do you plow your orchard with? 

Mr. Goodman — With a two-horse turning plow, except the 
last four rows next the trees ; for that we use a little diamond 
plow. 

Mb. Pollard — Your ideas agree with mine, except in regard 
to the use of the plow ; we use a disc in place of a plow. 
I am convinced, however, that this thing of continually cultivating 
the orchard, keeping the ground entirely bare, won't 
do; I have found that out. But when you talk about plowing, 
I would be afraid to put a fellow in the orchard with a 
plow. 

Mr. Goodman — Why would you be afraid? 

Mb. Pollard — I should be afraid the roots near the surface 
would be cut off. 

Mr. Goodman — It is true that some of the small roots 
near the surface are sometimes injured, "but this injury is 
nothing compared to the advantage of turning under all that 
vegetable matter. 

Mb. McIntosh — I am glad Mr. Goodman has called attention 
to this point. The cultivation of the soil stimulates 
the production of nitrogen; this will be taken up immedi- </seg>

ately almost if you have any green vegetable on it; bnt if 
there is no vegetable growing on the soil, that nitrogen will 
remain there. It is a very volatile thing, and the first rain 
will leach it clear out of the reach of the roots unless possibly 
the roots of the trees get it, and the soil actually becomes 
impoverished. By growing a crop you save that nitrogen, 
and when that crop is turned under and decays, the 
nitrogen becomes available to your growing trees. 

Mr. Barxhill — In regard to cutting off the small roots, 
if the ground is left bare, those roots are almost sure to 
freeze, anyway. They always freeze more or less, so that is 
not material. 

Mr. Youngers — That is all very well in theory, but my 
experience and observation have been that the best cultivated 
orchards we have are the ones that give the fruit. Any 
field man who has ever gathered fruit for exhibition purposes 
will say that the best fruit, that of the highest standard 
for exhibition, has come from the cultivated orchards. 
We cultivated with stirring plow, harrow, and disc ten times 
the past year, and we had as fine apples, and more of them, 
than any other orchard in that whole country. Mr. O'Gara 
and Mr. Hedgecock were up there and saw the orchards; in 
fact, they have been visiting both neglected and cultivated 
orchards in the state, and I should like to hear from them. 

Mr. Swan — How late do you cultivate? 

Mr. Youxgers — Up until the 1st of September. 

Mr. Goodman — I coincide with every word Mr. Youngers 
has said. As I stated in the beginning, I was loth to make 
the statement I did before the society. Every orchardist 
will tell you that the best fruit for quite a number of years 
will come from those orchards that are cultivated thoroughly 
; but if you follow that up for fifteen or twenty years 
you will see where the results come. I do not wish to be 
understood as not advocating thorough cultivation; I do 
advocate thorough cultivation. A strip six to ten feet wide 
on each side of the trees may be kept well cultivated, but </seg>

            <seg id="p224">
COVER CROPS. 

223 

the strip between the rows must have some kind of a crop 
to cover the ground and renew the vitality of the soil. I 
was loth to say that it was not a good plan to keep continually 
and thoroughly cultivating the soil, because I realize 
that it is just as Mr. Youngers says, the best fruit comes 
from the cultivated orchards. And yet you may cultivate 
too much. 

There is one plan that I like much better than thorough 
cultivation, and that is winter plowing. We are running 
our plows right along now, turning all of the ground* up 
except that which is in rye. Clover generally grows six 
inches to a foot high during the fall, and we are now turning 
that under; then by the 1st of August it will be about the 
same height, and we will turn it under again. This is not 
what you could call thorough cultivation, yet it is not injuring 
the soil and is helping the trees. I speak for a medium 
course; I do not wish to be misunderstood. 

Mr. Youngeks — What is your average rainfall where you 
practice that method of letting the weeds, grass, and rye 
grow in your orchards? 

Mr. Goodman — Thirty-six inches. 

Mr. Youngers — Yes, sir; in this country we have about 
twenty-eight; and if you let weeds, rye, or anything else 
grow in your orchard, and a dry time sets in, you will have 
very inferior fruit or very little of it. 

The President — I believe these differences of opinion are 
due largely to surroundings. Our friend from Missouri 
talks about winter plowing; of course we all understand we 
can't do that here. If we take location into consideration, 
I think that will explain the whole thing, and if these gentlemen 
could sit down side by side and talk these things over 
they could soon agree. Go out where Mr. Youngers is located, 
and there the rain all comes in the summer during 
the growing season. They probably do not have an inch of 
rain during the freezing weather and good evaporation all 
winter. Go where Mr. Goodman's orchards are, they have </seg>

            <seg id="p225">
224 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

very little more rainfall during the summer than we have 
here, but they have rain all winter and no evaporation ; that 
is, the winter rains are more than the evaporation. Thus 
the difference in climatic conditions, soil, etc., will account 
for our different methods of taking care of our orchards. 
In discussing these questions we ought always to take into 
consideration the local surroundings. 

Mb. O'Gara — I should like to say a word in regard to Mr. 
Youngers' orchard. Mr. Hedgecock'and I went out there 
and 'visited the orchards in that locality, and on one side of 
the road where Mr. Youngera' orchard is the trees are in 
good condition. There wasn't an unhealthy tree in the whole 
lot. In fact, Mr. Hedgecock and I went there looking for 
some fungus which we hoped we would find, but we didn't 
find any. There was not a tree that had fungus on it, and I 
think this is due to the thorough cultivation given. On the 
other side of the road, where the weeds had been allowed to 
grow, and the trees had cultivated themselves, there wasn't 
a live tree there but that was covered with fungi, and many 
of the roots were diseased. 

Mr. Pollard — How long have you kept up that cultivation? 


Mr. Youngers — The orchard was planted sixteen years 
ago and it has been cultivated every year right up to September. 


The President — Wasn't there one year that you let it 
stand without cultivating? 

Mo. Youngers — Yes, sir; one year we let the weeds grow, 
and then mowed them and plowed them under the same 
year. The orchard was very tardy about coming into bearing, 
and after consulting with Mr. Marshall we decided to 
try that course for a year at least. 

Mu. Hartley — I should like to ask Mr. Youngers what 
he would do in case he had followed clean cultivation for 
seven or eight years, until the trees were ten or eleven years 
of age and then were not producing fruit or showed very 
little sign of doing so? </seg>

            <seg id="p226">
225 


Mr. Youxgers — Well, with the exception of the one year 
mentioned, I kept right on cultivating. I don't know 
whether Mr. Brown is in the room or not, but he used to 
twit me about the beautiful orchard I had with no fruit on 
it. The trees were unusually fine and healthy and made a 
good growth every year, and now since they have come into 
bearing they have large tops and yield splendid crops. They 
are making up for all that lost time, and this year, in spite 
of the large crop of apples borne, the trees made a growth 
of all the way from eighteen to twenty-four inches. 

Mr. Hartley — At what age did they begin to bear? 

Mr. Youxgers — About eight years from planting I had 
the first fruit, and ten years from planting I had a profitable 
crop. From that time on I have had good crops right 
along except where failure was caused by accident. One 
year I lost the crop by a heavy wind and dust storm from 
the southwest blowing through the trees at blossoming time, 
and of course I have lost by frost when the crop has been 
generally killed over the country. 

Mr. Hartley — How old are your trees? 

Mr. Youxgers — They are now sixteen years old, 

Mr. Hartley — What varieties have you? 

Mr. Youngers — 1 have planted and fruited one hundred 
and seven varieties ; those that have given the most fruit 
are Ben Davis, Winesap, Jonathan, Genet, Grimes Golden, 
Pippin, Missouri Pippin, Wealthy, and Duchess. That 
would be about the list I should plant if I were starting 
again. 

Question — What about the N. W. Greening? 

Mr. Youxgers — It has not fruited yet; it has not been in 
the state long enough to give fruit to any extent. It has 
been exhibited from the northwest part of the state. I know 
it is a hardy tree, and know it is fine fruit; but what it will 
do in the way of bearing I don't know. 

Mr. Chapix — We have a small orchard of three or four 
hundred trees that have been planted about eight years.

They have always been cultivated clean, and have madesome 
of them especially — a very fine growth, but so far we 
have had no fruit at all. Last year we concluded to let 
them go without any cultivation; they were cultivated perhaps 
till the 15th of June and then we let them stand and 
grow up to weeds, grass, and everything else. Well, when 
the dry weather came on I went out into that orchard and 
there were cracks in the ground an inch wide just as you 
have seen in excessively cold weather in winter. Those 
cracks extended all over the orchard, and we finally concluded 
that we had better do something to fill them up, so 
we began cultivating and continued right along up until we 
got cooler weather and moisture. But as to what to do to 
get a crop of fruit on that orchard, I don't know ; it has been 
planted now eight years and we have got nothing. 

HORTICULTURE IN STATE INSTITUTIONS. 

By E. N. Reynolds. 

Horticulture at the state institutions means much more 
for the state and those who are cared for in these places 
than I will be able to tell you in this brief paper; but I 
have endeavored to outline a few points to indicate its 
importance. 

There are some very important reasons why horticulture 
should be one of the educational features of our state institutions: 
First, horticulture at these institutions is a profitable 
industry for the state itself. In our private affairs the 
first question we ask is, "Does it pay?" And in answering 
this question in relation to horticulture at our state institutions, 
I have no hesitancy in saying that the state itself 
will be abundantly recompensed for all outlays in the enlargement 
and cultivation of its orchards and vineyards. 
The products of these can be consumed in the institution 
itself, thus saving the outlay of moneys for these things. </seg>

            <seg id="p228">
227 


Fruit is recognized in all civilized countries as a most 
wholesome and nutritious diet, and the inmates of our state 
institutions crave the luscious fruit. In scarce years, imported 
fruit sells so high in our markets that fruit becomes 
a luxury, and the heads of our state institutions at once 
(and rightly) say, "We can not afford luxuries for our 
wards." But why deny them these luxuries when they 
might be raised right at the very doors of our institution 
properties? 

Generally, those who are inmates and residents at oar 
institutions can render a considerable part of the care and 
cultivation of an orchard as well as gather and store the 
fruit. This reduces the gross expense to the state. Outdoor 
work among trees and birds and flowers brings a restful, 
healthy, contented disposition of mind and heart. We 
believe some of the disagreeable, and criminally disposed 
minds could thus be led to aspirations after something bette 
— and truer principles of life instilled into those who are 
within our institutions to be benefited. Besides these sources 
of profit we believe, where more fruit of any sort is produced 
than can economically be used at the institution itself, our 
state furnishes a fair market, and something can be earned 
to help carry the expenses of these institutions by disposing 
of the surplus fruit in these markets. 

I am not here advocating the advisability of the state 
raising fruit to sell, but where an over-production, or extra 
yield, gives more than the institution can use economically, 
do not permit the waste of the fruit, but place it in the 
market and make all out of it you can. 

The second reason why horticulture should be carried on 
in our state institutions is for the sake of education. In 
institutions such as the one I am connected with, a large 
percentage of the young men in attendance come from farms 
and go back to farms, or should go upon farms, when they 
grow up. 

Nebraska as a state is fast developing into a fruit-produc- </seg>

            <seg id="p229">

ing state. Horticulture should be one of the leading studies 
of our farmers. Let not, therefore, the state institutions 
deprive its wards of as complete a knowledge in this line 
as lies at their command. 

We believe the heads of these institutions should be awake 
to the interests of the young men they are preparing for 
self-supporting citizenship. 

Nebraska is offering many inducements to fruit growers. 
Education on horticulture means the practical knowledge 
which comes from personal experience in tree-pruning, cultivation, 
and all work pertaining to practical fruit-growing. 
There are man}- young men who would be glad to take up 
this line of work — to look after large orchards, vineyards, 
and vegetable gardens — yet for lack of instruction they are 
unwilling to attempt it, or prove failures if they do. Our 
state institutions can do a great deal to spread a wholesome 
knowledge of this sort of industry and state development. 

We have at our institution about 250 apple trees, and 600 
grape vines with various other kinds of fruit. Our apples 
consist of about twenty varieties. I will mention some 
which gave us the best yield: Ben Davis, Winesap, Geniton, 
Iowa Blush, and Roman Stem. A number of other 
varieties yielded very well considering the extreme drouth 
last season. Though our orchard is small, the results proved 
valuable in supplying our institution with fruit, and it is 
only for lack of ground that our orchard is not larger. 

We find in our school that the largest proportion of young 
men come from farms and expect to continue work along 
tli is line. These young men can be successful fruit-growers. 
They are proving this fact by the work they are doing 
in our school. 

Nebraska is no longer a state where experiment is necessary. 
A visit to our state fairs will prove what magnificent 
yields of fruit are being obtained, and larger yields would 
be the result with more thoroughly educated horticulturists 
scattered over our commonwealth. </seg>

LAST SEASON'S PEACH CROP AND ITS LESSONS. 

By L. M. Russell. 

Last season's peach crop is another proof that Nebraska 
is not a failure as a peach-producing state. 

There were more bushels of peaches harvested last season 
in Nebraska than in any one year since we began growing 
peaches. While the leading growers did not realize as much 
per bushel as they have in years gone by, the crop as a whole 
brought more money, as there are so many more orchards 
in bearing now than a few years ago. 

During the month of July, while the hot dry winds were 
withering the crops of grain and fruit, it looked for a time 
like the peach crop would certainly be a failure. But this 
is proof again that the peach will stand more hot, dry 
weather than almost any other fruit, as will the tree at 
planting time stand more abuse and misuse than almost any 
other tree and still make a good growth with favorable conditions 
later on. 

The dry weather greatly delayed the ripening of the early 
varieties. The Alexander, Early Kivers, and Hale's Early 
ripening nearly a month later than usual, and the early 
freestones were about three weeks late. 

We were enabled to make a good showing of Alexander 
and Early Rivers last season at the State Fair, something, 
as I remember, that has never been done here before. These, 
of course, had been in cold-storage for two or three weeks 
and came out in fine condition. And owing to the late 
ripening of the earlier freestones, being held in check by 
the extreme drouth, they were shown in abundance fresh 
and nice from the tree, something heretofore unknown. 

There were a great many more peaches shown at the fair </seg>

last fall than ever before. And these were shown by many 
more exhibitors than in former seasons. In former years 
about all the peaches shown at the fair came from the southeastern 
portion of the state. But last season there were a 
good many shown from the west and southwestern part of 
the state, some fine specimens coming from Kearney, Lincoln, 
and Blaine counties. 

With the abundant crop of last season, the tender as well 
as the hardy varieties all blooming full and ripening good 
fruit, a great many will make a mistake in planting and 
paying too little attention to hardiness, forgetting that we 
do not have many winters as favorable as that of 1900 and 
1901. 

It was a poor season to test the hardiness of new varieties. 
While the Champion and Elberta are among our best 
varieties, it is being more noticeable that they do not bear 
full crops as young as many other sorts. 

Had it not been for the abundant crop of peaches last 
season, a great many families in different parts of the state 
would be almost entirely out of canned fruit, where, as it is, 
they were enabled to fill more cans than ever before with 
the fine fruit, and at prices any one could afford. 

In the last fifteen years we have had nine good-paying 
crops and one light crop of peaches. This seems to me is as 
good as any one could ask for, especially in a country where 
a few years ago nearly every person in the state would tell 
you they were a failure and it was of no use to plant 
peaches. What other tree can you plant and get good 
returns from as soon as from the peach? 

We had a good many trees last season three years from 
planting that ripened six to eight baskets of fine peaches to 
the tree and these sold readily on the market here at forty 
tn fifty cents per basket. 

The best yield I have ever heard of in the state from a 
young tree is one planted by O. J. King of Lincoln. This 
tree was planted in the spring of 1899, and Mr. King reports </seg>

haring picked more than two bushels of fine peaches from it. 

I would much rather have peach trees bear alternate years 
than to have them bear every year, as the tree has a better 
chance to grow and mature its buds when not ripening a 
crop of fruit. 

One of the important lessons to be learned from last season 
is that of thinning. There is no other fruit so much inclined 
to over produce as the peach. And more especially 
should this be looked after in such seasons as last when the 
trees are so full of bloom, and following the crop of 1900. 
When thinning is necessary not one person in one hundred 
will do enough of it, as it looks to them like a waste of time 
and fruit. 

A good way for a beginner to do is to pull off about onehalf 
from the tree and in ten days or two weeks go over and 
pull off another half. The thinning should be done as early 
in the season as possible, after you see the fruit well set and 
it is done dropping. And should be done by good, careful 
hands who will not leave the fruit too much in clusters, and 
pull off too many where it is not needed. 

A good deal of time may be saved in the thinning process 
by trimming the trees in early spring. This may be done by 
cutting out any branches that are in the way of cultivation 
or that are in a decayed condition. 

It was very noticeable last season where we had cut the 
trees back the most and thinned out large branches, that 
we got the best fruit. 

In a season like the one just passed when there are so 
many peaches coming to market from all over the country 
and in all kinds of packages and conditions, it is very important 
to have your fruit carefully graded and packed, for 
there is always a good market for good fruit, and if your 
baskets come on the market with a few overripe ones, or 
some very small ones or not well-filled, people will pass them 
by, always looking for something better. </seg>

REPORT OF DELEGATE TO THE ANNUAL MEETINGS 
OF THE MISSOURI AND IOWA 
HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 

R. A. EilERSON. 

As your delegate to the recent meetings of the Missouri 
and the Iowa State Horticultural Societies, I submit the 
following report of those meetings. In this report I shall 
not attempt to give abstracts of all the papers presented, 
bnt shall touch upon such points as seem to me of special 
interest to Nebraska horticulturists. 

THK MJSSOUUI MEETING 

The Missouri meeting was held at St. Joseph, December 
3 to 5, 1901. The society has a large membership. The 
present successful season has increased the interest in fruitgrowing. 
The natural result is an interesting program and 
an excellent fruit display. Some total failures of the fruit 
crop were reported, but most reports were very flattering. 
Where corn was so badly injured by dry weather that it 
yielded only a fourth of a crop, apples did well. They were 
very small when the drouth was broken, but responded 
quickly to the late rains and made highly-colored, comparatively 
sound, and large-sized fruit. Several instances were 
noted in which the fruit crop of this year alone brought 
more money than the land would have sold for in the spring, 
returns running all the way from $40 to f200 per acre. F. 
H. Speakman, of Neosho, southwest Missouri, sold over 6,000 
crates of strawberries from twenty acres, averaging about 
fl.40 and netting about fl per crate. 

The fruit exhibit was very good. It was a large display </seg>


            <seg id="p234">

of individually excellent apples of a very few varieties. It 
was an exhibit of commercial apples. Ben Davis were 
everywhere. There were large numbers of Gano, many 
Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Jonathan, Grimes Golden, 
Huntsman, Willow Twig, etc. A considerable number of 
seedlings of comparatively new varieties from south Missouri 
and Arkansas were shown. Your delegate secured 
specimens of several of the best of these to exhibit at this 
meeting. They are: 

Nixoxite, a very large flattened greenish yellow apple, 
said by Mr. T. B. Woodside, of Salome, to be one of the best 
keepers in southern Missouri. 

Payne's Keeper, a fruit of medium size, light red or 
greenish red, round, firm, and smooth. The tree is said to 
be a poor grower, in both nursery and orchard, but it is a 
heavy bearer. This seedling is highly recommended by G. 
T. Tippin, of Nelson, Mo. 

Ixgram, a fruit of medium size, much like Rawles Genet, 
of which it is a seedling. It was pronounced a heavy bearer 
by several members of the Missouri society and is being 
planted quite largely. It is called an excellent keeper, its 
only drawback being its comparatively small size. On being 
compared with several specimens of Rawles Genet it seems 
considerably larger than that variety. 

Shockley, a small light red apple with indistinct stripes. 
It is grown as far South as Texas. T. T. Munson of that 
state puts it at the head of the late keepers for Texas. It 
may be of value to use in breeding a late apple for Nebraska. 

Givens, a large, dark red apple with indistinct stripes. 
The fruit ripens late after most other varieties have been 
gathered and is said to be an excellent keeper. 

Beach (Apple of Commerce), a large, light red and indistinctly 
striped fruit. This is a productive apple and a 
good keeper, of fair quality. 

Oliver, a large, rather dark red fruit with scattered 
specks and indistinct stripes. This is a fall apple, but one 
which keeps well into winter. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

The topics considered at the meeting covered the general 
field of pomology with some papers on ornamental gardening 
and one on vegetable-growing. Apple-growing was the 
absorbing topic. Considerable interest was also shown in 
peaches and strawberries. Plums were discussed somewhat. 
Grapes were touched upon. Cherries did not have a place 
on the program and were mentioned by Nebraska and Iowa 
men only. 

Proper methods of culture and the value of spraying were 
discussed more than any other questions. It was continually 
pointed out that the best results could be secured only 
by thorough cultivation. The spraying tests reported gave 
best results in cultivated orchards. Some speakers dwelt on 
the impossibility of getting perfect fruit even with the most 
thorough spraying unless the orchards were thoroughly cultivated. 
It was pointed out that many troublesome insects 
could best be kept in check by clean culture. Some drawbacks 
to clean cultivation were mentioned, however. In 
light soils on bluffs and hills cultivated ground washes 
badly. Planting and cultivating on lines running around 
the hills and leaving strips of land uncultivated were the 
methods suggested to prevent this erosion of hillsides. On 
the poorer soils of southern Missouri clean cultivation exhausts 
the land, burns out the vegetable matter. To restore 
this humus, various methods were suggested. Some would 
grow clover in the orchard for a couple of years and then 
return to cultivation. Some preferred cow peas, and some 
rye. Others would grow these plants in strips between the 
rows, cultivating the rest of the ground. In north Missouri 
on the rich lands some trouble is experienced on account of 
trees making too much growth of wood and bearing too little 
fruit. Girdling the trees, root-pruning by plowing deeper 
than usual, and sowing the orchard to grass were suggested. 
It would seem quite as feasible to the writer to 
grow a cover crop which could be sown in July to check the 
wood growth and induce the setting of sufficient fruit buds. </seg>

In growing cover crops for this purpose or to build up wornout 
soils advantage can be taken of moist seasons so that 
the trees or their fruit would not suffer injury in a dry year 
as they might if the other methods of treatment were 
adopted. 

In the discussion of insect enemies and diseases much interest 
was manifested in the dusting method of applying 
fungicides and insecticides. Some speakers were warm advocates 
of this dry method, though little definite information 
secured from actual experience was given. W. D. Maxwell, 
of St. Joseph, in 1900 dusted a part of his orchard four 
times and sprayed another part four times. He says he got 
all his apples from the dusted part. This year he dusted 
his whole orchard six times and had almost no defective 
fruit. Secretary Goodman said that with him it is a question 
of dusting or nothing. He could not haul water enough 
for orchards the size of his. 

There were great differences of opinion as to the value of 
spraying by any method. F. H. Speakman, of Neosho, 
sprayed four times this year with three pounds of copper 
sulphate and one-third pound of Paris green in fifty gallons 
of lime water. Three-fourths of his apples were free from 
worms. In barreling apples from a neighboring unsprayed 
orchard he got 19 bushels of No. 1 to 120 bushels of No. 2 
fruits. Many growers, however, said they had seen no good 
results from spraying and doubted the value of any work 
of the sort 

Prof. J. M. Steadman reported the very interesting results 
of his work in determining the cause of the "stinging" 
of apples which has been the topic of so much discussion in 
Missouri and which may prove to be identical with certain 
injuries quite common in southeast Nebraska, The insect 
responsible is none other than the common plum curculio. 
He succeeded in rearing mature curculios from stung apples. 
The curculio's work in apples is different from that 
in plums. The beetle begins laying eggs when the apples </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

are small and continues its work through the summer. It 
does not make the crescent-shaped mark at the puncture in 
which the egg is placed in apples as it does in plums, merely 
raising a little flap of the skin near the puncture. The apple 
does not furnish congenial surroundings for the curculio. 
Not over 25 per cent of the eggs hatch in the apple 
and not over 15 per cent of the larvae mature. Apples are 
not much damaged early in the season since the puncture 
in the skin soon heals over. When the fruits are larger, 
however, the punctures cause bad scars and afford places 
for disease to enter. When the eggs hatch in the young apples, 
however, and the larvae mature, the fruit is one-sided 
and knotty and does not develop properly. On leaving the 
fruit the larvae enter the soil to a depth of from six to eight 
inches. Stirring the soil as by plowing does no good, since 
the larvae will burrow down again as soon as brought to 
the surface. They turn to pupae in about three weeks and 
to mature beetles in about two weeks more, when they come 
to the surface, and spend the winter hiding under rubbish, 
weeds, stones, etc. Spraying and trap lanterns are useless. 
Clean culture, allowing no rubbish to remain on the ground, 
is the best preventive. Poultry in large numbers encouraged 
to scratch in the orchards will destroy many beetles. 
Plums can be used as traps, since the curculio prefers plums 
to apples and since they can be caught on plums by the jarring 
method. Neglected plum orchards, however, furnish a 
good breeding place for the insect, since a much larger percentage 
reach maturity in plums than in apples. Prof. 
Steadman's bulletin giving a full account of his experiments 
will appear soon. 

Bitter rot of apples is attracting considerable attention 
in southern Missouri. Prof. J. T. Stinson, of the South Missouri 
Fruit Experiment Station, at Mountain Grove, reported 
the saving of 60 per cent of the crop last year by 
spraying with Bordeaux mixture, where unsprayed orchards 
were total failures. This year there was much less bitter </seg>

237 

rot than last year. Where apples were sprayed throughout 
the season many fruits were rusted by the Bordeaux mixture. 
Ben Davis was badly hurt. Jonathan and Willow 
Twig were injured a little. Winesap and Plum Cider were 
uninjured. H. von Sehrenk, of the United States Department 
of Agriculture, reported similar injury to the saim* 
varieties in Illinois, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. Bitter 
rot begins late in the season. Spraying for it is begun earl v 
in Julv. 

For peach leaf curl, W. H. Hoag recommended spraying 
with full strength Bordeaux before the flowers open and 
with half strength after the flowers fall. Since the disease 
lives over winter in the buds, spraying is likely to show as 
good results the following season as during the season the 
spraying is done. 

G. W. Hopkins, of Springfield, Mo., in discussing peachgrowing, 
said that trees that were cut back to the snow line 
after the hard winter of '98-'99 never thoroughly recovered. 
The same is true of trees that were not pruned at all. Trees 
that had the main limbs cut back to within two and one-half 
feet of the trunks entirely recovered and produced good crops 
the past year. 

THE IOWA MEETING. 

The Iowa Horticultural Society met at Des Moines, December 
10 to 13, 1901. The attendance was much smaller 
than at the Missouri meeting. The fruit display was not as 
large and there was naturally considerable difference in 
character between it and the Missouri display. Many of the 
varieties seen at St. Joseph were prominent at Des Moines, 
but some of the new varieties in the Iowa display showed 
traces of crab stock. It is natural that Iowa apple-growers 
should attempt to obtain hardy varieties just as those of 
Missouri seek late keepers. 

An important feature of the meeting was the adoption of 
resolutions favoring the establishment of a state department </seg>

            <seg id="p239">

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

of horticulture to include pomology, vegetable gardening, 
floriculture, and forestry, and to be coordinate with the state 
department of agriculture, instead of being included in it, 
as at present. 

The program of the Iowa meeting seemed somewhat novel 
to a Nebraskan on account of the space given to papers on 
the growing and use of garden vegetables. To the writer 
this seems a desirable practice, for although the men who 
are commercially interested in vegetable-growing rarely attend 
our meetings, I see no reason why they may not be induced 
to do so. Then, too, in Nebraska we have many farmers 
who are interested in growing both vegetables and fruits, 
not commercially, but for their own use, who, though they 
do not attend our meetings, get many valuable suggestions 
from our reports. Another noticeable feature of the Iowa 
program was the number of papers on topics relating to 

The Iowa society, like our own, continues to consider forestry 
a part of horticulture, though Iowa has a forestry as 
sociation just as we have. The writer believes this the wisest 
plan to follow, since in the prairie states forestry and 
horticulture are so closely related that they can scarcely 
be separated. 

The importance of choosing varieties and methods of culture 
with reference to local conditions, which was noted 
many times in the course of the Missouri meeting, was em 
phasized even more by members of the Iowa society. The 
necessity of developing local varieties which will be adapted 
to the climates of their own localities was made especially 
prominent. J. Sexton, of Ames, in a paper on the topic, 
"Why We Should Grow Our Own Trees," urged that trees 
for the prairie states should be grown here instead of being 
purchased from the East and South. Mr. Patton, of Charles 
City, in northern Iowa, reported poor results from the use 
of both Eastern and Platte river forms of the red cedar, 
but had good success with cedars secured north of his local- </seg>

My. Many catalpas from Illinois had been planted, but most 
of them winter-killed ; a few trees, however, survived. Seed 
selected from these trees produced trees about 50 per cent 
of which were hardy. Secretary Latham, of the Minnesota 
Horticultural Society, said that a few large catalpa trees 
are growing and bearing seed in Minneapolis. The seed of 
these trees is being planted with the expectation of securing 
hardy catalpas for the North. Prof. N. E. Hansen, of the 
South Dakota Agricultural College, spoke of the necessity 
of securing northern and western seed in order to have 
hardy trees for his state. Mr. A. T. Erwin, of the Iowa 
Agricultural College, in a paper on Leaf Study, gave several 
illustrations of the adaptation of plants to their surroundings. 
On the experiment station grounds at Ames, 
Americana plums ripened their wood and lost their leaves 
one or two weeks earlier than the Chicasaws, which are natives 
of the southern states. Siberian Larches dropped their 
leaves five weeks before the native species. Scions of common 
apples continued growth long after the Russian sorts 
upon which they were grafted had dropped their leaves. 
Mr. N. K. Fluke, of Davenport, reported finding pecans 
growing on the Mississippi river in Iowa farther north than 
they usually grow. Seeds from these trees were sent to 
Michigan and the trees produced from them have stood the 
hardest winters, while trees from the ordinary southern 
seed winter-kills. To show that plants become adapted to 
dry climates as well as to cold ones, Mr. Erwin spoke of the 
common observation among Iowa dealers to the effect that 
celery from Kalamazoo, Mich., wilts much more quickly 
when exposed for sale than celery from Kearney, Neb. 

W. A. Burnap introduced the discussion of local horticultural 
societies. He believes that local societies may aid 
or injure the state society according to how they are conducted. 
Local societies, he held, should meet frequently at 
the homes of members for informal discussions and comparison 
of methods, instead of holding regular meetings in </seg>

            <seg id="p241">
240 


public halls and presenting set papers. Secretary Latham, 
of Minnesota, told of their three local societies. Members 
of each local society must pay nn annual membership fee of 
at least ?1. If the local society delivers one-fourth of all 
these fef$ to the state society, all of the local members bocome 
members of the state organization. Secretary Barnes, 
of the Kansas Horticultural Society, reported forty local 
societies. Publications of the state societies are sent to its 
own members first and afterward to local societies for distribution 
among their members. A delegate from Missouri 
reported the plan followed by some local societies of that 
state. During the summer months meetings are held at the 
homes of the members and during the winter months in a 
town hall. 

The relation of horticulture to education was discussed 
by several speakers. G. H. Van Houten, lately secretary of 
the State Board of Agriculture, spoke on Horticultural Education. 
President W. M. Beardshear, of the Iowa Agricultural 
College, gave an address on the educational effects of 
the beautiful in horticulture. H. C. Price, professor of 
horticulture at the Agricultural College, spoke of the horticultural 
work at the college and the experiment station and 
of the need of state support for station work in addition to 
the funds secured from the United States government. He 
mentioned the amounts appropriated by the legislatures of 
some of the neighboring states to carry on horticultural 
work at their experiment stations. South Dakota, a state 
having fewer horticultural interests than many of the others, 
appropriated |10,000 for horticultural work, especially for 
the development of new varieties of fruits. A. E. Parsons 
spoke on horticulture in the ideal school. Dr. F. M. Powell 
urged the importance of having school gardens as an aid in 
teaching nature study. Secretary Barnes, of Kansas, 
thought five acres none too much for rural school grounds. 
There should be room for a sort of park or grove where the 
people of the neighborhood can meet on public occasions. </seg>

            <seg id="p242">
MISSOURI AND IOWA HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 

241 

Here should also be room for ball grounds and for gardens. 

Of the reports of those in charge of the horticultural society's 
experiment stations, that of Mr. Patten, of Charles 
.City, was especially interesting. He secured 1,300 apple 
seeds and 600 pear seeds last year from hand-crossed fruits. 
For this work pear pollen was received from Ames, Iowa, 
and Columbia, Mo. 

In the course of his paper on trees for timber and windbreaks 
in northwestern Iowa, P. F. Kinne recommended 
white or green ash as the best timbers for mechanical purposes. 
Honey Locust he considered good. It is hard, but 
not so tough and elastic as ash. Larch is one of the best 
timbers for covering sheds. He would plant catalpa, ash, 
walnut, and soft maple, four by four feet apart and cut out 
the maple for fire wood when the trees begin to crowd. He 
recommended red cedar and Austrian pine for wind-breaks. 
W. M. Bomberger reported better results with apples where 
they were protected by evergreens than where they were unprotected. 
He believes that belts of evergreens to protect 
orchards from severe winter winds are more reliable than 
cover crops. N. J. Graham recommended southwest slopes 
as sites for peach orchards since peaches can not stand the 
extremely cold winds of northern slopes. In the latitude 
of Des Moines from protected trees he has raised five crops 
in nine years. The writer was somewhat surprised to hear 
so many men recommend planting peaches on the south side 
of hills or belts of trees to protect them from winter winds, 
as he has been accustomed to think that the advantage of 
protection from the south winds of summer is more important 
than the protection from the north winds of winter. 

Silas Wilson presented a paper on grape-growing, in 
which he recommended McPipe grape as the best variety of 
all. In season it is the same as Worden. The methods he 
recommended for planting grapes led to considerable discussion 
as to how much the side roots of young grape plants 
should be cut back. Secretary Latham, of Minnesota, did

not believe in long roots. He would shorten side roota to 
four inches. 

Mr. E. E. Little, of the agricultural experiment station at 
Ames, read a general paper on tomato-growing. He advocated 
a selection of seed at home instead of depending on 
seedsmen for it. The paper covered the whole field of culture 
methods and varieties for early market, main crop, canning, 
and forcing. 

Two papers were presented by young ladies from the school 
of domestic science at Ames College, one on the food value 
of fruits and vegetables and the other on vegetable and fruit 
salads. 

COMMERCIAL ORCHARDING. 

By H. W. Marshall. 

Although commercial orcharding is as yet in its infancy 
in Nebraska, still on drawing conclusions regarding its future, 
by taking into consideration our location as being one 
in which we may justly have good reasons to believe will 
naturally retain a fair market for most of our staple fruits, 
and the fact that fruit can be raised and raised in abundance, 
we have no reasons to doubt but that the present 
members of our Society, who are so favored by Providence 
as to be living, and living in Nebraska in from twenty-five 
to fifty years from now, on looking back to where we now 
are will be thoroughly convinced that along about 1900, 
1901, and 1902 commercial orcharding in Nebraska was indeed 
in its infancy. 

Without taking into consideration the few commercial orchards 
that are now in existence in our state, the family orchards 
which are now growing on far the greater majority 
of farms in eastern and central Nebraska, the immense 
Bount of fruit they produce, the general satisfaction they 
e, the great dependence the families residing on said </seg>

            <seg id="p244">
243 


farms hare in them, the goodly per cent of the entire food 
sustenance of these families that come from these orchards, 
may be taken as an indication of what may be expected of 
the orcharding industry in the future. 

So greatly is the family orchard prized by the average 
Nebraskan that in case a farm is put on the market one of 
the principal inducements held out to the prospective purchaser 
is the number of bearing fruit trees and the amount 
of small fruit growing on the farm. In fact, we find that 
in advertising, agents or owners of farms, when endeavoring 
to sell, give as much it not more space to a description of 
the orchard and other fruit resources than is used in describing 
the modern two-story residence, the elegant tame 
grass pastures, etc. 

The commercial orchard will in the future discount the 
small or family orchard from the fact that the planter or 
owner must necessarily have devoted considerable time and 
expense to it, even by the time it is planted, hence, financially 
interested, he will then, to a good degree, very naturally 
go in to make all or the very best out of it that he 
can. He will spare no pains to learn the best manner in 
which to proceed, and will do all he possibly can to derive 
the greatest amount of profit therefrom. In other wordmust 
be his primary object and ambition to make orcharding 
an unqualified success, and not a secondary matter, as 
is really the case with ninety-nine out of every hundred 
growers of small or family orchards. 

LOCATION. 

While some locations as regards the lay of land are much 
more favorable than others for orcharding, still an orchard 
can be raised on almost any kind of a location (especially 
as long as you stay out of the low valleys), the planter taking 
into consideration the location he is to use and act accordingly, 
that is, work to such ends as are necessary for 
that particular location. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HOKTICULTUEAL SOCIETY. 

While there should be no set distance for planting the 
different kind of fruit trees, from the fact that the different 
elevations, exposures, etc., in different parts of the state render 
it necessary to vary the distances, it is an invariable rule 
that a southwest slope should have trees more closely 
planted; a west and south or slightly southeast slope next; 
we might also class with these a high level tract, with the 
northeast slope the farthest of any. Any location should 
have some protection from the winds. Also, would add that, 
whatever the location, it is a safe rule to follow to make the 
most dense break on the southwest or south and west. The 
high level tract has greater need of wind-break than any 

The northeast slope is generally conceded by horticulturists 
to be the bast for the growing of an apple orchard 
especially, although there are exceptions, even to this rule, 
as, for instance, after the noted hard winter of '98 and '99 
it was observed in different orchards that trees on this slope 
suffered more from the intense cold than the same varieties 
differently located. However, be this as it may, should I 
have my own choice as to the location of an apple orchard, I 
would choose a not very high northeast slope. 

The idea of leaning trees to the southwest in planting can 
not be too highly recommended. A tree limbed low in the 
nursery, then planted leaning to the southwest at an angle 
of 75 to 80 degrees, has a far better chance to succeed than 
the higher limbed tree planted erect. 

As most neighborhoods are to some extent infested with 
rabbits, I should consider it time well spent the first, second, 
and third years after planting, to protect the bodies of trees 
during the winter and guard against these enemies. Although 
tar paper or building paper is used to some extent 
for this purpose, as is also a board, which when watersoaked 
can be wrapped around the tree, still in communities 
where the orchardist has access to fields of standing cornstalks 
(which is generally the case with us in Nebraska) I </seg>


            <seg id="p246">
245 

should advise the tying of cornstalks around the tree rather 
than anything else we have seen or tried. On the average 
tree five cornstalks will amply protect it from the gnawing 
of rabbits, up until it has been three years planted, and they 
can be placed on very easily; the different stalks reaching 
up among the limbs without misplacing them on the body. 
A string can be tied just below the limbs and another just 
above the ground. These stalks may remain on, almost indefinitely, 
without injury to the tree, as the body of the tree 
will get sufficient air; neither can it be injured by drawing 
excessive heat from the sun, as is the case when tar paper is 
used and which always endangers the tree. 

The oft-repeated advice of horticulturists regarding the 
high state of cultivation necessary in the young orchard, 
we must accept as the best and we might say the only rule. 
The first two or three years after planting the orchard a 
cultivable crop may be raised among the trees without injury 
to them. Then as the trees attain fair size the growing 
of any crop among them should be discontinued, but the cultivation 
should be kept up (a disc being a good implement 
to use in the orchard at this stage). The object should be 
to keep the ground as level as possible, neither higher nor 
lower around the trees than elsewhere in the orchard. Cultivation 
should be kept up until the orchard is apparently 
old enough to bear, then sowed to some of the clover crops 
or some grass that will keep the soil as loose as possible. 
Then during the bearing stage it should now and then be 
plowed up and worked some, then sowed back again, the orchardist 
acting in accordance with his own best judgment, 
gained by studying the trees and their apparent needs. Also 
during the progress of the orchards from the time the growing 
of crops is abandoned up to its bearing stage, the manner 
or degree of cultivation should be studied and applied accordingly, 
as some years more cultivating is necessary than 
others, also some parts of the season require a higher state 
of cultivation than other parts of the same season. </seg>

            <seg id="p247">
246 


Although it has never become a very general practice, 
still I am convinced that late fall and early winter mulching 
of fruit trees of all kinds is a splendid treatment, each and 
every year from planting, on through the different stages 
of development and bearing. 

As to the different kinds of trees for the commercial orchard, 
I should name the apple, cherry, peach, and plum as 
the leaders. Any of these can be grown to a profit. The 
plum orchard should be planted to itself, the different varieties 
intermixed so as to fertilize, especially, the American 
varieties. 

When apple trees are planted the proper distance, that is, 
so they will be comparatively so when at bearing age, then 
peach or cherry trees can be planted among them so that all 
can be successfully grown together, either the peach or 
cherry trees having attained their age and size, done their 
bearing, and most varieties of both having done their duty, 
lived their day and out of the way before the apples have 
attained the stage where they could suffer any injury from 
the other trees. 

Peach trees will begin bearing at as early as two years 
from the time of setting. 

Careful measurements tallied an average of 1£ bushels 
of fine Wright peaches during this last fall per tree that 
were planted during April, 1898, having been initiated by 
the noted winter of '98 and '99, with several other varieties 
doing equally as well. 

Any of our standard varieties of cherries will begin bearing 
to a profit at from three to five years of age. 

Both peaches and cherries have always been in good demand 
at from fair to good prices. Both being perishable 
fruits, however, naturally renders their future price somewhat 
of a speculation, although the prospect for a contiuu 
ance of at least fair prices seems favorable. 

The prospect for the future price of the plum must neces- </seg>

            <seg id="p248">
247 


mast also the summer apple, but not so with the winter apple. 
We hare no more reason to be fearful for the price of 
the winter apple than we have for wheat, corn, live stock, or 
any product of the farm, and the profits to the careful, 
fairly successful orchardist is considerably greater than that 
of the farmer or stock-raiser on an equal scale. 

We may then conclude that the pursuit of commercial orcharding 
promises as much to the careful, thinking, studious 
Nebraskan as any other pursuit within our reach. 

To all to tchom these presents may come, Greeting: 

Know ye, that, reposing special confidence in Mr. O. H.

REPORT OF THE PURDUM EXPERIMENTAL 
STATION. 

January 7, 1902. 

To tlie Officers and Members of the Nebraska Horticultural 

Association: 

Purdum Station is located one mile from corner of Cherry 
county and is under the supervision of the State Horticultural 
Society. 

I herewith submit this, my second annual report, for the 
year 1901, of the work done and results for this station for 
your consideration. 

Although the past year has not been one entirely favorable 
to the orchardist, owing to deficient moisture, coupled 
with excessive heat, yet with these unfavorable conditions 
we are grateful to be able to report progress. Trees not 
carrying a crop of fruit hare made growth as follows: 
Peach, apricot, and plum, 3 to 4 feet ; apple and pear, 2 to 3 
feet ; and cherry, 1 to 2 feet. Trees carrying fruit show less 
growth, corresponding to the amount of fruit carried to 
maturity. 

Results and 3'ields of fruit for the past year are as follows : 
Our orchard being young, only quick-bearing varieties have 
borne, these being mostly stone fruits and berries, although 
a few apples and a sample of pears were produced. Peaches 
bore sparingly owing to a destruction of fruit buds from low 
temperature during the winter of '90 and '91. Varieties 
Bailey and Wright carried fruit buds safely through a temperature 
of 25° below zero. And matured a small quantity 
of fruit. All other varieties of peaches at this station carrying 
fruit buds suffered complete destruction of buds with 
this low temperature. It is gratifying to notice at this time 
that special varieties of Japan plum and also Russian apri- </seg>

            <seg id="p250">

PURDUM EXPERIMENTAL STATION. 

cot were able to carry a per cent of their fruit buds safely 
through this period of low temperature. 

Cherries gave a fair yield of fruit. Trees four years from 
planting made a yield of 12 quarts per tree, the English 
Morello being the best cropper and best variety for profit 
that we have yet fruited. Early Richmond, Montmorency, 
Ostheim, and Vladimir are other varieties giving satisfactory 
results. Plums (American) gave abundant crops, trees 
4 years old making a yield of one bushel per tree, most productive 
and best varieties for commercial purposes that we 
have fruited so far being Wyant, Hawkeye, and De Soto in 
the order named. 

Grapes have not yet been fruited successfully at this station. 
The past season promised a good crop early, but owing 
to excessive rains at the time of blooming the crop failed. 
A few clusters of fruit were matured of fair quality, 
weather being too dry to develop them to perfection. 

A few apples were produced of Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, 
Sheriff, and C. E. White; have thirty varieties under 
test to be reported later. Currants made a fair crop; varieties 
bearing were Victoria and Red Dutch. Other varieties 
under test are Versailles, Fay, Cherry, and White Grape, 
Gooseberries gave a good crop, those in bearing being 
Houghton and Downing. Have also the Pearl under test. 

Raspberries promised a heavy crop up till the time of 
ripening, the bushes being a mass of berries, but the dry 
weather cut them off. Some bushes, however, in sandy 
ground continued to ripen a fair quality of fruit until the 
middle of August in spite of the drouth and heat. Our chief 
reliance is a red variety the name of which we do not know. 
Other varieties fruiting are London and Palmer. 

This station has been recognized and is being used for the 
purpose for which instituted. Experience and advice have 
been asked for and given. So far as our experience has gone, 
I wish to say in this connection that our location is one in 
which the physical and climatic conditions are peculiar to </seg>

NEBRASKA STATB HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

our locality, and experience gained here will not always hold 
good in places where conditions are changed. To verify by 
example: the sandy nature of our soil makes it loose and 
porous. Air, light, heat, and moisture penetrate to a greater 
depth than in a more compact soil. Because of the loose 
condition of the soil it is advantageous to plant trees deep, 
20 to 24 inches, which would result in failure if practiced 
where conditions were changed to a heavy or compact soil. 
There are a number of reasons why deep planting is an 
advantage in this locality: 

1. The crown of the tree is protected from the trying conditions 
of climatic extremes. 

2. Roots are deep and less liable to suffer from protracted 
drouths. 

3. Trees have a better support in our loose soil against 
high winds. 

4. It admits of more thorough tillage of the soil without 
mangling the roots. I plow niy trees with an ordinary riding 
cultivator with a fifth shovel carried under the branches 
of the trees, suspended from an arm and working as deep 
in the soil as the tree shovels on the plow. This cultivator 
is alternated with the disc. 

My experience is that moderately deep tillage of the soil 
on this station gives better results in conserving moisture, 
aerating the soil, and supplying plant food than thin, shallow 
tillage. 

The past season was one of almost continuous drouth during 
the months of tree growth, there being a period of 79 
days, from June 18 to September 5, with but one rain — July 
25. Our system of deep planting and thorough tillage carried 
our trees, some of them with a crop of fruit, safely 
through this unparalleled siege of drouth and heat. Beginning 
with the 5th of September and lasting for two weeks 
we- had rain daily, receiving 10 or 12 inches in the two weeks, 
so that the ground was put in good shape for winter. 

In conclusion, I wish to thank your Society for liberality </seg>

REPORT OF THE MINDEN EXPERIMENTAL 
STATION. 

To the Nebraska Horticultural Society: 

For the Minden Experimental Station I beg leave to report 
as follows: 

LOCATION. 

The station is located on my farm two miles west and 1J 
miles north of Minden, Kearney county, Nebraska, the same 
being the northeast quarter of sec. 3, twp. 6 north, range 15 
west Sixth Principal Meridian, therefore about one hundred 
seventy-five miles west of the Missouri river. 

SOIL. 

The soil is a rich, dark, sandy loam about three feet deep. 
Under this dark loam is a deep, hard bottom of clay. The 
surface of the country is perfectly level. 

RAINFALL. 

The average rainfall for twenty years during the month 
of May prior to 1897, according to the government statistician 
at Minden, Joel Hull, was 5.33 inches. During the 
same month in 1901 it was .83 inches and June, July, and 
August were far below the average. September was far 
above the average in rainfall. During these months the 
memorable hot winds also added its destructive power to </seg>

1900. 

The stock planted for experimental purposes for the year 
1900, a report of which for said year will be found on p. 144 
of the annual report of the Society for 1900, vol. 32, has 
grown beyond expectation. One tree has grown over three 
feet. Two of the cherry (Terry) trees bore fruit and in 
addition have grown remarkably fast. 

The White Grape currant is doing fine, but the four varieties, 
viz., London Market, Prince Albert, President Wilder, 
and White Transparent, have been winter-killed. 

1901. 

The stock planted for experimental purposes for 1901 

resulted as follows: 

Roses:

REPORT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION AT SAN 
DOZ, SHERIDAN COUNTY, IN THE EIGHTH 
HORTICULTURAL DISTRICT. 

Jules A. Sandoz, Director. 

Mr. Sandoz moved into this country during the year 1884. 
It is situated about 420 miles northwest of Omaha and elevation 
about 4,000 feet above sea level. 

The first year be started with 100 trees of unknown varieties, 
and the first winter-killed about two-thirds, and the 
third year after he fruited a few Hyslop crab and a few 
Duchess apples from some of the remainder. 

He tried planting on bottom land, where it was only a 
few feet to water, but found it a failure. 

Then he planted 100 plum trees on dry upland, which 
proved very successful, and now he has fruiting De Soto, 
Wyant, Rolling Stone, Hawkeye, and many others, among 
which the Sandoz, a native, is especially promising. 

Of cherries he has fruited the Dyehouse, Montmorency, 
Ostheime, Wragg, and others which seem to stand the climate 
well. 

He has tried many varieties of apples, and among those 
that have stood the test of climate are the Florence, Yellow 
Transparent, Duchess, Mann, N. W. Greening, Wolf River, 
Walbridge, Iowa Blush, Longfield, and many others not so 
well known. 

The Bokara No. 3 peach has stood the winter, while Hills 
Chili and Sea Eagle froze back. 

Grapes must be covered in winter to insure success. 

Gooseberry, currant, and June berry do well. 

Mr. Sandoz recommends plums on their own roots for his </seg>

setting young trees and heading very low. In 
cultivation he is an advocate of clean cultivation with no 
cropping of the orchard.

THE BENEFIT OP ADVERTISEMENT THROUGH 
EXPOSITIONS. 

By J. H. Hadkinson 

This subject, though not announced so, will be purely 
horticultural, for this is about the extent of my sparse 
knowledge. Nebraska's horticultural advertisement dates 
back to the early TO's, when our late lamented co-workers, 
Hon. J. Sterling Morton, ex-Gov. R. W. Furnas, and Mr. J. 
H. Masters took a carload of Nebraska fruits east and secured 
a much valued trophy in the shape of a medal, and 
from that time on Nebraska has been winning medals, or 
rather snatching some as brands from the burning, and 
there are now in the archives of the Nebraska Horticultural 
Society about twenty-five medals, comprising Wilder, 
Horticultural Society, and Exposition medals. (These medals 
can be seen in the Historical Society's museum, Library 
building, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Neb.) 
Even one of these medals was captured in Europe from the 
Paris Exposition, and three from World's Fair, Chicago, 
from Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Omaha, and several 
from Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, N. Y. 

The greater portion of these medals was displayed at the 
Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Omaha, where they created 
no little comment and were added to by honors received 

It being my privilege to represent Nebraska horticulturally 
at the Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, it was decided 
by the State Horticultural Society to again display 
these medals at this exposition, and I must say they were a 
great surprise and advertisement for our state horticultur- </seg>

            <seg id="p260">
259 


Many old-time national horticulturists admired them, and 
told the writer how they had striven to be the possessor of 
them for their respective states. Others who knew little, or 
rather had not till this time considered Nebraska from a 
'horticultural standpoint, made inquiries, examined our fruit 
on the tables, and passed favorable comments on our fruit 
and state. 

Not being in possession of the Paris medal at this time, 
but being officially notified of the award, a card was printed 
as follows : "Nebraska received second premium for apples 
at Paris." This created no little surprise, as this display 
was in the heart of the eastern and Canadian fruit belt. 
Many visitors stopped, looked, and read and afterwards 
asked, "Is this really true?" When explanation was made 
and proof exhibited, they were amazed, and Nebraska was 
elevated horticulturally in their minds by this line of advertisement, 
and it surely was a benefit. 

At the World's Fair, Chicago, Supt. F. W. Taylor displayed 
a very large bunch of grapes about 36 inches long 
and 24 inches in diameter at shoulder (this was made up). 
Being so large, it attracted a great deal of attention and 
was the means of many more visitors stopping to look at the 
exhibit and inquiring about Nebraska. At the Pan-American 
Exposition, eight years afterwards, I was asked about 
this large bunch of grapes and the large vine on which it 
was suspended. I forgot to say a very large grape vine was 
procured to attach this bunch to. This was not made up, 
but a purely natural product from Lancaster county. 

A large apple displayed in same manner created no small 
amount of surprise and inquisitrveness which ended in more 
inquiries of our horticultural resources. At the Trans-Mississippi 
Exposition, Supt. Youngers displayed a large vine 
spreading over fully one-third of the large hall and covered 
with natural-sized bunches of grapes. This created comment, 
and was augmented by Grape day, which meant that 
Nebraska distributed seven tons of grapes to visitors on thii </seg>

            <seg id="p261">
260 


day. This was followed by peach and apple days, when these 
fruits were given away free to all visitors, none going away 
empty-handed, and some making rounders. Being at that 
time in the employ of the exposition, I had a good opportunity 
to hear and find out how this kind of advertisement was 
received by the public, and I can here state many comments 
both of surprise and gratitude were expressed about Nebraska's 
productiveness and liberality. If I remember 
rightly, fully 20,000 visitors partook of this horticultural 
feast on each day. 

The Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo being so far 
away and funds for this exhibit limited, the method pursued 
at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, Omaha, could not be 
followed there. Along with the display of medals mentioned 
earlier, a neat, attractive exhibit was kept up, the early part 
of exhibit being plums, named hybrids and crosses, and 
mostly of the Americana group (the varieties grown in the 
locality of exposition being mostly Domestica and Japs) created 
comment and admiration of visitors. The high color 
of the Wild Goose and the different shades of plums exhibited 
made an attractive exhibit on the whole. This exhibit 
eft plums was later awarded the Wilder silver medal by the 
American Pomological Society. This silver medal represents 
highest award of above society. 

Being surrounded by other states exhibiting fruit, 
namely, New York, Wisconsin, Illinois, and province of Toronto, 
Can., Nebraska had to do something to hold her own, 
when Wisconsin, our close neighbor, was exhibiting Wolf 
River and Wealthy in quantity, the former a very large, attractive 
apple, the latter about medium, uniform, and very 
attractive. (I must here give Wisconsin credit for her 
highly -colored and uniform Wealthy.) These are good show 
apples for the general public and command attention. At 
this time the Nebraska exhibit was mostly plum, peaches, 
and, as they are smaller and in general less attractive to the </seg>


            <seg id="p262">
261 

the attention of the visitor to the Nebraska exhibit so our 
state could gain horticultural advertisement. A pair of large 
birch bark shoes was procured and filled with fruit and displayed 
with a sign "We are standing np for Nebraska. 
These are our understandings." This drew the crowd, who 
then looked at our exhibit, which was mostly scientific at 
this time. This gave the desired results. 

New York had a large scientific exhibit and did not at 
this time draw the general visitor, their admirers being 
mostly horticulturists and scientists. The dull color of the 
eastern fruits does not show up well on the table to the 
public eye. There is a question on which I am decidedly 
unbalanced, and it is about the kind of exhibit to make for 
best results of our advertisement, viz., scientific or for the 
general public. If a scientific exhibit is made there must be 
smaller varieties of all kinds of fruits, which by a person of 
little experience are rated very low. On the other hand, a 
well-informed person knows their value. Large, showy fruit 
draws the crowd. I can truly vouch for this, for when Nebraska 
exhibited Jonathan, Ben Davis, and Missouri Pippin 
nothing else was necessary. At this time a surplus of Jonathan 
were on hand, and were distributed to visitors, even 
eastern people partaking of the wild west fruit and asking, 
"Did this really grow in Nebraska?" This same question 
was asked even by Nebraskans who visited the exposition, 
and the express receipts were shown in one particular case 
to convince the Nebraska skeptic. 

Therefore, under these conditions, I feel it is needful as 
well as a benefit to advertise horticulturally at expositions 
and also at home in our own state. There are many of our 
citizens who are not aware what is being done horticulturally 
at home. 

I have wandered somewhat from the direct sense of this 
paper, and will now sum up the situation as briefly as possible, 
though I give no apology for earlier diversion, it being 
almost necessary as an explanation* </seg>

            <seg id="p263">

The question will be asked, Where do we get any direct 
benefit financially from exposition advertisement? 

The direct benefit we get, though not financial at this time, 
is in placing our state horticulturally where we belong, and 
showing up to the outside world what we are doing and 
what can be done. Truly, Nebraska is not every inch of it a 
fruit state, but there is room for great development We 
are yet only in our swaddling clothes. Even York state, 
Michigan, and other states do not grow the same kind of 
fruits in all sections and not all over their respective states. 

The indirect or later benefits come through a class of 
citizens coming to our state from the over-crowded eastern 
states, buying up farms, business blocks, city homes, and 
going into business and bringing money and brains to help 
develop our state, making it stronger financially. The eastern 
homeseeker who comes amongst us is in most cases looking 
for farm lands, and being from a fruit section, he naturally 
looks for these surroundings, and I know of many 
cases where orchards have sold farms. These farms are 
later divided up among his children, who locate, plant more 
fruit and fruit-trees, raise more crops, and ultimately our 
merchants, bankers, nurserjmen, and railroads are benefited 
through exposition advertising, and, last, our state 
socially and financially. 

A COMPARISON OF FRUIT-GROWING— WITH AND 
WITHOUT IRRIGATION. 

By L. O. Williams. 

"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden." 
(Genesis 2-10.) 

Here was the genesis of fruit-growing under irrigation. 
There in the garden of Eden, which is accepted as a type of 
perfection in all horticulture, was given man's first lesson 
in the use of water in connection with gardening. We have </seg>


            <seg id="p264">
no authentic record of the time when man first began to 
garden without water rights, but we may safely assume that 
gardening and fruit-growing have declined in direct proportion 
to the distance removed from water privileges. 

Cultivation, as used to-day in our most advanced methods 
of horticulture, goes a long way in supplanting ancient irrigation, 
but the horticulturist who can combine both cultivation 
and irrigation must naturally occupy the front rank in 
successful fruit-growing. When we consider that about 
nine-tenths by weight of all our edible fruits is composed 
of water, we may better understand the necessity for supplying 
this needful element to our fruit-producing vines and 

The strawberry, which is the most popular of our fruits, 
has so large a composition of water that it has been styled 
"flavored water" by Mr. Kellogg, of Wisconsin. Its chemical 
formula might be written H 20 SO 10 — "S" standing for 
strawberry. The dependence of this fruit for its sustenance 
on a liberal supply of water must be recognized and gratified 
before it can be made to yield its nominal quota of fruit. 
Hardly a season passes but that the strawberry crop is pronounced 
a partial failure in many localities because of 
drouth. What is true of this fruit is true also in a greater 
or less degree with all our small fruits. 

Drouth also has made serious attacks here and there every 
season upon our tree fruits. The annual loss to fruit-growers 
of the United States from lack of moisture must reach 
into the millions annually. A careful survey of the fruitproducing 
regions of this country, I think, will show that 
those states or localities where irrigation is practiced or 
where rainfall is naturally abundant are the greatest fruitproducing 
regions. We know that California ranks first in 
horticultural products, not alone because of its climate, but 
more because of its Pacific moisture and mountain streams 
suitable for irrigation. 

Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington are also com- </seg>

            <seg id="p265">

ing to the front in fruit-growing because of their water advantages. 
When Iowa and Nebraska, with their boundless 
wealth of soil and sunshine, fall short on potatoes we take 
Greeley's advice and go west towards Colorado to supply 
our lack. When strawberries are gone from our home beds, 
Colorado and Oregon load whole cars with "flavored water" 
and tempt us to continue our festival with this delightful 
beverage. Does our apple crop fail or fall short because of 
the drouth, Idaho and Washington come to our relief with 
their well-watered Bellflowers and Pippins. 

Throughout our season for fresh native fruits, whether 
our crop be light or heavy, these favored sections to the west 
of us continue to send their peaches, prunes, pears, and citrous 
fruits pell-mell into our markets, tempting us to pav 
a royalty for watered stock. When profits can not be realized 
from the shipment of these fruits in a fresh state, the 
canneries and the evaporators are set to work and thus supply 
our wants through the remainder of the year. 

Now, as long as there is a demand, so long will there be 
an effort made to supply it. The demand for fruit in all 
lines, I believe, is continually on the increase, and it should 
be the aim of the home-grower to supply it as far as possible. 

Nebraska has resources in the way of fruit-growing that 
have as yet only been dreamed of. The possibilities of irrigation 
by canal within the state have been estimated as covering 
2,000,000 acres. Add to this another million that can 
be watered easily by artificial means and we have a resource 
for horticultural products that may make our sister states 
to the west of us look well to their laurels. 

I will not attempt to give many particulars showing the 
possibilities of Nebraska for fruit growing under irrigation. 
Those better versed than I can and have already given sufficient 
examples to cause encouragement for others to go forward 
and plant with hope. Mr. I. A. Fort, in vol. 27 (1896) 
of the State Horticultural Report, cites numerous examples 
of fruit-growing with success under irrigation in his section </seg>


            <seg id="p266">
of the state. My experience the past two seasons has demonstrated 
to my mind the advantage of "watered stocks.'' 
In my nursery work here on the ranch I can show a growth 
of 6£ feet made the past season by strong-growing varieties 
of the apple from yearling "cut backs." Two waterings were 
given. In the cherry orchard of 5,000 trees under the canal 
the growth of trees is largely in proportion to the amount of 
water given. But one watering has been given the entire orchard 
each season in the month of June. Late in the fall of 
1899 a few rows of the orchard were watered to test the benefits 
of November irrigation. Tlje results were shown this 
season by a marked additional growth and vigor in the portion 
of the orchard thus watered. 

Strawberry plantings have done well when set early, and 
on soil with plenty of humus in it have, with the use of water, 
made a fine growth. 

The most fruitful apple orchard in this section is found 
near Gibbon, located in the valley of the Wood river. This 
stream, Nile-like, overflows its banks in time of freshets and 
sends its waters to nourish that portion of the orchard located 
near its banks. Other small orchards I am told can 
be found in a flourishing condition on the island in the Platte 
south and east of Gibbon, where the trees receive water by 
subirrigation. In visiting the orchard of J. A. Hogg, north 
and east of Shelton, last fall, I was impressed with his evident 
discouragement in orcharding without irrigation. Mr. 
Hogg has been a diligent and persevering worker in horticulture 
for the past twenty years. His orchard of forty acres, 
however, has proven a doubtful profit for his investment of 
labor and money, the one thing lacking being water. 

To those of my fellow fruit-growers located in southwestern 
Iowa and its complement in southeastern Nebraska, where 
we are wont to look for our largest supplies of interior fruits, 
let me urge you to harness up your windmills, build your 
reservoirs, and turn aside your water courses ere you lose 
the prestige you now hold as a horticultural Eden. At the </seg>

risk of making comparisons that may seem odious I venture 
it, however, that the time will come when the so-called arid 
regions of this state will become, because of their irrigation 
advantages, the reservoirs of horticultural products. 

Here, when other sources fail, you may look for supplies 
to meet your needs. Meanwhile, let the owners of irrigated 
lands pursue their planting. 

THE "DAMPING-OFF" DISEASE AND ITS RELATION 
TO DISEASE OF CARNATIONS. 

By John L. Sheldon. 

The disease of seedlings known as "damping-off" is common 
in the greenhouse, garden, and field. Seedlings of weeds 
are affected as well as those of the cultivated plants of corn, 
millet, clover, beet, cucumber, cabbage, and flowers. The 
disease may be recognized by the top-heavy appearance of 
the seedlings and their pale-green color, as if they were suffering 
from insufficient water or food. The stem of the seedlings 
will be found upon examination to be shrunken near 
the surface of the soil, and the inside tissues are so weakened 
that they are unable to hold the little plants erect; in consequence 
they soon fall to the ground, and finally die. 

The name "damping-off" would seem to indicate that 
dampness is the cause of the disease, which is not the case. 
While dampness is one of the factors, as well as partial 
shade, high temperature, and rich soil, the disease is mostly 
caused by fungi, which enter the seedlings from the soil. 
These fungi themselves are plants composed in general of 
slender, branched, white or slightly colored threads or filaments 
which resemble our common mildews and molds. 

Usually the fungus does not show on the outside of the 
seedlings, but if sections from the inside be examined with a 
microscope, the small threads will be found extending 
through the shrunken portions of the stems. By placing the </seg>


            <seg id="p268">
267 

seedlings where they can be kept moist for a few hoars, the 
filaments will gradually grow outward and cover them with 
a white, cottony, mold-like substance. 

When seeds are sown so thickly that the seedlings crowd 
against each other when they come up, the fungus readily 
extends from one to the others. The disease usually spreads 
in circles where the seeds are sown broadcast, but follows 
the rows when they are planted in drills. 

The fungi which cause "damping-off" are able to live on 
the decaying plant material in the soil, such as leaves, straw, 
roots, etc., but if they happen to come in contact with a tender 
and juicy young seedling, they apparently find it a delicacy 
from the way they take possession of it and devour the 
soft inside. In a short time the fungus will have extended 
into all parts of the seedling. 

There are a few fungi which kill young plants by first getting 
a start in the lower leaves that become injured in transplanting 
or in some other way, and which gradually grow 
from the dead portions of the leaves into the living ; however, 
this disease is not to be confused with "damping-off." 

It is known that "damping-off" may be caused by the 
spores of fungi becoming attached to the rough coats of certain 
seeds, the beet, for example. The conditions which are 
favorable for the growth of the seeds are also favorable for 
the growth of the spores of th&lt;t fungus, so that the seedling 
and fungus grow up side by side, or until the fungus changes 
its abode to the inside of the seedling. A few seeds have been 
found which failed to grow, probably because the fungus 
which covered the outside had prevented them from doing 
so. Whether the fungus was in the soil or attached to the 
seeds is not known, but from the manner in which it spread 
out in all directions from the seeds it seemed as if the spores 
must have been attached to the seeds. " 

Cuttings in the propagating bed also suffer from a disease 
similar to that affecting seedlings. The cuttings turn pale, 
wilt, and finally die ; a few may form roots and die later. An </seg>

examination of that part of the stem which is in the sand 
shows that it has begun to decay, the amount of decay and 
the distance which it has extended up the stem being dependent 
upon the conditions of moisture and warmth. Occasionally 
a white, cottony substance may be seen on the outside, 
much like that previously mentioned as occurring on 
seedlings which "damp-off;" if not visible it can be made to 
show by placing the cuttings in a moist chamber, the same as 
the seedliugs. 

Quite a number of plants which are propagated from cuttings 
are attacked. The fungi causing the disease also enter 
the cuttings from the sand, or may have been already in the 
stock plants from which the cuttings were made. Although 
cuttings are taken from apparently healthy plants, there is 
no absolute certainty that the fungus had not attacked them, 
but not to such an extent as to cause any perceptible injury, 
and especially if the disease is present in the greenhouse or 

It often occurs that small round worms, nematodes, are 
also found in the decaying stems; in all probability they follow 
Iht- fungus and feed upon the decaying matter in the 
stems and do not cause the disease. 

A disease similar to that attacking cuttings also occurs in 
the forcing beds in the greenhouse, and often causes considerable 
damage, especially to certain varieties of carnations. 
The disease may be introduced from the propagating 
bed, or the fungus causing it may be present in the soil. 
When it is present one year it will undoubtedly make its 
appearance the following year, unless all the soil is carefully 
removed and new soil put in its place, for the fungus 
is able to live in the soil from one year to the next, and perhaps 
for several years. 

The conditions for enabling the carnations to make a vig 
orous and rapid growth are also good for the fungus. While 
the fungus may not be active when the carnations are set in 
the beds, the increased warmth and moisture will help it to </seg>


            <seg id="p270">
269 

become so. The fungus produces an enormous number of 
spores which correspond to the seeds of such plants as corn 
and sunflowers. The spores may rest in the soil after the 
manner of sunflower seeds, but when the conditions for growing 
become right the fNingus begins to make its presence 
known by entering the carnations and causing them to wilt. 
The inside of the stem will be rotten and sometimes the root 
also. The disease is sometimes known as "stem-rot," "rootrot," 
and "wilt." In all probability the name "wilt" is the 
more correct one to use, since the fungus causing the disease 
of the carnation is the same as that causing the "wilt disease" 
of cow pea, cotton, and watermelon. 

What is of more interest to the gardener, horticulturist, 
and farmer is how to prevent or get rid of such diseases as 
"damping-off," "stem-rot," and "wilt," rather than a minute 
description of the fungus causing them. Very little can be 
done in the field, but in the seed bed and greenhouse there 
are a few means of prevention. Spraying with such fungicides 
as Bordeaux mixture have been tried, but they are of 
no appreciable value; covering the soil with air-sl;iki&gt;d lime 
has also been resorted to with a similar result, for the fungus 
causing the carnation "wilt" is able to grow where ther 
plenty of lime, in fact, it is able to grow where there is lime 
just as well, if not better, than the carnation can. About 
the only means that are of any value seem to be in loosening 
up the soil around the seedlings, in furnishing plenty of sunshine 
to prevent "drawing," and in sterilizing the soil to destroy 
any spores that may be present. The soil may be sterilized 
by dry heat, but the best results are obtained when it 
is subjected to steam heat for several hours. </seg>

SELF-STERILITY IN APPLES. 

By K. A. Emekson. 

Much has been written during the past few years about the 
self-sterility of pears, plums, and grapes. Horticulturists 
are now coming to talk about the necessity for cross-pollination 
in apples also. The matter was brought up at the last 
annual meeting of this- Society and a number of cases were 
mentioned, showing the advantages from mixing varieties of 
apples in the orchard instead of planting large blocks of one 
kind. (See Report for 1901, pp. 124 to 129). 

During the past two years the horticultural department of 
the University Experiment Station has been investigating 
self-sterility of apples. But before this work is described it 
may be well to make note of some of the work that has been 
done by other experimenters. M. B. Waite of the U. S. Department 
of Agriculture was the first to make a careful study 
of self-sterility in apples, his work having been done in 1890 
to 1893. His results were not published at once, but in his 
report on self-sterility of pears (Pollination of Pear Flowers, 
U. S. Dept. Agr., Div. Veg. Phys. &amp; Path., Bui. No. 5, p. 
81) he says: 

"The varieties of apples are more inclined to be sterile to 
their own pollen than the pears. With the former, in the 
great majority of cases, no fruit results from self-pollination. 
The results as a rule, however, were less clear-cut than in the 
pear, because with most of the self-sterile varieties an occasional 
fruit will set under self-pollination, and none of the 
varieties were very completely self-fertile." 

In an article on the Pollination of Pomaceous Fruits, published 
in the Yearbook of the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture for 
1898, pp. 167 to 180, Waite gives a more complete account of 
his experiments with apples. To determine whether a variety 
is self-sterile or not he covered flower buds with sacks 
of paper, cheese cloth, or mosquito-bar before the buds </seg>

            <seg id="p272">
271 

SELF-STERILITY IN APPLES. 

opened. The flowers in some of the sacks were carefully 
hand-pollinated with pollen of the same varieties and those 
in other sacks were crossed with pollen from different varieties. 
The results he secured are here quoted : 

"In a general way the results were similar to those obtained 
in the experiments with pears. The division of the 
varieties into self-fertile and self-sterile sorts was not nearly 
so well marked. Crossing gave decidedly better results in 
all cases than self-pollination. The Baldwin, which was experimented 
upon freely, may be cited as a variety that comes 
as near being self-fertile as any, and yet even this is far from 
being entirely so, for in the best trees the percentage of fruit 
resulting from self-pollination was not more than one-fourth 
of that which resulted from crossing. Some of the Baldwin 
trees, in fact, seemed to be self-sterile, and trees of all the 
varieties occasionally set self-pollinated fruit. . . . 

"The apples resulting from some of the experiments were 
collected and studied, and the results were found to be parallel 
with those obtained in the experiments with pears, the 
crosses being larger, more highly-colored, and better supplied 
with seed. For example, the hand-crossed Baldwin apples 
were highly colored, well-matured, and contained abundant 
seeds, while the self-fertilized fruits were only slightly colored, 
were of one-fourth to two-thirds the regular size, and 
seedless. . . . 

"The unsatisfactory character of the fruits obtained from 
self-pollination was more pronounced in the apples than in 
the pears, and gave still further evidence that self-pollination 
is not to be relied upon for_apple production, especially 
in unfavorable seasons. . . . 

"Although several orchards of single varieties of apples in 
Missouri have not yielded satisfactorily, yet the experience 
with large blocks of Ben Davis at the Olden fruit farm in 
that state, and in other extensive orchards in the West, where 
single varieties are planted in large blocks, shows that under 
certain circumstances crossing between different varieties is 
not necessary." </seg>

            <seg id="p273">

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

A couple of years ago S. W. Fletcher reported the results 
of investigations on self-sterility. (Cornell Univ., N. Y. Exp. 
Sta., Bui. No. 181.) The author of this bulletin agrees with 
Waite that : 

"Self -sterility is not a constant character with any variety. 
The same variety may be self-sterile in one place and 
nearly self-fertile in another." 

He classes the following varieties of apples as usually elffertile 
: Baldwin, Ben Davis, FaJlawater, Genet, Oldenburg, 
Rhode Island Greening, Red Astrachan, Smith Cider, and 
the following varieties as usually self-sterile: Bellflower, 
Primate, Spitzenburg, Willow Twig, Winesap. 

Recently, F. A. Waugh reported the results of experiments 
with apples. (Vermont Exp. Sta. Report, 1900, pp. 362 to 
366). Flower clusters were enclosed in paper sacks for selfpollination. 
From 2,586 flowers covered, only three fruits 
or a little more than one-tenth of one per cent set. The fruits 
set well on other parts of the trees in most cases. 

The writer's own study was made in connection with work 
in hybridizing apples. The main object was to determine 
whether apples are sufficiently self-fertile to make it necessary 
to remove the stamens of apple flower buds before applying 
the pollen of other varieties. The work in 1900 was 
done in the orchards of W. H. Harris, of Tecumseh, Neb., 
and that of 1901 in the orchards of Isaac Pollard and Sons, 
of Nehawka, Neb., and Marshall Bros., of Arlington, Neb. 
The first year no inbred flowers set fruit, and the number of 
fruits secured from cross- pollination was so small that the 
results of that year are not considered to have any particular 
value. Last year some flowers of Winesap, Ben Davis, and 
Soulard crab were inbred and other flowers on the same 
trees were crossed. The crossed flowers had their stamens 
removed with small forceps before the buds opened. In 
some cases the pollen of other varieties was applied at once, 
and the flowers covered with paper sacks, which were allowed 
to remain on for two or three weeks, when they were </seg>

            <seg id="p274">
273 


removed and mosquito-bar sacks were substituted. In other 
cases the crossed flowers were covered after the stamens had 
been pulled out, the sacks removed a day or two later for the 
application of pollen, and again tied over the flowers. The 
inbred flowers were treated in the same way, except that 
their stamens were not removed. They were all carefully 
hand-pollinated. In the case of both crossed and inbred 
flowers only the strongest bud of a flower cluster was chosen, 
the others being removed before the sacks were tied on. Of 
the 257 crossed flowers, 161 or 62.6 per cent set fruit and 60 
matured fruits. (All but two of the fruits on the Soulard 
tree failed to mature on account of the fact that all but one 
limb of the tree died.) Of the 66 inbred flowers three or 
nearly 5 per cent set fruit, but none matured, all of them 
having dropped off while quite small. The following table 

number of flowers worked upon would appear five or six 
times larger, while the number of flowers that could have 
set fruit would have been practically the same. 

Some members of this Society have reported better results 
with Ben Davis apples when mixed with other varieties than

when growing alone, while some fruit-growers can not see 
any difference in the behavior of this variety under the two 
conditions. It seems strange that such pronounced results 
as those reported above should have been secured with a 
variety like Bca Davis which is often planted alone in larger 
blocks without disastrous results. It may be that insects 
carry pollen much farther than is sometimes supposed, 
which may account for the apparent self-fertility of such 
varieties as the Ben Davis. It is very likely true, however, 
as pointed out by Waite and Fletcher, that the season or locality 
or even the vigor of the trees may bring about selfsterility 
in one case and self-fertility in another. The safest 
plan is certainly to mix varieties in the orchard unless the 
varieties planted are known to be self-fertile in the locality 
under consideration. 

Some of the writer's work in hybridizing apples may be 
of interest in showing that certain varieties do not cross 
easily with others and that, therefore, little advantage can 
be gained by mixing them in orchards though they bloom at 
the same time. No trouble was encountered in hybridizing 
the various varieties of the common apple, but when attempts 
were made to cross the common apple with pollen of 
the wild prairie crab or its relative, the Soulard crab, failure 
was the result, though the reciprocal cross (prairie crab or 
Soulard crossed with common apple pollen) gave favorable 
results. In 1900, 75 flowers of common apples were crossed 
with wild prairie crab pollen. In 1901, 35 flowers of common 
apples were crossed with Soulard pollen and 22 flowers 
with wild prairie crab pollen, but not a single fruit set. On 
the other hand, in 1900, 78 flowers of the wild crab and in 
1901, 56 flowers of the Soulard cr"ab were crossed with common 
apple pollen, and 23 fruits of wild crab and 24 fruits of 
Soulard crab set, the percentages being 29 and 43 respectively. 
This is certainly interesting, though of little practical 
value, since these crabs are rarely grown. </seg>

TWENTY-FIVE NATIVE TREES OF NEBRASKA. 

By Chables E. Besset. 

BULL PINE. 

Pinus Scopulorum (Engelm) Lemmon. — This tree forms 
dense forests in the northwestern and northern portions of 
the state, extending from the Wyoming line along Pine Ridge 
and Niobrara river to the eastern boundary of Rock and 
Keya Paha counties. It occurs also on the North Platte 
river as far east as Deucl county, and also south of that river 
on the mountainous uplift, sometimes called "Wildcat mountains." 
It is so abundant in this latter region that saw mills 
have been erected and much lumber manufactured from it. 
It is said to occur, also, in isolated patches on the high rough 
land between the North Platte river and Pine Ridge. I have 
myself not seen the pine in this latter locality, but it is so 
reported by government surveyors. It occurs in limited 
areas in the Loup valley in the eastern edge of the sandhills 
and also in Greeley and Custer counties. It formerly occurred 
along the Platte river eighteen or twenty miles east 
of the junction of the North and South Platte forks, as is 
shown by fragments of roots dug from the ground. Similarly, 
it formerly occurred in Franklin county in the Republican 
valley, where it seems now to be extinct. In my opinion, 
this is one of the most promising of our native trees for 
planting in the sandy and dry portions of Nebraska. 

EASTERN BED CEDAR. 

Junipenis Virginiana L. — Distinguished from the next 
species by the fact that its fruits (terries) ripen the first 
autumn. Its foliage is more inclined to be prickly and is 
generally of a greener color and much less commonly of a 
glaucous hue. Eastern Nebraska along the streams and occasionally 
scattered over the hills in central Nebraska, and </seg>

in dense growths any place in the state.

Juniperus Scopulorum Sargent. — Distinguished from the 
eastern species by the fact that its fruits (berries) do not 
ripen until the second year and a less prickly and generally 
more glaucous foliage. I have noticed also that the foliage 
is considerably more odoriferous than that of the eastern 
species. The tree is inclined to be more round-topped and 
the twigs are a little stouter than in the other species. This 
species has been so much confused with the foregoing that it 
is quite difficult to assign its range with accuracy. All the 
red cedars in the state were until recently supposed to be of 
one species, namely, the first mentioned, but Prof. Sargent 
has determined that in western Nebraska many, if not all, 
the trees belong to the western species. In assigning its 
range I should give it as the western counties of Nebraska 
extending eastward along the Platte and the Niobrara rivers 
for 100 miles or more. 

NARROW-LEAP COTTONWOOD. 

Populus Angustifolia James. — This willow-like cottonwood 
occurs wild in canyons in the mountains south of the 
North Platte river in Scotts Bluff county and also in similar 
stations in Sioux county. It is worthy of trial elsewhere in 
the state. 

RYDBERG'S C0TT0XW00D. 

Populus Acuminata IJydberg. — This is one of the prettiest 
of the cottonwoods and is worthy of much more attention 
than it has yet received. It occurs in the canyons south of 
the North Platte river in Scotts Bluff county and somewhat 
Cmonly elsewhere in the Rocky mountains westward. It 
been extensively used for a shade tree in Colorado </seg>

            <seg id="p278">

Springs and other mountain towns, where it was until 
recently not distinguished from the next species. 

COMMON COTTONWOOD. 

Populus Deltoidea Marshall. — Too common to require any 
extended discussion. It occurs wild throughout the state and 
is the most commonly planted shade tree, on account of its 
ease of propagation and its great hardiness. In spite of 
much prejudice on the part of many people, this tree is still 
entitled to the first place among the trees of Nebraska, 

BASSWOOD OR LIXDEN. 

Tilia Americana L. — Southeastern to northern counties, 
from Jefferson to Gage, Kichardson, Cass, Saunders, Douglas, 
Knox, Uock, Brown, and Cherry. 

WHITE ELM. 

Ulmus Americana L. — Throughout the state; in some 
places rare and much scattered, but in other places, especially 
in the eastern portions, sometimes very abundant. 
This is our most desirable shade tree for planting about our 
dwellings. 

BOCK ELM 

Ulmus Racemosa Thomas. — Until this year the only locality 
in the state where this species was known to occur was 
near Meadville, in Keya Paha county, but it has now been 
reported by the United States forestry party as occurring in 
a ravine a few miles south of Plattsmouth. 

RED ELM. 

Ulmus Fulva Michaux. — Common in the eastern part of 
the state to Franklin, Adams, Buffalo, and Brown counties 
and reported from the valley of Medicine creek in Frontier </seg>

            <seg id="p279">
278 


HACKBERRY. 

Celtis Occidentalis L. — More or less common throughout 
the state, but less abundant in the west. One of the best of 
our trees for planting for shade and ornament about our 
dwellings. It is very rarely injured by winds or heavy snowfalls. 


WHITE ASH. 

Fraximus Americana L. — Known to occur only along the 
Missouri river from Sarpy county southward. The next 
species is very commonly planted under the name of white 
ash. 

GBEEN ASH. 

Fraximus Lanceolata Borkhausen. — Common along 
streams throughout the state. In many places it is accompanied 
by the downy or hairy tree known as the red ash ( F. 
Pennsylvanica), but whose claim to specific rank may be 
questioned. Although very largely planted, green ash is not 
a very valuable tree, as it never attains a large size and is 
quite subject to the attacks of boring insects. 

WILD CHERRY. 

Prunus Serotina Ehrhart. — Native of southeastern Nebraska, 
from Franklin to Richardson and Cass counties. A 
most desirable tree to plant for its very valuable lumber. 

HONEY LOCUST. 

Gleditsia Triacanthos L. — Native of the southern, eastern, 
and northern counties from Franklin to Richardson, Lancaster, 
Douglas, Dixon, and Holt Worthy of more general 
cultivation. 

SYCAMORE 

Platanus Occidentalis L. — Found wild along the Missouri 
river from Richardson to Douglas counties. One of the best 
shade trees for planting in towns and cities. </seg>

            <seg id="p280">

SILVER MAPLE. 

Acer Saccharinum L. — In the counties east of the ninetyeighth 
meridian, where it grows naturally along the streams 
and in the lowlands. West of this line it is planted abundantly 
and in nearly all parts of the state where sufficient 
water is available it thrives. 

BOX ELDEB. 

Acer Negundo L. — Found native throughout the state. 
One of the best shade trees for general planting. 

BUTTERNUT. 

Juglans Cinera L. — Found sparingly in the southeastern 
part of the state from Gage to Johnson, Nemaha, Otoe, and 
Cass counties. Planted somewhat outside of its natural 
range. 

WALNUT. 

Juglans Nigra L. — Found quite abundantly in the southern, 
eastern, and northern portions of the state from Ilarlan 
county, Saline, and Lancaster to Hurt, Dixon, Knox, Hock, 
and Cherry and eastward. This valuable tree is planted 
quite freely far outside of its natural range. 

SHELLBARK HICKORY. 

Hicoria Ovate (Mill) Britton. — Common in the southeastern 
counties from Gage to Cass. There is no question that 
this valuable tree might be profitably planted a considerable 
distance outside of its natural range. 

BITTER HICKORY. 

Hicoria Minina (Marshall) Britton. — This is the most 
widely distributed of our hickories, occurring in southeast- 
t Nebraska from Pawnee county to Johnson, Lancaster, 
and Sarpy. It is worthy of being extensively planted. </seg>

            <seg id="p281">

WHITE OAK. 

Quercus Albe L. — Confined to the southeastern part of the 
state and certainly known to occur in Cass and Nemaha 
counties. 

BUR OAK, 

Quercus Macrocarpa Michaux. — The most widely distributed 
of our oaks, occurring throughout the eastern half of 
the state west of an irregular line drawn from llarlan county 
to Custer and Cherry. This oak should be more extensively 
planted than it has been hitherto. 

BED OAK. 

riiercus Rubra L. — Next to the bur oak this has the widdistribution 
in the state. It extends westward from 
Itichardson county to Lancaster and northward to Dixon. 

WHAT TO PLANT. 

Of our native trees I should recommend the following 
lists: 

For the "prairie region" — Eastern red cedar, common cottonwood, 
white elm, red elm, hackberry, white ash, wild 
cherry, honey locust, sycamore, silver maple, box elder, butternut, 
walnut, shellbark hickory, bitter hickory, white oak, 
bur oak, red oak. The six specie** I especially recommend 
are common cottonwood, white elm, hackberry, silver maple, 
box elder, and walnut. 

For the "sandhill region" — Bull pine, western red cedar, 
common cottonwood, white elm, red elm, hackberry, green 
ash, wild cherry, honey locust, box elder, walnut, bitter hickory, 
and bur oak. The six species I especially recommend 
are bull pine, western red cedar, common cottonwood, white 
elm, hackberry, and box elder. 

For the "foot-hill region" — Bull pine, western red cedar, 
Rydberg's cottonwood, common cottonwood, white elm, hackberry, 
box elder. </seg>

ORNAMENTAL PLANTING AS DEVELOPED BY THE 

RAILROADS. 

J. H. Hadkinson, Omaha. 

The subject assigned me hardly covers the territory I wish 
to take in, so please excuse me if I ramble somewhat. Perhaps 
my subject would be better stated as follows: "Planting 
Which Has Been and Could be Developed by Railroads.'* 
The wording of this takes me back to a period of twenty 
years ago when I first observed such planting. This was in 
Europe, and I must say that even at the present time I can 
look back with pleasant recollections of some of those scenes, 
although at that time only a boy passenger with my parents. 
When the train stops at a station, what is more pleasing to 
a weary passenger than to rest his eyes on the works of 
nature and man combined? Recollection of the past brings 
to my mind the plantings at some of the stations. At one 
place, I remember, the station being in a cut, gave a good 
opportunity for working the name of the station in the 
pretty, grass-covered slope. The letters were about six feet 
long by eighteen inches wide, and filled in with white limestone, 
giving a pretty effect at all times. Another place 
where trains pass in all directions was to me like a flowery 
dell. The station was in a cut, with wagon roads across 
stone arches at about equal distances each way from the 
depot, enough so to give a good effect as a background. The 
judicious planting of shrubbery of various heights and 
growths, intermingled with herbaceous perennials, and annuals, 
gave a very pleasing effect, making you feel as if you 
were in a veritable fairy dell. And as you saw the last of 
the train pass under the bridges either way, it appeared as 
if they were entering a fairy jungle. 

However, we are western people and in a western climate, 
and I must confine myself to what is practical for us here 
under the conditions we have to meet It must be freely </seg>

admitted that our western railroads are doing — and have 
done — considerable in developing planting, both ornamental 
and otherwise, and more can yet l»e done which would not 
only be pleasing to their passengers, but instructive to the 
locality. This might become as much of an educator as has 
the practice of placing rain gages along the line. It is a 
common occurrence for people to scan the papers to see what 
the railroads say about the rainfall. Why not take in horticultural 
development when the passengers get the benefit, 
and also give a local stimulus to planting and improving 
homes? I know of several places in Nebraska where the 
town and railroad people get together and establish parks 
in close proximity to the depot, which I must say is very 
commendable and ought to have the support of all good people, 
for they as well as the passengers get the benefit of this 
sensible combination. 

I shall doubtless be confronted with the question: "What 
can be done in our arid region?" I say to these cities who 
make a combination with the railroads, collect and plant 
indigenous trees, flowers, and shrubbery. If in a locality 
where shrubbery abounds — and there is more or less of it in 
almost every part of our state — it will thrive and be a pleasure 
to passengers from moister climates, also being instructive 
lessons for them. I might go further and say, 
label them so they might be more easily identified. If too 
much trouble to label the individual plants, they might be 
labeled collectively something as follows: "Cacti, or plants 
found growing in this vicinity." Through the kindness of 
one of your townspeople I had the pleasure of a drive out of 
town (Geneva) a little distance, where there are thousands 
of Coreopsis, identical with the cultivated varieties which 
are so much prized in the East and in Europe. And I might 
say here, there is Eunonymous indigenous to our eastern 
counties, which is of great interest to our landscape gardeners. 
Why not our western plants be of interest to people 
from other climes? </seg>

            <seg id="p284">
ORNAMENTAL PLANTING BY RAILROADS. 

283 

The planting of trees has not been neglected by our railroads, 
but more could be done. I must say I am heartily in 
sympathy with Mr. J. P. Brown, of Connorsville, Ind., in his 
efforts to further planting in this line. Last summer it was 
my privilege to go east, and I was very much impressed with 
the plantings I saw around many of the stations through 
which I passed. I had heard and read of this elaborate work 
of ships and trains worked out in miniature on pretty green 
lawns around depots, and as I am writing I recollect a statement 
in a trade paper of a florist on a division in an eastern 
state, starting out with a special train of four cars laden 
to their capacity with potted plants, and before returning he 
traveled 1,055 miles and planted 191 flower beds at various 
stations on his division. What must have been done on the 
entire system? 

I am forcibly reminded of a piece of work in Omaha which 
gives a feeling of pleasure every time one sees it, either when 
coming into the depot, or crossing the viaduct. What a sense 
of restfulness from the dark buildings. I am sure the people, 
both travelers and townspeople, get enjoyment from this. 
Also at Council Bluffs there is an effort in this direction. 

I can not leave this subject without mentioning a few 
shrubs and plants which can be used in alii'o-t all localii 
Snowballs, Spireas — Van Houteii, Prunifolia, Billardi, and 
Thunbergi; Philadelphus of various kinds; Tamarix Amurinsis; 
Cydonia Japonica; Upright Honeysuckle; Hydrangea 
paniculata grandiflora. 

Of herbaceous plants I will mention Larkspur, Hollyhock, 
Dielytra Spectabilis, Phlox of many colors, Peonies, Kudbeckia, 
Iris, Hermorocallis, Pinks, and I might mention 
many others, but will leave you to find these in your own 
locality, where by a little observation you will find numerous 
things doing well. 

I can not close without mentioning what is done by the 
railroads in the way of providing for the pleasure of their 
passengers by providing flowers to decorate their dining </seg>

30,000 cut flowers a year to give away to their patrons, and 
these railways have also quantities of glass for the growing 
of cut flowers and plants for decorating their grounds and 
dining cars. Let us as individuals each plant freely, and 
thus push along the good work. 

ADVANCE OF FLORICULTURE. 

By Lewis Henderson, Omaha. 

The plants and flowers which adorn the globe more or less 
in all countries must necessarily have attracted the attention 
of mankind from the earliest time. The science that treats 
of them dates back to the days of Solomon, for that wise 
monarch "spake of trees" from the cedfir of Lebanon to the 
Hysop on the wall. The Egyptians were the early cultivators 
of science, and botany was not neglected, although 
the study of it was mixed up with speculations as to vegetable 
life. 

The subject of fertilization was one which early excited 
attention. The idea of existence of separate sexes in plants 
was entertained in early time, long before separate male and 
female parts had been demonstrated. The productions of 
dates in Egypt, by bringing two kinds of flowers into contact, 
proves that in very remote periods some notions were 
entertained on the subject. Female Date Palms only were 
cultivated, and wild ones were brought from the desert in 
order to fertilize them. 

Herodotus informs us that the Babylonians knew of old 
that there were male and female date trees and that the latter 
required the condurance of the other to become fertile. 
This fact was also known to the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, 
and other nations of Asia and Africa. 

The Babylonians suspended male clusters from wild dates </seg>

over the female, but they seem to have supposed that the 
fertility thus produced depended on the presence of small 
flies among the wild flowers which by entering the other flowers 
caused them to set and ripen, which process was called 
pahnafication. 

About 300 years before Christ, Theophrastus wrote a history 
of plants and described about 500 species used for treatment 
of diseases. Little, however, was done in the sci« 
of botany or floriculture until the 17th or 18th century. Still. 
Ihe custom of using flowers seems to have been by nature 
laid in the hearts of mankind; even the savages in the history 
passed picked flowers and leaves, making garlands to express 
their feeling of love and gratification. In the time of 
the Romans, flowers were thrown at the feet of gladiators in 
admiration of their strength and bravery. Floriculture was 
then unknown, homes were not decorated by flowers, but by 
swords and tragedies. Years and centuries went thus by 
until the 18th century, when Carl von Linne, of Sweden, 
and other botanists produced a most important revolution 
in botanical science. * 

The system of Linne is founded on the sexes of plants; he 
improved the distinction of genera and species, and invented 
a new and comprehensive system founded on the 
stamens and pistils. He divided plants into sexual and 
asexual, the former being Phanerogamous or flowering, and 
the- latter Cryptogamous or flowerless. He arranged their 
endless synomyins by requiring all species to be capable of 
a riporous definition not exceeding twelve words; he purified 
botany from the endless varieties of gardeners and 
herbalists. 

lJoboit Brown, a Scottish botanist, in the beginning of the 
19th century was the first to advocate the introduction and 
adoption of botany in the universities and schools of Britain ; 
this was really the first advancement of floriculture from 
then on, and especially in the years 1832 up to 1859 great* 
advances were made both in England, France, and on the </seg>

continent of Europe. Italy, Switzerland, and most every 
country in the world have contributed species of flowers and 
plants, which accounts for so many different and hard names 
applied to the same. 

re must by all means not leave out the United States of 
line of floriculture, although of later ten to 50 years it 
is more than probable that the first practical advancement 
in floriculture in this country originated in the catalogue 
system. And to Peter H. Henderson and others of his noble 
character are we indebted for this noble plan of reaching 
the multitudes. From the small efforts a generation ago to 
the present, words can not express what has been wrought. 
Our forefathers would not have believed it possible ; now millions 
of flower catalogues go yearly every city, town, and 
hamlet of our great country bearing on their pages accurate 
illustrations and complete descriptions of almost endless 
varieties of plants with cultural instructions for the successful 
growing of them. 

That we are now living in a period of progress and advancement 
of floriculture*, when hybridizing, cross-breeding, 
and the production of endless new varieties are brought into 
Ihe market, can be found in the annual report each year of 
the Society of American Florists, as they are too numerous 
to mention now. 

In the last two years only of 1898 and 1899 there were 
registered 21 new roses, 38 new carnations, 130 new chrysanthemums, 
105 new eannas, 35 new dahlias, 54 new geraniums, 
36 new sweet peas, 6 new petunias, 76 miscellaneous 
of all different kinds, with their names and originators and 
description of the plants. 

When we take a look at these western prairies, where sun- 
Howers and coyotes used to grow, we find that trees have 
l&gt;een planted, parks, orchards, and gardens hav6 sprung up 
one here and one there, and wherever we look we find tokens 
of refinement and civilization, to which we are largely indebted 
to those great mediums of modern civilization, the </seg>

daily press and other periodicals, which by their illustrations 
and growing attention to our business and interesting reports 
of flower exhibitions, and descriptions, turn the eyes 
of all Christendom to the fashion and necessity of the use 
of flowers. 

What an influence, too, to the advancement has been exerted 
by the state horticultural societies and exhibits of 
flower shows which draw multitudes of people, increase 
public interest in and study of plants and flowers of the different 
kinds and develop a practical advancement of floriculture 
and horticulture; and to the uttermost parts of the 
land goes the story of their beautiful effects in flowers and 
valuable plants and arrangements of nature's glories that 
are the pride of the eyes to millions to whom the influence 
of great exhibitions has come. 

What a glorious power are our great public park systems 
of universal instruction that speak in no uncertain way 
as to the elevating power of the beautiful. One need but 
visit the lovely gardens of parks to realize the intensity of 
interest the flowers create and the practical desire for home 
adornment which they foster. 

I have often heard thoughts mentioned that our Society 
should make some efforts to, in some practical way, reach the 
children of our schools with horticulture. It may entail 
considerable work and thought to mature a plan that would 
be practical and acceptable to our school authorities, but of 
the ultimate result of such a scheme I have no doubt. Could 
we not distribute plants and seeds among the school children 
under some superintendency of their teachers and offer prizes 
for the successful growers? Some few attempts in this direction 
have been done, and the reports of the results of the 
same are more than encouraging to the idea of enlarging 
and improving the scope of the work. These school children 
are to be the fathers and mothers of the near future, and the 
beautiful lessons learned and the pure thoughts inspired by

The calling of floriculture and horticulture is one that is 
ennobling. The true horticulturist is an ardent lover of 
nature, and someone has said that his occupation naturally 
draws him nearer to nature's God. 

The florist is constantly sowing seeds of love, happiness, 
content, and sacred tributes. His products often pass to 
other hands to fill various missions. The ardent lover well 
knows "flowers are lovers' truest language," and the shrewd 
florist aids him in making up bouquets and quotes to him, 
"Who that lias loved knows not the tender tale which flowers 
reveal when lips are coy to tell." A poet says flowers are 
words even a babe may understand ; so the youth keeps on 
with his floral tributes until he develops sufficient courage 
to produce a pop (py), then, after the florist has furnished 
the usual bridal bouquet, he many times loses a good customer. 


Few florists understand how great a medium they are in 
making "parlor matches." What a link they are in many a 
matrimonial chain, how true the saying, "The course of nature 
is the art of God and that nature never did betray the 
heart that loved her." 

What cheer, what joy does a little bouquet of flowers bring 
to the invalid; its appearance will seem to brighten the 
whole room. How true the saying that "flowers will preach 
to us if we will but hear." We have often seen languid eyes 
of the sick brighten with unspeakable joy at the sight of 
flowers, and heard the faint voice ask that they could remain 
constantly in view. 

The tributes of flowers sent by friends to the house of 
mourning are beautiful, silent messengers that convey heartgpeaking 
sympathy and love that is too sacred, too tender 
for tongue to express. </seg>

When we visit a cemetery planted with trees, flowers, and 
plants, see floral remembrances placed over the graves of 
dear departed ones it is a most impressive sight. Flowers 
are indeed God's emblem of purity. When we see these faithful 
friends of the dead with a force comes to our minds 
Byron's words, "Life is but a pendulum twixt a smile and a 
tear." Who shall say that flowers have not even vital influence 
in our lives? They teach us to love the beautiful ; 
we recognize them as God's gifts; they win our warmest admiration 
; we use them as conveyance of our love, happiness, 
sympathy, friendship, and as portraying our reverence for 

The present growth and demand for flowers and horticulture 
have been great; nature has done wonders to many a 
wayside flower in the history of American floriculture. 

Of the past, we have right to feel proud ; for our future w&lt;? 
have good reasons to feel confident. Let us so direct our 
organized efforts that the historians to come will find in our 
acts much to praise and nothing to condemn. 

PRACTICAL SPRAYING. 

By Peter Youngers, Geneva. 

Spraying from a practical standpoint is purely a business 
proposition. Stripped of all sentiment, the questions to be 
considered are, "What does it cost?" and "Are results sufficient 
to warrant the expense?" 

In speaking of our insect enemies I shall not attempt to 
give a complete list of those found in the state. Here in 
Nebraska we are still free from many insects that are doing 
much damage to orchardists in other sections of the country. 
Taking the subject as it relates more particularly to 
Nebraska orchardists, we find, first, the codling moth; second, 
the fungus, that have caused more loss than all other 
pests combined. 

19 </seg>

            <seg id="p291">
290 


The benefits to be derived from spraying depend very much 
on the condition of the weather, for while we may use every 
effort to control the insects and fungus in the orchard, if 
after the application of our spraying mixture we have a 
heavy rain, our labor, in a large measure, would be lost. Yet 
I believe that the fungus can be held in check so as to leave 
little to fear from that source. The codling moth, however, 
with its three or more broods, will not be so readily controlled. 
I believe that eventually some natural enemy will 
overtake the codling moth and destroy it (such as the parasites 
on chinch bugs and grasshoppers), but while we ir 
waiting for the natural enemy to appear we can do much 
toward controlling them by spraying and using bands on 
our trees. We are told by entomologists that the broods of 
the codling moth overlap each other; or rather, that they 
are continually hatching out. Consequently, in order to 
catch the different broods it is necessary to spray about 
every two weeks, and even then it is difficult to catch the 
young worm just at the right time. 

We commence to spray as soon as the blossom falls. The 
first spraying is Avith Bordeaux mixture and Paris green. 
This is repeated every fifteen days, using only Paris green 
and water until the last spraying in the latter part of July 
or first of August, when we again use the Bordeaux in connection 
with the Paris green. In the nursery we use the 
spray pump freely, going over the young stock from six to 
ten times during the season. Tent caterpillar and leafroller 
are unknown where spraying is followed. 

As to results in the orchard we can see quite a difference 
in the fruit that has been sprayed and that which has not. 
An examination of the apples at this time shows about 93 
per cent of them free from worms. We find, however, that 
during the month of August more fruit shows the effects of 
the inoth than at any other time of the year. We can carry 
the summer and fall fruit through with but very little loss, 
but our winter varieties — which are the most valuable — are 
the ones that are injured most. </seg>

            <seg id="p292">
291 


This season we have used 120 pounds of Paris green and 
700 pounds of sulphate of copper in our spraying. In preparing 
the Bordeaux mixture we use the normal formula: 
Six pounds of sulphate of copper and four pounds of lime 
to forty-five gallons of water. To this we add one-half pound 
of Paris green, as we have obtained better results from this 
amount than from one-fourth pound as generally used. 

In preparing the mixture we find that if the sulphate of 
copper is suspended in a sack in the water (we use 24 
pounds, enough for four barrels, each time) it will dissolve 
much faster than if placed loosely in the barrel and water 
poured on. Sixteen pounds of lime is slacked at each time — 
also enough for four barrels. After the lime is slacked it is 
diluted with water, divided by measure and poured into the 
barrels through a wire sieve. The Paris green, after it has 
been stirred into a thin batter, is poured into the barrels, 
and then the sulphate of copper water is added. This is also 
measured. Enough water is then added to each barrel to 
make the required amount. 

In spraying with Paris green I pound is used to the barrel 
of water, and about 3 pounds of quick lime is added to prevent 
burning the foliage. 

The cost of spraying is much less than is usually supposed. 
I find the cost of the first spraying (Bordeaux mixture and 
Paris green) is a trifle less than 2 cents per tree; the second 
and third sprayings (Paris green alone) cost a fraction over 
1 cent per tree each time. This makes a total cost of about 
4 cents per tree for the three sprayings. If the orchard is 
given a fourth spraying, using Bordeaux mixture and Paris 
green, the total cost for the season would be about 6 cents 
per tree, or $60 for an orchard of 1,000 trees. From my experience 
in spraying I believe this is money well invested. </seg>

SHELTER BELTS. 

By J. P. Dunlap, Dwight. 

They are a necessity od all the plain regions. What trees 
are best, and how to plant them will be my present discourse. 

The deciduous trees are best when you want a cool shelter 
from the summer sun, but as that more properly belongs to 
the topic on shade trees, I will pass them by without further 
notice. But as a shelter from the drifting snows and cold 
winds of winter the evergreen has no equal and as there are 
varieties of evergreen particularly adapted to every part of 
this state, and as they occupy less land, are hardier, cheaper, 
and more effectual in stopping wind, I do not see any good 
reason why they should not be used exclusively as a winter 
protection. In the eastern part of the State and on moist 
lands the Northern White pine is good. The Austrian and 
Scotch pine are good in the eastern and central, and perhaps 
on sandy lands in the western part of the State, but they 
do not stand dry weather or stock running among them as 
well as the following named trees. The Ponderosa pine, as 
far as I know, will stand more drouth, wind, and hail than 
any other tree, but they will not stand wet and are not at 
present grown in sufficient quantities for general planting, 
so I do not at present consider it the best tree. The Red 
cedar is a native tree of all parts of our country, although 
they vary considerably in looks and hardiness, according to 
the part of the country that they are native of. Whether 
the low lands of the Mississippi or the dry plains of the west. 
The native Nebraska Red cedar are the hardiest for our country, 
and as they are not broused by stock running among 
them as they make a thick, compact growth, and as they 
stand more drouth than any other tree, except the Ponderosa 
pine, and as they are grown in commercial quantities, I consider 
them the best tree for making winter shelter for stock. 

The way to make an evergreen shelter belt is to have a </seg>

            <seg id="p294">
293 


strip of land one rod wide in good cultivation, then where 
you want the belt to stand plow out so as to leave the middle 
furrow where the row of trees are to stand. I prefer only 
one row unless the rows are fifty feet apart, or where you 
wnnt to make a barn of them. One row will make a good belt 
if the trees are set eight feet apart and kept well cultivated 
for five years. The reasons why I prefer one row are they 
are easier to cultivate and keep clear of weeds and trash and 
the trees will stand more erect. The trees should not be 
trimmed. If you leave all the brush on them the trees will 
grow faster and make a better shelter. 

If you want to make a winter barn of them, plant the row 
around the outside six feet apart and the inside rows twelve 
feet apart and cultivate well, and when the trees are ten to 
twelve feet high trim the lower limbs off the inside rows to 
give room for the stock to get under them and leave the outside 
row without trimming, except only cutting a door to let 
the stock through and your barn is complete and covered 
over. A second row 50 feet north and west of barn and belt 
are good to catch and prevent the snow drifts. 

In buying your trees send only to reliable nurseries and 
the closer to you the better. Get only transplanted trees in 
the spring and see well that their roots are not exposed 
scarcely a minute to either sun or air. As soon as the plants 
are received unpack and dip the roots immediately in thin 
mud and keep them well heeled in until they can be planted. 
Plant four, eight, or -twelve inches deeper than they grew in 
the nursery, according to the size of the plants and the drying 
character of your land. If on hillsides where there is 
danger of the row washing, have a furrow on the side of the 
row to take off surplus water. Keep a clean surface cultivation 
during the entire summer for the first five years and 
after that use a plow or mower to keep down weeds and you 
will have a shelter that is substantial, useful, and beautiful. </seg>

FRUIT EXHIBITS AND EXHIBITORS. 

By O. S. Christy, Johnson. 

The subject of fruit exhibits in these days of expositions 
with international reputations becomes one of interest to 
every loyal citizen of Nebraska. And the diplomas and medals 
now in possession of the State Horticultural Bocietj 
should make every "tree-planter's'' heart swell with a little 
state pride. They are mementoes from nearly every great 
show since the Centennial in 1876 — Boston, New Orleans. 
Chicago, Omaha, and first prize at Paris in 1900. No other 
avenue of advertising our state will so certainly make an impression 
on the public mind, whether from France, Mexico, 
or Missouri, as to "show them." 

Our own state fair is an excellent means of notifying the 
public of our individual or local merits, provided we have 
the fruit and inclination to make a creditable showing. 
Granted that you have the fruit, it requires good judgment 
and hard work to select the best specimens and place them 
in position to show to the best advantage to spectators and 
judges. One of the principal objects of all exhibits being U) 
advertise your fruits to the marts of the world, it requires 
skill to make your display attractive, and tact to d&lt; 
means to inform the visitors of the locality from which jaw 
display comes. In gathering fruit you should visit the tops 
of the trees, so a nimble man or lively boy is a necessary 
adjunct to the work. Two or three times as many specimens 
as are needed should be picked, and then carefully seleet 
those of even size, typical form, good color, stems on, and 
free from worms. After making your selections, wrap the 
tender varieties in parafine pajwr, and wrap all apples, 
peaches, and pears in newspaper; then put each kind in a 
paper sack, write the name on the sack and pack in boxes or 
barrels for shipment. 

The gathering and transportation of the fruit without injury 
is one of the important factors in taking first premiums. 
I remember once meeting a public-spirited gentleman the day 
before leaving for the fair, and he told me of his fine applet 
on a ten-acre orchard just coming into bearing. It was impossible 
then to visit the orchard, so he agreed to have a 
number of specimens at the ten o'clock train the next day.

He was punctual, but what an array of fruit ! Massive Ben 
Davis; great yellow Golden Pippins, that would teuipt the 
palate of a connoisseur; Jonathans, upon which the hand of 
nature had spent an entire season, perfecting every tint; 
Maiden's Blush (with the blush so perfect it would make 
an Irishman bashful) — all had been picked hastily, put into 
a two-bushel sack, thrown into a spring wagon and brought 
to town at a three-minute gait. They had to be accepted to 
avoid giving offeuse, but not a single plate of all that first 
premium stuff was ever exhibited. It all went in with the 
general donations for charities. 

After getting your fruit to the fair in good shape, the next 
step is to make a thorough study of your premium list and 
mark every premium for which you wish to compete. You 
should begin the study of your list when you commence gathering 
fruit, but unless you take a sort of post-graduate course 
while preparing your display, you are apt to miss many 
awards that you might otherwise obtain. We will suppose 
that you are interested in a county display; individual, not 
less than thirty plates; five varheties winter, and fifteen single 
plates^ although you should have a part in the prach, 
l&gt;ear, plain, and grape exhibits. Now begins the real work 
of preparation to beat the other fellow, though we trust yon 
have a higher object than simply conquest. Take as many 
plates as you have exhibits, and make each plate as even in 
size and as nearly perfect as possible. You will now have 
one plate better than the rest, and here comes your fine work 
in judging your own fruit and determining where each plate 
belongs. If your object is to advertise your own orchard, 
then put all your finest specimens in the individual display; 
but if you desire to get money enough out of it to pay your 
expenses at the fair, the arrangement may be quite different, 
and can only be determined by a careful study of your own 
exhibit aud every other one in the hall. If you find it impossible 
to win on single plates, then bend every energy to take 
the collective, remembering that in the five winter, no varieties 
can succeed better than Winesap, Ben Davis, Gano, Jonathan, 
and Grimes Golden 1'ippin. 

As a last greeting to your exhibit before* the judges pas* 
upon it, examine carefully your collective displays and see 
that you have uo duplicates. Then be certain that you have 
not two varieties of apples on the same plate. If you have </seg>

            <seg id="p297">
296 


never exhibited, this may seem a needless caution, but a few 
years of experience will teach you different. Last, but not 

least, take jour pencil and paper, make a complete list of 
your collective exhibits and place where the judges can easily 
find it, for though your display be perfect, without this 
list the judges will pass it without placing any ribbons there. 

If you follow these instructions and do not get first premium 
— try again! 

I shall say but few words in regard to exhibitors. The 
fact that some people believe that the annual exhibits are 
for members of the State Society only, and that others think 
the judges favor the members in preference to others, is my 
excuse for saying anything about them. The entries are 
open to every citizen of Nebraska, and no member of this 
Society has any privilege over any other fruit-grower in the 
state. Judges are human, and not always infallible, but 
after several years' experience at fairs I am convinced there 
is less favoritism in the fruit display than in any other competitive 
exhibit on the fair ground. A plate of apples can 
be as accurately scored as e Poland China pig, a Hereford 
cow, or a Leghorn chicken. The jockeying of the race track 
is not found there, and if you have a real grievance after the 
judges have passed upon the fruit, go to the superintendent 
of the hall, good-naturedly state your case to him, and he 
will in every case have it adjusted. 

An inexperienced exhibitor should not expect to take everything 
in sight against those who have exhibited for years. 
He has a right to try for every premium offered, and to expect 
fair and impartial treatment, and in every case where 
he fails he should trv to learn the cause of such failure, as 
we can learn as well from our failures as our victories — but 
the medicine is not so pleasant to take. 

Judges are not divine arid are liable to err, but their errors 
usually favor the novice. I well remember one instance 
where there were five or six plates of Cooper's Early AVhite 
competing for first and second premiums. The judges 
awarded the first premium to a gentleman who had never 
been at the fair before. Later someone discovered that the 
plate that carried first premium ribbon was not Cooper's, 
but Warficld. The veteran exhibitor would allow no correction, 
but left the premium where the judges had placed it, 
as he said, "to encourage another exhibitor." </seg>

A gentleman once called my attention to the decision of 
the judges on several plates of Grimes Golden Pippin. He 
was very wroth and condemned the judges, superintendents, 
and everybody connected with the show. His apples were 
the largest by one and a half inches in circumference; they 
were the beautiful gulden yellow of the pippin, while others 
from a northern county were still a mottled green. Both 
plates were good in form, of even size,- and at first sight it 
would certainly seem that he deserved the premium. On 
closer-examination, however, we found two worm holes and 
one stem gone. He has exhibited several times since, yet no 
one has ever heard him objecting to the decision of those in 
authority. 

At another time a certain party exhibited a plate of Summer 
Queen, and after the judges had completed their work 
he went to size up his winnings. He found his plate of apples, 
and others of the same variety, but the ribbon was not 
where he expected it; a plate of very inferior fruit had taken 
first honors. He had five good specimens about eleven inches 
in circumference; the premium plate had one of that size, 
one about nine inches in circumference, and three smaller 
ones of various sizes. If you have ever seen a portly mother, 
a stout sixteen-year-old daughter, and three younger children 
of different ages come into church, you will be able to 
form a good idea of the appearance of that plate of aji] 
and yet they had received the highest award. Such favoritism 
and gross injustice was not to be tolerated, and he felt 
his ire begin to rise. In fact, he got "red-headed" about it. 
His first impulse was to throw the judges out, but as there 
were three of them he concluded that "discretion was the 
better part of valor" and went after the superintendent of 
the hall, as there was only one of him. The superintendent 
went at once to rectify the mistake, and informed the complainant 
that his apples were Summer Pennocks, and not 
Summer Queens at all. As he had exhibited no Summer 
Queen, he could not be awarded a premium on that varn 
the list the judges had did not give him as competing on 
Summer Pennocks, so they could not give him the premium 
he otherwise deserved, lie still continues to exhibit, but 
has been meek as a lamb ever since.

first on county, but the judges only found one county deserving 
first place. They did all in their power to allay the 
trouble by awarding the other counties premiums of less 
degree. 

Taken as a whole, our state fair — including the exhibit at 
the Trans-Mississippi — lias been to the horticulturists of the 
state one continual round of pleasant associations and goodnatured 
competitions. And this fall, when the state fair 
draws to a close, when the premiums have been awarded and 
each has received his portion as merit deserves, the visitors 
gone, and the exhibitors preparing to leave, if you would go 
where exists the most sincere friendship; where exhibitors, 
judges, superintendents, and police can take each other by 
the hand and heartily wish him God speed, come with me 
and I will introduce you to the occupants of Horticultural </seg>
