            <seg id="p005">5 NEBRASKA PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION Secretary'! Report December 1, 1920, to November 30, 1922 THE COMMISSION Personnel During the past biennium there have been changes in the personnel uf the Commission and its staff. Mr. C. A. Sommer, of Lincoln, who wad appointed in May, 1916, for a terra of five years, resigned in November, 1920. Mr. Sommer was actively interested in the work of the Commit sion, giving generously of his time in advising with the secretary on matters pertaining to the usefulness of the department. On Decembei 30, 1920, Governor McKelvie appointed Mrs. Charles H. Dietrich of Hast - ings for a term of five years. Mrs. Dietrich is the first woman to serv* a.- a member of the Commission. We feel that the choice was a for - tunate one. It seems fitting to pay tribute here to Mr. F. L. Haller of Omaha who died September 26, 1922. This may best be done by quoting from the minutes of the June, 1916, Commission meeting. "Mr. F. L. Haller retires at this time from membership in the Nebraska Library Commis - sion, after a continuous service since its organization in 1901, during the last ten years of which he was President. His devotion to the library interests of Nebraska has been shown by his cooperation in helping to make possible the establishment of the Nebraska Public Library Com - mission, by his interest in developing the work and by his loyal support of its plans." Nellie Williams, who had been serving in the Capacity of acting ecretary for eighteen months, was elected executive secretary of the Commission in May, 1921. Upon the resignation of Lora E. Bolton in January, 1921, Ruth E. Warriek, then librarian for traveling libraries, became reference librarian and Marguerite Nesbit of the public library of Tekamah, Nebraska, took charge of the traveling libraries. Due to her approaching marriage, Miss Warriek left the Commission in March, 1922, and Miss Nesbit succeeded to the position of reference librarian. In August, 1922, Winnie Jane Mann of the public library of Creighton, Nebraska, became librarian for traveling libraries. Louise Otten, who had served as clerk since January, 1920, removed to Califor - nia in May, 1022, and Grace Houts of Omaha became clerk. Location From its beginning in 1901 until June, 1921, the offices of the Com - mi.-sion were located in the Capitol building. Due to the need of more </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 space for our own and other state departments, a change was necessary. Mr. Wyer, President of the Commission, secured quarters for us on the University campus. We are now located in the Social Science building except for the office which is in University Hall. AftiYlti*. The Commission has followed the same general lines of work as in former years. Its purpose is to stimulate library development and to provide books for individuals and communities that are without library facilities. Its third activity is building and supervising libraries in the state institutions. Field Work While the secretary desires to answer all calls for help and aims to visit all public libraries within a reasonable period of time, it is becomirm more and more impossible to cover the field. Because we feel that a closer contact between the libraries and the Commission should exist, it is the policy of the secretary to send out circular letters during the coming year. She will appreciate it if these letters are regarded some - &gt;t in the nature of a visit and their contents as carefully considered a.-, suggestions have been in personal interviews. By thus doing some ing by proxy, the pending and urgent demands can better be met. 1 During the biennium the secretary has made 92 library visits, forty of which were to libraries that she had not previously visited. This ice is given without charge. The visits are classified as follows: The secretary has made a few out-of-state visits in the interest of the Commission. She attended the library section of the National Educa - tion Association in Des Moines in July, 1921, and also visited the Iowa Library Commission offices. From Des Moines she went to Iowa City to the summer school library conference to fill an appointment upon the program. She attended the Midwinter meeting of the American Library Association in Chicago in December, 1921. She also took part upon the program of the Regional A. L. A. meeting held in St. Joseph, Missouri, 1 Statistics are not a satisfying medium of expression.

The individual borrower becomes our friend because in return for help given she often expresses an appreciation which bespeaks her kindly spirit. And yet, figures do speak effectively. By them we note that more people have been served during tiie last two years than in any previous inium. In large measure this growth is due to a normal expansion of *ork, though counting renewals as loans accounts in part for the in - se. This ha? been done since January, 1921, when it was so voted at Chicago meeting of the League of Library Commissions. The in - ae in requests filled since the last report is 2,193; the increase in vol s loaned 19,321. The records show that books have been sent into y county in the state. A table of comparative statistics will be d elsewhere in this report.

Traveling Libraries Prom the second report of the Nebraska Public Library Commission the following is quoted: "The first traveling librarj was sent from this office in December, 1901. It went to a barber shop from which the books circulated during its three months' stay. The barber was deeply inter - ested in the welfare of his community. He hail the true library spirit." During all the years since that December in 1901, the traveling libraries have been upon their way, going here and there into every corner of the state. They have circulated from residences, schools, post-offices, libra - ries, churches, banks, barber shops, court houses, club rooms, drug stores, general stores, offices of doctors, county agricultural agents and COUnty superintendents. Could one have followed them, many a human interest story could no doubt be told of the splendid spirit on the part of those who have given freely of their services a? librarian -. The demand and the interest continue. The winter months find the supply insufficient to insure prompt service. It has been necessary this fall to send out a letter asking would-be borrowers to be patient. As public libraries become better equipped, theyjire requested to give way to the rural schools whose need is greater. It is impossible to keep pace with the call from the English departments of the hiph schools. The number of books loaned to a community is lessened during the season of greatest stress in order to serve more communities. It becomes a parcel - ing like the sugar rationing of war-time. Even the summer time supply of traveling libraries on hand is growing less as the public libraries take increasing advantage of this opportunity to supplement their own col - lection of books. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 a .state department knowing its clientele chiefly by correspondence has been considered by some as a mere machine of the mail-order va - riety. Such is not true. No one could fail to be personally interested in the housewife who writes thus under recent date: "We are anxious to have another library as the evenings are long now. The books have been a big help here as we have very little else for our amusement. At first very few read the books but now we have very nearly every family lepresented. They are getting anxious for more books. If you knew what an event the arrival of the books is you would know that your ef- rt to send us such jrood books as you have is surely appreciated." This comes from one teaching in a little town many miles from a railroad: "We all certainly enjoyed the library. We used some of the books in school and some the children took home to their parents. Head - ing matter is so hard to get in this country and they do so like the travel - ing library." Another letter from the same person says: "I merely wish to thank you for the library we had before and ask that you keep my name in line as near the front as possible as we are very anxious to secure another library. Our school is especially handicapped for lack of books." Reference. We are experiencing growing pains in this department of our work. The call for program suggestions and outlines, bibliographies and books covering many topics of study comes to us increasingly from the women as individuals and a.s club borrowers. The cry for debate helps is state - wide and insistent. Last year we could not keep pace with the Rural Club demand for Child Welfare material, though we bought as liberally as our means justified in order to keep faith with Miss Stella Mather of the Kxtension Department in her plan and program for the women of rural Nebraska. A letter to the public libraries asking them to supplement the Commission material on this topic brought some relief. It would be ap - preciated if public libraries would thus help their own local debaters. North Platte did this last year and won the state championship. In spite of an effort to buy along lines of probable demand, the ref - erence collection is inadequate. The removal of the Commission to the University campus is a partial solution of the problem of meeting these reference requests. Easy access to the University library makes it pos sible to borrow from its collection. Believing that effort and books were being duplicated, a comparison was made of the requests coming to the Extension Department of the University and to the Commission over a sufficient period of time to prove that this was true. Following a conference of Mr. Wyer and Mr. A. A. Reed of the Extension Department, it was arranged that the Ex - tension requests should be referred to the Commission, for a considera - tion agreed upon. The loans from this source for the past six months </seg>

The attire number of reference loan* to clubs and individ Institutional Libraries I There has been no opportunity to develop along any special line in institutional library work. While the same care in book selection been exercised and the general supervision has been carried on as ierly, the secretary has not made as many visits to the institutions lie did during the years when the greater part of her time was to - rt to this branch of the Commission work. Books and periodicals have been provided as liberally as the fund* allowed. The magazines for the several institutions number 265. The total number of volumes in all the libraries is 15,482. Appreciative words come from superintendents, officers and the inmate population in return for the reading matter supplied. It continues notably true that the library at the Penitentiary is an essential part of that institution. More and more do the men request books along technical lines. These are supplied by buying the best that are published, as listed by those having knowledge of their merits. In addition to the libraries functioning since 1911, we are making beginnings in two institutions created by recent legislatures. We have iir books and magazines in circulation at the Reformatory for Women ork. The men at the Reformatory near Lincoln were so eager fur s that a loan of the Commission books was made while waiting for e which are to make up their permanent collection. On a certain rday morning these books were placed upon shelves which the boys made, according to our specification? in their manual training de - ment. One of the men was selected as librarian. A simple ch&amp;rg - system was explained to him. In less than an hour, and the noon at that, thirty books had been loaned and other men were waiting e served. Among the first thirty books chosen were Robin Hood. I seeking on the Dalton trail, Sons of liberty, Tom Sawyer. Uncle 'a modern miracles, Lone Ball's mistake, Mernoin of Sherlock Holmes, Boy Scouts. Dick Arnold of Raman college, Boys' book of sports, Eced trails, Heart of the west, Lure of the Labrador wild, Seventeen, Jackets of 1918 and Widow O'Callajrhan's boys. Some of the men rred reading the magazines which we had provided and one colored who could not read was particularly enjoying the stereoscope and i which we find are popular among many of the institutional people. The circulation reported for the preceding biennium, in all institu - tions, was 70,634. During the biennium just dosing, the loan reached 89,364, making an increase of 18,780. We have every reason to believe that these figures are accurate. In both cases, the numbers are exclusive of periodical literature, of which no record is kept. The greatest need of the libraries at present is a librarian in each </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 institution who can give more time to the work. One reason that our per capita circulation at the Penitentiary- and at the Tuberculous hos - pital is so large is because there is daily opportunity to exchange books. In some places we are greatly handicapped because little or no time is given to the library. It is with great regret that we read on one circula - tion blank each month "No librarian." We hope that the promise of the Board to change this condition may soon result in having some one to see that the books provided reach those who enjoy the diversion which they afford. In October, 1922, the secretary was invited to speak on Prison Li - raries at the Prison Conference in Detroit. A conflict of dates pre- vented attendance. Publicity In addition to the advertising which comes by way of its friends, the Commission has made use of some means of publicity. The Asso - ciated Press interviewed us regarding our work and broadcasted us thus. An article in the December first issue of the Nebraska Farm Journal is making: us known and bids fair to swamp us with requests. One of these under date of December 6, reads: "We will probably have many leisure winter evenings which we wish to use to some advantage and we want to take up a few studies. My husband decided to take up civil en - gineering and I want to take dressmaking and millinery. Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated." Some one unknown to us has brought us returns by entering the Commission in the Beatrice Fairfax lumn where we are advertised just below an answer to Brown Eyes. The secretary has talked on the Library Commission before a Uni - versity class in History of Education, at the state conference of the League of Women Voters, at the state Federation of Women's Clubs at Seward in 1921, and at four district Federation meetings in the spring cf 1922. Miss Nesbit represented the Commission at the state Federa- ion meeting in North Platte, in October, 1922. At each of these places e had on display an exhibit of attractively illustrated children's books, :in«l the American Library Association county library poster exhibit. We had book lists and leaflets on various topics for distribution, the supply of which was never sufficient. The county library exhibit of posters was displayed at the state Teachers Association in Lincoln in October, 1922. The secretary has talked on the county library, the Library Commission and allied subjects before several clubs. She has been obliged to decline invitations due to office demands and conflict of dates. The instances cited show that the means of making the Commission known are limited and casual. It is not possible to conduct an organized campaign of publicity because no facilities for so doing are provided. Needs The ninth biennial report of the Commission shows that 3,125 re- </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 que.ns were filled daring the year* 1916-1918. The requests filled during this biennium are 6,213, an increase of 99% in four years. The number on the staff remains the same as it did four years ago. Thi= does not mean that those in charge of the loans are doine; double the work of their predecessors. That would not be possible. It means that they have not had time to assist in other details of the work. General cor - respondence has materially increased during the lust two years. For these and other reasons the secretary is less free to meet the out-ol - office calls. It necessarily follows that if she gives proportionately too much time to office demands, the fiell work suffers, or \ice versa. The needs require a Field Agent. The Commission should have additional funds for maintenance and for books if it is to meet the needs of the state for the special service which it is trying to render. The requests for books and traveling li - braries cannot be filled promptly unless the collection can be enlarged. An increase nn the staff and iti books depends upon the appropriation of the legislature. We have presented these needs to the Governor lor his recommendation to the members of the coming session. PUBLIC LIBRARIES Seven tax -supported libraries have been added to the list of lie re ported two years ago, making 123 municipal and township libraries in Nebraska. These libraries are at Arapahoe, Bridgeport, Newman Grove Ralston, Rushville, Sargent and Ulysses, the two latter being towiishi; libraries. The municipal library of Fullerton now receives support fron two townships. This makes a total of 16 township libraries in the state There are in Nebraska 21 cities of a population of 3000 and up, ail of which have tax-supported libraries. There are 23 towns between 2000 and 3000 population, 20 of which maintain libraries by tax. Ord, South Sioux City and Wahoo have no libraries, though there is strong library interest in the two former towns. Nebraska has 65 towns be - tween 1000 and 2000 population; 48 of these have taxed libraries, 17 have not. Of these 17 towns, 15 have association libraries, leaving two with - out any library facilities, to our knowledge. These are Curtis and Wilbur. There are 32 towns under 1000 population which have taxed libraries. There have been added 21 association libraries during the last bien - nium. The secretary has assisted in the organisation or has visited 11 of these. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 The association libraries are those which are supported in other ways than by tax. The list is as follows, the newly organized being indicated by a star: The secretary of the Commission would appreciate being informed of any, unknown to her, which should be in the above list. If space per - mitted, some interesting stories might be told of the work which is being accomplished in some of these libraries. Several of them should soon grow into tax-supported libraries, either municipal or as a part of a county system. In almost every case, great credit is due a club of women with the proverbially faithful few giving abundantly of time and energy. The secretary has also had correspondence with a number of towns where there is an awakening; or reawakening of library interest. Since our last report Cozad and Scottsbluff have erected library buildings from money given by the Carnegie Corporation which was promised before the war-time withdrawal of gifts. The Cozad library was erected at a cost of $8,600.00, $6,000.00 from the Carnegie Corpora - tion, $2,500.00 from the citizens. The Scottsbluff library cost $16,000.00. This makes a total of 68 libraries erected by gifts from Mr. Carnesrie or the Carnegie Corporation. In May, 1922, Hebron dedicated a library which was built with the $13,000.00 bequest of L. O. Secrist, a former resident of Hebron, in 1918, Mr. J. M. Preston of Orleans gave money with which was erected a beautiful library in memory of his wife. Mr. Preston died in 1922, leaving an endowment of $20,000.00 to the Orleans township library. The Arnold township library received a bequest of $17,500.00, from Mrs. Sarah A. Finch, to be used for a library building. Auburn has been given a residence by the Allen brothers of that city. This house is being used at present by the library which was compelled to vacate its High School quarters. The general status of the public libraries in Nebraska is not ma - terially changed.

            <seg id="p014">14 creased, in some they have been lowered. The majority remain approx - imately the same as two years ago. Several library boards have seen fit to lower salaries. In about three-fourths of the libraries, salaries have been raised, in a few of which the librarian is receiving $1,500.00 or more. t Statistics show that in some libraries circulation has fallen off. In y there has been a normal growth. A few have made a rather phe - enal increase in the number of books loaned. In the latter instances, cause can be traced to unusually faithful service on the part of li ians who have library boards of vision. It is with regret that we record the death of three librarians, Ruth L. Borden, of Burwell, Lillian Simpkins, for many years the librarian in David City, and Mrs. Nettie Johnson of Fullerton. Kn 1921, a publicity committee was appointed by the Nebraska Li- Association, its object being to aid librarians by an exchange of &gt;ds of advertising employed. The committee consisted of Anna V. ngs, of the State Teachers Collet, Kearney, Edna D. Bullock of the lative Reference Bureau, Lincoln, and Marguerite Nesbit of the ry Commission, Lincoln. All clippings were to be sent to Miss t. The report of the chairman at the N. L. A. session of the St. h meeting in 1922 showed that a few excellei.t articles had been re- Klt is desired to continue and increase this work, the Conuniss: to get material enouph to issue circular letters from time to tir KThe League of Library Commissions, at its session in Detroit, in &gt;, 1922, expressed the belief that library work would develop faster if active interest of more library trustees coulu be secured. The rue, therefore, passed a resolution that it would make every effort to organize library trustees in every state. In accordance with this reso - lution, a circular letter was sent out by the secretary of the Commission to the trustees of the state. It is hoped that the tentative plan for such an organization may be furthered in the spring. Could we have cooper - ative action on the part of the trustees it would be possible to focus at - tention on librarianship, county libraries and other topics vital to the building of better libraries in Nebraska. The only change in the session laws of Nebraska for 1919, relating to libraries, is found in the compiled statutes of 1922, under Section 3186 as follows: Provided, further, that cities having home rule charters shall have the power to fix, by ordinance, the number of members of such li - brary boards. COUNTY LIBRARIES » There is a demand fron» rural Nebraska for reailinsr matter. Schools, s and individuals appeal to the sources of supply to borrow the books h they need for study and which they desire for recreation. Th» </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 principal sources of supply are state, municipal and township libraries The Library Commission is * state department functioning, in part, to render such service. Calls come to the Commission from far and near. They come from the less prosperous districts; they come from the parts of the state which take pride in providing the best in roads, in schools and in everything but libraries. On another page of this report it has been said that the Commission and other state sources of book-supply cannot promptly meet the demands upon them, the delay in some in - -tances being beyond the time of need. There are small and scattered circles of library facilities which rep - resent the municipal and township libraries of the state. In a carefully prepared pamphlet by Professor J. O. Rankin of the Agricultural College on "Reading matter in Nebraska farm homes," he states that less than two-tiftha of the people of Nebraska are within these circles. It follows that more than three-fifths of the population are without library facili - ties. Many of the people in the three-fifths class apply to their nearest town library for books. Some are paying a nominal sum for the privi - lege; others are receiving gratis a service which is paid for by the taxed population supporting the library. Many of our libraries are not well enough financed to meet all the needs of the people within the taxed area, making it obviously impossible to render satisfactory service to all, if not unfair to the town to try to serve tM country. There are in Nebraska a few libraries where the unit is extended from the municipality to the township, the tax being shared by all living ■vithin the township. Some of these libraries are reaching a large part of the people within the prescribed limits. But the state does not lend itself to this plan because all counties do not have township organization. Nor is a scattered township here and there able greatly to lessen Ne - braska's unlibraried population. Since there is a demand for books from the rural population and the ources of supply are not adequate, how is the problem to be solved? Our reply is that the matter merely resolves itself into a question as to whether those outside library circles desire sufficiently to be within such a circle to pay for the privilege. This can be done by means of a county library for which the Nebraska law makes provision. A county library is a circulating library maintained by the county to provide books for everybody in the county. It can be supported by a small tax upon the county at a much lower per capita cost than the municipality imposes upon itself for its library privileges. At a time when Dakota corn was selling for less than Nebraska com, a Dakota farmer bringing in his ancful of books expressed his ap - preciation of the county library which provides him and his family with reading matter at so slight a cost. In spite of the fact that a pair of husking mittens and a bushel of corn have sold at equal prices in Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 bra&amp;ka, the question of county libraries has been agitated in some coun - ties during the last two years. It is necessary that the interest develop within the county, the initiative being tajten by those who see the need oi county-wide library service. When they feel this need, they will take nieans to provide it. The Library Commission is ready to assist in any such campaign by loaning material on the county library and by personal NEBRASKA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION In October, 1921, the Nebraska Library Association held its 27th annual conference in Grand Island with 66 registered in attendance. This was considered a good representation for a location thus far re - moved from the library center of the state The policy of the association culminating in the meeting at Grand Island was an emphasis of the need that greater support be given the Library Commission. At this meeting, Nebraska accepted an invitation of the Missouri Library Association to meet in a Missouri Valley Conference in 1922. fOn invitation of the respective librarj- boards, two district meetings : held, one in Fairbury in May, 1921, the other in Falls City in May, . These meetings were under the supervision of the N. L. A. officer. . dng in cooperation with the Commission, and ably assisted by the rians, Miss McQuaid and Miss Hutchings. The attendance was large but a sufficient number was present to stimulate discussion. I very informal nature of the one-day meetings made them of profit r airbury there was about an equal nurrber of trustees and librarian - nitting the afternoon session to take the form of two group confei s. Wteather conditions interfered with the attendance at Falls City a number of topics were enthusiastically discussed. At both place. - were most cordially welcomed. It is our hope to continue the c ng-time district meetings over the state.
