1 desire to call attention to the fact that no vault has as yet

the Supreme Court. It is unnecessary to urge the very

B valuable records of the Supreme Court. I would therefore 
ipectfully request that the Legislature be recommended to 
propriate the sum of four thousand dollars, or so much 
areof as may be necessary, to build and furnish a suitable
