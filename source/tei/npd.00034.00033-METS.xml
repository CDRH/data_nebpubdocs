Each member may enroll in one or more of these courses. Ehe lessons as outlined in this bulletin are taken up one each th. Most of the work is done by the girls at home, especially ng the months when school is not in session. In many towns and rural communities the girls, who are espe - cially interested in the study of domestic science, form a local club that meets once or twice every month. At these meetings they compare their work, study and discuss some particular topic sug - gested by the lesson, or a topic of interest to all members, and also take up the problems to be developed in the next lesson. A teacher, or other person interested in the work, acts as local leader and advisor of the club. f'hen a club member has completed the work given in the lesson, makes out a report from questions given at the close of the in. She submits this report to the local leader or sends it to state leader. Girls who complete satisfactorily Course No. I in Sewing as given in this bulletin may enroll for Course Xo. II in Sewing the following year. Teachers will find these courses well adapted for use in the gram - mar grades of both rural and village schools and also for use in high school. Much of the work must necessarily be done by the girls at home, especially where the school has no domestic science equipment. Sewing is an art and a science. Every lesson should be correlated with other subjects taught in the school. Very practical and inter - esting lessons in language, drawing, physiology, geography and arithmetic may be taught and illustrated from these lessons. Teach - ing of this kind will not only bring real life into the work of the school but will also bring the school life into the home. All articles in sewing, made by club members and according to directions given in this bulletin, should be exhibited at State and 4 f\% | *i f \y t^/^tri tpcf C f\T fr tt^ T^^\7C Q T"lfl l»1 1*1C I li1nC vuuiiiy LUiiicaia ui inc uuya ewiu vjii is \_iul&gt;s. </seg>

            <seg id="p005">5 LESSON NO. 1 DUSTING CAP We will need good tools to work with and then let us keep them in good condition. The first thing to think about each time that we sew is to have our hands washed very clean and well dried. Necessary Equipment I, package of assorted needles containing Numbers 5 to 10. Then can select the needle that will be suitable for the material we using. rhite thread, Numbers 50, 60, 70 and 80. pair of sharp scissors with good points. Select a thimble that fits the finger and never sew without it. A tape measure that has each inch divided into eighths. A Few General Directions for Sewing Sit in an erect position having the feet flat on the floor sitting well back in the chair so that one will not become tired. Hold the work up to the eyes instead of bending down to it. Have all the stitches small and even so that the work will be neatly and care - fully done. Have the wrong side when finished as neat as possi - ble. Use short threads for sewing not over 18 to 27 inches long except in basting, then they may be longer. If the end of the thread that is broken from the spool is put into the eye of the eye of the needle, the thread is not as apt to knot. Never bite the thread as it often cracks the enamel of the teeth. Stitches Used for this Lesson Basting The object of basting is to hold two or more pieces of material until a stronger stitch can secure them, and it may also be used as a </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Beginning and ending: Begin with a knot because the stitches are to be removed. Fasten the thread by taking two or three small stitches over each other. FIGURE NO. 1 r'ethod of work: Sew from right to left. In the even basting stitches follow each other consecutively having the stitches and space the same length. Running Stitch te running stitch is made the same as the even basting except the stitches are tiny and more than one stitch is taken at a Hemming Use: Used to finish the raw edges in clothing and other articles. Turning hem: Hold wrong side of the material next to you, make the turn for the hems come toward the worker. Have first turn of hem narrow, second turn may be any desired width but when decided upon should be kept uniform. Baste the hem down. ifethod of work: The stitch is worked from right to left, through edge of the folded hem. A knot may be used to begin with if an be concealed, otherwise let the end of the thread lie along ere the first stitches will cover it. Fasten the thread with two three small stitches taken over each other, then let the end of thread go back into the hem. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 FIGURE NO. 2 I/ork is held over first finger of left hand having the needle it toward the left shoulder. The stitch is taken first into the erial and then into the edge of the hem. Stitches are kept ting on both sides of the material. Keep slant and size of :hes uniform. If material is to be laundered the stitches should fully to right side of material although little of the material ild be taken up by the needle. Overhanding Use : Used to fasten two pieces of material together in a strong seam that will be scarcely visible. Good for selvages on underwear and bed linen, for patching table linen and for sewing on lace. FIGURE NO. 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Lessotts in Seizing Icthod of work: Baste together the selvage edges, or if not ge have a small turn placed in material before basting. Work i right to left. May begin with a knot but generally it is better t the thread lie along on top of the edge, covering it by the stitches. The overhanding stitch is a slanting stitch on the lg side and a straight stitch on the right side. It is better to c the stitch on the wrong side of the material so the slanting of the stitch will come on the wrong side and the straight on the right side. This will be less visible because the straight li will fall in the direction in which the threads are woven. Hold material over first finger of left hand, having the needle point toward the chest. Stitches should be only a couple of threads deep and should be close together but not overlap. Avoid an ugly ridge. Back Stitch This is one of the strongest stitches we have. i'sc: Used where there is a strain, or it may either imitate 01 replace machine stitching. It may begin with a knot if it can be concealed. Work is held over first finger of left hand with needle slanting toward left shoulder. FIGURE NO. 4 Eethod of work: Baste the two pieces of material together to them from sliding and to serve as a guide line for the back i. Sewing starts at the right side of material and goes toward left. Where work is to begin bring the needle up through rial about 1/8 inch from end of cloth, take a short stitch back Doer side of cloth and a stitch twice as lone forward on the </seg>

The effect on the right side is a series of stort stitches one meeting the other, while the wrong side gives a cord-like effect. Dusting Cap Materials Suitable E.wn, dimity, linen, organdie, dotted swiss, calico, percale, te, flaxon, chambray, seersucker, gingham, cotton challie, crepe. It may be made of same material as the house-dress or apron. unt of Material 20 inch square of material. 2 yards of lace. 1 yard of beading (either lace or embroidery) unless a bias piece of goods is used. Yi yard of elastic cord or narrow flat elastic. Method of Cutting K'ut out of paper a pattern that is a circle having a diameter of inches. Pin paper pattern firmly to cloth that is to be wed, out material around edge of pattern, keeping the edge very &gt;oth and without any jagged places. Making Hemming: Make first turn for hem 1/8 inch or less, turning the edge to the wrong side of the material. Make second turn for hem y% inch deep. Baste hem down using even basting stitches with stitches and spaces J4 mcn l° n &amp;- Frequently check the length of the basting stitches and the width of the hem with tape-measure to be sure distances are kept uniform. Using a fine thread and needle, hem down the % inch hem according to directions given for hemming. ■'ewing on lace: Before the plaits are turned, ov«r-hand the lace the cap. §fter allowing for seam on lace, divide the cap and lace each eighths and pin these points together.

Finishing cap: Fold cap into fourths and make creases toward center ,then crease into eighths and then into sixteenths. At each crease pin in a plait at the edge of the material that is Y\ of an inch deep. Turn all of the plaits the same way. Decrease the depth of the plaits as they go toward the center of the cap and pin plaits again 2 inches from edge of cap. faste outside edge of beading one inch from edge of material ling a good curve, then baste the other edge. Back stitch both :s of beading to make it strong. Place elastic cord in beading, ing the ends firmly after the length has been adjusted to fit head. A bow of ribbon may be added to the cap to make it e attractive. QUESTIONS ■ What kind of material did you use ? Number of thread used ? Number of needle used? 2. Was the hem kept smooth and of uniform width? 3. Did the hemming stitches slant on both sides? ■ Were your overhanding stitches taken so that there was no bad ridge left? ■ Did you keep the depth of the plaits and the distance between them uniform? 6. Did you leave any loose ends of threads? 7. Were all the basting stitches on the cap removed? ■ Were you able to keep the thread and the cap clean as you worked ? </seg>

"A" sists of a long running stitch on the upper side, and a short :h on the opposite side. "B" consists of a long stitch and two more short running stitches. This stitch holds work more ily than "A". Ese: It is used in preparing work for machine or hand sewing re there is little danger of the material slipping apart, or where ide line is needed. Overcasting Object is to keep raw edge of material from raveling. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 KHil KK NO. 6 Method of work: May begin with a knot if it can be concealed. Usually made from right to left. Work is held over the hrst nnger or two fingers of left hand. Place the needle over the raw edges and through the material having it slant toward the left shoulder. Have the stitches slant on both sides and do not draw tight. The kind of material will determine the depth of the stitch and the distance apart, and after this has been decided upon it should be kept uniform. Feather Stitch re term "feather" comes from the graceful form of stitch, stitch can be modified to suit different conditions. Bse: May be used to hold down hems in place of running stitch : may be merely ornamental. </seg>

Different varieties of feather stitch may be made by a change in the downward stitch. It may go diagonally toward center or it may be vertical along the threads of the material. Other variations may be made by taking two or more stitches on each side. When this is done the group should he placed close together or a straggly effect will result.

If the material is 18 inches or wider, then the towel may be % to 1 yard long. Hemstitching Ise: A decorative finish for hems on handkerchiefs, underwear household articles such as towels, dresser scarfs, table covers, linen, etc. It is also the foundation for drawn work. I reparation of material: Decide on width of hem. which will from 1 inch for the 27 to 30 inch towels, to 2 inches for the [ towels. Allow enough for twice width of hem plus enough the first turn, which will be about J4 inch. Draw the threads ng the number depend on the material and the size of the ;1. There is danger of pulling too many threads so it is better nil too few at first as more can be pulled out later. Basting hem: Make first turn for hem on a thread of the goods, then baste the second turn so that it comes just to the edge of the threads that have been drawn. Baste this carefully. Overhand the ends of the hem. FIGURE XO. 11 A — 1st step. Shows needle going under group of threads. B— 2nd step. Shaws needle going around group of threads and into hem. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 I'cthod of work: Use a fine thread about No. 60 or 70. There a number of ways of doing the hemstitching and several of them equally good. This method is a strong, simple and satisfactory- Begin as in hemming, on the wrong side of the material, ide on the number of threads to be taken up each time and i the number uniform, although it is not necessary to count n each time as the eye can tell whether they seem to be th: - e size bundles or not. Begin by fastening the thread under the hem without a knot. Hold work as in hemming. Have needle go under the number of threads decided upon and bring it out without catching it into the hem at all. Put needle back over these same threads and under again as at first but this time the needle goes through the folded hem beside the last thread of the group. Pull the thread toward the hem and have the group of threads kept distinct. Do not leave any threads betyeen the groups. Double Hemstitching Eethod of work: This is done by taking up the same group of ids on the other side of the drawn threads, here the needle will i into the goods the second time instead of the folded hem. QUESTION'S ■ What was the length and width of your towel ? How wide wa= the hem? ■ What number of thread did you use? Did you overhand the ends of the hem? I Did you use this method of hemstitching or another? Were your groups of threads uniform size across the towel? Were there any threads left between the groups of threads? Did you hold the work as in hemming? </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 LESSON NO. IV CROSS STITCH EMBROIDERY Eis is the simplest form of embroidery and is used for marking rclothes, linens, other household articles and for an orna - al finish in fancy work. Materials A — Towel that was hemstitched for last lesson. i — Cross-stitch canvas which is 36 inches wide and costs 25 cents per yard. A medium fine grade is the better. It may be obtained by sending to Miller &amp; Paine, Lincoln, Xebr., or any other large dry goods store. A piece of the cross-stitch canvas that is the width of the towel and a few squares wider than the design will be needed. — Thread : The D. M. C. cotton No. 18 or 25, or any other good make of cotton. A single color may be used, or a combina - tion of colors, but if combinations are used they should be carefully selected that they may be harmonious. Design Inv desired design may be used ; working out an original one is best way and is good practice. Books with Cross Stitch designs t be obtained from the dry goods stores in many places or the cilia Cross Stitch Book can be obtained for 2? cents from the icilla Publishing Co.. 85 Broad Street, Boston. Mass. Before ing the design on the towel, work out carefully the design to ned on paper that has small squares on it. Then by counting the ires the canvas can be cut to correspond, allowing a few extra ires on each side to help in removing the canvas. Placing Canvas on Towel Baste canvas firmly along both sides and have it even with threads of towel. Canvas is used to keep the stitches accurate in size and when work is finished it is pulled out thread by thread leav - ing the design worked on the towel. Care should be taken that the canvas is not basted too far from the hemstitching and not nearer than ]/ 2 inch. Distance depending upon the size of the towel and width of design used. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 FIGURE NO. 12 This illustration shows the canvas much larger than that used. Making of Cross Stitch I he stitch is double and consists of two slanting lines crossing le middle on the right side of material and forming two lines of ;r vertical or horizontal stitches on the wrong side. The needle •ought up through the canvas in one of the smaller squares and i over diagonally into another of the small squares, then is ight up again to form the other part of the cross as in "A" of illustration. If there is a long line of stitches to be taken those ting all one way may be made first, then come back with the r slant completing the crosses as in "B" of the illustration. If e are frequent breaks it is better to finish each cross at the time. Phe crosses should just meet at the corners so that there is no erial left between. Begin and end with 2 or 3 little stitches n over each other on the wrong side which do not show on right side. Eraw the threads quite tight so that when the canvas is removed threads will not be loose. The thread should not catch into the /as but go into the holes, otherwise the threads will be broken </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 roving the canvas. When design is completed pull out the and'press towel on the wrong side. Initial Im the other end of the towel a cross stitch initial may be placed the center of the towel and the same distance from the hem - :hing that the design was placed. QUESTIONS 1. What colors of thread did you use? What number? ■ Was your design original or did you copy it? Did you draw it on the squared paper before putting it on the towel? I How large was your towel and how far did you place the de - sign from the hemstitching? Was the initial the same dis - tance from the hemstitching? ■ Was any of the material left between the corners of the crosses where they met? ■ Did you have the center of the design come at the center of the towel ? ■ Were any threads caught into the canvas? Was the work too loose after the canvas was removed? I Was the wrong side neat where you began and ended the threads ? 8. Are your stitches on the wrong side all vertical or horizontal? Did you have long threads going from one part of the de - sign to another? </seg>

It may have either a round or a square [ and may be finished in a belt at the waist line or extend below t does in the pattern. To select size of pattern: Correct measurements should be taken in all fitting work as this is one of the secrets for making sewing easier. This pattern comes in sizes 32, 36, 40 and 44 bust meas - ure. To find which will be the correct size pass a tape measure loosely over the fullest part of the bust, having it come close up under the arms and slightly raised in the back. Materials Suitable Eainsook, longcloth, cambric, (Lonsdale or Berkeley), barred lin, barred nainsook, etc. It is well to shrink the material be - making it up.

The button-holes will be made in the right side he corset cover and the buttons sewed on the left side because right part of any waist should be on the top whether fastening he front or back. Button-holes Any girl may well be proud of her button-holes if she can do them beautifully. For nice button-holes do not use coarse needle or thread. For the corset cover about No. 60 thread and a No. 9 needle will be good. Kutting the button-hole: Button-hole scissors are convenient but not necessary. To cut button-holes without them use a pair of sors with good sharp points and two pins. Decide on the location of the button-hole and the distance it is to be from the edge of the cloth and place one pin at this point. With another pin follow along the threads of the cloth and place second pin just the distance needed for the button. For a flat button this will be just the size of the button, if it is thick then allow a little extra.

Stranding: This is done to strengthen the button-hole and also to act as a guide while they are being made. It may be done with the stranding stitches, beginning at the lower corner farthest from the edge of the cloth. 3 2. / FIGURE NO. IS At the ends of the button-hole the stranding may be doubled giving a thread on the upper and lower side of the cloth. Stranding is often done with running stitches or if the material is apt to slip or to fray it is well to do it with machine stitching. Eercasting; If the goods frays easily it is well to overcast the of the button-hole. This will be covered by the button-hole later. Eutton-hole stitch: In making button-holes it is better not to n with a knot, but start with a few small stitches that will be :red. Commence to make the button-hole stitch from the same e where the stranding began. I^ork from right to left. Insert the needle at the end of the and have it come out the depth the button-hole is to be and at it angles to the slit.

Patching Patching is used where the hole is too large to be darned. A piece of material is inserted into the hole to take the place of a torn or worn part. The method used will depend upon the kind of material, whether it is new or old, the location on the garment and how much strain there will be on the patch. In all patching the material should be matched if possible, if there are stripes, checks or figures these should match, also the warp and woof threads and the nap if there Materials for the Patching 2 pieces of material 4 inches by 5 inches which represent the garment that is to be patched. 1 pieces of same material as before 2 ! /&gt; in. by Z]/ 2 in. cut so they match the larger pieces when placed on the center of them, gingham, percale, calico, etc.. will do.

Shape and sice of patch ; It is usually square or rectangular de - pending upon the hole and the worn parts. It must be large enough to cover the hole and the worn parts plus J4 m - to allow for what will be turned under. Placing of patch : It is placed on the wrong side of the material so that it matches exactly the larger piece. </seg>

            <seg id="p033">33 Method of zvork (a) Easier way : Cut a small hole near center of larger piece to represent the hole that is to be patched.

Cut each corner of the l /n inch diagonally toward the outside corner of the patch, very careful not to cut too. deep. Eum edge of goods under l /$ inch and baste down onto the patch iround, then hem. Have the stitches as small and invisible as iible.

Cut small hole in larger piece to represent hole that is to be patched.

Overhand with very small stitches all around patch. tut away the garment (the larger piece) on the wrong side to same distance as the edge of the patch. Cut diagonally in each ler up to overhanding stitches. Remove surplus material at corners. Press seam open. Overcast the raw edges. The h should slip into the hole and, therefore, show little on the t side. (b) Harder way : Cut out the hole as it is to be, then turn in edge to wrong side. Cut patch and turn in edge so it will just match the hole, insert and overhand on wrong side. Darning Ksed to repair worn or torn parts of many materials by inserting threads.

Any of the following may be used : (a) Raveled warp threads of the same material give most satisfactory results. Warp threads are those going lengthwise of the material, they generally are the stronger threads. Woof or weft threads are those going across from selvage to selvage. It may be necessary to wax the end of the raveling to make it thread into the needle. (b) Silk thread one shade darker than goods may be used. It often helps to split the thread using 1/3 at a time. (c) Fine cotton thread. (d) Hair that nearly matches the color of the goods makes an invisible darn, good for fine lace or silk darning. Method of Darning There are to be four different kinds of tears to be darned on this Kirst darn. Straight tear called Plain or Cloth Darn: Cut a : at least ]/ 2 in. long going either with the warp or the woof ads. i/brk is usually done on the wrong side. Running stitches are le going back and forth at right angles to the tear leaving a 11 loop each time a turn is made so that the darn will lie out The distance that the stitches go beyond the tear depends a the strength needed. To weave the torn edges down have needle go over the edge from one side going one way and over otn the other side on coming back. FIGURE NO. 18 </seg>

Padding Eis is always done on the napkin and will wear much better being laundered if done with the cotton than if the paper s are used. E'ethod of work: A double thread may be used. First outline design either with running stitches or the outline stitch, having i come just at the inside edge of the letter so that one can fol - along the outer edge of the letter with the satin stitch and in way it will be easier to keep the edge of the satin stitch straight. The outline stitch is a good one to use, especially if the stitches are kept small on the under side. E padding of center, hoops may or may not be used. The pad - must be carefully done for irregularities in the padding show e finished work. Use either the outline or the chain stitch for the padding. Begin to pad by going around next to the outlining adding row after row until they come together at the center. Where the spaces are wider the number of lines must be increased. If the letter is desired rounded or higher at the center then two or three rows are worked on top of the padding there. </seg>

It is better to have the padding hes short on the wrong side, so that all of the padding will lie he upper surface. Satin Stitch Ehere are many stitches and combinations of stitches used for king linen but one that is used the most is the satin stitch, also used for much of the fancy work. This is a substantial h which will wear for years and is beautiful if well done. A fine thread makes much prettier work than a coarse one. D. M. C. No. 30 is a good number to use, especially after it is laun- Method of work : Use a single thread. Do not use any knots but begin in the design with 2 or 3 running stitches. The work is done from side to side of the design at right angles to it. After a little practice one may make the needle go down and up at the same time having the needle go from right to left. The stitch is usually worked toward the worker. The edges should be kept straight and the stitches worked close together so that the padding will all be covered; still the stitches </seg>

To work around curves the stitches on the inner side should be placed nearer together so that there will not need to be gaps on the outer edge. The wrong side should be as neat and smooth as the upper side. All of the stitches should be drawn equally tight so that the work when finished will look like a solid mass and not have individual stitches showing. The stitches should be drawn firm but the linen srnntrld be smooth. Iint/le Hues: Where a single line occurs it should be done in the i stitch also. A single line of outlining is often used for the ling- which should be completely covered.

Materials Suitable Yi yd. linen at least 22 in. wide (natural linen color is the better) 2/3 yd. outing flannel. Either a dark red or a blue are pretty. A pink could be used but it is not as pretty with the natural colored linen. A white or cream is not as good to use for the silver does not stay bright so long in it. 2/3 yd. of narrow ribbon to match outing flannel tpool Crochet Cotton to match also. ng Out Material Kake a paper pattern: Cut an oblong 21 in. by 14 in. and be sure easures exactly true. * E) curve the corners, measure each way from the corner 3 in. then draw a curve between these dots that you think will give 3d shape to the corners. Have all the corners alike. I'utting linen: Pin the pattern to the linen in several places; n cut out the linen, cutting it J4 ■• larger all around than the tern. While the pattern is still pinned in place turn the edge the linen over the paper and make a crease that will help to ke it easier in making the turn on the linen. Now unpin the tern and baste the turn on the linen which is J4 •"• deep, keeping ood even edge. I~utting the outing flannel: (a) Cut a ctraight piece of the outing inel 8 in. wide and 23 in. long, (b) Pin the paper pattern on the outing flannel and cut it out allowing y 2 in. from the paper around on this instead of the % in. as we did on the linen. Catch Stitch Eis is one of the simpler of the embroidery stitches. It is used Id down hems, to hold flannel seams open, for an ornamental , etc. </seg>

Start with a slanting stitch and place the needle in the clotli pointing toward the worker, bringing it out on the same line; cru-. over to the other side with a slanting stitch and proceed as before. Keep the two sides of the stitch even and have the stitches kept the same distance apart. Making Case Inside piece: Turn the edge of the straight piece over 1 inch each side and have the piece 6 inches wide ; baste both edges, i Catch Stitch them with the Crochet Cotton. A Catch Stitch ut 3/16 of an inh wide is a pretty size to use. Trim off the ' edge of the wrong side close to the Catch Stitching so the ons will not catch in it. Also trim off the ends of this piece if 5 longer than necessary when the two parts are put together. Kutside piece: Firmly pin the linen (that has been basted) on of the outing flannel, turn the edge of it toward the linen let - the outing flannel extend beyond the linen about y&amp; of an FHJIRE XO. 28 </seg>

Catch Stitch all ind this piece having the crosses come on the linen, and have stitches go through the outing flannel so that they resemble two s of running stitches on the other side. R lacing the two parts together: Pin and then baste along both 5 of the six-inch piece on the inside of the case having it come same distance from the two outer edges of the case. f) divide into 12 parts: Baste both ends of the six-inch piece l to the sides of the case. Fold the case across the center the t way and make a crease ; using this as guide line, baste down center to have it to guide the row of Catch Stitching. Meas - g \y± in. each way from the center, place the next rows of ng threads, and so on across the case having the rows of bast - \}i in. apart. This will divide the case into 12 parts that Id be equal in size. Catch stitch down these divisions but do let the stitches go through far enough to catch into the linen Eyou do not have these as you think they should be, take out part that it not good. When the work is not right take it out do your best to make it right the first time you do it. "Be sure are right, then go ahead." There is no place where this axiom iy more true than in sewing. Thinking before doing is better i ripping afterwards. Begin and end the rows of catch stitching where they meet the first catch stitching you did on the six-inch piece. The spoons in this case can be slipped in from either side and so form a better shaped roll. Ktwimg on ribbon for the ties: Fold the two sides of the case r so that they meet at the center, then roll up the case. Sew the center of the ribbon on to the end of the case with catch stitches, then tie the ribbon around the case. OfESTIONS I. What did you pay for your 'j yard of linen?
