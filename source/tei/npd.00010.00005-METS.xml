SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT. 

EXPERIMENTAL WORK. 

The work of the Experiment Station for the current year 
has been directed mainly along lines that were previously 
established. Some new problems have been taken up in 
agriculture and in animal pathology. Cooperative experimental 
work in determining the varieties of corn best 
adapted to different portions of the state has been undertaken 
by the Department of Agriculture. Twenty-one 
varieties of corn are being tested in thirty-nine different 
localities. Experiments to determine hardy varieties of 
winter wheat for the northern and western portions of the 
State, and to develop a superior variety of oats, have been 
continued. Experiments have also been undertaken looking 
to the improvement of alfalfa by selection of individual 
plants: to the tests of varieties of forage plants and 
mixtures of grasses for pasture. The soy bean and cowpea 
have been tested to determine their adaptability to Nebraska 
conditions, and their availability as furnishing protein foods 
to balance our corn rations. The experiments in soil tillage 
and crop rotation have been continued. 

Emg horticultural lines, investigation has been carried 
vering orchard cultivation and the use of cover crops, 
ation of old apple orchards, mulching vegetables by 
and earth mulches, the improvement of apples and 
cherries, and the investigation of bean hybrids looking 
&gt; selection of superior varieties. 

In dairy husbandry, experimental work has been directed 
along the line of rearing calves on hand separator milk with 
various fat substitutes, in crossbreeding experiments to 
determine the value of a dairy herd when crossbred with 
beef sires in the production of feeding steers, this experiment 
being cooperative with Animal Husbandry. Experiments 
have also been conducted in the comparison of alfalfa 
and wild hay for dairy cows and in testing other dairy 
rations ; also in determining the best week in the period of 
lactation of a dairy cow. 

The Department of Animal Husbandry has directed its </seg>

            <seg id="p008">
8 


attention to the determination of the best rations for wintering 
steers, a comparison of wheat and corn in the feeding 
of both steers and pigs, a test of the feeding value of dried 
blood when fed with corn and with mixed rations and a 
comparison of the feeding value of different breeds of pigs. 
Experiments have also been carried on with the Station 
herds in pasturing alfalfa. 

The Department of Chemistry has carried on its work 
largely in cooperation with other departments, spending a 
great deal of its energy in working on the poisons that affect 
sorghum and Kafir corn. This Department during the past 
year has discovered prussic acid in sorghum and Kafir corn, 
this Station being the first in the United States to make the 
discovery. A large amount of cooperative work has also 
been done with the Department of Agriculture in analyzing 
different grains. The Department proposes to direct its 
attention to the analysis of insecticides, preservatives and 
fertilizers and the analysis of irrigation waters in cooperation 
with other departments. 

The Department of Animal Pathology has given its 
attention largelv to a study of the cornstalk disease and of 
sorghum poisoning in cattle, together with the distribution 
of blackleg vaccine and assistance in controlling outbreaks 
of cholera where it has been called upon. The experiments 
in eradicating abortion in cattle and studying the true cause 
of this disease have been pursued for the last two years with 
the results that by proper disinfection of the male animals 
this disease can be controlled. The investigations of calf 
cholera, which have led to the disinfection of the navel of 
the young calf, have resulted in a very material decrease in 
the mortality of calves from this cause. 

R Department of Botany has carried on investigations 
he diseases of sugar beets and in the diseases of fruit 
and has cooperated with the Department of Animal 
logy. 

Ki Department of Irrigation Engineering has given 
time to the study of irrigation resources and practices 
State. 

The Department of Entomology has been studying the </seg>

Kb African locust fungus, visiting several infected dis-3 
in the State and distributing a considerable amount of 
us to destroy both the grasshopper and the chinch bug. 

STAFF. 

But few changes in the Station staff have taken place. 
The Department of Agricultural Chemistry has been made 
an independent department, being separated from the 
Department of Chemistry at the University, Dr. Samuel 
Avery having been placed in charge of this Department as 
Station Chemist at the resignation of Mr. Henry B. Slade to 
accept a position as Chemist in the Idaho Experiment 
Station September 1, 1902. Mr. A. T. Wiancko resigned 
the position of Assistant Agriculturist December 31, 1902. 

IMPROVEMENTS. 

During the current year very little has been done in the 
way of improvements or additional equipment, as the funds 
available for the Experiment Station were barely sufficient 
to maintain the work of the departments already organized 
and no funds were available for Station improvement The 
special appropriation by the Legislature of $2,500 for 
experiments in cornstalk disease has been expended under 
the Department of Animal Pathology : cooperating with the 
Departments of Botany and Chemistry, and a report of this 
work is in the hands of the Governor. The Station has been 
furnished animals and feed by the University to carry on 
experiments in animal husbandry, so that no expense has 
been incurred for animals in the feeding experiments carried 
on during the year. 

COOPERATIVE EXPERIMENTS. 

Cooperative experiments have been undertaken by the 
Departments of Agriculture and Horticulture with the 
Agricultural Students' Association and the Nebraska Corn 
Improvers' Association. The United States Department of 
Agriculture is cooperating with the following departments 
of the Station : Agriculture, in furnishing seeds of forage 
and grass plants and of macaroni wheat for testing and distribution; 
Animal Pathology, in distributing blackleg 
vaccine; Horticulture, in crossbreeding and in testing 
garden crops. </seg>

STATION EXTENSION. 

Eleven members of the Station staff have assisted in 
Farmers' Institutes during the past winter. The addresses 
at these meetings have furnished a means of disseminating 
the results of experimental work among the people and 
have furnished an opportunity for Station men to become 
acquainted with the needs of the farmers. It is believed 
that the experimental work carried on at the Station is in 
close sympathy with the needs of the farmers of this State 
and that the practical line of experiments in progress is appreciated 
by our best farmers. The various State societies 
which meet at the University each year, including the State 
Board of Agriculture, the State Horticultural Society, the 
State Dairymen's Association, the State Live Stock 
Breeders' Association, the State Swine Breeders' Association, 
the State Veterinary Medical Association, the State 
Poultry Association, have endorsed the work of the Experiment 
Station. 

PUBLICATIONS. 

iTo accomodate the increased mailing list, the bulletins are 
&gt;w published in 20,000 and 25,000 editions, and the Annual 
eport, containing the financial statement and some of the 
ore techincal experimental work of the departments, is 
lblished in an edition of 2,500 copies.

POISONOUS WEEDS. 

BOTANICAL DEPARTMENT, NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION. 

The investigation of the poisonous plants of the state was 
begun more than a year ago in the hope that it would 
throw some light on the so-called "cornstalk disease" which 
has caused very heavy losses of cattle and horses for a 
number of years. The importance of an investigation of 
this kind cannot be overlooked when it is known that the 
annual losses of stock in this state alone mount up into the 
hundreds of thousands if not into the millions of dollars. 

Many stockmen have been of the opinion that this disease 
is not due entirely to the cornstalks, but rather to poisonous 
plants (which might be of more or less abundance) in the 
fields. For this reason a great deal of time has been given 
to the examination of cornfields all over the state. However, 
pastures, meadows and ranges have received their 
share of attention. In general, the most thorough study 
was made in the parts of the state where serious losses of 
stock had occurred during 1901 and previous years. Stockmen 
and farmers all over the state have manifested a lively 
interest in the work and have aided uo very materially in 
getting together very important data. The members of the 
station staff who have had this work in hand feel deeply 
indebted to those who have so kindly given their time and 
generous assistance in studying the actual conditions where 
poisoning had occurred, and in furnishing conveyances to 
places which otherwise could not have been visited. 

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH POISONING OCCURS. 

As a rule, animals accustomed to a certain range, pasture, 
or field, seldom eat noxious or poisonous plants when there 
is plenty of other forage. Now and then we find an animal 
that will touch plants which are generally shunned. Such 
animals seem to have acquired the habit of eating harmful 
plants in much the same way as one acquires the oDium or </seg>


            <seg id="p015">
15 

tobacco habit. It is positively known that the appetite of 
some horses becomes so depraved that they will eat nothing 
but the Loco-weeds when turned out upon the range, and it 
is only with difficulty that they can be made to eat whole- 

A careful examination of some pastures and ranges shows 
that they are pastured too heavily and that cattle are often 
compelled to eai unwholesome plants in order to keep from 
starving. Several bead of cattle were lost in pastures near 
Madison. Nebraska, during the latter part of the fall of 1901 
because they were compelled to eat Snow-on-the-Mountain 
irhin iifinjin-itii) as a last resort. Very often when 
cattle are turned out of bare pastures into other pastures or 
fields where there is a luxuriant growth of vegetation, they 
are so ravenously hungry that they do not discriminate between 
the poisonous and non-poisonous plants, but eat everything 
in sight. 

Cases of poisoning are known to occur in early spring 
when stock are turned out on ranges where poisonous plants 
are found to precede the forage plants. This seems to be 
true of the Loco-weeds, which form light green clusters or 
rosettes, in early spring, all over the hillsides in many parts 
of the sand-hill and foot-hill regions of this state. It is 
probably the conspicuousness of these clusters that attracts 
animals to them. Tne plants may not be very palatable at 
first, but since there is very little or no other forage in sight, 
thev are often eaten. 

g seasons of severe drought, the native grasses mature 
early in the season. This, no doubt, exercises conable 
influence on the occurrence of poisoniag, as a 
)er of other plants may remain green and inviting to 
: after the principal forage plants are dry and withered. 

E»ry often cattle, when turned into stubble fields and 
stalks, eat quantities of such plants as remain green 
more or less succulent after the early fall frosts. Many 
fields and grain fields that have been examined were 
d to contain several species of the Nightshade family. 
', even if there were no poisonous principle in the plants, </seg>

            <seg id="p016">
16 


Ki might result from eating them in much the same way 
does where cattle used to dry pastures are turned into 
r or alfalfa fields. 

While the heaviest losses of stock have been in the stalk 
fields during the fall and winter seasons, and on the ranges 
and in pastures during the grazing season, there are on 
record a good many cases of poisoning due to poisonous 
plants which often make up a considerable bulk of the hay 
fed during the winter. It has been known for some time 
that hay fed from certain meadows in the Missouri River 
region of the state, always causes trouble among horses. 
Some of the farmers have lost all their horses during a 
single winter. Because of the fact that the trouble seemed 
to be confined to the Missouri bottom it was called the 
"bottom disease, " but it has been shown that, wherever 
farmers, living on the prairie, fed this bottom hay, the same 
fatal results followed. In the sand-hill and foot-hill regions 
of the state some trouble from feeding hay has been reported, 
but this has been due to entirely different poisonous plants. 

In the discussion of poisonous plants there are still other 
facts to be observed. It is found to be true that certain 
parts of a plant may be poisonous while other parts may be 
comparatively free from any poisonous principle. Experiments 
have shown that the Lupines which grow in considerable 
abundance in the western part of the state, and 
are often put up for hay, make very erood fodder when cut before 
the seeds are ripened. If animals, especially sheep, 
are allowed to graze on mature Lupines or eat Lupine hay 
which contains the ripened seeds, severe poisoning is quite 
sure to result. The quantity of poison in a plant may not be 
the same at one stage of its growth that it is at another. 
For instance, the Larkspurs are known to be harmless until 
they begin to blossom. Then they are looked upon as extremely 
poisonous. The passion-flower vine (Paasiflora 
inearnata) which is extensively used in medicine, is collected 
when it is beginning to flower in order to get a drug of 
maximum and uniform strength. If the plant is collected 
after this time it is found to contain little or none of the 
principle which makes it valuable as a drug. 

Again, some plants whose parts are normally non- </seg>



            <seg id="p017">
17 

poisonous, are found to be so when in a wilted condition. 
This is manifestly true of the wild black cherry (/'» 
'"), whole leaves when wilted contain prussic acid, 
one of the deadliest poisons known. Several cattle have 
also been poisoned by eating wilted oak leaves. Just what 
the poisonous princip'e in the oak leaves is, has not been 
d''t&gt;'rmined. 

DISTRIBUTION OP POISONOUS PLANTS. 

| 7 he distribution of poisonous plants, like other plants, 
ids upon two main factors, the make-up of the soil and 
uantity of rainfall. As we pass from the eastern part 
3 state to the western, the soil becomes more sandv and 
recipitation less, hence we would not expect to find the 
plants in the one locality that we do in the other. Of 
,e, we do find some poisonious plants that can adapt 
selves to almost anv locality in the state, but they are 
velv few in number. 

The poisonous plants found along the banks of streams 
and in low, wet ground are about the same for one part of 
the state that they are for another. For instance, we find 
water hemlock everywhere in the state along creeks, irrigation 
ditches and in low wet meadows. However, in the 
eastern part of the state, this poisonous plant will grow on 
much higher ground than it does in the western part of the 
state, because the rainfall is greater. 

Itivated fieHs also have their own peculiar flora, the 
land differing somewhat from the low or bottom land, 
her words, the hish cultivated fields throughout the 
hare pretty nearly the same weeds in them, and the 
ultivated fields also have the same weeds in common. 
5 is, however, a great deal of variation in cultivated 
, both in the number of different species of weeds and 
abundance. This, of course, depends upon cultii 
rather than locality. 

CLASSIFICATION BY SITUATION. 

The poisonous plants of the state may be grouped roughly 
by means of the localities in which they are found. 
Descriptions of the plants given in the following lists with 
illustrations, will be found in the annotated list beginning 
on page 28. </seg>

I. 

THE LOW CULTIVATED FIELDS. 

The low cultivated fields include both the corn fields and 
erain fields which border the rivers and small streams, and 
are known as bottom land. The following plants may be 
enumerated as occurring more or iess commonly in these 

fields •' 

THE HIGH CULTIVATED FIELDS 

Kj high cultivated fields include both corn fields and 
fields which consist for the most part of rolling land, 
table land situated above the bottoms. The poisonous 
i and other weeds commonly found in these fields are: 

1. Cocklebur (Xanthium cnnadeiuie)

As will be seen by the foregoing lists, the species of 
poisonous plants in the cultivated fields are very few in 
number as compared with the other weeds. In the low 
¦, only four known poisonous plants have been found. 
while in the higli fields only one has been listed. Again, 
there are but three supposed poisonous plants in the low 
fields, and five in the high fields. The Horse-nettle and 
Buffalo Bur might well have been left out of the list of 
supposed poisonous plants, because they are never eaten 
. nimals. They are heavily armed with spines and 
prickles which serve to keep them from being meddled 
with. The other weeds in these lists are given in order to 
show what may be found in fields besides the poisonous 
s. Only the common kinds have been given. 

Very often not more than one or two species of harmful 
plants are found in a single field, and where cultivation has 
been carried on in the proper way the number of individuals 
for any one species is very small and therefore unimportant 
so far as causing truuble is concerned. A single ftp 
the Rattlebox, has been found very plentifully in stubble 
ti-lds on the Missouri bottom, and trouble has been reported 
where horses were allowed to run in these fields. 

A very careful examination of a large number of fatal 
corn fields has shown that losses could not have been caused 
isonous plants. As a rule, nearly all the weeds found 
in the cornfields are in a dried or withered condition before 
the cattle are turned in, and are in no way inviting food. 
However, the Black Nightshade, the Spreading Ni^h'shade 
and the Wild Ground-cherry often remain green until late

¦i&gt; fall. Yet, we have no positive proof that these sus?d 
plants have poisoned animals that have been turned 
stalk fields. 

All the evidence we have Deen able to collect seems to inks 
that poisonous plants can have very little to do with 
the heavy losses of stock in cornstalks. In fact, fields 
which have been most fatal were found to be almost free 
from weeds of any kind and did not contain a single 
poisonous plant. The only conclusion is that the poisoning 
is due to some other causes — doubtless to the stalks them 
selves, and to Fuaarkum, a fungus found on the stalks. The 
work which has been done r&gt;n the cornstalks and / •'"&gt;&lt;¦¦ 
will not be discussed here, but is fully treated in another 
part of this bulletin.

PASTURES AND RANGES. 

Under this heading we shall consider both the smaller 
pastures of the eastern half of the state and the large ranges 
such as are common in the western part of the state. On 
account of the very wide difference between pastures 
situated in different parts of the state, they will be considered 
under the following heads:

I'li/hii Region, 

Is region includes that portion of the state lying imtely 
west of the Missouri River Region and reaching 
ard to the sand hills. Its boundaries are shown on the 
on page 29. This region, like the preceding, is 
rily a farming region, but pastures of varying sizes 
forage for a large number of cattle and horses. These 
e both the unbroken nrairie land pastures with their 
or wild grasses, and the pastures sown to cultiv 
&gt;s and other forage plants.

being so, are the ones most commonly found in the pastures 

of this region.

others have been reported as poisonous and should be

Pastures of Hi 

Sand Hill*. 

Bj referring to the map on page 29 the extent of this 
region will be seen. It contains a few of the poisonous 
plants given for the prairie region, but nearly all of the 
harmful and suspected plants are peculiar to the sand-hills. 
The plants are such as are able to withstand the effects of 
drouth to a remarkable degree, and seem to get along very 
well in a soil of almost pure sand. These dry land plants 
do not leave the sand hills and take possession of the low 
land lying along the streams. They seem to keep to the 
dry hills, leaving the creek and river bottoms much the 
same as those already described for the prairie region. 
However, in this dry region of the state, bottom land is not 
1 ally used foi pasture as it makes more valuable tillage 
and meadow land. 

The following list gives the poisonous and suspected 

plants for this region 

I Loco-weed

The Loco-weed and the Crazy-weed are found mainly in 
patches scattered over the hillsides throughout the whole 
region. These bright green patches are very conspicuous 
in early spring and are readily seen at a considerable distance. 
They are very abundant this year, and may cause 
considerable trouble during the comine winter. The 
Lupines, while not so abundant, are plentiful enough in the </seg>

abundant in waste fields throughout the entire region.

t shown on the map on page 29 the foot-hills reach from 
md-hills to the western boundary of the state They 
it stop here, nowpvor, but extend much farther west- 
Together witii some sand-hill plants which are quite 
lant, a few species peculiar to this region are very 
f ul. The poisonous and suspected plants are :

The first two plants in this list are the well known locoweeds, 
which have been given in the previous list of sandhill 
plants. The Lupines are more plentiful in this region 
than in the sand hills. The Larkspur, which is very 
plentiful in Kimball County, well deserves a place in this 
list. The last three plants are suspected of causing trouble 
and for this reason are placed here. 

IV. 

MEADOWS. 

Re meadows of the state are, for the most part, bottom 
which borders the rivers and smaller streams. Now 
hen grass is cut from very high land, but, in the strict 
i of the word, such land cannot be called meadow. 

The meadows are of two kinds, those which lie in the 
Missouri River Region and the eastern part of the prairie 
region, and those which lie in the regions west. For the 
sake of convenience we shall call the former the Eastern 
Meadows, the latter the Western Meadows. </seg>

            <seg id="p024">

The Eastern Meadows 

Ern meadows are confined principally to the 
ttom where the soil consists largely of gumbo 
Fhe sandy soil, as a rule, contains the more 
plants, while the wet gumbo is more often free 
The plants which have been found in very

Tin Western Meadows. 

The western meadows are for the most part free from 
poisonous plants. However, the heads of the wheat and 
rye grasses are often attacked by a parasite fungus called 
Ergot which may cause a great deal of trouble. This year 
Ergot is very plentiful all over the state, but especially so 
in the west where the wheat grasses are very abundant, and 
are cut for hay. Now and then considerable Water Hemlock 
is found in the lower meadows, but we know of no cases 
where trouble has been caused by feeding hay which contained 
it. The following list contains the plants commonly

However, there was a dense growth of Pigweed which had 
seemingly crowded out every other species. This weed is 
not considered poisonous, but enough is known of its bloating 
effect upon cattle to give it some attention. </seg>

ANNOTATED LIST OF POISONOUS PLANTS. 

Tbe following is a list of the stock-poisoning and suspected 
plants which have been commonly met with during 
the progress of our investigations. It is not a complete list 
of all the plants of the state which are known to be more or 
leas poisonous but includes only those plants which are 
known to be poisonous to stock or are strongly suspected of 
being so. 

MOST IMPORTANT POISONOUS SPECIES 

HORSETAIL. 

(Equi*ttum annat I.. &gt; 

This is a leafless, much branched plant, from six to twelve 
inches in height. It may be readily recognized by the fact 
that the stems are formed of joints which may be pulled 
apart very easily. The plant seems to grow best in sandy 
soil which is moist a portion of the season, or where the 
soil water comes to within a few feet of the surface. It has 
been found growing along roadsides and railroad tracks. 
but its occurence in serious amounts is apparently confined 
to low moist meadows which are more or less sandy. As 
before indicated, it is confined mostly to the Missouri 
bottom. A thorough examination of several meadows in 
retriao has shown that this plant often constitutes onesixth 
or more of the bulk of the hay. There is no doubt that 
lant causes a great deal of trouble, but to what extent 
is not known as many of the haystacks which were carefully 
examined contained the Rattle-box in considerable amount. 
Horses eating this hay suffered the combined effects of both 
poisonous plants. 

It was the intention of the Station to make a feed experiment 
in order to get the direct effect of each plant, but a 
delay on the part of those who promised to send to the 
Station some of the hay which had cau«ed them trouble, 
made this impossible. However, a careful study of the 
Horsetail has been mude at the Vermont Agricultural Experiment 
Station bv Dr. F. A. Rich and Prof. L. R. Jones, 
and we can do no better than to quote directly from them. </seg>



            <seg id="p027">

"The first evidence of the trouble is more or less unthriftiness, 
the horse appearing thin and the muscles wasted. In 
from two to five weeks, according to the age of the horse 
and the manner of feeding, the animal begins to lose control 
of its muscles, sways and staggers like a drunken man, 
although its eye looks bright, it eats well, and may even try 
to caper and play. - After muscular symptoms become pronounced 
many cases refuse to lie down, standing until 
thrown down by disorderly muscular contraction. If it 
continues to eat the plant the horse in any case soon 
power to stand and goes down, after which it becomes very 
nervous and struggles violently to get up. the legs become 
more or less rigid, and at times all the muscles of the body 
st.iii convulsed. Even in this condition one well r. 
patient tired two weeks. The horses are generally willing 
to eat. although unable to rise, but become sore and 
from struggling, finally dying from exhaustion. Lite is 
much prolonged by turning from side to side three or four 
timt-s in twenty-four hours, thus preventing gravit 
congestion of the lungs and kidneys. The pulse bee ¦¦ 
slow until toward the end when it is rapid and weak. 
Temperature is below normal until the animal goes down, 
after which some fever develops in consequence of the 
nervous excitement and violent struggling. The extremities 
are usually cold, and in the winter horses suffering from 
Equisetum poisoning suffer severely from the cold, pr»&gt; 
sumedly because of diminished oxidation and consequent 

low body temperature. The visible lining membranes of 
mouth, nose, eye, etc.. become pale. 

Conditions Influenting the F.fi'i-i-t oj th&lt; ftofeon. 

"Agt tf tin harm*. — Young animals develop svmptoms 
much more quickly and succumb to the Equisetum poisoning 
sooner than older ones. In one case under observation a 
mare eating Equisetum hay did not show symptoms until 
after four weeks, while her colt by her side developed typical 
symptoms of hursetail poisoning and died in ten days. Nine 
out of fourteen horses on one farm, all fed alike upon good 
hay, were bedded with swale hay containing large quantit </seg>


            <seg id="p028">

this weed. They ate this bedding freely and within three 
weeks all nine showed symptoms of poisoning, the remaining 
tive bedded with straw kept perfectly well. The 
youngest, a three -year-old, was down and died a few days 
later. The oldest, an old brood mare, showed but slight 
syintoms, while the other seven, of intermediate ages, all 
staggered and reeled, although they recovered. 

¦•1'rrii. — Grain-fed horses resist the action of the poison 
much longer than those not grained Horses seem to 
evelop a depraved appetite for the weed. In the last 
mentioned case, though all were fed good, clean timothy 
ay. they seemed to prefer the horsetail bedding, and even 
t'ft their grain to eat it. 

mdUion &lt;&gt;/ the plant. — We have no evidence that 
s grazing upon the green plant am poisoned thereby. 
It may be that the plant is less poisonous in the early stages 
of its growth than when mature, or the laxative effect of the 
-eaten with it may prevent the cumulative action of the 
poison. Moreover the plant rarely occurs in as large 
Quantities in pastures as in meadows and apparently rarely 
needs cause apprehension. If, however, it is abundant 
close watch should be kept upon horses pasturing where it 
occurs that the animals may be removed at the earliest 
symptoms of trouble. 

"Treatment 

"In the way of treatment, the first and most important thing 
is to stop immediately the feeding of the Equisetum hay. 
Our practice further than this has been to give a purgative 
pill consisting of one ounce of Barbadoes aloes, one or two 
drachms of ginger, and sufficient English crown soap — soft 
soap — to make a ball or pill. This is put down the horse's 
throat, at one dose, and following this we have usually given 
bran mashes night and morning until the digestive tract is 
entirely cleared of the poisonous plant. In case aloes cannot 
be easily obtained a quart of raw linseed oil will do very 
well. After the physic has operated, a teaspoonful of 
powdered nux vomica is added to each grain feed, three 
times a day. This tends to relieve the muscular incordination. 
When poison symptoms are severe and especially </seg>

and especially at flowering lime in the leaves. There is 
also a resinous substance, cttmhxime, which is even more 
poisonous than the emfnr. The root, before it has become 
bis also very poisonous. Even drinking the water of 
hy ground where the roots may be crushed by tramping 
e animals, may result in poisonins. 

Si only are animals poisoned by eating the plant, but 
cases are on record where persons have been poisoned 
mistaking the young plants for parsley, and using the 
leaves in soup. Children have also been poisoned 
eating the plant or its seeds. 

E soiling of hogs has been reported in the state through 
iting of the roots The animals were kept in a pasture 
ivcn little or no food and were forced to eat the roots 
irve. 

Experiments at the station show that animals do not like 
iste of the roots . and will not eat them unless forced 
to do so by giving no other food to eat. A hog and a sheep 
¦were used in the experiments, and both refused to eat the 
roots at rirst. The amount eaten at any one time did not 
¦ (1 twenty grams, and this did not have any effect whatever. 
However, had the roots been perfectly fresh, this 
quantity would have produced the symptoms of poisoning if 
not death. 

Symptom* 

Kttle, poisoned', lie as if lifeless, with slow feeble pulse, 
extremities and dilated pupils. Sheep become giddy, 
ss and sometimes die. The symptoms of poisoning in 
?ns are vomiting, colicky pains, staggering, unconisness, 
and convulsions ending in death. . 

Treatment. 

Erbivorous animals which have eaten a sufficient amount,

of melted lard. Linseed oil is also recommended,

in height, bearing simple leaves and solitary yellowish 
flowers. It bears pods one-half to one inch long, and onehalf 
inch or less in diameter. As these pods ripen they become 
stiff and blackish in color, and contain a number of 
flattish,kidnoy shaped, rich brown, smooth and shining seeds. 
These seeds become loose, and rattle about within the pod, 
hence the name Rattle box. The plant is very common in 
the eastern part of the state along the river bottoms, and 
thrives best in sandy soil. It is found to be dangerously 
plentiful in pastures and cutlivated fields, especially stubble </seg>

feared. It has been found so plentifully in some meadows 
that it actually constituted one-fourth of the bulk of the hay. 
This hay when fed always caused severe losses in horses. 
In fact many farmers have lost all their horses during a 
single year.^ 

Actual experiments, performed several years ago, have 
shown that it is an extremely poisonous weed. Dr. Bessey 
states that he witnessed an experiment which showed that 
posion is actually present in the plant A young horse was 
killed by being compelled to drink a quantity of water in 
which the green plants had been crushed. Dr. Stalker, of 
Iowa, has also shown that the mature pods are poisonous. 
It is probable that the mature pods cause most of the trouble 
when the plant is fed with the hay. Horses which are 
allowed to eat from racks or mangers which have a tendency 
to collect the pods, always succumb to the poison in a 
shorter time than those fed from racks of a different type. 

Symptoms. 

As a rule, the symptoms are much prolonged, death resulting 
only after several weeks or even months. The 
length of time varies of course with the quantity of the 
weed present in the feed. There is a general decline of 
vigor and a gradual loss of flesh, and the animal has a disposition 
to eat old rotten hay or straw. The animal finally 
loses power of locomotion, and lies down much of the time 
as the disease advances. Very often an animal becomes 
crazed making it dangerous for any one to approach it. 
Convulsions soon set in and the animal dies. 

Treatment. 

Treatment must be more in the nature of preventing the 
se from obtaining: a hold on animals, than in effecting a 
cure. If hay or pasturage is found to contain this weed, 
stock should be carefully watched, especially if feed begins 
to run short. Horses shuuld never be given Rattle-box hay. 
Animals that show the slightest symptoms should be placed 
where they will not have access to the plant, and should be 
supplied with nourishing, easily digestible food. </seg>

WOOLLY LOCO-WEED 

I.— Loco-weed [Attrmgaim wuUmkmm), one-third natura 

(From Chesnut. U. S. Department Agriculture 

This is a silvery- white perennial eight to twelve inches in 
height, with an abundance of soft foliage springing out in a 
cluster from a short central stem close to the ground. It 
has compound leaves composed of from nineteen to twentyseven 
oval, obtuse, silky-hairy leaflets, and a spike of purple 
pea-snaped flowers. The pod is distinctly two-celled. It 
grows both on the open prairie and rocky hillsides, and is 
found in the sand-hill and foot-hill regions of the state. It 
Otx:urs in clumps or patches which may be seen at a considerable 
distance. It is possible that the conspicuousness 
of these Hatches attracts animals to them. 

The loco-weed appears in the early spring when other 
vegetation is scarce, and remains gree'n and inviting to 

(Attmgmhu mollisttimut '/'&lt;&gt;rr.) </seg>


            <seg id="p035">

narily stock does Dot at first like the taste of the loco weed 
and eats it only when other food is scarce. However, when 
once the taste has been acquired, nothing else will be eaten, 
and the animal either dies from eating enough of the plant 
to drive it crazy, or from starvation, or possibly both of 
these causes. 

Symptom$. 

Horses, cattle and sheep are affected by loco, but the 
Drincipal damage is done to horses. The effect of loco is 
not acute, but in its slow progress may be likened to disease 
produced in man by continued and excessive use of morphine 
or cocaine. There seem to be two stages of the disease. 
The first stage which may last several months is a period of 
mania accompanied bv defective eyesight, during which the 
animal may perform antics of all sorts. Then comes the 
second stage in which the animal refuses every other kind 
of food. The animal becomes very poor in flesh, has sunken 
eyeballs, is rough-haired and is very feeble in its movements. 
The animal dies as if from starvation in periods ranging 
from a few months to one or two years. 

Treatment. 

In regard to treatment, there is little to be said. All 
medicines that have been tried seem to have been of doubtful 
effect. More can be done by keeping animals away from 
loco than in any other way. As long as there is a plentiful 
supply of grass, there is little to be feared, but when 
pastures and ranges run low, stock should be closely 
watched. At the very first appearance of trouble, affected 
animals should be removed to some place where they cannot 
gain access to loco. Good nourishing food should be given. 
If the disease has obtained a strong bold on the animal there 
is little hope of recovery under the best of treatment, hence 
the need of early treatment and prompt removal from the 
source of the trouble. </seg>

Crazv 


From Chesnut, U. S. Department Agriculture). 

This is a close relative of the Woolly Loco Weed, and is 
often mistaken for it. It differs from it, however.in being more 
erect and less branching, the leaflets are narrower, sharppointed 
and less hairy, and it has a one celled pod. The 
flowers are not so numerous on the spike, and are frequently 
much lighter colored, often being nearly white. It is found 
throughout the same regions that have been given for the 
Woolly loco weed. 

Symptoms mill Trent matt. 

So far as has been observed, its poisonous action is Quite 
similar to that of the loco weed, if not identical with it

            <seg id="p037">

Icmen throughout the ranee country consider it to be 
lly prejudicial to the stock-raising interests. The same 
should be exercised in keeping stock away from this 
as in the case of the loco weed. 

LUPINES. 

There are three species of Lupines in the western part of 
the sand-hill region and throughout the foot-hills, which are 
worthy of attention. So far as can be learned, cattle and 
horses either do not eat them or are not harmed by them, 
but sheeu-meu say that they are extremely poisonous to 
sheep when eaten after the pods have formed and have 
b*&gt;tcun to ripen. Many sheep owners are very careful to 
avoid patches of Lupine in driving their sheep from one 
range to another, and never trust the flock to a green herder 
who is unacquainted with the range. 

The three species common to the regions mentioned 
are the Nebraska lupine (Lii/iimi* plmttemtia S. Wats.), 
the silvery lupine (Lmpimmt " rijfntfiis Pursh. ), and the 
low lupine (Liipiimi pusiiiHx Pursh.) The first is a 
more or less finely hairy plant with seven to ten 
narrowly oval leaflets borne at the ends of the leaf-stalks 
and a four to eight inch raceme of pretty blue flowers. The 
second is a rather shrubby, bushy-branched plant.one to two 
feet high, densely silky hairy, with leaflets narrowed at the 
base. The flower-stalk bears a dense cluster of purple 
flowers, the pods are about one inch long, silky-hairy, and 
contains three to five seeds. The last is a small hairy plant 
four to eight inches high, much branched near the root, 
bearing commonly five leaflets at the end of the leaf-stalk. 
The densely clustered blue flowers are borne on a stalk four 
to eight inches long. The pod is finely-hairy and is threefourths 
to one inch long. 

Ese plants belong to the pea family but are easily dis 
shed from the luco weeds and other common wild 
s of this family by the character of the leaf. The 
are compound, and the several parts are all attached 
end of the leaf stalk, radiating from this point in 
mt directions.

K account of the limited amount of tirnu at our disposal, 
plants could nut be studied, as we had wished. We 
low, however, that they are poisonous to sheep and 
no small amount of trouble on some ranges. 

8 far as can be learned, these plants are very rapid in 
action. When sheep eat a quantity of the pods, they 
ly die within a very short space of time, often in a half 
¦ee quarters of an hour. The animal becomes more or 
razed and seems to have fits or spasms. When the 
il has eaten a less amount, the symptoms are not so 
&gt;unced. 

Treatment. 

¦far no remedy has been found but Chestnut and Wilcox 
sir bulletin on the Stock Poisoning plants of Montana, 
imend potassium permanganate and aluminium sulphate. 

There is every reason to believe that the Nebraska sp 
of Lupine are as poisonous to sheep as those which have 
caused such enormous losses in Montana. One reason why 
less is known of the poisonous character of our species is 
because sheep raising is not carried on to such a large extent 
as it is in Montana and other western states. 

NELSON'S LARKSPUR. 

Delphinium nelmmi Greene. 

This is a very finely hairy plant with a slender simple 
stem eight to sixteen inches high, rising from a cluster of 
tuberous roots near the surface of the ground. The leaves 
are firm and much cut or divided: the flowers are blue, 
slightly hairy and are placed at the end of the slender stalk. 
In the months of May and June the hills in the western part 
of the state may be seen dotted with patches of pretty blue 
flowers which are rather attractive. The plant is very 
abundant in Kimball County, and reports received from this 
locality indicate severe losses of cattle and sheep due to it. 
As a rule animals do not relish this plant, but it is one of the 
first plants to appear in early spring and is often eaten. 

In Montana several species of Larkspur have been ex-

has not been shown that they are poisonous to horses, 
of the poisoning on record has occurred in the spring

nud by eating the ripe seeds in the fall. 

Ei much is known of the symptoms which our Larkspur 
ices, but from what can be learned, it seems to produce 
. of stiffness making it very difficult for the animal to 
about. Animals usually die with fits or convulsions. 

Treatment. 

Experiments on cattle and sheep, which have been carried 
on in Montana, show that potassium permanganate is 
effective when given in the early stages of poisoning. This 
may also be effective with our species.

Chesnut. D. S. Department Agriculture. 

"^The Dwarf Larkspur is a smooth simple-stemmed, plant 
six to twelve^inches high, with a tuberous root, deeply fiveparted 
leaves and a long loose cluster of blue flowers which 
appear in April and May. It is found very sparingly in the 
eastern part of the state, principally in the timbered portion. 
On account of its rarpness in trie state, little need be feared 
from it. However, it is extremely poisonous to stock, and 
considerable loss has been reported from Ohio. It is fatal 
to cattle in very early spring when the fresh leaves appear.

C!orh Cockle is a plant which has come to us from the Old

in the eastern part of the state. A number of specimens 
have also been found along road sides and railroad tracks. 
It grows from one foot to three, in height, has narrow leaves 
which stand two opposite one another at each joint of the 
stem, and pretty pink flowers three-fourths of an inch or 
more in diameter. 

The danger in this plant resides principally in the seeds 
which contain a poisonous principle called saponin. When </seg>

the weed is plentiful in grain fields, tbese seeds are threshed 
out with the grain. Great care should be used in keeping 
it out of wheat fields, as it may enter into flour in sufficient 
quantities to produce serious poisoning. 

•ording to Chestnut, the symptoms of acute poisoning 
are: Intense irritation of the digestive tract, vomiting, 
headache, nausea, vertigo, diarrhoea, hot skin, sharp pains 
in the spine, difficult locomotion and depressed breathing. 
Stupor sometimes sets in, and it may be followed by death. 
Experiments upon animals show chronic diarrhoea and 
gradual depression, the animal losing vigor in breathing 
and in muscular movements until death ensues. 

Oils, melted lard or butter may be used, and should be 
Kivn as quickly as possible. A veterinarian should be sent 

BOUNCING BET 

Saponaria ofldnalis L. 

This plant is a close relative of the Corn Cockle, and is 
commonly grown in gardens as an ornamental plant. It 
grows from one to two feet high, has oval-shaped leaves 
which are three-ribbed, and a dense cluster of pretty pink 
flowers at the top of the stem. In the eastern portion of the 
state this plant has escaped from the gardens, and patches 
have been found here and there in the fields. The plant is 
not generally plentiful enough to cause any trouble but it 
should be kept down. 

The poisonous principle which this plant contains is 
saponin, — the same poison which makes the Corn Cockle so 
dangerous. 

ERGOT 

Ergot is a parasitic fungus which attacks the heads of rye, 
wild rye-grass, wild wheat-erass, and many other species of 
grasses. It is known to attack at least thirtyfive species of 
the grass family. In this state it is found in great abund-

ance wherever the wild rye and wheat grasses abound, and 
it may be said that this is practically all over the state. On 
examining the heads of infected grasses, black spurs one 
half to an inch and a half long and one eighth of an inch in 
thickness many be seen sticking out from the place where 
the kernel should be. These are the Ergot spurs which are 
so commonly supposed to be enlarged grains. 

I many parts of the state the wild wheat-grasses consti;he 
larger portion of the summer forage and are exteny 
cut for hay. In fact, some of the meadows examined 
composed almost entirely of these grasses. This year 
rasses have grown luxuriently and have produced an 
dance of heads. The fungus seems to have kept pace 
the grasses, and many meadows were so badly infected 
they presented a blackened appearance even at some 

Ergot contains three poisonous agents : (1) An alkaloid 
which produces abortion, (2) A non-nitrogenous, resinous 
substance which gives rise to gangrene, and which in large 
doses produces cramps similar to strychnine, (3) Ergotic acid 
which is more a narcotic diminishes reflex action and finally 

The disease caused by ergot is called Ergotism. The 
symptoms vary considerably according to the conditions 
surrounding the affected stock. As stock usually gets ergot 
in hay only a small amount is eaten at one time, and the 
immediate effect is very slight, bat as more ergot is eaten 
the disease becomes worse and often gets a firm hold on the 
animal before any marked symtpoms become apparent. 
Animals become gaunt, thin in flesh and rough haired, bat 
still continue to eat fairly well. They usually become lame 
and appear to have lost all their energy. Very frequently 
there is more or less derangement of the digestive apparatus 
'and there is a loss of appetite. If the disease is 
allowed to proceed, the feet become cold and lifeless. Dry 
gangrene sets in and the flesh sloughs off, often taking the 
entire foot with it. It is not uncommon for the tail and ears 
to be affected in the same way. Very often the horns also 
drop off. The mo'Uh and tongue are often affected and </seg>

            <seg id="p044">
44 


when this occurs with the diseased feet, ergotism is often 
iken for the "Foot and mouth disease.'" In talking 
this matter over with a number of stockmen, it has been 
found that there is more or less trouble of this kind in 
different parts of the state. Many who have studied the 
disease are inclined to believe that prgot has caused the 
trouble rather than the 'Foot and mouth disease." The 
difference between the true "Foot and mouth disease" and 
ergotism is not always apparent, the former, however, is 
known to be contagious while the latter is not. ' 

One of the well-known effects of overdoses of ergot is the 
production of abortion. In several parts of the state 
numerous cases of abortion have occurred among cattle, the 
losses often being so heavy as to make the herd unprofitable. 
Some stockmen say that very often they lose fiftv p"r cent 
of the calves in this way alone. It is true that contagious 
abortion has much to do with' some of the losses that have 
been reported, but it is certain that much of the trouble is 
traceable to the feeding of hay which had considerable 
ergot in it. 

I'n mil ion inul Treatment. 

Hay that is badly affected with ergot should not be fed to 
stock at all or, if that is necessary, only in small quantities 
and in company with some easily digestible, nourishing and 
ng food. It has been observed that where stock was 
fed corn with ergotized hay, little or no trouble was experienced. 
This is the reason horses are less often attacked as 
receive more or less grain. However, sume cases of 
severe poisoning have been recorded for horses. Ergot is 
formed on the grasses in late summer or in the fall, so that 
cutting the meadows early will avoid it. It is always a good 
plan to cut the wild rye and wheat-grasses early because 
ergot is avoided and the hay is also better than if cut too 

Ijrgotized hay must be fed, see that the cattle have good 
er and plenty of water. In case the disease app^ 
containing ergot should not be fed, but should be 
ituted by good stimulating food. A dose oi e]

they are practically the same. The symptoms as given for 
sheep areas follows: The first signs of poisoning area 
certain uneasiness and irregularity in the movements of the

pronounced accompanied by incoordination of the muscular 
movements, spasms and rapid breathing. Finally there is 
a complete motor paralysis combined with an exceedingly 
rapid and shallow breathing and a frequent weak pulse.

WILD BLACK CHERRY. 

Strange as it may seem, the leaves of this tree develop'in 
themselves one of the deadliest poisons, and it is an undisputed 
fact that animals have died as a result of eating them. 
Chesnut gives the following in regard to it: "Poisoning 
is frequently caused by cattle eating the wilted leaves from 
branches thrown carelessly within their reach, or ignorantly 
offered as food. Children occasionally die from eating the 
kernels of the seeds or by swallowing the fruit whole. The 
poison is formed in the leaves of detached branches by the 
chemical action of two non-poisonous substances which are 
present in the plant. Under certain conditions these ova-

            <seg id="p049">

pounds liberate prussic acid, one of the most deadly poisons. 
The fresh leaves are generally considered harmless. As 
they begin to wither, however, the acid is formed but as this 
is volatile it disappears from the foliage in a short time. 
These facts thus serve to explain how it is that only the 
partially wilted leaves are considered poisonous." Besides 
the Wild Black Cherry, we have the Choke Cherry (Prunus 
i(ni&lt;i), and the Dwarf Wild Cherry (Primus ilemism) 
which doubtless will be found to have the same poisonous 
properties. Chesnut says: "The seeds of all varieties of 
cherries and plums, both native and introduced, are subject 
to suspicion : the flesh of none of the species is in any way 
poisonous." 

Symptonu. 

El symptoms are those of true prussic acid poisoning. 
i animal has eaten a sufficient quantity, he begins to 
ontrol of himself and soon drops to the ground. Commuscular 
paralysis sets in and the eyes bulge out of 
sockets. The animal dies in terrible agony in from 
y-tive minutes to an hour after eating the leaves. 

OAK. 

The first authentic report of cattle losses in this state due 
to eating oak leaves was given by Mr. A. H. Denman, of 
Spur, Nebr. This gentleman said that he trimmed a 
number of oak trees, which are growing in his pasture, and 
left the leafy branches where the cattle could have free 
access to them. The next morning be found two animals 
dead, but did not suspect what was at the bottom of the 
trouble. He continued trimming his trees with the result 
that three more were found dead the following day. When 
he had lost his tenth animal, he called in a neighbor and 
post-mortem examinations were made on several. It was 
found that the stomachs were full of oak leaves and that the 
intestines were burned in places, or had that appearance. 
The cattle had plenty of water and there was no evidence 
that they had died from impaction of the stomach. Mr. 
Denman at once removed from the pasture all the branches 
which he had cut from the trees, and lost no more cattle.

ROUGH PIGWEED. 

Ani'iroitlnis retrojtertu L. 

This weed which is often called Hoi- root, though wrongly 
so, is a common fleshy annual in erardens, wastes and cultivated 
fields. It is extremely variable in height, being sometimes 
less than a foot tall, more often three feet in rich soil. 
The leaves are more or less ovate, and are pointed at the 
top. The small green flowers are densely packed in an 
elongated mass, and when ripe become very prickly. When 
young the plant is very soft and sappy, but after the seeds 
ripen it becomes very coarse, so much so that animals hesitate 
to walk through a dense patch. 

This weed is not poisonous, at least it is not supposed to 
be. but it has doubtless caused a good deal of trouble in 
some parts of the state. In Lincoln County a careful study 
of fields in which losses had occurred was made, and a feed 
experiment carried out. 

Mr. C. C. Palmer, living four miles south of North Platte, 
lost five head of cattle in his pasture. The cattle were dead 
when he found them, and all were very much bloated. 
Some of the animals were opened, and the stomachs wer« 
found to be full of the Pigweed. 

The part of the pasture in which tbe animals were found 
dead was a waste field which was densely overgrown with 
the Pigweed. There were also a few patches of Russian 
Thistle and Lamb's Quarters. Tbe animals had been accustomed 
to prairie grass pasture but the fence separating 
the two fields was broken down and they began eating the 
Pigweed which was very succulent. After the five animals 
died the fence was replaced and no further losses occurred. 
Mr. Palmer said that on several occasions his milch cows 
came home very badly bloated from eating the weed, and 
be came very nearly losing one of them. As the cows were 
the only ones of the herd to come to the barns, the percentage 
of the herd affected by the Pigweed is not known. 
There was plenty of water at all times, and salt was placed 
where animals could have free access to it. </seg>

About two weeks after the cattle were lost, a feed experiment 
was made at Mr. Palmer's place. A healthy threeyear-old 
heifer was selected from this gentleman's herd and 
placed in a barn. She was fed the fresh weed both in a wet 
and dry condition, and given all the water she wished to 
drink. The weed was eaten in considerable quantity and 
with apparent relish, but no signs of bloating were noticed. 
The experiment was kept up a reasonable length of time in 
order to see if continued eating might not have some effect, 
but no changes in the animal's deportment were noticed. 

Although the result of the experiment was negative, the 
reason why it was so is quite apparent when conditions are 
known. The experiment was made some time after the 
animals were lost, and on account of dry weather setting in, 
the plants had lost their succulency and had more 
or less dry and harsh. In fact most of the plants fed had 
their seeds nearly ripened. 

Many of the stockmen in this vicinity have been asked 
their opinion in regard to this weed, and they all pronounce 
it a bad 'bloater. ' Mr. Streitz, a prominent druggist in 
North Platte and the owner of a well-stocked farm, says 
that Pigweed has the same bloating effect on animals as 
green clover and alfalfa. </seg>

SPREADING NIGHTSHADE. 

Solatium tritium in Nutt. 

This plant is much like the Black Nightshade, but is more 
spreading and weak stemmed. Its leaves are very much 
lobed, and the flowers are white or pinkish. The berries 
are larger than those of the Black Nightshade, and are 
somewhat flattened. It is found growing in wastes, and 
sparingly in fields. 

Many people make a habit of eating the berries in pies 
without any serious consequences resulting. However, the 
eating of the berries should be discouraged as poisoning is 
liable to occur. The poisonous principle is 'solanine' 
which is found in varying quantities in all parts of the plant. 
This plant has the name of being poisonous to stock and has 
been so reported. Chesnut reports that complaints of the 
poisoning of cattle have been sent in to the Department from 
Nebraska. 

There are two other species of Nightshade common in 
cultivated and waste fields throughout the state. They are 
the Horse Nettle (SoUiinini oanUnente) and the Buffalo Bur 
urn ritstrntiiiii). Although these species may contain 
the same poisonous principle there is little danger that 
cattle will touch them. They are so well armed with sharp 
prickles that animals, no matter how hungry they may be, 
are kept from eating them. </seg>

This plant has a fairly wide distribution, but is most common 
throughout the eastern half of the state. It is commonly 
found in low moist" meadows and pastures. The 
stem is angular, having narrow wings running down the 
side from the bases of the leaves which are lance-shaped. 
The flowers which appear in autumn are yellow and rather 
showy. The whole plant, especially the flower, is bitter to 
the taste. The powdered plant when inhaled produces 
violent sneezing, and is used for this purpose in medicine. 
The poison is found orincipally in the flowers, but young 
plants are known -to be more or less poisonous. The 
amount of poison in the full grown plant is very variable. </seg>

fatal cases, animals have spasms and convulsions. 

TALL CONE-FLOWER. 

Rudbeckia laciniata L. 

This plant, which resembles the sunflower somewhat,

those of the lower part of the stem into three to five parts, 
and the uppermost are three-parted. The heads are from 
two to three inches across, with yellow rays and a dull 
yellow centre or disc. The plant is very common in the 
wooded region of the state and is also found in considerable 
abundance along the banks of streams. A number of pastures 
containing a considerable amount of this weed, were 
examined. No reports of cattle losses have been received, 
and it is probable that cattle are not poisoned by it. However, 
sheep and hogs have been poisoned by it. No

poisonous, and bears white flowers which are followed by 
dark purple juicy berries a half inch or so in diameter. 
The plant is but sparingly found in the southeastern part of 
the state. The entire plant is poisonous, and the custom of 
using the fresh shoots as a substitute for asparagus cannot 
be commended. Fatal poisoning has occurred where the 
fleshy roots have been eaten. In the eastern part of the

THE CORNSTALK DISEASE. 

Department of Animal Pathology, University of 
Nebraska. 

During the last two years we have heard of a number of 
outbreaks of cornstalk disease in Nebraska, Kansas, 
Missouri, Iowa and parts of Illinois. Reports of cattle 
dying in cornstalk fields were received as early as October, 
1900. During the winter of 1900-01 the outbreaks were more 
serious and also more numerous than during the following 
year. During 1902-03 the disease has greatly decreased and 
has not been prevalent throughout the eastern counties; 
the outbreaks reported were in the western counties. 

The cause of cattle dying in cornstalks seems to be a very 
mysterious one. The many theories that have been 
advanced by practical stockmen and farmers, through the 
medium of the agricultural press and at the various 
Farmers' Institutes, do not seem to explain nor thoroughly 
settle the cause of the trouble. 

The theories advanced regarding this disease, when carefully 
investigated, were found to be lacking in absolute 
proof. It is strange to say that cattle have died under all 
sorts of conditions. The cause most generally assigned 
was impaction: that animals gorge themselves with indigestible 
cornstalks. This theory cannot be regarded as 
correct when it is carefully investigated, for it is not uncommon 
for owners who have used great precaution, only 
allowing their animals to be in the stalk fields from a few 
minutes to a few hours at first and then gradually increasing 
the length of time, to report losses. Another strange 
feature is that in a field where cattle had died, there would 
not be a single loss when cattle were turned into the field 
again after it had been abandoned for a short time. It is 
not uncommon in large herds for only one or two animals 
to die in a single stalk field. This shows that the cause 
could not be indigestion. This theory is further discredited 
by the fact that losses have occurred when animals, after 
receiving plenty of grain and water, have been turned into 
the stalk fields for short periods. 

Chemists will tell us that the cornstalks cut and shocked </seg>


            <seg id="p064">

as when fed in the stalk fields and yet no authentic cases 
have been reported where cattle died from eating cut stalks 
in the corral. Now if death were due to impaction it would 
be reasonable for us to suppose that we should find the same 
indigestion taking place in the corrals as in the fields. In a 
great many cases post-mortem examinations of animals 
found dead in the field did not reveal any abnormality that 
would justify one in saying that the animals had died from 
impaction. No doubt the impaction theory has been largely 
supported by the fact that the third stomach was found in a 
hard'and dry condition, which was supposed to be the true 
cause of death : but the third stomach is naturally in a more 
M dry condition. If an animal suspends chewing the 
cud for some time, it sometimes occurs that the membrane 
of the stomach comes away, but this is not the cause of 
death. The short-of-salt-and-water theory is advanced by a 
great many, but records of this department show that in the 
majority of cases the cattle were fed an abundance of salt 
and had plenty of water, so that it is extremely improbable 
that the animals died from want of either. In numerous 
cases preventive measures were used, such as feeding 
various kinds of condition powders Contrary to the belief 
that salt should be fed as a preventive, it is sometimes regarded 
as a cause of the disease. Deaths have been reported 
in herds where the animals were fed neither salt nor 
sulphur as a preventive. In 91 per cent of the lostported 
to us in the stalk fields that were investigated, the 
cattle had plenty of water both morning and evening. 32 
per cent of these cases had running water in the fields, 
showing conclusively that it could not be due to a lack of 

Out of 437 reports, 94 reported losses from allowing their 
animals in the fields only a short time, starting them in gradually 
from a few minutes to a few hours; 77 reported losses, 
who were not particular as to the time, turning them in at will ; 
137 reported no loss by turning them in gradually; and li'lt 
no loss by turning them in at will. 87 reported losses on 
high land and 75 on low land. No losses were reported 
from 172 on high land and from 100 on low land. Reports </seg>

from 30 show a loss where the corn and stalks were good 
and 108 reported the corn worm-eaten. No losses were reported 
in 33 instances where the corn was good, and no 
losses in 198 instances where the corn was worm-eaten, full 
of chinch bugs and smut. These reports will show that 
animals have died in fields under various conditions. 

CORN SMUT. 

Ki smut theory is one of the oldest, and conclusive exents 
have been conducted with the same, which are as 
¦s: 

Professor Gamgee, in his report on the subject, ' records 
an experiment with smut as ' follows : ' 'One cow was fed 
thrice daily one and one-half pounds of cornmeal and three 
ounces of smut, mixed with as much cut hay as she would 
eat. The second had the same allowance, but wet. The 
amount of smut given in each case was increased to six 
ounces. The cow fed on dry food lost flesh. Eight days 
later the dose of smut was increased to twelve ounces three 
times a day. The cow on the wet food gained in condition, 
the other one lost. In three weeks the two cows consumed 
the forty-two pounds of smut. They had a voracious 
appetite the whole time, and the only indication of a peculiar 
diet was a very black color of the excrement and the loss of 
flesh by one animal, although liberally fed on nutritious 
diet, which, however, was given in a dry state. * » • It is 
evident that smut is not a very active poison in combination 
with wholesome tood, and especially if the animal is allowed 
moist food and plenty "of water to drink. " 

An investigation of similar nature was made at the Illinois 
Experiment Station." "To ascertain whether the smut was 
responsible for the disease, about sixty pounds of it were 
collected and fed to a grade Jersey steer, with grain and 
hay, as follows : 

Bom December 13, 1889, to January 2, 1890, 120 pounds 
in, 105 pounds of hay, 20 pounds of smut, and 371 
s of water were given. From January 2 to January

24, 1890, 176 pounds of grain, 135 pounds of hay, and 39 
pounds of smut were fed and 366 pounds of water given. 
When the experiment was begun, December 13,1889, the steer 
weighed 560 pounds. January 2, 1890, he weighed 551 
pounds, and January 24, 555 pounds. No evidence of disease 
was discovered." 

Dr. F. L. Kilborne records' two experiments to test the 
effects of corn smut. In the first case the smut used came 
from a field in which several animals had died within dve 
days after they had been turned into it. Three two-year-old 
steers were fed exclusively on smut-laden stalks and free 
smut mixed with a small quantity of a mixture of cornmeal 
and wheat bran, for seven days without ill effects. This 
report states: "It is safe to say that these animals consumed 
a much greater quantity of smut than the animals which 
died in the fields." 

In the second case two heifers were fed, in addition to 
grain and hay, sixteen quarts of smut morning and evening 
for sixteen and one half days. The animals appeared to be 
perfectly well throughout the time of feeding and continued 
so for several months. 

E. N. S. Mayo records' the experience of a farmer near 
hattan, who gathered the smut from the field and 
id it in an enclosure. ' 'One night the cattle broke into 
enclosure where the smutty corn and smut had been 
wn out and ate all they wished ; no injurious effects were 
sed " 

Professor C. D. Smith has completed experiments along 
the same line," in which four cows were fed varying quantities 
of smut. Two of the animals were fed in as large 
doses as they could be induced to receive, the dose being increased 
'gradually until two pounds were fed to each for 
twenty-four days. This dose was then increased one pound 
per day fora week, when the experiment closed; each receiving 
eleven pounds on the last day. 

The other two began on two ounces a day each, and re-

ceived gradually increased doses until one pound a day was 
given for thirty-three days. 

Ethe cows were pregnant, but no signs of abortion 
red. The milk production was regular and constant, 
A not vary in yield. No injuries whatever were susby 
any of the animals from eating the smut. 

At a Farmers' Institute at David City a gentleman stated 
that he had often heard his neighbors say, and he had also 
read the same in agricultural papers, that cornstalk disease 
was caused by cattle eating smut. He had the opportunity 
to make the test for himself. He was compelled to clear 
the farm he rented of the smut. His son gathered the 
smutty stalks into a yard where two cows ate considerable 
of the smutty leaves. No bad results followed, as witnessed 
by the gentleman himself and the owner of the place. 

Mr. J. J. Jolliffe in the Drovers' Journal of February 7. 
1902, says : ' 'I have never had any bad results from smut. 
I have watched the stock eat ears that seemed 75 per cent 
smut, and they devoured them apparently with as much 
avidity as sound ears, never affecting the health or appetite 

!e have seen cattle die in fields where there was no smut 
tever on the stalks and also in some fields that had preisly 
been cleaned as good as one could clean them from 
smut; the cattle died in spite of this precaution. Often 
owner of the neighboring fields, in which large quans 
of smut were found, did not believe this theory and 
wed his cattle to run in the stalks promiscuously withsuffering 
any losses. 

Again, some people think that chinch bugs are the cause 
of this trouble. Losses occurred in a number of fields 
where chinch bugs could not be found; and again in a 
number of fields in which a large number of chinch bugs 
were found there were only a few losses. In the majority of 
fields in which cattle died, and which were examined by this 
department, no chinch bugs were found. 

GERM THEORY. 

The "germ theory" is that the disease is due to a bacterium. 
This was first advanced by Dr. F. S. Billings, </seg>

            <seg id="p068">
68 


Eerly of the Nebraska Experiment'Station. He believed 
the cattle died from the effects of eating cornstalks ind 
with a germ known as the "Burrill bacillus." 

In 1889, Professor Burrill described' a bacillus that attacks 
cornstalks in the following way:' "(1) The young corn is 
first affected in the roots, and (2) full-grown stalks after 
midsummer, when it manifests itself by certain discolored 
areas, more particularly on the leaf sheaths. Attacking the 
young plants, it dwarfs the stalks, destroying the crop, 
while in the mature plant it is widely distributed and does 
not appear to be of economic importance." 

•In January and March, 1888, and in February, 1889, Dr. 
Billings examined material from cattle that had died while 
feeding in cornstalk fields. He succeeded in isolating in 
each case a germ supposedly identical with that described 
by Professor Burrill as affecting cornstalks. Inoculations 
were made by Dr. Billings from cultures obtained from the 
above material, with the result of death in rabbits, guinea 
pigs, and mice. A rabbit fed with a pure culture died in 
four days, and pure cultures of the germ were obtained from 
each of the organs. A calf and a hog were inoculated with 
this material. The hog remained well, while the calf became 
exceedingly emaciated. From this same animal pure 
cultures were obtained. 

According to these reports Dr. Billings is justified in 
affirming that the animals died from a bacterial disease. 
The next step was to discover how the animals became infected. 
He accordingly obtained leaves from the cornstalks 
taken from the field in which the animals had died that was 
examined in February, 1889. By feeding these leaves to a 
raboit he produced a disease of which he obtained pure cultures 
of the germ, "the same as that found in the cattle, so 
far as we could judge from a microscopical examination." 

Dr. Billings' opinion is shown in a popular article. He 
states :* "It is now six years since I first discovered a germ 
in cattle sick and dying from being turned into stalk fields.

In many cases I have carefully examined the whole field, 
and in some of the worst outbreaks smut was conspicuous 
by its almost total absence. * * * Not only in every case 
personally examined, but in still more where blood and 
organs have been sent me. have I isolated one and the same 
germ, but have repeatedly produced the disease in cat He 
with inoculations of pure cultures. Some six weeks since I 
received some corn from a field in which cattle were dying 
in Indiana, and in this corn I found the same germ. I 
inoculated rabbits with some small fragments of the diseased 
corn and it killed them, and from them I made pure cultures 
and injected two cubic centimeters into the jugulars of two 
cattle with the result of killing one and making the other 
very sick, getting the same germ from both." 

It is held by Dr. Billings that this germ is identical with 
that described by Professor Burrill, but later investigators 
have demonstrated that cornstalks infected with the Burrill 
bacillus are wholesome food for cattle. For instance, Dr. 
Mayo made experiments to demonstrate what influence, if 
any, the diseased cornstalks had in the production of cornstalk 
disease. 'On July 13, 1891, he received from Professor 
Burrill a culture of the germ which produced the disease in 
the growing cornstalks. Cultures were made from these, 
and inoculations made in growing corn. When these were 
thoroughly ripened they were gathered and fed to a twoyear-old 
heifer. For eight days she was fed exclusively 
upon this inoculated corn fodder, which she ate readily. 
No deviation from the normal condition was observed. 
Beef- broth cultures were given in large doses to the same 
heifer without serious effects. 

Pfact that cattle can eat without ill effects cornstalks 
d with the Burrill disease was further shown by the 
ment of the Bureau of Animal Industry at Washing- 

*"A drought which extended over the greater part of the 
state of Illinois in August and September, 1893, dried up the

many instances cornstalks were the only food given. As all

of the corn was found to be affected with this disease, it was 
evident that no feeding experiment could be planned that 
would be more efficacious than those already being made. 
Several herds of cattle that were being fed exclusively on 
these stalks were carefully watched for a period of several 
weeks, but no evidence of disease appeared. The cornstalks 
fed were carefully examined and found to be thoroughly infected 
with the Burrill disease. It should be noted that the 
cattle ate these stalks much closer than they did dried ones 
in the field later in the fall, and consequently they ingested 
many more of the diseased areas. It is of interest to add 
that so far as it was possible to learn, the cornstalk disease 
did not appear among the cattle in 1893 in the districts 
visited in the fall and where the mature cornstalks were 
known to be badly affected with the Burrill disease." 

As mentioned above, these experiments show that the 
Burrill disease is not the cause of cornstalk disease. 
Furthermore, investigators, with the exception of Dr; 
Billings, have been unable to demonstrate the presence of 
any living organism as the cause of this disease. So I am 
of the opinion that the Burrill bacillus may not be identical 
with the bacillus discovered by Billings, and that the Billings 
bacillus may yet be shown to be the cause of the disease. 

Ei theory that the disease is dun to the weather has not 
confirmed, as our reports show that losses have 
red under all climatic conditions, so that the cause of 
isease cannot be attributed to the climatic conditions. 

!ie poison theory is one that will be more fully investid. 
The chemical department in its report shows what 
i has been done on the nitrate of potash (saltpeter) 
ry. Some years ago it was thought' that an excessive 
unt of saltpeter in the stalks was the cause of cattle 
g in the stalk fields. 

SALTPETER. 

Dr. Mayo reports cattle dying from eating corn fodder 
that contained potassium nitrate, or saltpeter. He describes' 
how an excess of saltpeter in cornstalks may be 
detected. If such a stalk be lighted it will burn and crackle 

¦Kans. Ezp. Station. Bull. 40, 1805, p. 5. </seg>

            <seg id="p071">

71 

like the fuse of a firecracker. In a certain instance he 
found that "beneath the leaf sheath which surrounds the 
stalk just above the joints, the nitrate had crystallized in 
fine, white crystals which resembled a white mould, but was 
easily recognized by tasting with the tongue. Around in 
the cut ends of the stalk were solid masses of almost pure 
potassium nitrate. If a stalk were cut in two and tapped 
lightly upon a table, the crystals of potassium nitrate would 
be jarred loose and fall as a fine powder upon the table." 

We have examined various cornfields where cornstalk 
disease prevailed, and in no case did we find potassium 
nitrate in sufficient quantities to warrant us in giving this 
as the cause of the disease. The theory that this is the 
cause of the disease has not been generally held since it is 
known that this is one of the chemical constituents of cornstalks. 
And besides, cattle can take with impunity a great 
amount of this as a medicine, more than is taken by eating 
the cornstalks, except in the rare case cited by Dr. Mayo, 
where the stalks had been grown under peculiar conditions 
near the barn, where excessive amounts of nitrates could be 
absorbed. 

CA. de Schweinitz, who has made chemical examinations 
ilks from fields in which cattle had died from cornstalk 
se, says in regard to the presence of potassium nitrate :' 

"Those that we examined contained only minute trace of 
the nitrate, so that if in any of the instances the cornstalks 
were the cause of disease in the cattle, and our sanmles 
were fair specimens, the poisoning was not by this salt" 

¦ese analyses by him further showed that toxic properwere 
not present in sufficient quantities to produce 
trous results. 

Since these investigations, the chemical department of the 
University of Nebraska has found prussic acid in large 
Quantities in sorghum and Kafir corn under certain conditions 
of growth. The symptoms of the cornstalk disease 
are largely the same as those of sorghum poisoning. In the 
latter case death was attributed to indigestion and bloat 
when in reality the symptoms reported of this disease show 

•P. 88 of U. S. Report, referred to in footnote 1, p. 68. </seg>

            <seg id="p072">
72 


¦ it must be something else than indigestion; and 
the poison has been found in the sorghum and Kafir 
it is not unlikely that some mysterious poison exists in 
ornstalks. 

I should like to draw attention to the fact that some of 
the best scientists did not discover this poison in the sorghum 
and that samples of sorghum, received from fields in 
which cattle had died, did not prove fatal when fed to 
animals in the laboratory. The reason for this has been 
explained by the field experiments at the Nebraska Experiment 
Station. When sorghum that is deadly poison is cut 
and allowed to remain for 48 hours before being fed to cattle, 
there is practically little danger of killing any of them. 
This same thing may be true of cornstalks that have been 
shipoed in from various parts cf the state for feeding experiments 
: either the poison may have been shaken off or 
evaporated and for this reason no positive results were 
obtained. It is known that sorghum and Kafir corn are 
deadly poison only when arrested in their growth, and for 
this reason it may be that only certain parts of a field are 
poisonous. This is proven by the fact that frequently some 
cattle die in a field where they have been pastured for a 
time and perhaps not another death will occur during the 
remaining season. From October, 1900, to the spring of 
1901 there were a great many outbreaks in this state as well 
as in parts of western Iowa and parts of Kansas. In 1901-02 
the disease was less marked, not nearly so many outbreaks 
in western Iowa and in our own state. In 1902-03 
the lines of demarcation were more definitely marked, 
hardly a [loss occurring in the eastern part of the state. 
Only in the western part in those counties where the corn 
was arrested in its growth did we hear of this disease, showing 
very plainly that the stalks are dangerous when they 
are in any way arrested in their growth. - This was also 
very clearly shown during the time from 1897 to October, 
1900. We had very few losses from this disease and yet 
during that time more cattle were fed on cornstalks and 
allowed to feed in the stalk fields than in any other period 
in the history of the state. All rules regarding salt and 
water and the length of time that cattle were to remain in </seg>

INVESTIGATION OP CORNSTALK DISEASE AT CRAB ORCHARD. 

I response to a telephone message of October 10, 1902, 
V. A. Hunter and myself left Lincoln on the morning 
8 11th. arriving in Crab Orchard at two o'clock in the 
ooon. 

Instead of going out to the farm of Mr. Oscar McDonald, 
who sent the telephone message, we were taken to an adjoining 
farm nearer town, owned by Mr.T. J. Biskup, who had 
three calves taken sick that day. When we arrived, one 
calf was dead and the other two down. We held a postmortem 
on the one that was dead, finding nothing abnormal. 
All of the organs of the body appeared to be in a normal 
condition. We took specimens of the blood from the heart 
and also some of the contents of the first stomach. We then 
killed one of the calves that was down and made a postmortem, 
finding the conditions the same as in No. 1 ; also 
took specimens of blood from the heart and some of the contents 
of the first stomach for analysis. In the morning, calf 
No. 3 was dead. We did not make a post-mortem but put 
in a couple of hours examining the cornfield. We found the 
shucks of the corn very moldy, and also considerable mold 
on the undeveloped ears: also found a good many plants of 
the nightshade family but none of the deadly nightshade. 
We brought back two sacks of these plants, shucks and undeveloped 
ears of corn. 

We then went over to a neighbor, Mr. A. J Russell, who 
has lost several calves this fall and who had lost one the day 
previous, fie had skinned his calf and saved some of the 
contents of the first stomach for us, which we brought back 
in order to wash out and determine the nature of the seeds 
contained in it. The fields in which his calves were running 
contained no cornstalks. The first field in which he had </seg>

            <seg id="p074">
74 


of which we found considerable of [the water hemlock. We 
brought back some of the roots of this and also a large 
quantity of the seeds. In the second field, where the calves 
had been feeding the day before, we found the deadly night 
shade, plants of which were partially eaten, and a considerable 
of other plants of the nightshade family, which we 
brought back. Th«se calves had been in this field for about 
two weeks before any losses occurred. 

We then went to the farm of Mr. McDonald, who had sent 
the telephone message the day before and who had lost one 
colt and one calf, the colt having died four or five days before 
and the calf the day before. This field was on very high 
land and absolutely free from weeds, and, having had a great 
number of stock in it, the stalks were all eaten off very 
closely. We found only two very small plants of the nightshade 
family, probably not over two or three inches in 
height. As the calf had been dead for about thirty-six 
hours, we did nut examine it. From a description of the 
symptoms of the colt lost, we should hardly think that it 
died of cornstalk disease. 

On October 14, a yearling heifer was put up in the Animal 
House and first fed the moldy shucks and undeveloped ears. 
Following this, the plants of the nightshade family were 
fed. None of the deadly nightshade or water hemlock was 
fed. No effect was noticed from this moldy feed. The 
animal was turned out on the 18th. 

INVESTIGATION OF CORNSTALK DISEASE IN HAYES COUNTY. 

¦ received a letter of Mr. Gull of Hayes Center stating 
Mr. Rice had lost three bead of cattle in stalks and 
isting that we make an investigation. 

I left here Sunday evening, November 17, reaching Palisade 
the next morning. While waiting for the stage to go 
to Hayes Center, I learned of Robert Counce that Mr. 
Schuman, who lives 17 miles northwest of Palisade, had lost 
three that morning. Mr. Counce agreed to take me out to 
Mr. Schuman 's and, this outbreak being fresh, I thought 
it best to investigate it. We arrived there at dark. We 
found that he had lost four more during the day, making 
seven in all. I went to Mr. Counce's place that night and </seg>


            <seg id="p075">
75 

next morning returned to Mr. Scbuman's. Here we found 
Mr. Geo. Kiddle, the President of the Farmers' Association 
of Hayes County, and also a number of neighboring stockmen. 
We appraised two head which we turned into the 
stalks. Mr. Schuman also turned in two at his own risk. 

The cattle that Mr. Schuman has. about fifty in number, 
had been fed all the cane they could eat and had all the salt 
and water they wanted. They were fed in the stalks one 
hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon, two 
days previously. We put up a yearling, which was fed all 
the purslane it would eat for two days. On November 21, 
we turned this animal out and put up another that had not 
been in , the stalks since November 18 and fed this animal 
all the worm-eaten nubbins it would eat for two days. 
Neither this animal nor the one fed on purslane showed bad 
results from this feeding. 

On Friday. November 22, Mr. Schuman turned in the 
whole herd again, saying he could not afford to feed up the 
cured cane. He fed them as the morning before, a good 
feed of cane, and let them stay in an hour in the forenoon 
and an hour in the afternoon. On Friday evening, I told 
him that my experiments with the two yearlings were closed 
and that if they died before Sunday noon we would pay for 
them, whether he kept them on the stalks or took them off; 
also that he could keep the whole herd on the stalks and if 
any died before Sunday noon we would pay for two of them. 
He kept the herd in the field Saturday and also Sunday. 
Sunday night he found an animal that was affected. He 
called in a neighbor that said he could cure it. It died 
three hours after it was found sick. Next morning he found 
two more animals [down, one of them being a yearling that 
we had first turned into the stalks. By ten o'clock there 
were two more down, which died later. At this time I concluded 
to go to Hayes Center and from there to Mr. Rice's 
place and look over his field. 

Kathered samples of stalks and worm -.eaten nubbins from 
schuman 's field and |also gathered samples of stalks 
Mr. Rice's field. Mr. Schuman's field, about 80 acres, 
absolutely clean except for cornstalks, purslane and a 
Russian thistles. Mr. Rice's field was also compara- </seg>

            <seg id="p076">
76 


tively clean. I also looked over some fields two miles from 
Mr. Schuman's place, where three head had been lost. 
These fields were on the upland and were fairly free from 
weeds. I took from the first stomach of each of the three 
animals that died on the Schuman place one quart of the 
contents and also portions of the mucous membrane of the 
first stomach and also of the intestines and brought the 
same to the Station for chemical analysis. 

On Tuesday, November 19, about one o'clock, one of 
the cows in the herd, which was at] this time on cane 
stubble and had not been on the stalks since Sunday afternoon, 
was seen to be affected. This was an old cow in 
rather thin flesh. The muscles of the hind legs twitched 
and the hind quarters staggered as the animal walked. 
The cow was driven to the bouse and put in the corral. 
The twitching in the hind legs continued until the animal 
went down. This was about five o'clock. There was an 
almost continuous flow of urine. The animal after going 
down was in a comatose condition and there was comparatively 
no twitching. She continued in this condition until 
death at nine o'clock. Of the other animals that died one 
cow, which died Monday morning the 25th, was in convulsions 
for about two hours, lying on her side and continually 
pawing and moaning. Another one was in a comatose 
condition from the time affected until death, which was 
within foui hours. In nearly all cases we could tell which 
animal was going to come down by the staggering gait and 
twitching of the muscles of the hind legs. These symptoms 
would last ordinarily two hours; the animal would then go 
down and remain in a comatose condition until death, which 
would occur in about four hours from the time when first 

¦i only thing abnormal noticed in the post-mortem was 
patches of the mucous membrane of the first stomach 
badly congested. 

SYMPTOMS. 

The symptoms are not very readily described, as it 
is difficult for a veterinarian to see a case of cornstalk 
disease while the animal is still alive. In the majority of 
cases the animal is dead before the veterinarian reaches the </seg>


            <seg id="p077">
77 

E'emisns. The symptoms described were gathered from 
jrsons who have seen a number of cases while the animals 
ere still alive and their observations are recorded. 

Eis usually confined to yearlings and two-year-olds; 
igh I know of farmers who have lost several milch 
within a few days. I have seen instances where the 
f animals would die in the fields and none of the older 
be affected." • 

The symptoms are as follows: The disease comes on suddenly, 
without any apparent warning. The sick animal is 
found apart from the rest, either lying down or standing. If 
standing the back is usually humped up. Frequently there is 
a switching of the tail and a peculiar twisting of the rump, 
indicating a straining in attempting to urinate. The animal 
often shows pain in the abdominal regions by kicking at the 
belly. The eyes have a peculiarly brilliant stare, as if the 
vision were impaired. In the first stages the animal moves 
very reluctantly if disturbed. The gait is staggering and 
uncertain, with lameness and frequent paralysis of the 
limbs. Some have a chill for an hour before death. If the 
brain is affected, the animal starts wildly at the approach of 
anyone, and becomes quite delirious, running about the field, 
sometimes running into a wire fence, which it is quite uncommon 
for cattle to do. Not infrequently the animal will 
attempt to attack the attendant. The respiration is much 
increased. The general course of the disease is from 
twenty-four to thirty-six hours. 

This disease has been taken for blackleg. Cattle that die 
with blackleg, have a characteristic swelling on the shoulder 
or external muscles, which swelling crackles when the hand 
is passed over it as though air were beneath the skin. In 
anthrax the animals die very suddenly, and on post-mortem 
examination the blood is not coagulated, and the spleen is 
very much enlarged and gravitates. Carbuncles may also 
be seen on the skin. Rabies is more likely to be mistaken 
for cornstalk disease, because we find similar symptoms, 
such as straining in attempts to urinate, delirium and 
paralysis. But rabies comes at a different time of the year, 
during the warm season, and is generally accompanied with 
a mad-dog scare. </seg>

POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION. 

"In twelve animals which died in cornstalk fields and were 
examined, post-mortem changes were more or less advanced 
in the greater number. A few were examined soon after 
death. The structural changes in the organs were slight. 
This explains the statement of many veterinarians that the 
organs of cattle dying with cornstalk disease are normal in 
appearance." 1 

As a rule we have found the organs normal but for 
slight hemorrhagic areas on the mucous membrane of the 
first and third stomachs. We also found the heart and the 
covering of the lungs (pleura) containing red spots, the 
liver enlarged, gall balder distended, spleen enlarged and 
pale, kidneys pale, the capsules being very easily removed, 
and the third stomach firmer than usual. 

"'When found in fields they were generally lying on the 
left side with the head turned back, with a greenish liquid 
running from the nose and mouth, with the legs moving 
spasmodically, dying generally within 10 to 20 hours, but 
some dying in much shorter time. 

"On being opened, the rumen is found, as a rule, looser 
than natural, the contents seem to be mostly husks, of 
which the ribs can yet be traced to the undigested base of 
the husk. The softer part of the husk separate from the 
ribs so that the ribs appear like a bunch of grass, several 
stems being fastened at the base. The mucous membrane 
of the stomach in most cases is normal as nearly as I can 
determine; the same is true with the second stomach. The 
third stomach is sometimes a little dryer th%n natural and 
the mucous membrane inflamed and easily detached, but in 
most cases it is about normal. The fourth stomach seems 
to be always normal. The intestines next to the stomach 
contain a thin dark substance and when a section, say 8 to 
10 inches long, is cut off and held pependicular the contents 
thereof run out easily, leaving the mucous surface almost 
clean, and on the surface of the mucous membrane and sometimes 
on the outside coat can be seen small red spots about 
the size of a pin head. These spots appear in sections, 

1 Moore's Pathology, p., 853. 

'Dr. A. Bostrom in a letter. </seg>


            <seg id="p079">

other parts being free from them. The next portion of the 
small intestines contains a thick yellowish-white, sticky substance, 
and when a section of this portion is cut off the 
contents will not run out but have to be squeezed out and seems 
to stick to the mucous membrane like glue. The red spots 
can also be seen on this part of the intestines. The liver is 
a little darker and somewhat softer than natural. All other 
organs seem to be natural." 

TREATMENT. 

It is difficult to suggest any line of treatment for the 
cornstalk disease that would be generally successful. 
The writer has tried a great number of methods, many of 
them recommended by farmers in the agricultural press, 
but he is not in a position to recommend any of them for the 
reason that he had as good success where no treatment at 
all was used. However, where animals are not too far gone, 
the writer has always administered salts, one pound as a 
dose, repeating in some instances within three hours. Of 
the many treatments given, this seems to be the most satisfactory. 
In the advanced stages where the animals do not 
swallow, it is not advisable to drench them. 

EFFECT OF MOLDY CORN ON HORSES. 

Numerous reports have been received from stock owners 
of a disease which they call cornstalk disease or spinal meningitis, 
which affects horses in the stalks and also some 
which have not been in the stalks. 

This disease is very rapid in its course. For this reason 
it is sometimes difficult to see animals aliye or in the beginning 
stages of the disease. In the later stages the 
animals are usually in such violent excitement that the 
symptoms have to be studied from a distance. One peculiar 
feature about the disease is that it comes on without warning, 
often attacking an animal while at work. One of the 
first symptoms noticed is the refusal of feed. Some have 
observed an excessive thirst and a difficulty in swallowing. 
The head is drooped in a very peculiar manner, denoting 
dullness. The eyes become very dull and later almost 
totally blind. This is usually followed by delirium and 
death. When a horse becomes affected in the stall it sometimes 
presses its head against the manger or wall and as </seg>

            <seg id="p080">

nil Experiment Station of Xebratka 

this symptom increases'in violence it is not uncommon to 
find the stall and manger demolished. Another peculiarity 
of the disease is that just before the animal becomes violent, 
one can cross its legs and the animal will remain in that 
position semiconscious for some time. 

E disease has been attri buted to many causes. It is 
ally conceded at this time that it is due to a fungus 
on the food administered. It is also known that 
i weeds commonly called horsetail have a faculty of 
producing a disease almost identical with this one. The 
experiments conducted by Dr. Rich of the Vermont Station 
show that that weed is capable of producing similar symptoms. 
Feeding experiments with moldy corn at our Station 
and other Stations, have proven that moldy corn is capable 
of producing this disease. In March, 1902, a quantity of moldy 
corn, which was taken from cribs of a farmer at Graf, Nebr. , 
who had lost a number of horses with this disease, was fed 
to four horses. These horses were fed exclusively on this 
corn with a small quantity of good hay and on April 2 two 
of the horses were found to be affected, the symptoms being 
the same as those in animals that died in various parts of 
the state. The black horse, John, was found in the afternoon 
of April 2 to be swaying in his gait. He refused feed, 
had the peculiar dullness of the eyes, and when his limbs 
were crossed he remained in that position entirely motionleas 
for some time. The next morning the animal was very 
much Worse and at noon he was killed so that an autopsy 
could be held. The post-mortem examination showed that 
all organs were practically normal except the brain which 
was much softer than normal. I will quote the description 
of the post-mortem of the brain as given by Dr. Butler, 
which is as follows: "On removal of the brain the superior 
surface of the right cerebral hemisphere was noticed to be 
slightly flattened over the anterior half. Palpation revealed 
a soft spot at this place. An incision through the apparently 
sound gray matter revealed what Mayo described as a 
'serous abscess' in which floated 'flocculi of broken down 
brain substance, which presented the appearance, as one 
stockman said, of a mixture of vinegar and curdled milk.' </seg>

            <seg id="p081">
Sij-t,enth Annual Report 

81 

This portion of softened and broken-down white brain substance 
is in no sense a serous abscess. The line of demarcation 
between the broken-down and the healthy brain substance 
was not clearly marked, but surrounding the completely 
broken-down portion was a zone probably half an 
inch thick that was softer than normal and of a slightly 
yellow color. The liquid in the cavity, and in which floated 
portions of soft and partially broken-down brain substance, 
was slightly yellow, but in no instance was clotted blood 
or any other macroscopic evidence of a hemorrhage to be 
found " 

Bi following are feeding experiments conducted with 
¦ corn by Dr. Butler, formerly of the Kansas Experi- 
Station. and also by Dr. Mayo some years prior : 

"Mr. A. of Wakefield, Kansas, during March, 1901. lost 
four registered Percheron horses which on post-mortem 
examination showed the characteristic well-marked breaking 
down of the brain substance, in some instances extremely 
large areas being involved. A careful examination found 
the sanitary condition of stable and surroundings first class. 
The water came from a hillside spring and was also good. 
The horses that suffered were not running in the stalk fields 
but received good clean, bright hay. It seems to me unfortunate 
that you 'and Mayo and others call this a cornstalk' 
disease. I have seen more cases where cornstalks 
were absolutely excluded from the ration than where they 
were being eaten. On the other hand I believe that cornstalks 
raay be the means of conveying the disease. The 
corn being fed in the case in point was bad, probably 10 per 
cent or more being wormy, moldy, rotten or damaged. The 
feeding of this corn which had been shelled and ground was 
stopped and no further trouble occurred. Right here permit 
me to state^that I have noticed that where shelled corn 
is fed the trouble is worse, owing, no doubt, to the fact that 
where ear corn is fed the bad ears are more likely to be 
thrown out. I had 400 pounds of the worst of this corn 
picked out and about 50 pounds of the chaff and screenings 
blown out at the back of the sheller also shipped to the 
College at Manhattan; Kansas, and fed as follows: </seg>

EPwo colts, 23 months old, were purchased on July 16, 
, and were placed in a small lot where they had shelter 
good hydrant water. The lot was the highest point 
nd and absolutely dry as all high ground was, in Kanduring 
the summer of 1901. On the night of July 16 
for 5 succeeding days they were fed 1$ kilos each, twice 
daily, of ear corn. On the evening of July 22 and for the 
three following days they were fed 1^ kilos of corn and cob 
meal twice daily. Beginning with the 26th of July these 
two colts were fed If kilos of the damaged corn, well ground, 
cob and all. This was continued until and including August 
19. During the feeding of this corn the 50 pounds of chaff 
from the sheller was given mixed with the corn and cob meal 
being fed in' the morning from August 3 to 13. All was 
eaten up clean after first two days. 

Bie of these colts died August 21 or two days after the 
etion of the feeding of damaged corn. During these 
lys they were fed good marketable corn. 

Eiring the first ten days of the experiment they were fed 
about 10 pounds each of good alfalfa hay of last year's 
After that they were fed about 12 pounds each of this 
\ crop of prairie hay." 

"On June 30. a large two-year-old colt was put up and fed 
upon moldy corn and good prairie hay. The colt was very 
thin in condition. He was given a good feed of moldy corn, 
picked out from the college crib. After feeding the corn 
three Jtimes daily for two weeks, no change was noticed, 
except a gain in flesh and general appearance ; so a change 
was instituted. The corn was thoroughly moistened, and 
kept in 'a moderately warm place until the mold began to 
form spores. I 'commenced feeding the fresh, moldy corn 
to the colt on July 16. His pulse and temperature were 
taken 'twice daily, morning and night. His temperature 
varied'from 101° to 102*° F., standing at 101f most of the 
time, with pulse at 48 beats per minute. On the evening of

with this disease. 

It is a known fact that our western ranchmen discovered 
that when corn is moldy.or, as they call it, "worm-eaten, "it is 
dangerous to feed it to horses. They have had many instances 
where horses died with this trouble, and when the feeding 
of this moldy corn was discontinued the losses stopped immediately. 
Some who did not believe that moldy corn was 
the cause of this disease and who continued to feed it 
suffered constant losses. If space would permit we could 
cite many instances where stockmen lost until they discontinued 
the use of the moldy corn. 

One other striking evidence found in our field observations 
was that moldy corn was always found on the premises 
where horses were lost. There were only two exceptions to 
this: in one instance we found moldy alfalfa and in the other 
a very bad and moldy straw stack. 

As a preventive of this disease we suggest that whenever 
corn is moldy or worm-eaten, it should not be fed to horses. 
Dr. Butler states that when the moldy corn was shelled it 
seemed to be more dangerous. Therefore it is well not to 
use corn in this condition at all. The writer has known instances 
where the corn was soaked and then fed without any 
bad 'results, but we have not sufficient evidence that this 
method would be a safe way of feeding the corn. It would be 
well to pick out the moldy corn and break off the affected tips. 
Dr. Mayo says that when the corn is shelled and soaked in 
water the moldy kernels will float and can then be taken off. 

The treatment recommended by many has on the whole 
been more or less unsatisfactory. The animal should first 
be made as comfortable as possible by placing it in a box 
stall where there is plenty of ventilation. Purgatives have 
been advised by many writers, aloes used, giving 
from 6 to 8 drams for a dose according to the size of the 
animal. Iodine has also been recommended in a one-dram 
dose. A great many stockmen have recommended bleeding by 
tapping the jugular vein, and some of the reports received 
show that they have good results with it. Some have </seg>

suggested giving hot water as a drench and some have 
suggested injecting large quantities of lukewarm water per 
rectum. We have not tried the last two methods mentioned 
but have seen them recommended in agricultural papers. 
In our own experience we have found nothing better than 
giving the animal a good comfortable box stall where he can 
be watched so that he will not bruise himself very much, 
and in early stages we give a purgative, using either from 6 
to 8 drams of aloes or a pound of Epsom salts. </seg>

CHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS.

Experiment Station. 

DO POISONOUS WEEDS CAUSE THE CORNSTALK DISEASE? 

The thorough botanical survey of the cornfields of the 
state is gi ven on pages 14-62 of this report. In view of the 
fact that noxious weeds may produce symptoms very similar 
to those of the so-called cornstalk disease it seemed well to 
test from a chemical point of view the ' 'poisonous weed 
theory" that has been advanced from time to time ever since 
the cornstalk disease has been made a subject of inquiry. 
The stomach contents of all the samples received were examined 
for alkaloids or other toxic substances of vegetable 
origin. For the most part no trace of vegetable poisons 
could be found. Out of twenty-three samples the contents 
of only one stomach (No. 2499) gave positive evidence of 
the presence of an alkaloid. In two other cases (Nos. 2511 
and 2512) there were suggestions that death might have 
been due to an alkaloid. Considerable quantities of water 
hemlock were growing in the field where the animals died 
but no satisfactory chemical tests for an active principle 
could be obtained. One sample had undergone putrefaction 
and was discarded. In the nineteen remaining cases the 
results were negative. 

8 order to make sure that no vegetable substance to 
i the trouble might be due had escaped detection, 
us methods were tried under varying conditions. The 
iar nature of alkaloids and the ease with which many 
ese compounds are decomposed in the animal body, 
s the work of the investigator unusually difficult, 
especially when only traces of the substance are present. 
6 this reason every precaution was taken to avoid loss 
the whole investigation was conducted with the greatest 
In doubtful cases the process was repeated two and 
i three times to verify the negative results obtained. 

The method best adapted for the detection of an unknown 
vegetable poison is that advanced in 1867 by the Russian 
chemist, Drajrendorff. The method covers a large number of </seg>

substances and consists essentially in treating [the purified 
acid extract of the suspected sample with immiscible 
solvents such as ether, by which any alkaloids present are 
removed and may be further tested with appropriate 
reagents. The reactions in every case are compared with 
those of the pure known substance for complete identification 
and verification. The detailed procedure is too 
technical to interest anyone except the specialist. 

This method or some modification of it was used throughout 
the investigation. As a special method for alkaloids 
alone several methods were employed. In order to avoid 
the possible decomposition of the substance by heating with 
dilute acids the acid extract of the stomach contents was 
neutralized with ammonia before evaporating. The method 
is described by its originators Urslar and Erdmann. This 
method gave on the whole satisfactory results. 

Allen recommends ordinary alcohol as the best extractive 
agent for alkaloids. He gives a method for recovering 
strychnine from stomachs which with modifications is 
applicable to most alkaloids. 

Ke main object of any method lor extraction of alkaloids 
obtain the substance free from foreign matter, as only 
jure condition do these compounds yield characteristic 
ions. 

The residue obtained by evaporation of the solvents were 
tested with mineral acids with and without oxidizing agents 
such as nitric acid, potassium dichromate, manganese dioxide 
and potassium nitrate; with Wagner's reagent (iodine dissolved 
in a water solution of potassium iodide), Mayer's 
reagent (potassio-mercuric-iodide). FrOhde's reagent(sulphomolybdic 
acid), Schribler's reagent (phospho tungstic acid), 
platinic chloride, tannic acid, auric chloride, alkalies and 
the usual alkaloidal reagents in making group tests with 
negative results in all cases except those mentioned. Three 
stomachs as stated showed more or less clearly the presence 
of an alkaloid resembling coniine. 

Kiine is the volatile alkaloid of the hemlock. It also 
i in the alder (Sambucus nigra) and frequently the 
of stock may be traced to this source. Coniine pos- </seg>

•eases a peculiar, disagreeable mousy odor which is 
characteristic and unmistakable. A very minute trace will 
impart the [odor to a considerable quantity of water, in 
which it is only slightly soluble. With hydrochloric acid 
coniine forms needle-like crystals doubly refracting light. 
Heated with sulphuric acid and a small crsytal of potassium 
dichromate coniine is decomposed with the formation of 
butyric acid which may be passed into an alkaline solution 
and further identified. The formation of crystals with 
hydrochloric acid, the smell of butyric acid on heating with 
sulphuric acid and potassium dichromate and the mousy 
odor give unmistakable evidence of the presence of coniine. 

Sample No. 2499 alone gave complete evidence of coniine 
poisoning. In this sample, the stomach of a horse with 
contents, the tests were unmistakable. The mousy odor of 
coniine, the smell of butyric acid on heating with potassium 
dichromate and sulphuric acid, the smell of coniine on heat•ng 
with barium hydrate, the crystals formed with hydrochloric 
acid on evaporating a drop of the distillate with 
hydrochloric acid, the reddish-brown precipitate with iodine 
solution were all characteristic of coniine and the precipitate 
which formed ut&gt;on standing after* neutralizing the acid 
solution with sodium hydrate proved the presence of an 
alkaloid. The tests were verified by comparison with 
parallel tests with Merck's coniine. 

Sample No. 2511 yielded partial tests for an alkaloid like 
coniine. The mousy odor was evident and the butyric acid 
test was obtained by boiling the substance with sulphuric 
acid and potassium dichromate and passing the vapor into 
a solution of barium hydrate. On treating the barium 
hydrate solution with sulphuric acid the odor of butyric 
acid was again evident. 

Certain volatile ptomaines have been discovered with 
reactions which may be mistaken for coniine. Water hemlock 
was found in considerable quantities in the field and 
the source of the alkaloid may have been this weed. 
Cicutoxin is the name given to the poisonous principle of 
water hemlock. Nothing recognized as this alkaloid was 
obtained. The presence of coniine is suggested by the tests 
but lacks confirmation. </seg>

            <seg id="p088">

In sample No. 2512 the alkaloid was present in such small 
amounts that only the odor gave a suggestion of the presence 
of Cwtriine. 

DO THE STOMACHS CONTAIN A MINERAL POISON? 

Rio alkaloids or other organic poisons having been found 
the stomach contents, the question of mineral poisons 
sented itself. In many cases in the search for alkaloids 
the residue from the acid alcoholic extract of the stomach 
contents was found to contain crystalline deposits along 
with yellow, amorphous matter. The foreign matter was 
washed out with alcohol and the crystals purified by crystallization 
and the process repeated several times until the 
crystals were obtained in a pure condition. On examination 
the crystals proved to be mixtures of calcium acetate, 
potassium chloride and in some cases common salt. In 
sample No. 2503 aluminium was found. Apparently the 
animal had received a dose of alum. The calcium acetate 
could be traced to the union of the acetic acid used in the 
process with the lime of the water in the stomachs. Most 
water which the cattle might drink would contain lime, and 
calcium salts are normal constituents of the stomach juice 
as also potassium and sodium chlorides. Hoppe-Seyler 
quotes from Bidder and Schmidt the composition of the 
stomach juices of various animals. The figures for the 
amount of sodium and potassium chlorides in 1,000,000 

parts are the following 

Man 

Dog (saliva-free) Sheep 
....1.125 1.518 

Potassium chloride 0.550 

Sodium chloride 1.465 

The larger content of the stomachs of herbivora as shown 
in the case of the sheep in the above table comes from the 
fact that the vegetable food of herbivora is rich in potassium 

Knberger analyzed the stomach fluid of a dog and 
0.175-1.46 parts in 1.000 of potassium chloride, 2.5-5.68 
ium chloride and 0.14 of calcium chloride. 

I the present instance no determination of the amount 
Dtassium salts present in the stomach was made. The

ation, more especially for alkaloids, so that they were not 
representative of the total contents of the stomachs and 
any calculation of the percentage of potassium salts upon 
the total contents would have been inaccurate and of no 
value for comparison with the above figures. In several 
of the stomachs the amount of potassium chloride appeared 
to be abnormal. At least a gram of crystals was obtained 
in most cases and in some instances several grams were 
obtained. Samples Nos. 2496-2502 were not considered, as 
ordinary water had been used in making the extracts.

lue to poisonous weeds. 

EXAMINATION OF THE CORNSTALK. 

IB samples of stalks from fields where cattle had been 
y affected were examined by the methods employed 
the stomach contents in searching for alkaloids. No 
cious substances were obtained. 

A sample of powdered stalks was examined with strong 
ulcohol by percolation, the alcohol evaporated and the residue 
treated with ordinary ether and the ethereal solution 
filtered and evaporated. The residue was treated with 
water, the solution filtered and evaporated. The residue 
contained crystals which on testing with ferrous sulphate 
and strong sulphuric acid proved to be crystals of potassium 
nitrate. No other suspicious substance was found in the 

Eter extracts of the stalks gave test for nitrates with 
is sulphate and sulphuric acid in every case and in 
instances the coloration was most marked. ' 

Ehe presence of potassium nitrate in the stalks and of 
arently abnormal amounts of potassium chloride in the 
nachs suggested that the cornstalk disease might be due 
itrate poisoning. 

THE OCCURRENCE OF POTASSIUM NITRATE (SALTPETER) IN 
PLANTS. 

Potassium nitrate is widely distributed through the vegetable 
kingdom. Nitrates are used by the plants as food and 
in some cases considerable amounts of this salt are stored up 
by the living plants. Chatin investigated the content of </seg>

plants in saltpeter. The original article could not be obtained 
but the abstract in Biedermann's Centralblatt states 
that both meadow and forest plants in many instances are 
rich in nitrates as also many grasses, such as knot grass 
(polygonum) and hen's feet (Fumaria officinalis). Berthelot 
and Andre in 1884 studied the same question. They give 
a list of thirty-four plants containing potassium nitrate. In 
1,000 parts of the fresh plant these authors found 27.8 parts 
of potassium nitrate in wheat, 17.6 parts in oats and 33.3 
parts in Bryony (Bryonia dioica). Boutin found 11.68 per 
cent of potassium nitrate in a water-free sample of Amaranthus 
blitum, one of the common amaranths of Nebraska and 
other Western States, usually found in uncultivated lands. 
The same author found in Amaranthus atropupureus 22.77 
per cent of potassium nitrate in the water-free material and 
16 per cent in A. melancholicus ruber. When these plants 
were slowly dried, crystals of potassium nitrate were 
obtained. 

Sugar beets oftentimes contain considerable quantities of 
potassium nitrate. Biedermann's Centralblatt quotes a 
case where 9.09 per cent of the salt was found in a sample 
of beets and 38.93 per cent in the first product of sugar. 

B tobacco plant also contains considerable amounts of 
ter. Kosutany found as high as 3.379 per cent of the 
i the dry tobacco leaves. 

THE OCCURRENCE OF POTASSIUM NITRATE IN CORNSTALKS. 

Ein in the research previously mentioned states that 
corn !is especially rich in nitrates. Berthelot and 
found in sorghum and at times in corn-fodder \oonsle 
amounts of the salts of nitric acid, especially in the 
pith. The abnormal quantity of the saltpeter according to 
these investigators is due to an unhealthy condition of the 
plant so that stock fed upon stalks in this condition are 
poisoned. The calculation is made that animals eating *40 
kilos of the fodder would take 172 grams of potassium 
t. Since 60 grams acts vigorously upon the kidneys, 
nsidered that the continuance of such a ration for any 
of time would kill the animal. 

In 1889 Dr. Paul Schweitzer of the Missouri Experiment </seg>


            <seg id="p092">
92 

I ion analyzed some stalks sent by Dr. Paquin, then 
rinarian of tbat State, and obtained 5.47 per cent of 
tals of potassium nitrate from ten pounds of cornstalks 
sted in water for twelve hours. The analysis was not 
ished but is here given through the courtesy of Dr. 
Schweitzer. 

Dr. Schweitzer estimates that in collecting and testing 
the sample enough of the salt was lost so that the total 
amount would probably be 10 to 15 per cent. 

Kilar results were obtained by Dr. N. 8. Mayo of the 
,8 Experiment Station, and reported in Bulletin No. -2 
t station. 

The poisoning reported in this bulletin occurred in August, 
1894. The cornstalks in question were grown on a small 
plat of ground beside the barnyard. Seven out of twelve 
head were fatally affected. Examination of the stalks revealed 
the presence of large quantities of saltpeter. ' Beneath 
the leaf sheath which surrounds the stalks just above 
the joints the nitrate had crystallized in fine white crystals 
which resembled a white mold, but was easily recognized 
by tasting with the tongue. Around and in the cut ends of 
the stalks were solid masses of almost pure potassium nitrate. 
If a stalk was cut in two and tapped lightly upon a table, 
the crystals of potassium nitrate would be jarred loose and 
fall as a fine powder upon the table. Upon splitting a cornstalk 
the crystals in the pith of the stalk could be seen with 
the unaided eye. The bitter, cooling taste, so characteristic 
of potassium nitrate, could be obtained by placing a 
small bit of the stalk in the mouth. On lighting a bit of 
stalk with a match, it would deflagrate, burning rapidly like 
the fuse of a firecracker. A chemical examination of a 
quantity of the stalks gave 18.8 per cent of the dry weight 
of the stalks to be nitrate of potash." 

In a later bulletin. Dr. Mayo states that he examined cornstalks 
in several fields for potassium nitrate and found in 
some cases considerable quantities. Several samples received 
from other places were also richly charged with saltpeter. 
Dr. Mayo estimated the amount at 10 to 15 per cent.

Erred only in patches, and in the patches not all the stalks 
ed to be thus heavily loaded. Dr. Mayo's conclusion in 
bulletin is stated in these words : 

' 'There are indications that what may be called typical cornstalk 
disease in cattle is a combination of indigestion and 
some toxic substance in the cornstalks, possibly saltpeter 

Biy of these instances, however, are to be regarded as 
inal. The very large amounts of potassium nitrate 
reported ware found in stalks grown on the site of 
ock yards. 

EXAMINATION OP CORNSTALKS FOR POTASSIUM NITRATE. 

Fourteen samples of cornstalks grown in the season of 
1901 were received from .fields where cattle had been fatally 
affected. The samples were sent by express to the Station 
by various farmers who wished to learn whether the stalks 
contained any poisonous substance. In many instances the 
sample consisted almost entirely of the leaves and for the 
most part were cut up. In other cases the stalks were simply 
cut into short lengths, tied in a bundle and sent in. In no instance 
was a sample taken with a view of ascertaining the 
potassium nitrate present. All of the samples gave evidence 
of the presence of potassium nitrate when the water extracts 
were tested with ferrous sulphate and sulphuric acid, and 
in one case, No. 2565. the reddish-brown coloration was 
very marked. 

Ping the season of 1902 very little loss of stock in the 
elds was reported. A severe outbreak, however,

details of the analytical work of both seasons will be

elL. TEMPERATURES AT LINCOLN, NEBRASKA, 
1888 TO 1902. 

By G. D. Swezey. 

In the spring of 1888, seven soil thermometers, made by 
Henry J. Green, were placed in the ground at the Experiment 
Station farm, at depths of one inch, three inches, six 
inches, nine inches, one foot, two feet and three feet, respectively. 
Observations with them were begun May 1st of 
that year and these observations have been continued up 
to the present time, including fifteen years in all, except 
that during the first three years the readings were discontinued 
during the winter months. For twelve years then, 
from 1891 to 1902 inclusive, the observations have been practically 
uninterrupted except by reason of the occasional 
breaking of a single thermometer and the delay incident 
to its replacement. The observations have, for the most 
part, been taken by Mr. S. W. Perin the present superintendent 
of the farm. 

Up to August 1, 1895, the thermometers were read three 
times, and, for a part of this period, four times a day ; since 
then the readings have been made only once each day, at 
about 6 p. m. The daily means for the years 1888 to 1893 
inclusive have already been published in full, in Volumes IVI 
of the bulletins of this station ; for the years following, 
up to the present time, the data are given in Table VI of this 
report. 

I extensive and continuous a series of observations as 
now been accumulated seems worthy of at least a brief 
ission ; accordingly the normals, means and ranges for 
welve years of practically continuous record have been 
juted, and will form the basis of the present discussion, 
iks are due to Mr. G. A. Loveland, Section Director of 
Nebraska Section of the U. S. Weather Bureau, for 
ed assistance in compiling this report. 

SOURCES OF HEAT. 

The sources of .the heat by which the soil is warmed are 
two, the radiant energy of the sun absorbed the soil and 
the internal heat of the earth conducted'to the surface from 
great depths; the former is variable, coming in well marked </seg>

daily and yearly periods but its effects are modified to some 
extent also by atmospheric conditions which vary in rather 
irregular periods of a few days, and a few years, respectively. 
The heat received from the interior of the earth is 
presumably constant or nearly so. is relatively slight, and 
is nearly but not entirely masked by the downward and upward 
flow, through the soil, of heat received from the sun. 

DIURNAL CHANGES. 

!be first question to be considered is the behavior of the 
nal wave of temperature ; its progress downward, the 
:h to which it is appreciable and the amount by which it 
clayed in reaching the several depths. The months best 
Bd to an investigation of this subject are February and 
ust; in these months the ground temperatures are most 
•ly constant, being nearly at a minimum in February and 
k maximum in August; hence the diurnal changes are 
little if at all affected by the downflow and upflow of 
) due to the annual wave of temperature. 

During the year 1891 the thermometers were read four 
times a day, viz.. at 7 a. m., noon. 6 p. m., and 9 p. m. 
The following tables give the mean temperatures at each of 
the several depths for these different hours.

From the above table it will be seen that the daily fluctuations 
in the air are nearly coincident in time with those 
at the surface of the ground and are not very different from 
them in amount; that the diurnal wave gradually progresses 
downward and at the same time gradually grows less marked 
until it finally disappears. In winter the daily maximum 
is reached in the middle of the afternoon ; at depths of three 
to six inches the maximum occurs in the evening, at one 
foot it is delayed till the following morning, below which it 
is scarcely appreciable, appearing, if at all, during the 
following day ; the minimum temperature, which occurs in 
the air in the early morning, is propagated downward at 
about the same rate. In summer the daily range is considerably 
greater at all depths, the changes are appreciable 
to a depth of at least two feet, and are retarded to about the 
same extent as in winter. We may therefore think of the 
diurnal wave of temperature as first appearing at the surface 
of the ground under the influence of the sun's radiant 
energy, and thence propagated both upward and downward ; 
upward into the air quite promptly by conduction, convection 
and radiation and slowly downward by conduction into 
the soil with decreasing effect until it disappears at a depth 
of about three feet. 

ANNUAL CHANGES. 

We may next consider in the same way the progress of the 
annual temperature wave. This is indicated, in a general 
way, by the following table of normal monthly temperatures 
for the various depths. These normals are obtained by

Table II. — Normal temperatures for the several month*. 

Month Air 1 in 3 ins 6 ins 9 ins 12 ins 24 ins 36 ins 

I inspection of the table will lead to conclusions similar 
?se derived from Table I. We note, for example, that 
nnual changes of temperature are greater at and near 
urface of the ground than in the air itself, and that the 
Eil range, like the diurnal, decreases with great regulart 
we go down. 

The table also shows that on the whole the air receives 
heat from the soil rather than the soil from the air; this 
follows from the fact that the soil is warmer than the air. 
It is true that the air temperatures given in the table are 
mean temperatures while those of the soil are, as stated at 
the outset, partly derived from single daily observations 
taken about 6 p. m., but while this might increase somewhat 
the excess of temperature found at the shallower 
depths over that of the air the effect would be slight and it 
would not at all affect the deeper temperatures as given in 
Table I. It appears, then, that the temperature of the 
soil to the depth of a few inches is higher during every 
month of the year than is the air which lies upon it, and that 
this is the chief source of warmth to the atmosphere ; also 
that the deeper soil is warmer on the average than the air; 
at a depth of three feet the temperature is the same as that 
of the air in March and September, is hieher from October 
to February and lower from April to August, but on the 
average is 1.6 degrees warmer. How much of this excess

is due to the downtlow of solar beat and how much to the 
upward flow of the internal heat of the earth does not appear 
from our data : we can only say that more of it comes from 
above than from below, bat how much more we can not say 
because our observations do not reach deep enough. Similar 
investigations in other localities have shown that, beginning 
at a depth of one or a few feet, tuere begins to be a 
rise of average temperature as we go deeper ; thus at Lahore, 
India, Dallas* finds the mean temperature at a depth of 
three feet to be eight tenths of a degree higher than at one 
foot, while at six feet it is one degree higher ; at Jaipur and 
Dehra Dun the increase begins at less than one foot, from 
which he concludes that the coolest place in the crust of the 
earth in Upper India lies at less than one foot below the 
surface ; from our observations it appears that in Nebraska 
the coolest layer lies at an average depth of somewhat more 
than three feet from the surface. It would be interesting to 
know whether the difference is a climatic one or is due to 
the closer proximity of subterranean fires there than here. 

It appears then that at the depth of our deepest thermometer 
the flow of heat is downward rather than upward, 
so that this excess of 1.6 degrees by which the temperature 
at that depth is greater than the air temperature is due more 
to solar than to terrestrial heat; but how much more does 
not appear from the data. 

The rate of descent of the annual temperature wave is 
also indicated in a general way by Table II. We see that 
the coolest month of the year at the surface of the ground 
is January, while at greater depths the month of February 
gives the lowest temperature ; and that July is the warmest 
month at most depths but August is warmer than July at 
the depths of two and three feet. 

But a table of monthly means is evidently not well suited 
to a study of this question : more light is furnished by a 
consideration of the actual dates of highest and lowest 
temperature for different years at different depths.

This table shows that the yearly maxima and minima are 
reached at practically the same time for the air and the 
upper few inches of soil, and that the annual wave of 
temperature progresses somewhat regularly downward, 
although of course somewhat distributed by temporary 
changes in the weather, requiring about a month to reach 
the depth of our lowest thermometer. 

DEPTH OF FROST. 

We may determine approximately the deptb to which the 
ground is frozen at any time from the reading of 'the thermometer 
next above, and that next below this depth ; assuming 
that the temperature changes regularly between 
these two points we may interpolate between their two 
readings to find at what depth the temperature would be 32 
degrees. In this way we may trace approximately the 
movements of the frost line in the ground during any particular 
winter. For example, in 1900-1901 we tind that after 
one or two temporary cold spells the ground began to freeze 
permanently on Dec. 24th, the depth of frost gradually 
increased to 15 inches by Jan. 1st, the frost line remained 
at this depth with slight oscillations for twenty days, then 
rose to 10. 5 inches by Jan. 23d ; it remained at about 12 inches 
most of the time until early in February ; it then descended 
to a depth of 20 inches by Feb. 12th ; it remained at about 18 
inches until early in March, it then rose to 12 inches where 
it remained until Mar. 12th. Meanwhile, beginning about 
Feb. 26th, the ground began to thaw permanently at the 
surface, and a second line of 32 degrees began to descend 
from above. During the early days of March the only portion 
of ground that was frozen was at a depth of between 
nine and twelve inches. The lower frost line thus remained </seg>


            <seg id="p101">
101 

at a Dearly constant level of one foot until the upper line 
descended to the same depth, the last remnant of frost being 
recorded on March 12th at a depth of twelve inches. This 
may be taken as a fair sample of the movements of the frost 
line during the winter, except that it often penetrates to 
considerably greater depths. 

Table IV shows the greatest depth of frost for each year 
and the date of its occurrence. 

Finally it remains to consider those differences of temperature 
by which one year, or one group of years, 
differs from another. For this purpose the mean temperatures 
of different years at different depths are here brought 
together so far as the record is complete for entire years. 
The normal temperatures given at the foot of the table are 
taken from Table II, as being more accurate than averages 
made from the less complete date of Table V would be.

Table V.— . 

It will be seen that the differences of temperature for 
different years at the surface and in the air are in general 
reproduced at all depths, but with diminished intensity as 
we go down. There are some anomalies but they are easily 
accounted for ; we have seen from Table I that changes in 
the temperature of the air in summer are correlated with 
greater and deeper changes in the ground temperatures 
than are those of winter. When therefore, as in 1896, the 
temperature of the winter months is abnormally high, 
the mean temperature of the year may be thereby raised 
above the normal without a corresponding excess in the 
ground temperatures. When on the contrary, as in 1901, 
the mean temperature of the year is brought above normal 
by abnormally high temperature in the summer months, 
we may expect to see the ground temperatures somewhat 
higher than usual.
