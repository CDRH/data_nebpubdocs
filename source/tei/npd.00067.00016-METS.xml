OVERWINTERING OF UREDINIOSPORES OF PUCCINIA GRAMINIS TRITICI INTRODUCTION In order to ascertain whether the urediniospores oiPuccinia graminis tritici (Pers.) Erikss. and Henn. overwinter under the environmental conditions prevailing at Lincoln, Nebraska, a series of experiments was carried out extending over a period of 5 years. The results of this investigation are briefly presented. •. EXPERIMENTAL DATA 1920-21. The experiment was begun July 15 by planting Prelude wheat. Every 2 weeks thereafter a l/40th acre plant - ing of Turkey Red (Neb. No. 60) was made until m January. During the latter part of August a natural epidemic of stem rust occurred on the Prelude wheat, which had made a good growth during August. Later urediniospores were plentiful on the leaves of the first 4 plantings of Turkey Red. New uredinia developed from time to time until the middle of October. Plants showing an abundance of uredinia m the first 5 plats were located by means of stakes, October 15. Every 2 weeks thereafter, leaves with uredinia were gathered and the per - centage of spore germination determined. The number of spores which germinated decreased gradually at every read - ing until late m January, when a small percentage of the spores were still viable. No germination was obtained from any of the spore material gathered m February, at which time it was also difficult to find leaves with uredinia. A close examination was made of the plants m these plats during the spring, but no uredinia were found until June 14. However, uredinia of stem rust were present at the same time on wheat plants m all the plats over the farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agr. Exp. Station Research Bulletin 35 1921-22. The above experiment was duplicated and similar results were obtained. 1922-23. By means of an extended period of incubation, an attempt was made to determine whether overwintering of the urediniospores might not occur and for this reason the work was confined to the low temperature greenhouse. The results obtained have already been reported. 1 They show that when seedling plants were inoculated and incubated at the optimum tempera cure for infection and then placed at a constant temperature of 5° C, uredinia were not visible on any of the plants within 8 weeks after they were placed at this tempera - ture. 1923-21,. Two experiments of a similar nature were under - taken in the low temperature greenhouse. As in the previous experiments the period of incubation was extended for about 8 weeks under the conditions of the experiments, at which time uredinia were visible. It is extremely doubtful if over - wintering, under the fluctuating field conditions of the Ne - braska winter, can occur by means of an extended period of incubation. Further, seedling plants were grown in paraffin paper con - tainers (Sealrights) in the open field until they began to stool. During the forepart of November they were brought into the greenhouse, inoculated and incubated for 48 hours under optimum temperature and moisture conditions. The con - tainers with the plants were then returned to the field and placed under a variety of conditions. At the end of each week a number of containers from each set were brought into the greenhouse and maintained for a period of 2 weeks under optimum conditions for the development of the disease, when a record was made of the number of plants infected and the degree of infection. During the course of the winter the number of plants in - fected decreased with each succeeding week, until the last infection consisting of one pustule on a leaf appeared in January. 1924-25. The above experiment was repeated on a more extensive scale, with similar results, namely the last pustule appeared in the greenhouse on a leaf of a plant brought in from the field January 5, 1925. These experiments check with 1 Peltier, George L. A Study ot the Environmental Conditions Influencing the Development of Stem Rust in the Absence of an Alternate Host. II.

            <seg id="p005">Conditions Influencing Development of Stem Rust the one made on the viability of the urediniospores as de - termined by the percentage of germination of urediniospores produced naturally on plants in the field. SUMMARY After the month of January, no urediniospore germination was obtained from naturally infected wheat plants in the field, and no urediniospores developed on plants inoculated and incubated in the greenhouse, placed under various conditions in the field and subsequently brought back into the greenhouse. It is extremely doubtful whether overwintering of the urediniospores of stem rust can occur under field conditions by means of an extended period of incubation. Thus, it is safe to conclude from 5 years' results that the urediniospores of Puccinia graminis tritici do not overwinter under condi - tions that exist at Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Agr. Exp. Station Research Bulletin 35 v. the period of initial infection of urediniospores of puccinia graminis tritici on wheat INTRODUCTION By the period of initial infection is meant the time required by a pathogene after it reaches a susceptible plant part to enter the tissues. To determine what the period of initial infection of urediniospores of Puccinia graminis tritici might be, experiments were undertaken during the season of 1923 - 24 using urediniospores of Physiologic Form XXI. EXPERIMENTAL DATA Methods. A large number of 7-day-old seedlings of Little Club (C. I. 4066) were hand inoculated and all placed in an incubation chamber at the same time. The incubation chamber was held at 23° C. and all plants had an even film of water on the leaves. At stated intervals, 60 plants were withdrawn from the chamber and placed on a bench in a greenhouse held at a temperature of about 24° C, under a series of 1000 watt Mazda C lights. The artificial light served not only to give uniform conditions for all the plants but also to dry the film of water present on the plants, when taken out of the chamber, within a few minutes after being placed under them. These lights were run continuously for the period of the experiment. A record was made of the number of plants infected and the degree of infection two weeks after incuba - tion. The results obtained from two experiments are listed in Table 1. Results. The first infection subsequently developed on plants incubated for 3 hours. In other words, a uredinio - spore was able to germinate, produce a germ tube, and enter a stoma of a leaf within 3 hours. True, the number of plants infected was small but still some pustules were produced. With 6 hours' incubation there was a decided increase in the number of plants infected, and with each additional hour of incubation the percentage of infection was almost doubled, until at the end of 24 hours' incubation, almost 90 per cent of the plants were infected. When the length of incubation was extended beyond 24 hours from 92 to 100 per cent infec - tion of the plants was obtained. When incubation was less than 24 hours, only a few pustules were found on the plants, even tho the percentage of infec- </seg>

            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agr. Exp. Station Research Bulletin 35 VI. INFLUENCE of light on infection and subsequent development of urediniospores of puccinia graminis tritici on wheat INTRODUCTION In order to determine the influence of light on initial infec - tion and development of stem rust of wheat, a series of ex - periments were undertaken using the series of artificial light chambers previously described. : Mazda lights of 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 750, and 1000 watts were used. These lights were on continuously thruout the experiments. The plants placed in sunlight and in the dark were grown in the same greenhouse. The experiments reported below were all run in duplicate. Seven-day-old seedlings of Little Club (C. I. No. 4066) were used and were inoculated with the uredinio - spores of Physiologic Form XXI. INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON INITIAL INFECTION The seedling plants were hand inoculated and 20 pots of 6 plants each were placed in each light compartment in suit - able incubation chambers. The plants were incubated for 48 hours under these lights and then placed on the bench in a greenhouse held at approxi - mately 24° C. The mean temperature within the light com - partments was 20.5° with a range of 1.5° C. Two weeks later the percentage of infected plants and the degrees of infection were recorded. The data are listed in Table 1. The results show that light is not necessary for initial infection to take place, since as large a percentage of infection was obtained in total darkness as in sunlight or under the artificial lights. Likewise little' or no difference was noted in the degrees of infection. Apparently light has no influence whatever on initial infection of wheat seedling by the urediniospores of stem rust. 1 Peltier. George L-. and Goss, R. W.

After 48 hours' incubation the plants were removed from the incubation chambers. The mean tempera - ture within the light compartments for the period of the experiment was 19.8° with a mean range of 2° C. Notes were made of the degrees and types of infection, one and two weeks after inoculation. The results together with the per - centage of infected plants are given in Table 2. A decided difference in the development of rust in the dif - ferent light compartments was noted. The most rapid de - velopment occurred in the compartments having the greatest intensities of light; in fact, the development of rust was apparently more rapid under the higher intensities of light than in sunlight (101.7 hours of actual sunshine for period of experiment) altho the final results at the end of two weeks were the same. At the lower intensities of light, pustules developed but they were small in size. However, this could be correlated directly with growing conditions of the wheat plants. The results show quite well that the development of rust after infection has taken place depends on the factors favoring the development of the host plant, which in this instance was light. </seg>

These plants were incubated for 48 hours under ordinary greenhouse conditions in an incubation chamber held at 22.5° C. After ineubation, 19 pots of 6 plants each were placed in each light compartment. Notes on the degrees and types of infection were made at the end of one week and two weeks. These are listed in Table 3. A uniform percentage of infection was obtained in the incubation chamber, but the development of the disease de - pended on the amount of light that was available. At the higher light intensities, flecking and some pustules were re - corded at the end of the first week; while at the lower intensities and in sunlight (93.1 hours of actual sunshine for period of experiment), flecking was very indistinct. At the end of 2 weeks, normal pustules were observed on the plants held in the sunlight and at the higher intensities of light. The development of rust was slow and some flecks were observed on the plants held at the low intensities of light, which again was correlated with the condition of the plants. The plants grown at the higher light intensities made a rapid growth and were of a dark green color as con - trasted with the slower growing somewhat etiolated and </seg>
