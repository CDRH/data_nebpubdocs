Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Com - missioners of State Institutions, Silas A. Holcomb, Howard Kennedy and Henry Gerdes. Gentlemen : In compliance with the statutes, the fifth biennial re - port is herewith submitted. The Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital was created by an enactment of the legislature of 1905. $10,000.00 was appro - priated for the establishment of the institution and its maintenance for the first biennium. The hospital was pro - vided for the care of the destitute crippled and deformed of Nebraska. The originators of the bill and those who aided in se - curing the passage of the law creating the institution were influenced by the conviction that dependent cripples could and should be brought from various parts of the State and converted into self-sustaining and independent individuals. The law creating the hospital provided that it should be located in a building at the Home for the Friendless in Lincoln. Before hospital work could be begun, however, it was found necessary to expend practically half of the ap - propriation in remodeling the building set aside so that it would serve the purpose. The basement and part of the first floor of the building, which had been placed at the dis - posal of the new institution, were remodeled in such a way that fairly satisfactory quarters were obtained. The first patient was received October 1, 1905, and from that time until November 30, 1906, which was our first official biennium, 106 patients applied and 81 were admitted to the hospital for treatment. The following table indicates in several different ways the various activities of the li(is|&gt;il;il liming I he first bienniimi.

            <seg id="p005">372 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF not only how much was done during the first biennium but how rapidly the work has increased. During the second biennium, by action of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, the one entire building, of which we had formerly occupied only a part, was placed at the disposal of the Orthopedic Hospital. As indicated in the tables above about $20,000.00 was devoted to making the folhwinp improvements : The rooms in the basement were converted into offices, operating and X-rav rooms, children »' dining room, diet kitchen, etc. The first floor of the build- 1905-06 1906-08 1908-10 1910-12 1912-14 MFTMFTMFTMFT MFT Patients at beginning of period 15 17 32 20 21 41 25 38 63 53 47 100 Patients ad- mitted 53 53 106 72 79 151 86 85 171 145 139 284 .124 266 590 Patients dis- charged 38 36 74 70 72 142 83 66 149 115 132 247 318 265 583 Patients at end of per- iod 15 17 32 20 21 41 25 38 63 53 47 100 59 48 107 Av'ge daily 23 32 52 86 58 44 10J Average No. of officer? and em- ployees 5 6 15 34 No. of hos- pital days 8.850 23.360 37,960 t&gt;2,780 74,460 No. of sur- gical oper- ations 165 440 No. of sur- gical dress- ings 3,711 13.464 No. of Plas- ter of Par- is dress- ings 669 Mfl Expended — salaries &amp; wages 4,684.91 11,000.00 16,800.00 27,785.05 Subsistence 307.50 8,000.00 16.300.00 28.985.84 AH.&amp; repairs 1,000.00 800.00 3,196.42 Office, Hosp.

            <seg id="p006">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 373 ing was remodeled to provide a boys' ward, school room, quarters for the head nurse and three rooms for help. The second floor was arranged to provide two large wards, one for babies and one for girls, and two dining rooms, one for nurses and one for officers. The third floor when remodeled gave three bed rooms for nurses, two store rooms, kitchen and two bed rooms for the cook and her assistant. During the biennium following, the kitchen was trans - ferred to the basement of the main building where it is now located, conveniently situated near the cold storage and new dining room. Three inside bath rooms were torn out and seven out - side bath rooms were built providing adequate and sanitary accommodations for all the rooms and wards in the build - ings. The solarium at the south end of the building was extended up two stories providing two outdoor wards, one for girls and one for boys, which have been devoted partic - ularly to the care of tuberculous patients. Finally, a mod - ern push-button electric elevator of the automatic type was installed, which provides transportation to all the floors of the buildin" and which in the present state of our work is an indispensable feature. About June 1, 1911, all the buildings formerly occu - pied by the Home for the Friendless were turned over to the hospital. Although these new buildings made a consider - able addition to our space the extra space so provided was rapidly taken up as suitable patients were selected from among the applicants. As the buildlings have been during the past biennium we have had comfortable space for about eighty patients but for the past three years we have averaged more than 100. Our present crowded condition, in buildings which are not fire proof, is about to be relieved, however. The last legislature provided $45,000.00 with which a modern fire - proof building is being put up. This will be a surgical, office, and school building. The two upper floors will give space for the entire surgical department and the care of about 50 patients. The main floor will contain offices, re- </seg>
            <seg id="p007">374 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF ception rooms and library. In the basement there will be dining rooms and school rooms. The subway built two years ago connecting the old buildings and the communicating inclines to the new build - ing make the arrangement of our buildings very satisfac - tory. These inclines constitute one of the features of our new building in which there will be neither stairways nor elevator. All of our patients even with crutches or wheel chairs will be able easily to get from one floor to another by means of these easy sloping passageways which have been built for all four floors. Aside from the progress made on the new building the institution has made a number of other substantial improve - ments in a material way in the past two years. The two most important of these are the new laundry building and the sleeping porch on the south end of the old main build - ing. The new laundry building was put up at an expense of ar&gt;out $6,000.00. It is of fire proof construction, 40x30 feet in size and two stories high. The half basement houses the entire laundry with the exception of the ironing room. It contains two washing machines, one of which is new, a large and efficient extractor which is new, a mangle, collar and cuff ironer, and a new and very efficient dry room. The ironing is done in the old laundry building at present. This equipment enables us with four employees to take care of all our own laundry which with less equipment and less effi - cient help would be a tremendous burden. The care of our laundry work has always been an important problem, with as many bed patients as we have to care for and as much surgical work as we have to do. One hundred such children mean a much larger amount of laundry work than people ordinarily appreciate. The upper floor of the laundry building gave us for the first time a satisfactory Assembly Hall, which we have also used as a school room. This Assembly Hall we have been asking for, for some years, and it fills a need which we have &lt;Vlt very much. A considerable number of interesting and enjoyable gatherings are now regularly held in this room. </seg>

            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 375 These include Sunday school, meetings of the Boys' and Girls' Clubs, special entertainments for the children and social gatherings for the employees, nurses and officers. The new sleeping porches built on the south end of our main building were to replace old porches in a bad state of dilapidation. These have also been especially helpful. These porches were built fire-proof in construction and of the modern sleeping porch type. The upper of these porches is now used as a sleeping porch by our nurses the year 'round. Inside rooms are used by the nurses only for dressing rooms. Prom a health standpoint this makes a highly desirable arrangement as our nurses who have been twelve hours on duty in the wards are undoubtedly bene - fited by spending their sleeping hours in the outdoor air. The arrangement is also highly satisfactory from an eco - nomical standpoint, inasmuch as sixteen of our nurses oc - cupy only two large rooms in the house. The lower part of this porch has also been used as a sleeping porch by some of the officers and employees. There are still many people in Nebraska who do not understand exactly what the Orthopedic Hospital is doing. The hospital is regularly contributing to the recovery of sick and diseased children and correcting deformities which are ordinarily looked upon as hopeless. The institution has now been in existence long enough so that we can point to many examples of crippled children who have either been cured of existing deformity or have been cared for during the active stage of disease so that deformity has been prevented. We have cared for many patients with tubercu - losis of the spine, of the hip joint, knee joint and- other parts of the body, who have made perfect recoveries or have re - covered with a minimum of deformity. Many children suffering from infantile paralysis have been brought to us either with existing or impending deformities of the most serious character. These children have been corrected and improved by operation or by the use of Plaster of Paris, by the use of braces or otherwise. A considerable number of children who came unable to stand have been put upon their feet and now get about very well. Children with hare-lip, </seg>
            <seg id="p010">FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF 376 cleft palate, bow legs, hernia and other surgical conditions have come to the hospital in considerable numbers and have gone home cured following operation. In order properly to appreciate what is being done at this institution it must be realized that a considerable num - ber of the patients who come to the institution can only be benafitted and not cured. A complete restoration of the individual to normal is, in many cases, quite impossible. A much larger proportion of all crippled children can be im - proved or cured than is ordinarily supposed. In fact it is a common experience to have crippled children brought who have been led to believe that their condition is absolutely 'uopeless when as a matter of fact their relief or even cure is a relatively simple matter. To illustrate our work it may bo interesting to introduce accounts of a few of our patients. The following experiences are fairly typical of different classes of patients who come to the institution. Patients with hare-lip and cleft palate, when the condi - tion is a simple one, can nearly always be cured by suitable operation. Commonly this operation has to be done in two stages but more difficult cases require more attention. The following account is of a patient with an extreme condition. C. C. came to the hospital May 17, 1909, at the age of I years. She was the second of four children. Father, mother and three brothers all healthy. This child was a strong, healthy girl but the defects in her lip and palate v-ere so extreme that it was difficult to understand her speech. A two or three stage operation was decided upon but after the third operation it was found that the result v&gt; as not fully satisfactory. She was operated upon the first time July 12, 1909, and had other operations August 30, September 20, December 13 and January 4. On February 1 , 1910, she was discharged from the hospital cured, having spent 247 days in the institution. This girl, by her treat - ment in the hospital, was changed from a child with a ser - ious facial deformity of repulsive appearance and one which would have made intelligible speech absolutely impossible into a child who is now one with simply a peculiar facia) expression and a slight difficulty of speech. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 377 l atients with tuberculous conditions of the bones and .joints present conditions very much more difficult to treat. With proper care such as is given at the institution we have usually secured good results. For example, S. A. came to the hospital August 19, 1907. She began to be lame June 22, 1907. When admitted to the hospital she complained of severe pain and great tenderness of the right hip joint. An abscess had formed in the joint and there was consider - able deformity with her leg about l l n inches shorter than the left. The parents reported that the child cried out con - tinually at night because of pain, and her general condition was very poor. Physical examination and X-ray pictures indicated tuberculosis of the hip joint. She was put to bed at once and weight and pulley traction applied to the leg. On December 13, 1907, her first plaster cast was applied and from this time until November 26, 1913, she wore casts or was in bed most of the time. In June, 1908, an abscess in the hip joint had to be opened. This healed immediately, how - ever, and her progress continued. When discharged from the hospital November 26, 1913, she had been here a total of 2,327 days. She had not only recovered from her tubercu - lous hip with slight deformity, but had made substantial progress educationally, inasmuch as at the age of 10 she had reached the fourth grade, all of her schooling having been obtained in the hospital by the methods of bedside as well as school room teaching which we have followed so faithfully for all our patients in this institution. Congenital misplacement of the hip is another condi - tion for which a considerable number of patients come to the Orthopedic Hospital. The operation for this condition has attracted a great deal of attention as the "bloodless operation" on account of the publicity given it at the time when Dr. Lorenz visited this country in 1902. As a matter of fact we do a considerable number of so called bloodless operations for other conditions than congenital dislocation of the hip. This particular operation, however, because of its peculiar interest and because of the splendid results ob - tained, has attracted the attention of a considerable number of people. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">378 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF P. H. was admitted to the hospital April 22, 1906. with both hips out of joint since birth. His age was 2 - 1 years. He was operated upon April 23, 1906, both hips being replaced and Plaster of Paris dressings applied from this time until June, 1908. He wore plaster continuously and had casts readjusted to improve the position of the hips. He was then finally discharged from the hospital as cured, the result being entirely satisfactory to all con - cerned. A deformity like that of this patient becomes very severe if the condition is not treated, but this boy through his treatment at the Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital is now an absolutely normal individual. It would be quite im - possible for anyone to recognize without thorough examina - tion that he had ever had any defect whatever. A considerable number of patients come to the hospital with club foot. This is also a birth condition except where it follows Infantile Paralysis. The distortions of the foot in early cases are usually fairly easy either to greatly re - lieve or entirely cure. K. S. was brought to the hospital October 15, 1906, when less than a year old with extreme double club foot. The feet were turned entirely inward so that when he stood up he stood on the outer ankle of each foot. He was oper - ated upon October 22, 1906, partly by dividing the tendons about the foot, which were too short, and partly by the blood - less correction of the feet, then put in plaster and the casts changed at intervals until March, 1907, when he was dis - charged cured. In October, 1914, he returned to the hos - pital for a little further attention because the family felt that one of his feet was not quite as good as the other. Slight further correction with the fitting of a brace was at this time sufficient to give him practically normal feet to take the place of the severe deformity he formerly had. Many other similar examples could be quoted but it is sufficient to say that similar results may be obtained for many de - formities ordinarily looked upon as hopeless. Special care in such an institution as this will give bril - liant results in the correction of deformity following Infan - tile Paralysis and suitable surgical operations or braces will enable many patients to walk who could not stand. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 379 Since the epidemic of Infantile Paralysis in Nebraska in 1909, we have had many such patients. Not many of these can be cured but practically all can be benefitted. It is particularly in this class of patients that none must be considered hopeless. Some of the most discouragingly par - alyzed patients who have come to us have been very greatly improved. Children with tuberculous spines may, if they come to the hospital early, be absolutely protected against deformity instead of developing into hunch backs as so many do other - wise. Tuberculous ankles, knees, hips, and shoulders are all amenable to improvement or cure by proper attention in such an institution as ours. It is not too much to say that it is for the reasons given above that the work of the Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital has met with almost instant approval and with great en - couragement in the way of increased appropriations in a territory where 10 years ago such work was almost un - known. Neither is it too much to say that as a State work this is one of the most popular enterprises in which Ne - braska is now engaged. The following table gives in some detail an account of the surgical work done at the hospital during the past two years. Fairly descriptive titles are given for the operation and for the conditions requiring operation. The results are also shown.

Also a few operations are listed as having been done more times than we have had patients with the condition specified. This is for the reason that some of the above are two or three stage operations. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS ■m It is significant and worthy of careful consideration that even though Orthopedic surgery or the surgical and mechanical treatment of crippled children as a distinct specialty is comparatively new in this territory, even with our rapidly increasing space, the requirements and demands upon the institution have always been greater than could be met. Those who have had an opportunity to observe work of this sort in the larger cities may have noticed that the accommodations are some times greater than the num - ber of patients. This is not because there is any lack of such patients but because no special effort has been made to reach such patients and their parents with satisfactory in - formation as to what the hospitals are for and what they can do. On this account a considerable effort has always been made in this state to keep the work well advertised. Even yet, however, a very considerable number of patients who come to us complain that they had never heard of the institution or the work we are doing until just before they came. For this reason a continued effort must be made to keep our work and our results properly before the people of the State. There are still hundreds of patients to whom the institution is unknown who are suffering from condi - tions which could and should be relieved by treatment in this institution. It is important to remember also that this institution does not limit itself to the hospital care of these children. A feature which has characterized our work for a number of years is the special effort which has been made to provide the children during the time of their hospital care with special educational opportunities. Even our children who are confined to bed are assigned lessons and recite to special teachers every day. In addition to the ordinary grade in - struction which is given them, special features like the Boys' Debating Club, an organization of Camp Fire Girls, and a band, occupy the attention and interest of a number of the children at odd times. More than a passing word must be/ given to our educa - tional work. There have been some changes in the person - nel o«ir teaching force since the last report. Miss </seg>
            <seg id="p016">■;x-j. FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF Mercier, however, is still in charge of the school and she now has as associates, Miss Cleaver, who has charge of the higher grades and high school work ; Miss Fairley, who in - structs the intermediate grades; and Miss Pacosta, who carries on the industrial work. We now have our school well graded and systematized. The children are given as nearly as possible, with our lim - ited teaching force, the same course of work as is given in the Dublic schools of Nebraska. Each teacher is supplied vith a Nebraska Course of Study as prescribed by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, which she follows, thus placing our children in a position to enter their proper "rades in the public schools when they leave the hospital. The attendance of the children and the book record as well as daily recitation grades are kept in a register just as in all public schools. School sessions are held all day, from nine o'clock in the morninsr until half past three in the afternoon. After the reeular school hours, each teacher goes to the children who are not able to be up and go to the school rooms. In this way the children in bed have their lessons just the same as those who are able to be up and around. This year we have made arrangements with the County Superintendent to send us monthly examination questions ~i'ch as are sent out to the public schools so that we may keen our children up to standard in their lessons. Last sprint three of our children took their county eighth grade examinations and were given free high school certificates. Tn the industrial department the children are taught to do all kinds of plain sewing, such as making their own dresses, gowns, aprons and bibs, and curtains for use in the hospital, darning and mending, as well as lace making, em - broidery, tatting, crocheting and basket weaving. We now have a complete system of school work from the kindergarten up through all of the grades and various hitfh school subjects. On account of a limited number of teachers we are not able to aret in the work in Nature Study, drawing and writ - ing such a;, given in public ochuuls, during tht nine months i </seg>

All of the teachers now employed in our school hold State certificates and have had experience in teaching be - fore coming here. An important contribution to the educational as well as the entertainment side of the life of our children has come in the form of our institution library. As a result of a special appropriation secured by Miss Templeton of the library commission in 1911 and the interest of Miss Waugh, institution librarian, the first institution library was opened at the Orthopedic Hospital in September, 1911. Several hundred books and about twenty of the current ma - eazines have since been supplied by the library commission. Miss Eva Colby, under Miss Waugh's direction, has since maintained the library according to modern library ideas and it has been a source of the greatest help and satisfaction to patients and employees of the institution. Acknowledgement must be made of our indebtedness to many Lincoln people and to a considerable number out - side of Lincoln who have contributed to the welfare and en - tertainment of the children at different times. Miss Tem - pleton and Miss Waugh of the Library Commission, entirely aside from their official duties, have contributed very largely by their interest in individual patients and in the Boys' Debating Club. Miss Annie Jones has given piano lessons to our chil - dren for several years and has contributed otherwise to their pleasure and progress at different times. Miss Miriam Starrett by personal solicitation secured special funds and has contributed by this means to a number of special occasions. The success of our Christmas last year and the year before for the children was quite largely due to her efforts. Mr. C. R.

Miss Isabell Coons has been especially attentive in this reeard and the children look forward to her frequent visits vith interest and enthusiasm. Mr. Gorman and Mr. Frank D.

It is quite impossible to enumerate all those who have taken an interest in the institution and the children. It is important, however, to say that it is largely on account of this interest and because of this attention that the work has taken so &lt;rreat a hold upon the people of Lincoln and the people of the State. The fact is becoming generally understood that we are. not only relieving the children at this institution of physical infirmities but that we are devel- op physically and educationally young men and young v, omen who instead of being dependents will become inde - pendent and useful citizens with certain special abilities for service in whatever eommnnity they may subsequently be situated. A number of neople in other states who are interested in the care of these children have visited the institution and others have called upon its officers to tell of what is being done here.

The institution is under considerable obligation to the medical profession of Lincoln and the State. Practically all physicians who have come in contact with this work and who are at all familiar with what is being done here are hearty in their commendation. If there have been faults and defects in the work done so far it is generally consid - ered that these are due less to the aims and objects which we are endeavoring to attain than to incidental defects which we are overcoming as rapidly as possible. This institution was originally designed to provide care for the indigent crippled and deformed of the State. This purpose has been admirably fulfilled. Until about a year ago the institution received occasional pay patients who desired to avail themselves of the special equipment and service to be had there. In as much as this custom was made the basis of some criticism the practice has been dis - continued and now only those patients unable to pay are accepted for treatment. It is important to understand, however, that this does not limit the institution only to those who are in destitute circumstances. Any child who is crippled or deformed or who is suffering from a disease likely to eventuate in de - formity and whose parents are unequal financially to pro - viding modern hospital care and professional services for the particular condition involved is promptly accepted for care at this institution. By some who do not fully understand our objects and methods it has occasionally been urged that patients remain at the institution for the shortest possible time or only until the most immediate hospital results can be obtained. This does not agree with the idea of those in charge of this work. It is our desire that all patients brought to the hospital re - main here until such time as the utmost that can be done for them by hospital care has been accomplished and. in those patients where there is danger of relapse, until such time as this danger is past. Our scheme of educational work makes this not only entirely feasible but highly de- </seg>

In this way patients who have fallen behind in their school work may be brought up to a normal grade by special attention from our teachers and because of the fact that our school continues in operation for twelve months in the year. The combination of hospital and school which we have always urged at this institution is working out to our entire satisfaction and will, it seems to us, meet with more general approval and acceptance as time goes on. Perhaps the most important event in the life of this institution in the past two years was the transfer of the governing authority to the newly created Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions. This is a considerable step in advance for Nebraska. It follows along the line of what has already been done in a number of other states. The new arrangement has not only jriven us a controlling Board which takes a more immediate and direct interest in all of our affairs but has put the entire business side of the institution on an administrative basis, with more attention to detail than that to which we had been accustomed. We have already under this arrangement developed a more efficient and satisfactory system of conducting the affairs at the institution. Under the present arrangement it is also possible for us to secure just the kind of cooperation and support which is most to be desired because it can be based i n a knowledge of exact records of past performance and exact existing conditions. In making this report which is in effect a report to the people of the State it is a pleasure as well as a duty for the s^'.'rintendent to express his very great appreciation of *he privilege of having been able to serve under the present Rnnrd of Commissioners. In the two years just past nearly as many patients have been tidmitted and treated at the hospital as during the en - tire eight years previous to that time. This large amount of \ orV has been accomplished without great difficulty and without serious disturbance of any kind. In making this statement it is a pleasure to acknowledge the untiring ef - forts; v* well as the loyalty and enthusiasm of the other offkrre and employees of the institution. The amount and </seg>
            <seg id="p022">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 387 kind oi work done at this institution could not have been accomplished except by constant and harmonious effort on tbt' part of all those who have been associated here. The number of our employees, while aparently large, is reailv small when one considers that both hospital and educational work are being clone for the children. Also a large plant including heating plant, laundry, etc., is being &gt;!&gt;erated. This institution is peculiarly situated, moreover, as compared with the other institutions of the State. That is to say. we are unable to secure from our patients the nssistance in carrying on our work which institutions of other kinds can get from their inmates. All of our work must be done by paid employees and the work is of a char - acter which at times presents extraordinary difficulties besides. The people of the State owe a particular debt to the nurses, who have the care of these patients. The care of the sick is always a burdensome task and the number of sick children in this institution is always sufficiently large so that the burden is only to be tolerated because the work is done by an enthusiastic, loyal corps of young women, who are devoted to their patients. It may not be generally un - derstood that our nurses are young women who are really punils in the Nurses Training School of the Orthopedic Hospital. These young women devote two years to a com - pletion of the training course. During this time they spend a number of hours in the actual care of patients. In addi - tion they have a certain amount of laboratory and class - room work and devote some hours to the study of subjects related to nursing and the care of the sick. The subjects studied in this way are: In the junior year, Anatomy and Physiology, Bacteriology, Practical Nursing (infectious dis - eases. Parasitic diseases. Pediatrics), Surgery — practical training, asepsis and antisepsis, bandaging, casts, braces and splints, Urine and Stomach Analysis (lectures and lab - oratory). Blood counting, Dietetics and Massage. Tn the senior year, Materia Medica and Toxical, Gynecology, Ob - stetrics, Practical Nursing (digestive system, respiratory, urinary, blood and ductless glands). Surgery (Practical training, operating room), Nervous and mental disease. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">388 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF Venereal diseases, Red Cross Nursing, and Public School Nursing. The nurses actual service during the two years consists of twelve months in the wards, two months in each ward ; four months of night duty ; two and one-half months in the surgical dressing room ; three months in the operat - ing room ; six weeks at Milford (Obstetrics) ; and one month vacation (two weeks each year). An effort has always been made to have the adminis - trative side of the institution conducted satisfactorily along the lines laid down by the Board of Commissioners. That this part of the work has been well done is sufficiently evi - denced by the fact that when all the expenses of the insti - tution for the past biennium are charged up to the patients our per capita daily cost has been only $1.26. Here again it is necessary to remember that this includes not only hos - pital care but comprehensive educational work for our chil - dren. The per capita cost of any hospital plus the per capita cost of our public school is far above what it is cost - ing us to do work at least as difficult. RECOMMENDATIONS The Assembly Hall, built during the past biennium has been an important contribution to the comfort and pleasure of the patients who are able to be up and about. Some special equipment for this room would make it much more desirable as a play room for the children and as a gymnasium for nurses and employees. Some systematic work along this line has already been done but entirely without apparatus and with but few appurtenances of any kind. The sleeping porches already completed are also ex - tremely useful but already becoming inadequate for the number of nurses and employees in the institution. The construction of the Assembly Hall and sleeping porches was bet»un under the direction of the Board of Public Lands and Buildintrs under the administration of which this institution was conducted for the first seven months of the biennium. We are particularly indebted to Mr. W. A. George, State Treasurer, one of the members of this Board, for the idea and the plans of this building. Mr. George actively nppospd the pxpenditnrp of money for thp r*- </seg>

In a similar way Mr. Fred Beckman, chairman of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, was chiefly responsible for the tearing down of old porches at the south end of our main building and the construction of the new sleeping porches already referred to. With the completion of the new building we shall have floor space enough so that with suitable alterations and re - pairs satisfactory quarters can be provided for all officers and employees except the superintendent. To provide these quarters the changes will have to be quite extensive and a liberal alteration and repair appropriation must be provided for this purpose as well as to harmonize the appearance and construction of the old building with the new one which it joins. This applies particularly to halls and stairways of all floors in the main building. For the superintendent new living quarters must be provided, either by a suitable addition to one of the present buildings or by the construc - tion of a separate residence. During the developmental stage of this work all of the officers and employees of this institution have patiently endured meager living accommodations. Now that the in - stitution has reached its present state it would seem that living conditions similar to those in the other State insti - tutions should be provided. For the adequate heating of our enlarged plant an ad - dition to our heating plant will be necessary. This will involve the enlargement of our boiler room and the adidtion of another boiler of similar capacity to the two we now have. This will be another expensive change but one which is absolutely necessary and one for which allowance has been made in our estimate of expense for the coming bien - nium. Some improvements must also be made in our heat - ing plant by the installation of new radiators to replace those which are worn out and by new steam pipes where needed. Almost the entire institution, especially the interior, is </seg>
            <seg id="p025">KIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OK 390 badly in need of repainting. In some places wooden wains - coating must be torn out and walls and ceilings repaired. In general the interior arrangement is satisfactory but a few partitions must be built and others changed, especially in the nurses' and employees' living quarters. In conclusion, the Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital, we think, has been shown to be making rapid progress in an increasingly useful work. The people and their represen - tatives and officers in the legislature and in the capitol building have manifested an interest in and enthusiasm for this work which we believe to be unequaled in any other State in this country. In return for this interest and the liberal appropriations provided for carrying on this work we believe we can say that, all things considered, from the hospital and educational stand point, the State of Nebraska, in proportion to its population, is receiving better service of this sort than any other State. Let no one suppose, however, that we have reached the point where we can afford to relax our efforts. The de - mands made upon the institution are becoming constantly greater and the opportunities for valuable service in this direction will be more rather than less. We hope to have from all those who have had a part in the development of the work up to this point still greater interest and still more encouragement. In this way only can the hospital increase its usefulness to the crippled chil - dren and, therefore, to the people of the State. It is also upon such agencies that the institution must depend for its increasing influence outside the State. s It has already been pointed out that a number of other States are taking steps toward the establishment or expansion of similar work. Their efforts and their success in dealing with the cripples of their respective territories will depend to a certain extent upon the continued success of the work in Nebraska and the attitude of the Nebraska people and the State officials. We desire to acknowledge also our debt to the members of the medical profession of Lincoln and the State. They, more than anyone else, keenly appreciate our problems and </seg>

It is a pleasure to say that our work has been easier and more successful because of the friendly attitude and the co-operation of the progressive and more advanced of our professional associates. We have been glad to receive and have profited by criticism from this source. In November, 1913, the Central States Orthopedic Club met at the Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital with such well - known men as Dr. John Ridlon, Dr. John L. Porter, Dr. Edwin Ryerson of Chicago ; Dr. S. C. Baldwin of Salt Lake City ; Dr. A. Steindler of Des Moines ; Dr. W. G. Stern of Cleveland, Ohio; Dr. A. M. Steinfield of Columbus, Ohio; and a number of others in attendance. The expressions of interest and approval of those men on that occasion were such as to justify us in the belief that our work compares favorably with that being done elsewhere and that it merits the respect and confidence which we have so abundantly re - ceived.
