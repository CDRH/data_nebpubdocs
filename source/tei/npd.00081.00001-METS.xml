APPLICATION NO. 11153. In the Matter of the Application of the C. &amp; N. \V. Ry. Co. for au - thority to discontinue operation of Motor Trains Nos. 121 and 122 between Missouri Valley. Iowa, and Fremont. Nebraska. UY DRAKE, CHAIRMAN: OPINION A.M&gt; FINDINGS This matter came on for hearing on the 11th day of January, - 1!K!5. upon the application of the Chicago .£ Northwestern Railway Company, who request authority to cancel certain train schedules now on file covering passenger trains Nos. 121 and 122, operating between Missouri Valley, Iowa and Fremont, Nebraska. Proper notice of this hearing was served upon interested parties in the cities and towns affected. No appearances were made by any ot the affected parties in the state of Nebraska, and the only protest on file with the Commission from Nebraska parties is from the newspaper pub - lisher at Fremont, Nebraska, relative to the delivery of newspapers from Fremont to Kennard, Nebraska, one of the towns now being served by these trains. The Assistant General Superintendent for operations of appli - cant carrier in Nebraska, and applicant's station agent at Missouri Valley. Iowa, appeared as witnesses for applicant, introducing ex - hibits showing record data and also testifying orally in support of their request. The record testimony shows that the present oper - ations of a motor car train running from Fremont, Nebraska to Missouri Valley, Iowa, a round trip distance of 74 miles, is result - ing in a loss of approximately $10.50 per day which, on a basis of 310 days (present trains operating week days only) amounts to ¥3, 287.00 per year. The testimony shows that the average cost- per train mile, in - cluding depreciation is .310, and excluding depreciation, is .2f&gt;fi. while the average revenue amounts to about .13(J per train mile The Nebraska cities and towns affected, namely, Blair, Arlington and Fremont, are served by other trains and mail services, while the town of Kennard is the only station which would have any appreciable loss of service. The record shows that Kennard produc- </seg>
            <seg id="p082">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ed passenger revenue in 1934 of $65.95, which is an average of .211? per daily train &lt; peration. It is apparent from these facts and other record data, that this train operation has become a burden upon the company, and thej allege they have been forced to divert sorely needed revenues from other sources to meet the deficits incurred herein. Applicant shows taat mail service to all of the towns in Ne - braska now being sen ed by these trains can be and will be served by the U. S. Railway Mail Service, either through other train service or establishment of Star Mail Routes, which will give to such towns equal or better service than now received. The only objection voiced by any of the Nebraska patrons comes from a Fremont newspaper publisher on afternoo i delivery of newspapers by train No. 122 at Kennard, Nebraska, "lie record shows that there are at the present lime 26 such new-spar ers for the delivery of which, at that time of day to Kennard,' Nebriska, no substitute service of the applicant or U "s&gt;. Mail Service is provided. The question is then presented as to whether or not this Commission should compel the applicant to con - tinue this service when the record shows that the revenue received from such service an ounts to only i£ $ per mile, such newspapers being carried as baggige. Objections were voiced for the people of Missouri Valley, Iowa, through their counsel, and a motion was made to dismiss the applica - tion on the grounds :hat the train operations were interstate, sub - ject to the jurisdictior of the Interstate Commerce Commission only, and several suggestiors were made as to the proper procedure here - in. Attention is called to the Nebraska constitutional provision giv - ing this Commission general control over the services of common carriers, and to the statutory provision which requires applicant to file its schedules. Ii the present instance, these train schedules have heretofore been filed and approved by this Commission, and this is an applicatioi to change such schedules. It is therefore apparent that this Commission does have jurisdiction in the matter. This Commission cai not recognize any statutory requirements In the state of Iowa, which might govern the operations of this train in that state. The &gt;nly question involved in this proceeding is whether or not the evidence in this case shows that the service about tc be abandoned is required, and in considering such question the Commission must recognize the fact that it cannot compel appli - cant to continue to operate trains which incur substantial losses which become a burdi-n upon the revenues of the applicant company. There is one question presented which this Commission must consider. It is allege 1 that if these trains are taken off, a person at </seg>
            <seg id="p083">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT Fremont, Arlington or Missouri Valley who might wish to travel to Arlington or Blair, or any other point of connection with connect - ing railroads and trains, would be then forced, in order to travel, to buy pasnenger transportation over a longer route thru Omaha, be - cause there was no passenger service left. The Commission is of the opinion that if it should allow applicant to discontinue these trains, that applicant should protect the present short line mileage for such passenger service. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the present economical and proper operation and management of applicant company requires that it be permitted to cancel the present train schedules of its trains Nos. 121 and 122 operating between Fremont, Nebraska anil Missouri Valley, Iowa, insofar as such trains operate in the state of Nebraska, with the provision that the passenger fares via the short line mileage, Fremont, Nebraska to Missouri Val - ley, Iowa, will be protected when passengers elect to use passenger service between these two points and the route of movement is through Omaha, Nebraska. The Commission is of the further opinion and so finds that an emergency exists, and that this order should be made effective less than thirty days from this date, but not less than a reasonable time of fifteen days, to allow the railway mail service to complete arrange - ments for changes in the mail schedules and establishment of Star Mail Routes. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Rail - way Company to discontinue Trains Nos. 121 and 122 be approved, insofar as such trains operate in the state of Nebraska, with the pro - vision that the passenger fares via the short line mileage, Fremont. Nebraska to Missouri Valley, Iowa, will be protected when passen - gers elect to use passenger service between these two points and the route of movement is through Omaha, Nebraska. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that an emergency existing, this order shall be and will be effective February 1st., 1!)35. MADE AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska. January 17th.. 1935.

APPLICATION NO. 11153 In the Matter of th&lt; Application of the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., for author - ity to discontinue operation of Motor Trains Nos. 121 and 122 between Missouri Valley, Iowa and Fremont, Nebraska. BY BOLLEN, COMMISSIONER: I OPINION AND CQJ£HI;USIONS I concur with the other Commissioners upon the findings of fact. The evidence is conclusive that Motor Car Trains Nos. 121 and 12L", now be ng operated by applicant between Fremont, Ne - braska and Missouri Valley, Iowa, are being operated at an out-of - pocket loss ol api roximately $3,287.00 per year. This is not an application to cancel train schedules. It is merely :i letter ec liciting the permission of this Commission to dis - continue Motor Car passenger service. The cancelling of train schedules is mere &gt;• incidental and would necessarily follow a dis - continuance of M&lt; tor Car passenger service between the designated points. Were this application to discontinue Motor Car passenger ser - vice between two stations sltaajted in Nebraska, there could be no question about o ir jurisdiction fo grant the application upon the evidence as subm tted. Our jurisdiction would then arise under the Constitution whic i confers upon the Commission the "regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers". We have no statutory enactments which extend the jurisdiction given under the Constitution. " V. This is an application to discontinue Motor Car passenger ser - vice between interstate stations.

            <seg id="p085">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT be delegated by it to the Interstate Commerce Commission by proper federal legislation. I am unable to find any such specific statutory enactment. FEDERAL, JURISDICTION Paragraph 4 of Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act places the burden upon "every common carrier, subject to this Act. engaging in the transportation of passengers of property to provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable request therefore, and to establish through routes and just and reasonable fares, 'rates and charges applicable thereto and to provide reasonable facilities for operating through routes and to make reasonable rules and | reg - ulations with respect to operation of through routes and prov dins for reasonable compensation to those entitled thereto." This section does not require an application to the Interktat&gt;- Commerce Commission for a certificate of convenience and necessity before a carrier discontinues an interstate passenger train. 'The jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, if any, would arise only when a carrier had discontinued an interstate passenger train. Upon complaint the Interstate Commerce Commission under the above section would have the power to order the train restored. if it found that the public convenience and necessity required such service. . Paragraphs 10 and 11 of Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act provide that it shall be the duty of every carrier by railroad. subject to the act, to furnish safe and adequate car service and to establish, observe^and enforce just and reasonable rules, regulations and practices with respect to car service in the transportation of property. In the case of Railway Commission of Wisconsin vs. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 87 I. C. C. 195, the Interstate Commerce Commiss on held that jurisdiction to regulate the operation of passenger trains had not been vested in the Commission. Paragraph 17* of Section 1 of the Act contains the following: "Provided, however, that nothing In this Act shall impair or effect the right of a State in the exercise of its police power to require just and reasonable freight and passenger service for intrastate business, except insofar as such requirement is inconsistent with any lawful order of the Commission made under the provisions of this Act." </seg>
            <seg id="p086">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION &gt;) Paragraph 18 of Section 1 of the Act provides that "no carrier by railroad, subject to this act, shall abandon all or any portion of a line of railroad or the operation thereof unless and until there shall first have bee j obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit of such abandonments. " This, of course, has no application to the discontinuance of passenger trains, but the abandoment of all train service. I, there - fore, conclude tha . no application is required to be made to the Interstate Comme -ce Commission to secure permission for the abandonment of ai y interstate passenger train. This matter, as far as Conyress and the Interstate Commerce Commission are concerned, is left entirely to the management. If the carrier discontinues any interstate passenge - train the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission could be invoked to determine whether the present or futuri' public com enience and necessity permitted such discontin - uance. STATK .IUKISDICTION Section 20 of Article IV of our Constitution provides: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law, but in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers ai d perform the duties enumerated in this pro - vision." I am unable to find any specific legislation relating to the discon - tinuance of intrastate passenger train service. The opinion of the nifajority assumes such jurisdiction from .Section 75-102 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes which provides: "It shall be the duty of all common carriers within the state to file with the State Railway Commission all freight and passenger schedules, classifications, rates, tariffs or charges used by such common carriers and in effect on January 1, 1 !i08. both state and interstate, and proportional charges." The above sectior does not relate to train schedules. It refers and pertains only to schedules of rates, tariffs and charges. Our author - ity to require an application to this Commission and an order au - thorizing the discontinuance of train service must be found else - where. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT The records of this Commission disclose that on April 8, 1908, an order was entered forbidding any "carrier operating local freight or passenger trains between stations in Nebraska to discontinue any such train and until application has been made (o the Commission and its permission had for that purpose." This was legislation by the Railway Commission and is just as valid as any enactment of the legislature upon the subject matter. The Constitution provides that in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall ex - ercise tbe powers and perform the duties enumerated in this pro - vision. It will be noted, however, that this Commission did not attempt to legislate as to trains operating in Interstate Commerce. The order was limited to passenger trains between stations in Ne - brnska. This order was before the Supreme Court of Nebraska In the case of State of Nebraska, ex rel O. S. Spillman vs. Chicago it X. W. Ry. Co., a corporation, 122 Neb. 176. The respondent had notified the Commission that on a date certain it would cease dally train service between certain points in the State and cease Sunday train service between other points in the state. The Commission made application for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the respondent to run the train because permission had not been grant - ed by the State Railway Commission to discontinue. The Court, in its opinion per curiam, said "The Court being of the opinion that the only question before it was with respect to the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission to make the order of April S, 1908. and being of the opinion that the Railway Commission possessed jurisdiction to make said order under the Constitution and Statute of this State and that respondent must obtain the permission of the Railway Commission in order to discontinue the service." The order was modified and the motion to vacate the peremptory order overruled. It will be noted that the Supreme Court did not base its decision upon any power or duty vested in the Commission by reason of Sec - tion 75-402 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes. The duty imposed upon the carriers, by Baid section, to file with the State Railway Com - misson "all freight and passenger schedules" has no application to train ' schedules. The order herein entered by the majority basing its jurisdiction on this section of the Statue becomes at once an ab - solute absurdity. The discontinuance of trains Nos. 121 and 122 insofar as such trains operate in the State of Nebraska would be a discontinuance of trains operating in interstate commerce. No statute of this State and no rule of this Commission requires application to be made </seg>
            <seg id="p088">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION to this Commission for the discontinuance of such trains. The applicant is not reqi ired to file any application with the Interstate Commerce Commission nor with this Commission to discontinue in - terstate passenger trains. The applicant may discontinue such trains without the permissi )n of either Commission. The order entered by the majority of this Commission is without any foundation of law or rule of this Commission and violates the Interstate Commerce Section of the Fed&lt; ral Constitution. This Commission is without jurisdiction and an order should have been entered dismissing the application! Respectfully submitted, (Signed) F. L. Bollen Commissioner FORMAL COMPLAINT 770. L. \V. Johnson and F. 3. Johnson, Co-partners, Grand Island, Ne - braska, doing business under the firm name and style of Johnson Cash-Way Lumber Company, and John E. Forsell Complainants, V3. Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defendant, MAUPIX. COMMISSIONER: Complainants it this case seek to show discrimination against them by the Union Pacific Railroad Company. The alleged discrim - ination is that defendant company seeks to enforce the terms of a contract similar to contracts made and entered into all like cases by the defendant company and lessees. Complainants, however, entered into a lease similar to the one in this case for a site on the defendant's -if;ht-of-way at Hastings, Nebraska. They must have been familiar with a specific term in that lease prohibiting the sale or transfer of the lease without the con - sent of the lessoi . Complainants purchased from a Referee in Bankruptcy the sto:k and equipment ot a bankrupt lumber company, and now endeavor to retain possession of the site under a lease issued to the bai krupt company, never having endeavored, by negotiations with a duly authorized agent of the defendant company, for the assign men' of the lease. On the contrary, it appears front* the evidence, that complainants sought to conceal all knowledge </seg>
            <seg id="p089">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT of their efforts to purchase the assets of the bankrupt company, until such time as they had completed their negotiations. Defendant shows that the lease, in the first instance, was made to a wholesale lumber company, defendant investing a considerable sum of money in improving the site so as to make it suitable for wholesale lumbering. After entering upon the site, the complainants began the business of retail lumbering. The defendant company, having prepared the site in question lor wholesale lumbering, seeks to obtain possession of the site so as to be able to lease it for its original purpose. With the strife between parties for a particular site, this Com - mission has nothing to do. ft is concerned only in seeing to it that the defendant company, does not discriminate between parties. The defendant company,; in this Commission's opinion, has the right to lease its premises to whomsoever it sees fit, being careful lo treat all alike. A railroad right-of-way is a railroad's private property. It can lease or refuse to lease as seems best for its own interest. But. In case it does lease to one on certain terms, it cannot refuse to lease 10 other or similar competitors upon the same basis. It is not shown by the complainants that the defendant refus - ed to lease to it upon equal terms, a suitable site for its business. It is merely sought to show that it will be discrimination to compel it to accept another and equally suitable site instead of the one it now occupies in distinct violation of the lease originally issued. It is further sought to show that the defendants will suffer financial loss by being compelled to accept another site. The evidence shows that the defendant had an opportunity to sell it at a distinct pro - fit, and refused. These matters, brought out in hearing, are of ab - solutely no concern to this Commission. Thus, viewing the matter at issue, this Commission is first concerned with its jurisdiction. Nowhere in the statutes, nor in the constitutional provisions governing the Commission, can be found authority for the Com - mission, to decide between contenders for a site upon a railroad right - of-way. Its only authority in the premises is to see to it that all parties are treated with equal consideration. In this case the com - plainants are offered a site equal in every way to the one they now seek to retain, and upon equal terms with their competitors. It is my opinion the Commission is without jurisdiction. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 1 1 is clear to thi s Commissioner that the complainants' recourse is to the courts, if :hey believe that they are being, or have . been damaged, this Comii ission having no authority to sit In judgment in damage cases. The testimony s lows that the complainants have been offered a site suitable to tl eir business, and practically adjoining the site now in dispute. Ttie only possible claim for discrimination laid by the complainants must be found in Section 74-702 of the Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, reading as follows: "If any railw: y company or common carrier, subject to the provisions of this article, through or by its officers agents or employees, makes or gives any undue or unreason - able preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm &lt;&gt;r corporation or locality, or subjects any particular description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice, delay or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever, the s;une shall constitute an unjust discrimination, which is hereby prohibited." Nothing in the evidence shows that the complainants have been subjected to any discrimination covered by this section of the statutes. They ha - e not been denied a suitable site; they have been subject only to the defendant railroad company's right to lease its property to whomsoever it sees fit, using its own prefer - ence between contenders for a single site, and obeying the law against discrimination as to charges for sites thus leased. The testimony shows that the complainants have been offered a site suitable to heir business, and practically adjoining the site now in dispute. There being no discrimination shown as to sites or suitable accommodations, this Commission is without authority 10 act. FINDINGS Tjlie Commission is without jurisdiction in this instance and the 'complaint must therefore be dismissed, leaving complainants and /defendant to settle their dispute in the proper court. (Signed) Will M, Maupin Commissioner DRAKE, CHAIRMAN, CONCURRING: The record in I his proceeding shows that the facts, in the main, were stipulated. One. Cousins Lumber Company, owned ( a lease </seg>
            <seg id="p091">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT on the premises in question. The assets of that company were sold under a court order. Complainants herein, thru an agent. bought the assest of the Cousins Lumber Company. This agent had instructions, in negotiation for the purchase, to not disclose the true purchaser. Complainants, tor some reason, did not dis - close to legal representative of Cousins Lumber Company, nor to defendent herein, an intention to purchase the assests,' and did not ascertain from defendant before the purchase, whether defendant would continue the lease on the premises to the complainants. Complainants are lessofs of defendant company on another tract of land at Hastings, Nebraska, and well knew the conditions of such lease. The record shows that complainants did purchase all the assets of the Cousins Lumber Company for $9,250.00, but re - fused to answer a direct question as to the market value of the assets although admitting that they have been offered a substantial profit for such assets after the sale, refusing to sell. It is my opinion that if (complainants have any legal right to an assignment of the Cousins Lumber Company lease, such right must be determined in a court of law, and the record shows that complainants have proceeded with such litigation. If the court, at the conclusion of such lawsuit, should hold with complainants. it is presumed that they would dismiss this complaint. If the court should hold against complainants, I cannot see how they -have any preferred claim, and if not a preferred claim, certainly discrimination cannot be claimed. It is my opinion that if com - plainants have any rights in the premises it must come from what - ever rights they purchased from Cousins Lumber Co., former les - see. If two applicants, neither claiming a special right, as claimed by one party in this cast, should apply to a carrrier for the same location, surely this Commission could not step into the tield of management and decide which should secure the lease. The Com - mission would not have, and does not have, any jurisdiction. Exhaustive briefs have been filed, but a study of them fails to disclose any arguments or decisions upon which this Commission could take jurisdiction in this case which would require an order to defendant to lease to jany certain tenant. The final "Memoran - dum Reply Brief" of complainants concludes with this: "So in the case at bar. The defendant is under no legal obligation to let any person or corporation operate a lumber yard on its right-of-way. It may tell the complainants and all their competitors to get off. But it may not discrimin - ate between the complainants and their competitors in the; matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION •'Either all must get off or all be allowed to stay, they beins similarly situated." I concur fully il this statement, but in this case there are not two applicants for the same location before this Commission. There is- only one applicant before this Commission, asking that we force! defendant to lease to him. A study of- the discrimination statute fails to d sclose any discrimination by defendant when they answer that t iey prefer to lease to some other tenant, admit - ting that -the&gt; have available and will lease to this complainant, an - other location whi :h. from a business and/or transportation stand - point, would be acceptable to other tenants engaged in a similar bus - iness. An appropriate order of dismissal of the complaint should be entered. ( (Signed) HUGH DRAKE Chairman. r BOLLEN. COMMISSIONER. DISSENTING: I am unable tc concur with majority on the final order. I can reach no conclusion other than the facts present a plain case ol discrimination pronibited by statute and which this Commision has jurisdiction to prt vent. FACTS The facts art- not in dispute. Complainants are engaged in re - tail lumber and coal business with lumber and coal sheds located on respondent's r ght-of-way at Grand Island. They are not tres - passers. They a re rightfully in possession under assignment of lease from receiv 3rs of predecessor company. Their lumber yard and coal sheds c&lt; institute facilities for receiving shipments of coal, lumber and othei building materials transported over respondent's railroad. They co a cash and carry business. The other dealers do not and it wo ild ajfpear from all of the evidence that the other dealers do not want complainants to have the present location or any other location. The Grand Island Chamber of Commerce claims to be interested in securing a wholesale lumber company and wants complainants oused from their present location to make room for a wholesale firm. Another nearby location is available and suit - able for wholesa' ing of lumber. I find nothing in the evidence to show that respondent has offered complainants another location on its right-of-v ay. They have been ordered by respondent to vacate the premises and respondent proposes to oust them, itf they do not. It woulci thus appear that an organized movement is under- </seg>
            <seg id="p093">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL, REPORT way between the other, lumber and coal dealers, the Chamber of Commerce, and respondent to oust complainants from their pre - sent location or any other location on respondent's right-of-way, and thus compel them to leave the city of Grand Island or to seek another location not on respondent's right-of-way, and where they would be unable to compete with other dealers more favorably located. There are six other firms located upon respondent's right - of-way at Grand Island engaged in the retail business of coal, lumber and other building material. There is nothing in the ev - idence to show that respondent has ordered them to vacate. With the lease, validity of assignment, and respondent's elect - ion to terminate, we have no concern. The sole issue before us is discrimination. First, do the acts complained of constitute dis - crimination against complainants and in favor of six other retail lumber and coal dealers now located on respondent's right-of-way at Grand Island? It is the duty of railroads to furnish equal ter - minal facilities to all and without any discrimination for receiving and forwarding all commodities transported over their rails. They cannot furnish facilities to one and deny the same to another similarly situated. If a railroad does not own such facilities and in lieu thereof leases part of its right-of-way to one person for the purpose of erecting facilities of a permanent nature, it seems to me that it logically follows that it must lease another tract to another person engaged in the same business to the extent of its available right-of-way, and without discrimination. There is little if any dispute, that a railroad may refuse all persons the use of its right-of-way for the purpose of erecting terminal facilities, pro - viding it maintains proper facilities of its own. There can be no dispute that a railroad may lease its right-of-way to one person for a purpose not incidental to its function as a common carrier and refuse to lease to another person another part for the same purpose. See Luedeke v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 120 Neb. 124, Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Nebraska, 164 U. S. 400, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 195 U. S. 540. Delaware. L. &amp; W. R. Co. v. Town of Morriston 276 U. S. 182. The facts in this case do not present an exception to the above rule. The facts call for the application of another rule. Complain - ants are using respondent's right-of-way for a purpose incidental to, its function as a common carrier. Complainants ship their coal, lumber and other building material over respondent's railroad. The fact that complainants are using right-of-way for other pur - poses is immaterial. Seven firms are now using respondent's right-of-way at Grand Island for the same purpose. Respondent </seg>
            <seg id="p094">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION » orders one to vacate and allows the others to remain. This is dis - crimination. Second, do the acts complained of constitute discrimination against complainants and in favor of a person or firm who wants the same location jr a wholesale lumber business. A wholesale dealer would on acco int of the nature of its business, use respondent's railroad for incoming and outgoing shipments and would give re - spondent a greater" evenue than a retail dealer. If both were out of possession and without any investment in buildings, there could be no question abo it respondents right to choose between them. The facts present a case of the rights of two persons demanding the same seat in a passenger train where one is in possession with no empty seats. Similar would be a case where two shippers want - ed the same box cir and no other car available and one was in possession with the car loaded with wheat and ready for shipment.. Could a conductor jrder the passenger in possession to vacate the seat for a more favored passenger, or the station agent order the shipper in possession to unload his wheat and vacate the car for a more favored shiiper, without discriminating in each case against the one in possessic n of the facility and in favor of the one out of possession? In the instant case another tract suitable in every way for :i wholesale lumber business is available and the facts present a more flagrant case of discrimination than the two examples, supra JURISDICTION In support of jurisdiction the complainants rely upon Section 75-70::; 74-5(11; 7 i-201 ; 75-215 of 1929 Compiled Statutes, and .Section 20 of Arti :le 4 of the Constitution of Nebraska. The re - spondent in opposi ion to the same relies chiefly upon the case of Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Nebraska, 164 U. S. 403. A careful read - ing of this case prompts me to say that this case supports the con - tention of complainants rather than the contention of the respond - ent. Ttr facts in the case present a situation where a group of farmers .' tiled a complaint before this Commission for an order directing the Missouri Pacific R. Co. to lease them a location for an elevator on th :ir right-of-way at Elmwood for the purpose of storing their own grain. It appears no where in their complaint that tiny intended to purchase grain from the public generally for the purpose of shipping the same over the respondent's railroad. The Supreme Court of the United States decided the case upon the allegations of the complaint and the facts before it. That court rightfully Slid: </seg>
            <seg id="p095">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT "To require the Railroad Company to grant to the petit - ioners a location on its right-of way, for the erection of an elevator for the specified purpose of storing from time to time the grain of the petitioners and of neighboring farm - ers, is to compel the Railroad Company, against its will, to transfer an estate in part of the land which it holds under its charter as its private property and for a public use to an association of private individuals for the purpose of erect - ing and maintaining a building thereon for storing grain for their own benefit.** This court, confining itself to what is necessary for the decision of the case' before it, is u - nanimously of the opinion that the order in question, inso - far as it required the Railroad corporation to surrender a part of its land^to the petitioner for the purpose of build - ing and maintaining an elevator upon it, was, in essence and effect, a taking of private property of the Railroad corporation, for the private use of the petitioners**" and is a violation of the 14th article of amendment of the Con - stitution of the United States." It appears to me that the above case clearly draws the line of de - marcation when a railroad may be required to grant the use of its right-of-way for the purpose of the erection of building thereon. The use of the same must be for the purpose of erect - ing terminal facilities for handling incoming and outgoing ship - ments over its rails. If the purpose of sucli use is for the erection of buildings not to be used for terminal facilities In handling in - coming and outgoing shipments the railroads may deny or grant the use of the same at its own pleasure or it may grant the same to one and refuse to grant it to another without discriminating against the one and in favor of the other The respondent relies upon the case of the Western Union Telegraph Company v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 19;"&gt; V. S. 540. In my opinion this case likewise supports the contention of complain - ants. This was an action Cor an injunction to prevent the rail - road from removing complainant's telegraph lines from the re - spondent's right-of-way. It is clear that telegraph poles on a railroad right-of-way has no relationship to the railroads function as a common carrier,' they are not terminal facilities for the purpose of handling incoming or outgoing shipments. The use of a railroad's right-of-way for this purpose would be similiar to using the same for the erection of an elevator for the storage of grain and is one of those cases where a railroad may grant or refuse or grant to one and refuse to another. </seg>
            <seg id="p096">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The case of D( novan v. Pennsylvania R. Co.. 199 U. S. 279 also supports the complainant's contention. This case involves the right of a railroad company to grant an exclusive right to a trans - fer company to fi rnish at its passenger station all the vehicles necessary for the accommodation of the passengers arriving on its trains. This case has no -connection with the railroad's duties or functions as a :ommon carrier and the court rightly held that the railroad comi any could legally refuse their depot grounds to all other hack or cab men for the purpose of soliciting the customs or patron; .ge of passengers. Respondent also cites the case of Delaware L &amp; W R. Co. v. Town ot Morristoi , 276 U. S. 182. This was a case where the railroads had m;id a contract with an operator of taxicabs which granted the exclusive privilege of a taxicab stand on its railroad grounds. An ordinance of the Town of Morriston sought to es - tablish a public hick stand on the railroad right-of-way. Again the court rightfully held that a taxicab stand had no relationship with the railroad company's fuctions as a common carrier and that it was within the discretion of the railroad to grant such privilege to ojie person and to refuse to grant the same to another. CONCLUSION In this cane tie tract of land now used by the complainants is a terminal facility for the handling of incoming shipments over the respondent's railroad and that respondent can not lawfully' grant the use of its right-of-way to six otner persons en- L-;i l;im1 in the sam ) line of business and refuse to grant the same to the complainant. Nor can it oust the complainant now in pos - session of the said tract and grant the use of the same to another. In either case it constitutes discrimination against the complain - ant and in favor of the six retail dealers and the one wholesale dealer. It is a discrimination prohibited by our statute and which this Commission lias jurisdiction to prevent. An order should be entered commanding the respondent to cease and desist from dis - crimination, favoritism or partiality against the- complainants and each of them and in favor of the six retail dealers and the whole - sale dealer now t esiring the use of said premises.

The cases under consideration on this appeal were tried to - gether in the court below and briefed and argued together in this court. The judgments appealed from are identical in form except as to the amounts. Each of the plaintiffs filed claims before the state railway commission to recover back certain freight charges which it had paid, but which it now claims were excessive. The state railway commission ordered a refund of the excessive amount which the company failed to pay. Plaintiffs then filed .suit in the district court to enforce payment of the claims and recovered judg - ments for the amounts thereof. The defendant prosecutes these ap - peals from each of the judgments entered. It is not disputed in the evidence that an overcharge was made in the hauling of gravel for each of the appellees, due to the fact that the mileage from the gravel pits to the points of destination was incorrectly figured. It is the contention of the defendant that these cases were filed under the reparations statute, the same being sections 75 — 510 to 75 — 512, inclusive. Comp. St. l!»2fl. and that appellees are limited to the remedies provided therein. The state railway commission was created by constitutional amendment in 1906. Const, art. IV, sec. 20. The powers of the commission were defined by legislative act. pursuant to the consti - tutional provision, in 1907. Laws 1907, ch. 90. This act. which we will hereafter designate as the act of 1907. contained, in part, the following provisions: "The commission shall have the power. and it shall be its duty to make all necessary classifications and to fix all necessary rates, charges and regulations to govern and re - gulate the freight and passenger tariffs of railway companies and common carriers, the power to correct abuses ana prevent unjust discriminations, extortions and overcharges in rates of freight and passenger tariffs on the different railroads in this state, and to en - force the same by having the penalties inflicted as herein after pro - vided, through proper courts having jurisdiction." Comp. St. 1929. </seg>
            <seg id="p100">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION sec. 7 5—203. It will be noted that the only method of enforce - ment directly expressei in this act was by the infliction of pen - alties. The act did g.ve authority to the railway commission "to correct abuses and prevent unjust discriminations, extortions and overcharges.'" This provision authorizes the railway commission to make awards in proper cases. To hold otherwise would defeat the very purpose of the act as therein expressed. There was no ex - press provision in the act granting the shipper the right to sue in the courts to recover overcharges which might be awarded by the railway commission. It can hardly be a -gued that enforcement . of the act by the in - fliction of penalties ui on the offending railroad would in any man - ner recompense the shipper for the wrong he has suffered. There is no question that an action existed at common law for the recov - ery of overcharges ex: cted by a railroad company. In Tift v. Southeri R. Co., 123 Fed. 789. the court said: "The difference in the obligation of a common carrier and that of a private individual is t lat the former has undertaken a, duty to the public. Having undertaken that duty, it was settled by the com - mon law that the common carrier must carry for all, to the ex - tent of his capacity, \dthout unjust or unreasonable discrimination •rithf-r in charges or n the facilities for actual transportation." In Sullivan v. Min leapolis &amp; R. R. R. Co., 121 Minn. 488, the ian,B proposition was announced in the following language: "The modern common law imposes upon common carriers the duty of equal - ity in freight rates to all shippers similarly circumstanced, for the transportation of the same class of goods the same distance; and our statutes prohibiti: g such discrimination are declaratory of the common-law rule". We therefore conclude that immediately following the passage of the act of 1907. heretofore referred to, the common-law action was still available. The s Upper's common-law right of action for dam - ages for a discrimination of overcharge in rates is not taken away by our rate-regulating statutes which provide penalties only for their enforcement and furnish no civil remedy to the shipper there - fbr. Sullivan v. Minneapolis &amp; R. R. R. Co., supra. The measure of re - covery under the exis .ing common-law rule would be the difference in the rate charged i ml the rate fixed by the railway commission, if one had been fixed. In other words, the statutes regulating rates are in derogation o: the common law to the extent that the shipper in his suit fur damages is bound by the rates established </seg>
            <seg id="p101">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT by the commission and could not establish the reasonableness of the rate by evidence, as was the case under the common-law rule. However, the legislature later passed chapter 229, Laws 1921, commonly called the reparations act, now sections 75-510 to 75 - 512, inclusive, Comp. St. 1929, which we will hereafter refer to as the 1921 statute This act provides as follows: "That if. after hear - ing on a complaint under sections 6126, 6127, 6128, 6129 or sec - tions 6137, 6138, 6139, 6140, Revised Statutes or Nebraska for 1913, the Nebraska state railway commission shall determine that any party complainant has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said com - plaint paid unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defend - ant railroad or express company in this state on intrastate traffic or has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint suffered dam - ages by reason of the maintaining, publishing, demanding, charging, receiving or retaining by such carrier of any rate or rates, charges, rules, regulations, services or practices on intrastate traffic which are found by the commission to be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential or otherwise unlawful, the com - mission shall make an order directing the railroad or express comp - any to pay to the complainant the sum 1 to which he is entitled oh or before a day named." Comi&gt;- St. 1029, sec. 75 — 510. The sections of the statute referred to in the above quotation provide for the filing of complaints before the railway commission to determine the reasonableness or unreasonableness or rates, charges and regulations to regulate and govern the freight and passenger tariffs of railway companies or common carriers. The 1021 statute grants to the railway commission the additional power to grant re - parations where the lawful and existing rate is retroactively set aside. The statute is plain that a claim must be filed within two years, where it arises by virtue of the retroactively setting aside of a lawful and existing rate, in order to confer jurisdiction on tin - railway commission to make an award . thereon. The two-year period is not a statute limitation but an express limitation upon the jurisdiction of the railway commission in such cases. The limita - tion is a limitation of the right as well as the remedy and, unless the party seeking relief under the new remedy therein granted places him - self strictly with the limitations, he has no cause of action. This was so held in the case of City of South Omaha v. McUavock, 72 Neb. 382, the court saying: "Where a statute grants a new remedy, and at the same time places a limitation of time within which the person complaining must act, the limitation is a limitation of the right as well as of the remedy, and, in the absentee of qualifying provisions </seg>
            <seg id="p102">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION or saving clauses, the pirty seeking to avail himself of the remedy must bring himself str ctly within the limitations." The ■ remedy provided in such cases is cumulative in nature ana grants an ad - ditional right to the shi jper. It cannot, however, in tne absence of a legislative intent thert in expressed, change the effect of the prior statutes governing other classes of claims. We conclude, therefore, that the railway commission has the power to make awards under both the l!&gt;07 and the 1921 statutes. The appellees contend that, the appellant having failed to ap - peal, the award of the railway commision is final. To this we can - not agree. In the making of every award there is necessarily a de - termination of a rate i lvolved and the assessment of the damages based on that rate. Tie determination of the rate is, under our law, u legislative functicn possessed by the railway commission. The courts do not have the power to act in a legislative manner to per - form this function. N» cessarily, therefore, the fixing or establish - ing of a rate by the railway commission has the force of a statute .on the subject. On the other hand, the finding of the railway com - mission that the shipper has suffered a damage, and the determin - ation of the amount hereof, are judicial in their nature. This part of the finding is confined to a prima facie status and is merely a rebuttable presumption. Comp. St. 1929, sec. 75-507. The case at bar th ;refore involves the application of an estab - lished rate to an admit :ed mileage. The 1921 statute, and the two - year limitation therein, can have no application. The question of Krantinu reparations, ivhere an existing rate is retroactively set ' aside, is not in this case. That statute is cumulative in its nature and as a result can tak &gt; nothing from the rights of the parties exist- ' ing prior to its passage, in the absence of a legislative intent ex - pressed therein to so do. We therefore conch de that appellees have the right to maintain a common-law action to recover back the overcharges made in the case at bar. The action having been commenced within five years from its accrual, the statute of limitations is no defense. Tht- only question remaining is whether the evidence was suf - ficient to sustain the , udgment. The record shows that the trans - cript of the proceedings of the railway commission was received in evidence without objec:ion. In addition thereto, appellant admitted in each case the date &gt;f shipment, the car number and initials, the weight of the shipmei t, the rate charged and the amount of the charges made, each (if which admissions is shown In the record. The legal existing rate fixed by the commission having been offered </seg>

By Sections 60-101 to 60-105 of 1929 Complied Statutes, the 1927 Legislature enacted specific legislation relating to motor buses In interurban operation. The Commission was vested with general control except as to rates and fares to be charged. By Sections 60-201 to 60-204 of 1929 Compiled Statutes, the 1929 Legislature enacted specific legislation relating to taxicabs, and defining taxicabs as motor vehicles fitted with a taxi - meter and equipped to carry not exceeding seven passengers. The jur - isdiction of the Commission was limited to liability insurance, surety bonds and salable securities for the protection of the public. The. above covers all specific legislation by the Legislature relating to the jurisdiction of the Commission over common carriers of passengers for hire by motor vehicles. The several acts of the Legislature did not include control over motor buses opevatlng between fixed terminals and upon fixed sche - dules within the limits of cities and towns and not in. connection with a street car system. They did not include motor vehicles not fitted with taximeters, not equipped to carry not to exceed seven passengers, and not operating between fixed terminals upon fixed schedules. During the summer of 1935, there developed a public demand for these forms of motor transportation of passengers. Un - der our constitutional powers we adopted Resolution No. 137 on July 3, 1985. directing interested parties to show cause on or before July 10th, 1 J! 3 5 , why the Commission should not assume full and complete jurisdiction over all forms of motor transportation of pas - sengers for hire. No interested party appeared to make objections, and on August 27, 1935, we entered an order in Resolution No. 137 assuming such jurisdiction and prescribing rules and regulations. The resolution and order is published in this 1935 Annual Report.

Ii 1935, all surrounding states and with but few exceptions, all states iad such regulation. The increasing amount of freight carried by trucks and the decreasing amount carried by ■ • ■ railroads had become a natter of general concern. In 1935, 93% of all hogs and 51% of all livestock shipped to the Omaha market were delivered by trucks. | Motor transportation had -come to stay and regulation could not loni;er be postponed.

The Federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935, vested the state commissions with co-operative jurisdiction. To meet the requirements of the Federal Act and the growing demand within the state for truck regulation, it appeared mandatory that the Commission should assume jurisdiction to the extent of the powers vested in us by the Con - stitution. On August 27, 1935, the Commission approved and adopted Re - solution No. 138, in the matter of jurisdiction over motor vehicles for hire in connection with the transportation of commodities and by which we proposed to assume jurisdiction vested in us by the Consti - tution to regulate rates, service and general control of common car - riers of property for hire by motor vehicles upon the highways of Nebraska. A hearing was held on September 25, 1935 and between 300 and 400 truckers were present. Nearly all present indicated their desire that the Commission should at once assume jurisdiction and proceed to prescribe rules and regulations. Before taking further action, the Governor announced his inten - tion of calling the Legislature in special session. The Commission, in company with a committee of truckers, called upon the Governor and requested that he include truck regulation as a part of the pro - gram of the special session. It was necessary that our constitutional jurisdiction be supplemented by sufficient legislative enactment to make our regulation effective. We needed an appropriation or the; power to charge and collect fees to support our regulation activities. We needed jurisdiction over forms of motor transportation of property for hire, other than common carriers. The Governor did not include truck regulation in his call for the special session and no further action was taken by the Commission during the year of 1935.

STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION: 1 The Nebraska State Railway Commission, herein afterwards re - ferred to as the Commission, on its own motion did on the 3rd day of July, 1935, adopt anc concur in this Resolution No. 137. Briefly this resolution deals -v 1th this Commission's power to prescribe certain rules and regulations governing common carriers of passen - gers for hire, by motor rehicle, in the state of Nebraska, and further sets forth an order to siow cause why the said power should not be exercised. The aforesaii resolution is hereby referred to and made a part hereof as though | written herein. ■ General notice of tie above mentioned resolution and order to show cause having bee i given to all common carriers of passen - gers for hire, of which this Commission had knowledge, the matter came on for hearing in the offices of the Commission in the Capitol Building in Lincoln, Nejraska, on the 10th day of July, 1935. At* that time appearances ware entered by various interested parties. At the time of said tearing no objections were offered as to the Commission's jurisdictioi over the subject matter, or as to its power to make such rules and egulations as it saw fit. "While those present, it the hearing were but few in number, and no representatives of th s bus industry were present, still the Com - mission feels that since"; dequate notice had been given to all parties, the mere fact that no one appeared to offer objection, indicated all transportation agen lies of passengers were perfectly willing ' that the Commission prepare such rules and regulations as it deem - ed adequate and necessary to properly cover the subjects set forth in its resolution. j MOTOR TB ANSPORTATION COMPANIES What constitutes a motor transportation company as such and the necessary qualifications that must be met in order 'to become </seg>
            <seg id="p173">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT one, are all fully set forth in Section 60-101, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929. At this time the Commission will in no wise at - tempt to change these definitions or qualifications. Pursuant to and in conformity with Sections 60-101 to Sections 60-105, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, the Commission has prescribed and set forth various rules and regulations governing the operations of motor transportation companies in this state. These rules and regulations are contained in the Commission's Res - olution No. 102 and its supplements. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that this last named resolution and its supple - ments should continue in full force and effect unless the rules set forth herein are to the contrary, in which event the rules herein prescribed will supersede those now in effect. After full consideration of all matters pertaining to the oper - ation of motor transportation companies in Nebraska the Commiss - ion is of the opinion and so finds that its present rules and regula - tions governing the operation of such companies in this state should be modified and extended to include rules and regulations requir - ing those engaged in operating as motor transportation companies, as defined by statute, to make a definite showing of public con - venience and necessity before being given permission to operate. Such rules and regulations will therefore be fully set forth in the order herein. The Commission is of the further opinion and so finds that those now operating as motor transportation companies, as defined by statute, should be granted permission to continue their present op - erations, upon the condition that they make proper application to the Commission. The complete requirements of such application will be fully set forth in the order herein. TAXICAB COMPANIES Section 60-201, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, fully de - fines, and sets forth the qualifications of a "taxicab". The other sections of the statute impose on this Commission certain duties relative to the prescription of rules and regulations governing the operation of said taxicabs in this state. Pursuant to and in conformity with the above mentioned sections of the statute this Commission passed its Resolution No. 110 and various supplements thereto, which Resolution and supplements are now and for some time past have been in full force and effect. At this time it is the opinion of the Commission that the Resolution and supplements next above referred to should continue in effect. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Such rules and regulations as may be hereinafter prescribed in this order are to be considered additional to those now in force. After a careful co isideration of the operation of taxicabs in the state of Nebraska, (he Commission is of the opinion and so finds that at the present t: me considerable competition exists between taxicab operators in ra any of the towns of the state. While the old adage "Competition is the life of trade" may still be acceptable as applied in private industry, still today it is the general concensus of opinion of both the courts and regulatory bodies, that unbridled competition between pi blic utilities is not only .harmful to the in - dustries themself but also in the end generally enures to the de - triment of the general public as well. It being true there lore that at the present time there is keen competition between Uxicab operators in many of the cities and towns of the state, this Commission is of the further opinion and so finds that operators of taxicabs, as defined by statute, in the state of Nebraska, be required to obtain from this Commission a permit to engage in this type of motor transportation for hire, the said permit to be grarted only upon a definite showing of public convenience and necessity. The conditions, qualifications and cir - cumstances precedent to the granting of such permits, will there - fore be fully set forth in the order herein. The Commission is further of the opinion and so finds that all persons now engaged ii the business of operating taxicabs, as de - fined by statute, in cilies other than Omaha, should automatically be given permission t&gt; continue their present taxicab operations without the necessity cf making a definite showing of public con - venience and necessity. The said permission to be granted only after proper application has been made to this Commission. The requirements for permission to continue present taxicab operations will be fully set forth n the order herein.

Motor vehicles operated for the common carriage of passengers as provided in Sections 60-201 and following, and conforming to the definition of taxicabs as therein expressed, except where same are not equipped with taxi - meters. In prescribing rules and regulations governing these last two groups of common carriers, the Commission is invading a field that has not previously -been covered by any of its regulations. For this reason the regulations that will be prescribed in this order must of necessity be more detailed than those regulations to be prescribed for motor transportation companies and taxicab operators. Heretofore this Commission has not prescribed rules and reg - ulations governing the operations of motor busses operating over a fixed route and between fixed termini of the incorporated town or village or within a three (3) mile radius thereof because it was felt that there was little need'f&amp;V such type of regulation. Within receut years, however, this type of motor transportation has been increasing and it is now believed that In order to adequately pro - tect the public this class of carrier should be regulated and to that end proper regulations should be passed. The question of this Commission's jurisdiction over this type of motor carrier need not be herein discussed. The Supreme Court of the state of Nebraska has several times ruled that in the absence of specific legislation on the control of common rarriirs this Com - mission has the power to make such regulations as it deems necr essary. No such specific legislation has been enacted and therefore this Commission has the power and right to legislate on this ques - tion. It is the intention of this Commission that the term "motor bus' 1 as used in this part of its order, shall be construed to mean "any motor vehicle operated between fixed termini or over a fixed route of any incorporated town or village or within a three (3i mile radius thereof regardless of size". This will include motor vehicles now being operated as so-called "jitneys". The concensus of opinion of this Commission is that in order to adequately piotect the interests of the public the class of motor carrier being here discussed should be regulated first by being re - quired to obtain a permit based on a showing of necessity and con - venience before being allowed to begin operations and second defin - ite insurance requirements should be prescribed. </seg>
            <seg id="p176">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In connection with permits based on a showing of public con - venience and necessity, we will therefore, in our order herein, fully set forth in the ( uali ications and conditions that must be met before such permits wll'be granted. However; in the granting of such permit it is the wish of this Commission to cooperate with the various city counc \s and town boards, and such regulations, as may be prescribed, will provide that applications for permission to op - erate this type of mo to." vehicle transportation shall be attached there - to an affidavit showing that the proposed bus operations have received the approval of the city council or town board in which they are to bo conducted. By making this requirement, however, the Com - mission in no wise intends to delegate any power it may have rel - ative \o th&lt;: certificates of convenience and necessity. AVith this thought. in irind, therefore, the Commission will therefore reserve the. right to jrant such certificates even though the same may not receive the a &gt;proval of the city council or town hoard. This Commission i; of the further, opinion and so finds that none of the regulations to be prescribed herein shall apply to any bus line operated as a part of any street railway system. Motor vehicles ope 'ated for the common carriage of passengers as provided in Section 60.-201 and following, and conforming to the definition of taxicabs ;.s therein expressed, where not equipped with taximeters as .mention! d in Resolution No. 137, and the regulations pertaining to this clas : of common carrier by motor vehicle will bo but briefly discussed. The operations of this last mentioned type of common carrier is practically identical with that of a taxicab. " The only difference - being that a taxicab is equipped with a taximeter, whereas these carriers are not. Because of the fact that the operations of theso carriers so nearly ap &gt;roxiniate those of taxicabs this Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the operation of both carriers should be governed by the same rules and regulations. With this thought in mind then any rule or regulation prescribed in the order herein applying to ta?icabs will be made to apply equally to motor vehicles operated for the common carriage of passengers as pro - vided in Sections 60-2(1 and following, and conforming to the defini - tion of taxicabs as therein expressed, except when riot equipped with taximeters. The Commission is of the further opinion .and so finds that the rules and regulations now contained in its Resolution No. 110 and supplements should b&lt; made to apply to the type of motor carrier last above mentioned. An appropriate order to this effect will be entered herein. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT We do not believe it advisable to at this time attempt to reg - ulate the rates of any common carriers by motor vehicle and this matter will therefore not be discussed. The Commission is of the further opinion and so finds that in order to properly protect the interests of the public this order should be made effective as soon . as practicable.

CHAIRMAN: OPINION AND FINDINGS This matter arises upon the application of the Dawson County Irrigation Company, a corporation, owning and operating a common carrier irrigation system in Dawson County. Nebraska. Applicant states that it is and has been carrying water for -hire from its head - gates near Cozad, Nebraska, to water users located below its canals. Rates for such carriage, heretofore approved by this Commission, are $1.50 per acre per year to users holding "paid water rights", $2.00 per year for spring and fall water, and $3.00 per year for annual water to users not holding "paid water rights." Applicant has been carrying water, if and when available, from the Platte River to these users who have held appropriation rights dating back to as far as 1894, but the record shows that during most of the irrigation periods in the past few years there has been very little, if any, water in the river. Applicant now shows that there has been perfected a storage company for the purpose of taking flood and surplus waters from this river at a point near Keystone, Nebraska, storing the same in^ large canals and reservoirs, and sending it back to the river near North Platte, Nebraska, during the "dry" months of July and August. This storage company is the Platte Valley Public Power Company. commonly known as the "Sutherland Project", and herein will be de - signated as the "District". This District was financed with federal monies, which contemplated this storage water would be used for both power and irrigation purposes, and one condition to the securing of the said monies was for the District to obtain contracts from irriga - tion water companies or users, in the sum of $100,000 per year. The applicant company entered into a contract with the District for part of this water, which contract calls for 50,000 acre feet of water at an annual price of $50,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Applicant alleges that the only method it has of reimbursing itself tor this annual cha -ge of $50,000, is to pass the same along to the users of water who (an he supplied from their ditch. The origi - nal and later appropria ions of water to the land which can be served by this ditch include over 100,000 acres, all of which are not "irrigable" acres, and t ie maximum number of acres which have been suplied in any one year has been about 30,000 acres. At var - ious times in the past applicant has sold to some of these landowners what has been called "neater rights". This term "water rights" is a misnomer. It is not a water right. The owner of the land is en - titled to the use of whativer water has been appropriated to the land, as long as statutory requirements have been met and a carrier is able anil willing to can y the water. In the formation and organ - ization of irrigation so ■npanies, a common plan has been one of selling these so-called water rights to landowners at a figure rang - ing from $5.00 to $25.00 per acre. This money was paid to the ditch company merely for the purpose of raising the necessary funds for completion o • extension of the project, and which then gave such owner an im erest which entitled him to a first right for water, and in most case 3, resulted in a lower maintenance cost figure per year. This term "water right" is in fact nothing but a con - tinuing right of contract between the landowner and the ditch company for the prior vater service at the least annual maintenance cost. In the present set-up there are about 6,800 acres holding these water rights, ar d under the schedule of rates the annual maintenance charge f&lt; r these acres is $1.50 per year. To the water users w.ho do n &gt;t hold these water rights, the company has been furnishing annu: 1 water at the rate of $3.00 per year or $2.00 for either sprin ? or fall water. The company now proposes, in order to secure the necessary - funds with which to pay this additional annual charge of $50,000, to offer to deliver this 50,000 acre feet of storage water under certain conditions. Tjhe company recognizes the present schedule of rates and the present water right contracts for delivery of the natural flow water of the river, and does not propose to change them. It. does propose to offer to a landowner holding, at the present time a water right, this storage water, if and when deliver - ed to it at its headgates in sufficient quantity to provide for all users who hereafter enter into new contracts, to them upon the following conditions, to-wit: That each said landowner shall pur - chase an additional \ rater right from the company for one-.half of the irrigable acres on each quarter section unit of land owned by the landowner, at tliii present price of $12.50 per acre, payable in ten equal annual payments, with a discount of 1 0 r / r for cash, un- </seg>
            <seg id="p191">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT til March 1st, 1935, after which time this charge shall be $15.00 per acre under the same conditions. With this new contract is of - fered the right of such landowner of natural flow and storage water to other lands at the same rate. Applicant offers further to own - ers of land, not holding water rights at the present time, that it will not deliver either storage water or natural flow water unless such landowner applies and contracts for water rights for at least one-half of the irrigable land on each quarter section unit. These proposed plans, which might better be termed rules and regulations of the company, are submitted to this Commission for its approv - al, and the reasonableness of such plans, rules and regulations is the issue presented herein. The first question presented to the Commission is the question of jurisdiction thereover, and. in the determination of such, sev - eral things must be considered. Our attention is called to the Con - stitution of Nebraska which states in Article XV, as follows: "Sec. 4. The necessity of water for domestic use and for irrigation purposes in the State of Nebraska is hereby declared to be a natural want. "Sec. 5. The use of the water of every natural stream within the state of Nebraska is hereby dedicated to the people of the state for beneficial purposes, subject to the provisions of the following section. "Sec. 6. The right to divert unappropriated waters of every natural stream for beneficial, use shall never be denied except when such denial is demanded by the public interest. Priority of appropriation shall give the better right as between those using the water for the same purpose, but when the waters of any natural stream are not sufficient for the use of all those desiring to use the same, those using the water for domestic purposes shall have preference over those claiming it for any other purpose, and those using the water for agricul - tural purposes shall have the preference over those using the same for manufacturing purposes. Provided, no inferior right to the use of the waters of this state shall be acquired by a superior right without just compensation therefor to the in - ferior user. "Sec. 7. The use of the waters of the state for power purposes shall be deemed a public use and shall never bo alienated, but may be leased or otherwise developed as by law prescribed." A proper interpretation of the above sections leads us to the conclusion that this water belongs to the people, and that no in - terest in such water can be attached by either the District or the irrigation company, and that they can and must either store or carry it for and to the landowners to whom it has been appropriat - ed by the state acording to the provisions of the statute relating to </seg>
            <seg id="p192">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION priorities of appropriate ns, and in accordance with the statutes and rules and regulation; of the Department of Irrigation. Mr. It. H. Willis, Chief of the Department of Irrigation for the State of Nebraska, t :stified in this case that the District above referred to holds an ap iropriation of water from the Platte River near Keystone, Nebrask i, for 3torage and power purposes dated in February of 1033. Ft r the purposes of this record, we are not in - terested in the appropri Uions for power purposes, except that any appropriation of this witer for either power of storage purposes carries with it the rig: it to store waters from the Platte River during non-irrigation seison (October 1st to April 1st), and dur - ing the balance of the year only providing any waters are avail - able from the river which are not requested for the use of irriga - tion on lanils carrying recognized appropriation water rights prior to the date of the appropriation to the District, and this record shows that appropriation righ s of the land under the Dawson County ditch date many years i rior to the appropriation of the District. A study of the Constitutioial provisions and interpretation of the sta - tutes by .Mr. Willis then leads us to this conclusion: That the District has the right to store 01 ly the non-irrigation season water, plus flood and -surplus waters not required by prior appropriation holders; that thi,s water does not belong to the District, but is only held in storage for the use of either po ver or irrigation, and must be delivered back to the river under directions of the Department of Irrigation, and in accordance with its regulations. For the services rendered by the District in such storage a charge can be made, and in this instance the record shows that a preliminary or temporary charge is being made of ?100,000 per -ear for the storage of 100,000 acre feet, o£ which this applicant company has now contracted for 50,000 acre foot. The Constitution pr ividing that this water belongs to the people and that no right other than the use of the same can be attached by anybody, prohibits this water from becoming a commodity. If it were not for the Cons itutional inhibition, it is quite probable that this water would become a commodity, if and when it was taken from the rivet- at a time wh€n not called for under any appropriation right. This fact, plus the sta utory provision as follows: "Irrigation works constructed under the laws of this state are hereby declared to be common carriers. The owner or operator of any works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irrigation districts, shall deliver all water legally appropriated to the parties entitled thereto, at a reasonable rate, to be fixed by the State Railway Commission." (Sec. 46-627, C. S. Nebr. 1929.) </seg>
            <seg id="p193">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT now leads us to the conclusion that this Commission does have jurisdiction in this case. Applicant alleges that the proposed rules and regulations are reasonably required in order to provide sufficient monies to pay its necessary running expenses and fixed charges, plus this additional expense item of $50,000 per year for storage water, and offers for the consideration of the Commission its financial statements and an - nual reports covering its revenues and expenses for a numUfer of years.

            <seg id="p195">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT The record further shows an appraisal figure as of January l. 1927 of f267.738.73 (present value) with additions and betterments up to and including 1931, added to make a total of $446, 408. G2. The reason for the large increase is due to some major extensions of main canals during those years to take care of 1928 water ap - propriated acres. Under former applications this Commission has approved securities for the company in the amount of $195,000. These securities were divided in common stock in the amount of $120, 000. 0» and 7% bonds in the amount of $75,000.00. The record shows the net earnings of the company after all charges, are: 1930, a deficit of $7,031.98; 1931. a deficit of $5,365.75; 1932, a deficit of $4,675.36; 1933, net income of $104.30; and 1934, deficit of $2,834.80. Gross income dropped from $28,911.45 in 1930 to $17,107.20 in 1934. i Direct operating expenses declined from $27. nil. 79 in 1930 to $19,942.08 in 1934. Operating expenses have been cut drastically' as the company's income has declined. No dividends have been paid on the common stock since the year 1929. The record shows that the company issued, in 1934, additional common stock in. amount of $20,000.00 in order to have sufficient cash in the treasury to, meet its current expenses. This stock was purchased by the directors of the company. The average annual expenses of the company, excluding depreci - ation, for the last five years, has been $27,364.38, and the revenues have been insufficient to provide any reasonable return. Revenues can come only from the annual maintenance fees plus the charges for seasonal water. It is therefore evident that the company must be permitted. to increase its revenues if it meets tho new additional expense item of $50,000 per year. The company alleges that if it can secure permanent water contracts with at least 40,000 acres, that it then has an assured income of $60,000 per year - using as a basis present maintenance charge of $1.50 per acre per year - und that it probably can sell additional services to acres not under contract. for sufficient revenues to put the company on a sound financial ba - sis. To all of this, the Commission must conclude that the plan is not unreasonable. Objections have been raised as to the reasonableness of the $12.50 and $15.00 per acre figure for the water rights. At the present time the prepayment cost would be 90% of $12.50 which is $11.25 per acre. Assuming that not all acres would be contracted at present and the company should contract 30,000 acres at an average of $12. on. the result would bring $360,000 into its treasury. This will not </seg>
            <seg id="p196">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION happen, becav.se most o this will be amortized over the period of ten years, but whatever is received, can and most probably will be used to pay current indebtedness of about $37,000.00, the expendi - ture of additional mone;- for needed repairs and improvements, and the retirement of bonds. A condition and a fact also that must always be kept in mind is that at any time in the future, should the annual maintenance charge or any charge be too large to provide proper maintenance and reasonable return, that this Commission has the continuing jurisdiction tr&gt; lower the same upon either complaint or its own investigation. Attention at this thiie ia also called to the fact that the G.800 acres for which a water right price has been paid, have the right to a claim of discrimination. They have carried the load so far and have in fact received little benefit during the past years of low water over the acres which have not carried this burden. If all the units of land carried the same burden, the rights and resulting charges for carriage of vater can more equitably be adjusted. Test - imony of witnesses, so ue of which can be considered as expert testimony, bears out the ie facts. The Commission must also consider another phase of the new proposal for storage water service. The District now has a permit to store this water, but &gt;efore it delivers it back into the river where it becomes available to icres holding appropriations the said District must make a further ai plication to the Department of Irrigation of Nebraska. In this appl cation the District must designate the land to be irrigated. Sectior 46-617 of the Compiled Statutes. 1929, in - cludes the following provision: "After the completion of such storage reservoir, to the satisfaction of the department any person, proposing to apply to beneficial use the water stored shall file with the depart - ment an application for a permit, particulary describing the use to which the wat^r is to be applied, and if for irrigation, a description of the land to be irrigated." (underlining mine.) The District must have the actual description of these acres. Mr. Willis, the Chief of the Nebraska Irrigation Department states that such description should be by 40 acre units. If the District must have this definite information, then the applicant company must secure such information If this water can only be diverted and then delivered to designated tracts of land, then the applicant company must increase the number of acres above the present figure of 6,800 acres and must have such "water rights' 1 definitely located as to 4 0 acre units. This company, up to the present time, has allowed a landowner </seg>
            <seg id="p197">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL, REPORT to shift or float his water right around on his land at election of the landowner. The present proposed plan includes the definite de - signation of the land to which the "water right" must be attached. It seems reasonable to conclude that this procedure must be followed if the proposed plan of distribution of storage water can be carried out. Everybody is agreed that storage of flood and surplus waters is necessary and advisable, and in consideration of any proposed charges, rules and regulations, we are faced with not only the prac - tical problems, but with the above stated statutory requirements. The record shows that the present owners of so called "water rights" have paid from $5.00 to $25.00 per acre for the same; that during the later years, the price has been $25.00; that other irriga - tion companies have made about the same charge; that othtr and neighboring irrigation companies have the same kind of rules and regulations, including the closest company which is a mutually own - ed company with a rule that one-fourth of the irrigable land must be covered by a located "water right". Taking everything into consider - ation, the Commission is forced to conclude that the rule is not un - reasonable. The present application proposes that the charge for a "water right" contract shall be $12.50 until March 1, 19;!5, after which time the charge will he $15.00. This application was filed in December. 1934, and due to necessity the hearing was postponed and an order has been delayed. The Commission is of the opinion that March 1st, 1935, will arrive too soon after the publication of this order, and sucli date should be set at May 1st, 1935. We find ihat the practical interpretation of the proposed rules will provide for the payment of annual charges as follows: 1. For water users holding existing prepaid service contracts (water rights), and not entering into new contracts for storage waters, the annual water charge shall be $1.50 per acre per year for natural flow water delivered for use on acres of land covered by said prepaid water contract. 2. For water users holding new contracts which will include de - livery of both natural flow and storage waters, the annual water charges shall be as follows: a. For acres of land in each quarter section unit for which the said owner or prior owner has paid for prepaid water (water right) and held an existing contract therefor, the annual charge for delivery of both natural flow and storage water shall be $1.50 per acre. b. For each additional acre of land covered by new prepaid water contracts (water rights) the charges shall be as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p198">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION $3.00 per year per acre for each acre covered by said prepaid wa - ter contract (water right), which annual payment, however, may be decreased upon the folio ving conditions: First: Upon payment liy water user for prepaid water of an amount which shall equal $15.0) per acre for each acre covered by said prepaid water contracts, ihen said annual charge shall be only $1.50 per acre per year for all waters delivered by the company, provided however 1 , a. Said $15.00 pei acre for prepaid water may be paid in ten equal installments, with interest at 6% per annum on deferred pay - ments. b. If paid on or jefore April 1, 1935, or if contract for ten annual payments is executed on or before April 1, 19 35, an additional discount shall be taken &gt;f 16%%, resulting in a payment of $12.50 per acre. c. If paid in full on or before April 1, 1935. an additional discount of 10 r ,' c shall be allowed, resulting in a net payment of $11.25 per acre. Second: Upon payment in full of prepaid water (water right) contracts as set out in paragraph "First" above, the annual water charge shall be $1.50 p &gt;r acre, unless sooner changed or modified. Another method of slating the proposal is that: First: Under the proposed plan, each quarter section unit of land will then be in the same class, that is, that each unit has entered into a prepaid water contract, thereby removing any question of discrim - ination. Second: That the units now entering new contracts in fact are prepaying for service, the practical result of which is that they are now contracting to pay he present annual charge of $1.50 per acre plus an additional charg ; for each additional acre under contract of $1.25 or $1.50 per acre for two years. Third: That the present annual charge of $1.50 may be changed at any future time upon complaint by users, application of company, or investigation of the Commission. Fourth: That the q lestfon of contribution by users of capital funds to the company i i a matter which should and will be taken into consideration by the Commission in future rate investigations. In conclusion we add that in response to many inquiries from water users as to the ji risdiction of the Commission over the ques- </seg>
            <seg id="p199">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT tions herein presented, we submitted this case to the Attorney Gen - eral, and we quote a portion of the official opinion herein: "Without going into unnecessary detail with regard to these constitutional and statutory provisions, it appears to us very clear that when storage water is diverted to a reservoir, and a .permit is isued to the owner of the storage reservoir permitting the said water to be used for the purpose of ir - igating certain designated land, that this amounts to an ap - propriation of the storage water for the purpose of irrigating that particular land. We think it then follows that the State Railway Commission has jurisdiction under the provisions of Section 46-627 to regulate the rates which shall be charged therefor. "We arrive now at the second question, which is whether the Commission has the right to pass upon the amount which should be charged for what is denominated a perpetual water right, _ The term seems to us to be quite inaccurate. What the contract really does is to fix the price for use of the water at $2.75 each year, for the first ten years, and at $t..5O per year thereafter, the consumer agreeing that he will pay in advance for the right and privilege for the use of the watpr, $1.25 each year for the first ten years. That is. he agrees to and does pay a portion of the annual rate each year in ad - vance. At the end of the ten year term, the cost of the water is reduced to $1.50. Thus, the amount exacted lor a perpetual water right really enters into the matter of rates and charges, and should be considered by the Commission. "We are clearly of the opinion that the provisions of ih&lt; - contract which is presented for approval, presents questions as to rates and charges which should be exacted from water users, and that it is within the jurisdiction of the. Railway Commission to pass upon these questions. "It has been objected that the sale of perpetual water rights constitute the levying of a capital contribution upon prospective water users. That is, that the company is com - pelling them to contribute money which the stockholders should advance themselves. We can hardly accede to this view of the matter. As we view it, the company is taking this means not only of securing prospective customers, but also of assuring itself of raising annual revenue In order to meet its obligations. Of course there is nothing in the operation oi other classes of utilities or common carriers which is com - parable to this situation, but this is perhaps due to the pec - uliar nature and character of this particular form of activity. It may very well be that some of the money derived from the of perpetual water rights will find its way into replace - ments and betterments, and thus come into the capital account of the company. However, should the capital of the company ' be so increased, and should it be attempted to levy unreason - able rates on the water users by reason of such enhancement of capital, it undoubtedly would be proper for the Commission to consider this matter and order that such amounts be strick- </seg>

"It should be remembered that the Commission not only has the power to fix these rates and charges at the inception, but has and retains a continuing jurisdiction over them, so that the same may be reduced at any time that it appears that they are excessive." I am of the c pinion and so find that the proposed charges, rules and regulations if applicant company are not unreasonable under present conditions, and an appropriate order will be entered, with changes as to effective dates as above set forth. BY MAUPIN, COMMISSIONER, CONCURRING: OPINION AND CONCLUSIONS Applicant is a corporation for profit now engaged in distributing water from the I latte river, or that part of it commonly known as "the natural flow", to approximately 6,800 acres of land in Dawson County, Nebraska, under contract running with the land and com - monly known as ' perpetual water rights". It must be borne in mind that while the wt.ter right is perpetual, the supply of water is not, and the ability of the said Dawson County Irrigation Company to distribute water c epends wholly upon whether there is an available supply of water t) deliver. The question at issue is not what land - owners have heretofore paid for such water rights, but is what landowners are hereafter to pay for water rights under a new dispen - sation. Heretofore the Irrigation Company and the landowners there - under have been compelled to depend upon the natural flow of the l'latte river for irrigation water. This supply is too often inad - equate, and in sevsral years last past has been almost wholly lacking. In order to avoid this difficulty, the Irrigation Company has contract - od with the Sutherland Project authorities to purchase annually fifty thousand (50,000 acre feet of water at an agreed price of One Dollar ($1.00) pir acre foot. The price at which the Irrigation Company has beeij furnishing water, when available, is not sufficient to pay this extra price per acre foot; hence the applicant company comes to this Commission with the request that it be authorized to make new contracts with landowners, specifications of said proposed contract being set out in detail in the application made to this Com - mission. It is sufficient to know that the applicant company has not been able to meet the demand for water; that because of inadequate water supply, heavy investment and lack of ability to meet customer demand </seg>
            <seg id="p201">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT for untoward climatic conditions over which it has no control, the applicant company has become heavily involved, and has not for a long time paid to the investors in its stock any dividends what - soever. The application sets forth methods whereby applicant comp - any-can meet the demands for water, thereby greatly serving a large area of land, increase its facilities, and at the same time recoup its fortunes without in any wise inflicting a hardship upon its patrons. Objection is made to the proposed charge of $12.50 per acre for a perpetual right to a share in the storage water. That the objection is unfounded may be illustrated by the custom of the elevator companies, oil companies, etc., leasing in what is in effect perpetuity certain plots of ground on railroad rights-of-way, thereby assuring to said companies a right to a particular service from said railroad companies. In case the applicant for lease on a right-of-way and the railroad company cannot aprree as to terms, then the State Railway Commission has jurisdiction. See Sections 74-. r i44 and 545. C.S. Nebr. 1929. These cases are comparable in that applicant for water is in effect purchasing the right to a special and specific service, and both the Irrigation Company and the landowners are asking this Commission to settle a case in which there are some to dispute the proposed contract. The sum asked for a perpetual right to a portion of the storage water in question is.- in effect, a lease in perpetuity. whereby lessor and lessee are benefited, the same as in the case of a railroad leasing a portion of its right-of-way to a patron, not only for a cash rental but in anticipation of greater and more profitable business in the future. To ask applicant company to invest large sums to benefit others without imposing conditions upon those to be benefited, is an utter absurdity. In this case applicant company is merely asking that applying water users evidence their sood faith by agreeing to certain rates and conditions supplementing those rates. The proposed charge of $12.50 per acre for a perpetual water right is merely a part of a general rate schedule, and, therefore, under the jurisdiction of this Commission, as provided in Section 46-627, C.S. Nebr. 1929. The value of the applicant's property is set forth in exhibits attached to its application to this Commission, and may be taken as substantially correct. It has likewise submitted statistics cover - ing operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, etc., together with past revenues and revenues anticipated under the contract with the Sutherland Project, and its contracts with a substantial majority of the landowners under its canal and laterals. </seg>

            <seg id="p204">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (Signed) J. F. Miller Secretary. COMMISSIONER CONCURRING: (Signed) WILL N. MAUPIN ■.■'.■■ In the Matter o£ the Application of ) Dawson County I Tigation Company for ) an order authorising and approving ) the terms upon which said company and ) APPLICATION the landowners under its irrigation ) NO. 11168 system maycpntiact for storage water ) from the Suther and Reservoir. ) OPINION AND CONCLUSIONS BOLLEN, COMMISSIONER, DISSENTING: I am unable to concur with the other two Commissioners in the proposed ordsr. I am unable to see wherein the Commission has any jurisdiction of the subject matter, and if we had juris - diction I could n )t approve the proposed contract. - ■ • The Dawson County Irrigation Company has entered Into a contract with the Platte Valley Public Power &amp; Irrigation District for 50,000 acre feet of water to be stored in the Sutherland Res - ervoir at $1.00 p :r acre foot of water, delivered at applicant's head - sate between Junis 15 and September 1 of each year. The contract be - comes effective when the water is ready to be delivered and remains in effect until December 31, 1967, and terminates thereafter at the option of the applicant. In order to neet this annual charge of $50,000.00 per year applicant now proposes to offer for sale perpetual water rights for such storage wattr, in addition to the natural flow rights, at $12.50 per acre with a maintenance charge of $1.50 per acre. Water is to bo given to al present holders of perpetual water rights, for the number of acres in such rights and new perpetual rights, including storage water, aie to be issued upon cancellation of such existing rights. In ordei for either class to receive new perpetual -water rights for natura. flow and storage water they must contract for at least one-half of the irrigable acres of land owned and definitely located and not low covered by perpetual water rights. OPINION Applicant now comes to the Commission praying that we ap - prove the proposed contract. When the application was filed I was unable toj see where we had any jurisdiction over the subject matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT I consented to have the application set down for hearing at Lexing - ton. The hearing was held by the other two Commissioners and the evidence has been transcripted. After reading the evidence I am now convinced that !we are without jurisdiction. Section 4 6 - 627 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes provides: "Irrigation works constructed under the- laws of this State are hereby declared to become carriers. The owner or operator of any works for the storage, carriage, or diversion of water, except irrigation districts, shall deliver all water legally ap - propriated to the parties entitled thereto at a reasonable rate to be fixed by the State Railway Commission." Our jurisdiction is limited by the above section to the fixing of reasonable rates for water legally appropriated to the parties en - titled thereto. The proposed contract does more than to fix reason - able rates for water carried and delivered. It requires as a con - dition precedent that the land owner must contribute $12.50 per acre for at least one-half of his irrigable land, before he can re - ceive any service. The evidence shows that this contribution will be used in part to pay for deferred maintenance and existing in - debtedness, and may be used in part to pay for storage water, in - creased salaries and dividends to the stockholders. On a basis of 30,000 acres this contribution would amount to $375,000.00. On a basis of 40,000 acres this would amount to $500,000.00. a sum in excess of applicant's capital investment. I know of no regula - tory rule which permits a common carrier, as a condition prece - dent for rendering service, to collect from rate payers money for the purpose of paying deferred maintenance, existing indebtedness or service to be rendered ten years in the future. Such a proposal is absurd. The proposal amounts in substance to a condition pre - cedent, before rendering any service, that the rate payer must sub - scribe and pay for capital stock without voting or dividend powers, in an amount equal to or in excess of the fixed investment of the carrier. This is not rate making and has no place in any setup by a regulatory body with jurisdiction to fix reasonable rates. Rate payers should not be required to contribute any part of the capital investment and then be required to pay a rate of return upon their own investment. If the proposed contract meets with the approval of existing and prospective customers why then invoke the jurisdiction of this Com - mission? Does applicant want us to abrogate our rate making powers? This we can not do. Does applicant want us to enter an order authorizing the issuance of more capital stock? It has not made that kind of an application.- Does applicant want us to en - ter an order fixing reasonable rates? It has not invoked our juris- </seg>
            <seg id="p206">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION diction for tl at purpose. Does applicant want us to approve the proposed contract for the purpose of being able to tell prospective customers that it has been approved by the Commission? This we should not do. Our jurisdiction extends merely to the fixing of reasonable ra ;es for the transportation and delivery of water leg - ally appropr ated to the parties entitled thereto. When our jurisdiction is invoked for this purpose we should then, and not until then, pioceed to make an investigation of the present value of applicant's property, its revenues present and prospective, and its operating expenses, and then proceed to fix a rate that will give applicant a reasonable return upon that which it employs for the public co lvenlence. The present application should be denied and the proc&lt; edings dismissed. Respectfully submitted, By (Signed) Floyd Xj. Bollen Commissioner. </seg>

E. corner ) of Section 14-22-9 and north to ) Ralph Robert! on and Harold Swanson. ) OPINION AND FINDINGS BY DRAKE. CHAIRMAN: This application comes before the Commission under provisions of Our General Order No. GO, which provides: "Section 1. That no telephone company operating in the State of Nejraska as a common carrier shall after June 1. 1934, construct a new telephone line or extend an existing telephone Hie into the territory of another company operat - ing as a coiimon carrier without first making application for and , receiving from the Nebraska State Railway Commission a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity. "Section 2. Upon receipt of an application for any such certificate, the Commission shall cause notice thereof to be given to all telephone companies into whose territory such new lines are sought to be constructed or existing lines extended of the time and place of hearing such application. </seg>
            <seg id="p217">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT "Section 3. If after hearing upon such application the Com - mission finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction and op - eration of such new or extended lines, a certificate of conven - ience and necessity will be issued by the Commission author - izing the construction of new lines or the extension of exist - ing lines." and is important because it is the first case in which the Commis - sion is asked to make a decision. If the Commission is to have any control over these telephone companies, it should have all control, and certainly the division of territories, and control over the extensions by one company into the territory of another company, with the resulting loss of revenue and plant investment, is very material to proper regulation. It might be stated that the prime reason for the rule promulgated in this order, was . for the purpose of protecting a weak company against the invasions of a strong company, and in all probability such protection will be needed in time to come. In this case we have the weaker, financially, of two companies, encroaching tin - territory of the stronger company. Whatever principle is laid down in this case, is liable to be followed in later cases, and for that reason an order of denial or an approval of the application should contain a recital of some of the facts, and state some of the reasons for the resulting order. If this case involved the en - croachment by the stronger against the weaker company, this Com - mission, without doubt, would unanimously condemn the practices shown and deny the application in no uncertain terms. This Com - mission, however, should not be influenced by such facts, and must lay down some principles which will stand up under all circum - stances. The record shows that a customer living in the Okland terri - tory applied to the Craig company for service; the Craig company referred the customer to the order of this Commission in G. O. No. 60; the subscriber then wrote to this Commission, requesting an or - der, and was advised that the application must be made by the telephone company; that thereupon this application was filed, not - ice served upon the other company, and the subscriber, and the case set for bearing; that the subscriber did not appear; that the manager of the Craig company appeared as witness, stating that his company would build over to subscriber, a distance of over one - half mile, and serve subscriber at the present rate of $1.00 per month, if the Commission gave permission; that the subscriber does live in Oakland territory surrounded by Oakland subscribers, who logically belong- to Oakland territory; that subscriber desired Craig service (hearsay testimony) because of a relative living over </seg>
            <seg id="p218">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION near Qraig; aid Exhibit No. 1, a map showing locations of former customers, present customers and existing lines, shows that twenty - three of the farmer subscribers in Oakland territory are now being served by the Craig company. This record indicates that the mythical line which formerly separated the two exchange territories, has been moved about a mile from the Craig exchange toward the Oakland exchange, and each extension in such direction moves that line further, and sure - ly a time must come when that movement should stop. That is, if the Commissic u intends to exercise any reasonable control over this and other like cases.- The managers of the Oakland exchange have apparently sa . back and watched their subscribers being taken away, until tl ey now see too much property being rendered use - less and wortl less, and an unwarranted loss of revenue. They also recognize that the encroachment into the logical Oakland territory by another company brings about a loss of service to their remain - ing customers, it being a fact that one of the most valuable services rendered to a farmer is the ability to talk with his neighbors. This record - shows that the customer involved is entirely surrounded by Oakland cusU niers, and the existing plant runs by his doorstep The record further shows [that the rate of the Craig service is $1.00 per month, a temporarily reduced rate put in by the Craig company Janu iry 1, 1933, during the depression, and a rate which can and will go back to the former rate of $1.50 whenever the Craig company applies for the same. This Commission is well aware of the fact that a rate of $1.00 per month for rural service of this kind in this tc rritory is not remunerative, and in fact less than cost under any recognized system of cost accounting. In other words, this service is now being offered to these customers in their own territory and in other territories at a rate which is slowly wreck - ing the comp iny, and the time will come when the company, in order to continue to serve, will be forced to increase the rates, in all probability to a rate in excess of the former rate of $1.50 per month. This low rate is, however, very attractive to rural cus - tomers. A cl eck upon the annual reports of Craig company shows that the average depreciable plant in service during the past five years is about $17,500; that the average annual charge to dep - reciation has been $80.00, when it should have been at least J6S0.00. J&gt;r &gt;per mangement during the past five years would have required at least $3,000.00 more credits to the reserve, and if that- 'an &gt;een done, these low rates could not have been in force, but th ■&gt; company would have been in proper condition to weather some more bad years, which in all probability may come. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT This Commission has, in the past year, issued various orders to larger companies, governing proper depreciation items for the protection of investment, and in other ways has tried to safeguard not only property, but continuance of proper service at reasonable rates. It is not the function of the Commission to step into the field of management, and at first glance it might appear that it was so doing in this case, but good management on the part of one company is entitled to some protection from poor management on the part of another company. If one company is willing to render service at less than cost, it may be their right, but certainly it should not be allowed at the expense of a well managed com - pany. Upon the facts above stated, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application should be denied, and an approp - riate order will be entered.

            <seg id="p220">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION DISSENTING OPINION BOLLEN, COMMISSIONER, DISSENTING: I am unalile to concur with my colleagues in the opinion and order on this application. General Order No. 60, set out in major - ity opinion, vas entered May 1, 1934. With all that happened prior to that ime we are not concerned. The language of thn order needs no con itruction. The purpose of the order was to prevent destructive competition between two or more public service corp - orations engaged in a business which must of necessity be a mo - nopoly. Bull ling new telephone lines or extending existing lines in - io the territ)ry of another telephone company results in the a - bandonment if existing lines and in taking the property from an - other compary without just compensation. The order never in - tended that he Commission would mark out any arbitrary lines between two exchanees serving rural subscribers in adjacent ter - ritory. We did not intend to establish any arbitrary rule but wisely left each application to be considered on its own merits. It was intended to provide applicants for telephone service with the ser - vice of their own choosing, providing the service chosen did not require the &lt; estruction of existing lines without compensation. The facts disclosed by the record are not in dispute. Mrs. Ralph Robertson anil Harold Swanson both reside on Section 14, Town - ship 22. Ka ige 9 east, in Burt County. The former resides on southwest and the latter on southeast quarter. Neither at this time has any telephone service. A Craig subscriber resides on the northeast quarter and two former Oakland subscribers reside on the northwes quarter of the same section. On Section 20, south and adjacent to Section 14, three Oakland subscribers reside on the west halt and two Craig subscribers reside on the east half. Applicants are not surrounded by Oakland subscribers as stated in majority opirion. They are both in the twilight zone. Mrs. Robert - son lives ab jut equal distance between Oakland and Craig. Mr Swanson resides nearer Craig than he does Oakland. They are not in the territory of the North Western Bell Telephone Company. Our General Order No. 6 0 did not require the Craig Telephone Company to make application to the Commission before extending its existing ine to serve these applicants for telephone service. Under the almitted facts this Commission is without jurisdiction in the premises to enter any order except an order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The record discloses that since 1930 the twi-light zone has been moved westv ard. Exhibit 1 discloses that many former Oakland </seg>
            <seg id="p221">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT subscribers are now being served by the Craig exchange and many former Oakland subscribers are not receiving any telephone ser - vice. This situation can be easily accounted for by the fact that the North Western Bell Telephone Company charges rural subscrib - ers a net rate of $2.25 per month and the Craig Telephone Com - pany charges a net of $1.00 per month, a difference of $15.00 per year. In a period of economic depression, such as we have exper - ienced during the past four or five years, twi-light zones are bound to move into high rated territory. The Craig Telephone Company has not extended the twi-light zone. It has been extended by the North Western Bell Telephone Company by exacting a charge from rural subscribers that they were unable to pay and more than the service was reasonably worth. This situation is not confined to the company's Oakland exchange. On December 31, 19 30 the North Western Bell had 10,251 rural subscribers in Nebraska. On Dec - ember 31, 1934, it had only 4,731, a net loss of 54 per cent. It was not the intention of our General order No. 60 to deprive any farm - er of telephone service because they could not afford to pay exist - ing rates. If one company is unable or unwilling to furnish tele - phone service in a rural territory at rates that the subscribers can afford to pay, then it should withdraw from that territory and permit another company to furnish service at a rate the subscrib - ers can afford to pay. The evidence also discloses that the Craig Telephone Company is ready and willing to extend an existing line to serve the Robert - son and Swanson homes and that such extension will not require retirement of any existing line of the Oakland exchaime. Both ap - plicants have other reasons for wanting the Craig service. Both have iriends and relatives on the Craig exchange with, whom they wish to converse. If required to take Oakland service they would be required to $15.00 per year more than for Craig service and also pay toll charges through the two exchanges in order- to talk with their friends and relatives. In the last analysis subscribers should be the sole judge of what exchange will best serve their needs. The facts present a case where two applicants prefer the Craig Service. The Craig Company is ready and willing to extend an exisiting line into a territory not now being served by any com - pany and furnish service. The extension of such line will, not re - quire the removal of any existing line of another company or the taking of another company's property without compensation. Un - der the facts we are either without jurisdiction in the premises or if we have jurisdiction the facts present a case where the application should have been granted. </seg>

On or about October 1. 1035, respondent disconnected complainant's telephone and remov - ed the same from his residence for non-payment of arrears. At that time cc mplainant was owing for January, February, March, April and September service. Before the telephone was removed, he offered to pay for April and September but refused to pay for January, February, and March. The evidence is undisputed that for a part of 1934 and for the first three months of 1935, he was able to call c ut but others was unable to call him. He complained to the company and the lineman was unable to remedy the trouble until about April 1, 1935, when a new instrument was installed. Since that tine he has received satisfactory service. From the evidence we can find that at the time his service was discontinued, there existed a substantial and legitimate dispute as to January, February anc March service. Our jurisdiction as a .regulatory body does not extend to the settlement o ' disputed telephone charges. This is a matter for the courts tc adjudicate. The law is well settled that a telephone company can lot lawfully discontinue telephone service for the non - payment of a disputed claim. State ex rel.

In the Matter of Depreciation Charges ) GENERAL ORDER NO. 5 it for Class "A" and Class "IV Telephone (NORTHWESTERN BELL Companies. ) TELE PHONE COMPANY OPINION', FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS BY BOLLEN, COMMISSIONER: Our general order No. 59, Re Depreciation Charges for Telephone Companies, (1933) 1 PUR (NSi 2C4 directed all Class "A" telephone companies to file, not later than March 1, 1934, schedules of dep - reciation rates by primary accounts, together with supporting data, which they proposed to apply for the your 19:&gt;&gt;4. The order also directed such companies to file, not later than August 1, 1934, schedules of depreciation rates by primary accounts, together with supporting data, which they proposed" to apply and make effective January 1, 1935. This order was in conformity with the procedure adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission, except that we proposed to review the findings of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission as- to rates to become effective January 1, 1935, and to enter our final order thereon, to the extent that such rates affected dep - reciable property situated in Nebraska. Respondent complied with our order and filed required sched - ules and supporting data, which resulted in a composite rate of </seg>

We were not satis - fied with the proposed rate and set the matter down for hearing. On April 9. 1 )34, after extensive hearings we entered an order fix - ing respondent's composite rate at 3^% for 1934. Exhibit No. 18, Re Northwest ;rn Bell Telephone Company, (1934), 5 PUR (NS) 20. Challenging our jurisdiction to fix any rate, respondent appeal - ed. Our order was affirmed by the Supreme Court. (Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Nebraska State Railway Commission, 259 NW 362, March 1 1935; 8 PUR (NS) 46.) On the Question of jurisdiction our court said: "Appella it argues therefrom that it had no right to keep or to be requi ed by the state railway commission to keep, its accounts in the form prescribed by the state commission. We do not find that the interstate commerce commission has ever seen fit to act upon the question of the rate of depreciation to be used :n intrastate companies though they may do an in - terstate bus ness. Even assuming that the congress has au - thorized such action (which we do not decide), and assuming that the ultimate decision would rest with the interstate com - merce comi lission as jto intrastate rates (which also we do not decide), and that the state railway commission would bu bound by tiat decision still, the federal commission not yet having acter upon the! question, the state commission has the right to act until such ; time as the federal commission excerises its authoritj." On July 11, 1934, the Federal Communications Act brought in existence the Federal Communications Commission which took over all jurisdiction of telephone companies formerly exercised by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The order of the later Com - mission, I. C. C. Docket No. 14700, requiring all Class "A" tele - phone compai ies to file ; with state commission, prior to August 1, I'llM, schedules of depreciation rates, together with supporting data, which t uey proposed to apply after January 1, 1935, and for hearings bofcre the state commissions, and, recommendations by such commission, was by the new commission continued to May i, 1935, (Order 10-A, F. C. C. Docket No. 2552). On May 1, 1935, by Order No. 10-B, Docket No. 2552, (Exhibit No. 20), the Federal Communications Commisssion indefinitely postponed the effective dates of all o-dersin I. C. C. Docket No. 14700 and F. C. C. Docket No. 2552, Depreciation Charges of Telephone Companies. Para - graph 5 of S?ction 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended in 102H provided, and paragraph "b" of Section 220 of the Federal Communications Act now provides that: / "The C )inmission shall, as soon as practicable, prescribe /for such curriers the classes of property for which deprecia - tion charge-; may bo properly included under operating expen- </seg>
            <seg id="p225">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT ses, and the percentages of depreciation which shall be charged with respect to each of such classes of property, classifying the carriers as it may deem proper for this purpose." Neither act required the Federal Commission to prescribe deprecia - tion rates for telephone companies and it is now fair to assume that the Federal Communications Commission has concluded after fifteen years of study and investigation by the two Commissions, that it is impracticable to do so. This conclusions will be concur - red in by all state regulatory bodies.* This proceeding arises from that part of our order No. 59, re - quiring- all Class "A" telephone companies to file with us, prior to August 1, 1934, schedule of depreciation rates by primary accounts, together with supporting data, which they proposed to apply after January 1, 1935. Respondent compiled by filing with us a sched - ule of proposed rates with supporting data, offered in evidence in this proceeding as exhibit No. 7, and which resulted in a composite rate of 4.44%. Owing to the amount of evidence taken at the for - mer hearing resulting in our order of April 9, 1934, fixing respond - ent's depreciation rate for 1934, we did not think it necessary nor did respondent request any hearing. The data was examined by our staff and on September 21, 1934, we submitted to the Federal Com - munications Commission our report and recommendations. In this report, we brought our order of April 9, 1934, down to date. We did not enter a final order. On March 12, 1935, the Federal Com - munications Commission, having taken no action on our report, we entered a supplemental order directing respondent to show caust- - on the 25th day of April, 1935, why an order should not be entered fixing a composite rate of 3.18% or such other rate as would be sufficient to keep respondent's investment intact for the year 193." upon all its depreciable property in Nebraskka. JURISDICTION Respondent stitl contends that we do not have jurisdiction to prescribe depreciation rates upon its depreciable property in Neb - raska. Our supreme court has held otherwise, at least, until the Federal Commission exercises its authority, if it has such authority. The Federal Commission has indefinitely postponed the effective dates of all orders in assumption of such authority. The respondent's contention as to our jurisdiction is overruled as far as this proceeding is concerned. I DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTUiG It is a recognized fact that all physical property installed in any industry must ultimately be consumed and retired from service; that </seg>
            <seg id="p226">NI- BRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION provision mus . be made to pay the cost of property consumed when and as retired; that stockholders of a public service corporation are not only entitled to a reasonable return upon the fair value of pro - perty used and useful in rendering service to the public but are also entitled to have their investment kept intact. These facts were re - cognized by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Uniform System of Accounts f i &gt;r Telephone Companies, First Issue, effective January 1, 1913. This system provided a reserve for accrued depreciation with instructions to credit the same with such amounts as were concurrently charged to certain operating accounts and including any amount carriei in reserve on' January 1, 1913. It also provided that the account lie charged ' with realized depreciation of property re - tired from seriice after January 1, 1913. The computation of charges for depreciation remained as before, a managerial function. By the 19 20 amendment. Congress recognized the fact that com - putation of depreciation charges and prescribing the same were reg - ulatory fund ons. The jconclusions ■ reached by the Interstate Com - merce Commission in I.G.C. Docket No. 14700 (177 I.C.C 351) re - quired a revis on of "first Issue" of Uniform System of Accounts. The "First Reviser Issue" wais adopted November 12, 1932. (Exhibit No. 1 ) . The con fusions reached by the Federal Communications Com - mission in P.d.C. Docket No. 2552 (Exhibit No. 20) required a re - vision of. the "First Revised Issue"."? On June 19, 1935 the "First Revised Issue ' was superceded by "Issue of June 19, 1935" effective January 1, 19 36, (Exhibit No. 21). Reference being made to instruc - tion :; of "Issue of June 19, 1935" we quote the following defini - tions: "(J) 'Depreciation', as applied to depreciable telephone plant, means the loss; in service value not restored by current maintenance, incurred in connection with the consumption or prospe&lt; tive retirement of telephone plant in the course ol service from causes which are known to be in current operation, against which the company is not protected by insurance, and the effect of which can be forecast with a reasonable approach to accuracy. Among the causes to be given com ideration are wear and tear, decay, action of the elements, nadequacy,' obsolescence, changes in the art, changes in demani and requirements of public authorities. "(L) 'Group plan', as applied to depreciation accounting, means th&lt; s plan under which depreciation charges are ac - cured upo i the basis of the original cost of all property in - cluded in each depreciable plant acount, using the average service life thereof properly weighted, and upon the retire - ment of iny depreciable property its full service value is charged to the depreciation reserve whether or not the par - ticular Hem has attained the average service life. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT "(P) 'Net salvage value', means thel salvage value of the property retired after deducting the cojit of removal. "(W) 'Salvage value' means the amount received from property retired, if sold, or if retained for reuse, the amount at which the material recovered is chargeable to account 122, 'Material and supplies'. "(X) 'Service life' means the period between the time of installation of telephone plant and the time of its retire - ment. "(Y) 'Service value*\ means the difference between Un - original cost and: (1) The salvage value for station apparatus. (2) The net salvage value for other telephone plant. "(Z) "Straight-line method', as applied to depreciation accounting means the plan under which the service value oi property is charged to operating expenses and to clearing accounts and credited to the depreciation reserve through equal annual charges as nearly as may be during its service life." By Instruction 82 under the caption "Depreciation Accounting", it is provided that all depreciable telephone plant be classified by 12 primary accounts. We quote from Instructions 80-81 : "80. Computation of depreciation rates.— f A) Dep - reciation charges shall be computed by applying the com - posite annual percentage rates considered applicable to the original cost of each class of depreciable telephone plant own - ed or used by the company. These percentage rates shall be based upon the estimated service values and service lives de - veloped by a study of the company's history and experience and such engineering and other information as may be available with respect to prospective future conditions. These percent - age rates shall be computed in conformity with the group plan of accounting for depreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value of the property, except for losses excluded under the definition of depreciation may be distributed un - der the straight-line method during the service life of tin - property. Such percentage rates shall not include any al - lowance for loss in service value of property expected to be installed in the future. The percentage rates shall, for each primary account comprised of more than one class of property, produce a charge to operating expenses for that account equal to the sum of the amounts that would other - wise be chargeable for each of the various classes of property included in the account. "81.

In computing the current monthly charges, 01 e-twelfth of the composite percentage rate appli - cable to the primary accounts covering depreciable telephone plant shall be applied to the average of the balances, as of the first and last of : the current month, in each such pri - mary account." As reflected by the oral testimony of Mr. Livermore, company statistician, w len property is retired from service, an expense is in - curred equal o the difference between the original cost and the net salvage value. The recording of this expense on the books of the company is depreciation accounting. Under the straight line method, the annual d&lt; preciation charge is obtained by dividing the original cost, less net salvage value, by the number of years of estimated service life. The annual percentage of depreciation is obtained by cither reducing the figures to percentages, or by the short cut of sub- Btracting the estimated net salvage percentage from 100 % and divid - ing the remainder by the number of years of estimaled service life. The original :ost is obtained from the company's books, the estim - ated service life and net salvage value are computed by the engineer - ing staff. With these figures, depreciation rates become a simple prob - lem of math ;matics. Separate rates are developed for each class of property in each primary account. These percentages are then com - posited into i rate for the primary account. These composite rates are again composited into a single rate for all primary accounts. In our fo:-iner order we did not fix composite rates by primary accounts. W; prescribed one composite rate for all depreciable pro - perty which jermitted respondent to reallocate same to the .twelve primary accounts. The determination of estimated service lives and net salvage v dues, of rates for each class of property in primary ac - counts and the composite rate for each primary account are merely steps in the process of determining the composite rate for all de - preciable pro jerty. We see no sound reason for fixing depreciation rates by prin: ary accounts until such time as the accumulated balance in the reserve for accrued depreciation has been segregated and main - tained by prinary accounts. The important question is what amount in dollars should subscribers contribute to keep company's invest - ment intact. We will not at this time attempt to prescribe deprec - iation rates \ y primary accounts. ■ Our limited appropriation enables us to employ but one engi - neer at half :ime work and half time salary. With an appropriation sufficient to employ the necessary engineering staff, we might from the company s records determine the service lives and net salvage values of the many classes of depreciable property. Where estimates or judgments based upon estimates are required, we would be able </seg>

Bell Tele - phone Company and its predecessor companies, together with careful consideration of the conditions which have affected the plant in the past and the degree to which these condi - tions a ill exist and are expected to exist in the future. In cases -where the present and probable future conditions dif - fer fro n those of the past in respect to their effect on ser - vice life, these conditions have been given full consideration in making estimates of average service life. "TV e past experience of the company has, in the case of most classes of plant, been adequate to provide data- from which :he service lives resulting under past conditions can be determined. There are a few exceptions, notably plant ex - pected to have very long service lives, such as underground eondui and very large buildings; plant, the greater part of which is comparatively new, such as toll terminal equipment; and plant of which only a small amount is owned, such as submarine cable. For the kinds of plant falling in these classes, the service lives were estimated giving consideration to their physical and functional characteristics and all of the otner factors which may be expected to influence their service lives." On the same subject we quote from the testimony of Mr. Cranfield. (Record pg. 70): "The estimates of service life are based on a complete an - alysis of the experience the company has had up to the pre - sent time, with each of the various classes of property, mod - ified ly our best judgment as to what factors that have af - fected the service life in the past may be expected to have a different effect in the future. In other words, the final estimate is based on analysis of experience plus judgment as »o future probability." </seg>
            <seg id="p231">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT Instruction 80 (C) of Uniform System of Accounts pro - vide: "(C) The company shall keep such records of property .and property retirements as will reflect the service life of property which has been retired, or will permit the deter - miniation of service-life indications by mortality, turnover. or other appropriate methods, and also such records as will reflect the percentage of salvage value, or net salvage value, as appropriate, for property retired from each class of depre - ciable telephone plant." Respondent uses the mortality method for groups of property made up of a large number of individual units, the nature of which makes it practicable to keep life .history records of each individual unit. It uses the turnover method for groups of property made up of a large number of units which cannot be followed through the accounts as individual units. It employs two other methods, the first is applied to groups of property having a very long service life and for which actual experience and records are inadequate to fore - cast estimates of service life with a reasonable approach to accuracy. In these groups service life is based upon judgment and may properly be called the judgment method. The second is known as the average realized service method and is applied to those groups of property having a few large and complex items of such nature that records may be kept for each individual unit. The estimated service life of these groups are in large part also based upon judgment. The four methods are illustrated by the testimony of Mr. Granfield at pages 74 to 103 of record. Respondent contends that it has kept its depreciation accounts, and computed its depreciation rates in the manner prescribed by the Federal Commissions. As to depreciation accounting we so find. Aa to computing depreciation rates we find that respondent has in - cluded an allowance for loss in service value of property expected to be installed in the future, and prohibited by instruction 80 of Uniform System of Accounts, supra. We find such allowance has been made for buildings at Omaha, McCook, Norfolk, Holdrege, Sid - ney and South Sioux City. This is probably true but not revealed by the record, for central office equipment for the same buildings. We also find that respondent kept its depreciation accounts and com - puted its depreciation rates in the same manner, before required to do so by the Federal Commissions and was along with its parent company and associated companies responsible for it. We also find that its present reserve for accrued depreciation was accumulated in large part under the same system of accounts and computed rates of depreciation. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION RESULTS In our opiiion the best test of the accuracy of the four methods is the result &lt; btained over a long period of years as reflected by the difference bet veen existing accrued depreciation and the balance in reserve for ac:rued depreciation. If accrued depreciation is greatly In excess of bal: nee in reserve, then the rates in' the past have been too low and should be increased for the future. On the other hand if balance in teserve is greatly in excess of accrued depreciation, then the rates in the past have been too high and should be decreased for the future. I ! rates have been too low the stockholders suffer a loss. Their investm ;nt is being consumed in service without compensation. If the rates 1 ave been too high, the subscribers have suffered loss. They have be&lt;;n required to contribute to capital investment and not to capital consumption. The balance in reserve being invested in plant, they are required to pay a return upon their own investment. In our fern er order (Exhibit 18), we found the existing accrued de - preciation to be 12% of depreciable property. No new evidence has been submitted to show a greater per cent accrued depreciation now, and we now find 12% existing accrued depreciation as of January 1. 1934. Respondent has not segregated its reserve for accrued depreciation by states. A ; of above date for the five states the depreciable pro - perty amounted to $121,054,108 and balance in reserve for accrued depreciation amounted to 132,534,451.. The depreciable property in Nebraska mo anted to $24,660,022 or 20.37% of all. By applying 20.37% to $: 12,534,451 we find the reserve for accrued depreciation on Nebraska property to be $6,627,267 or 26.87% of depreciable pro - perty and 14.87% more than required to keep investment intact. Reduced to dollars, the reserve- for accrued depreciation is $3,666, - 94 5 in excess of accrued depreciation, and in excess of the amount re - quired to keep investment intact. It is difficult to otherwise conclude that past est mates of service life and salvage value have not been accurate or forecasted with any reasonable approach to accuracy. Respondent's Nebraska subscribers have contributed $3,666,945 more than requirei to keep its investment intact and the excess being in - vested in pU nt, they are now required to pay a return upon their own investment. Rate; payers should not be required to pay for capital contr butions. -Company contends there is no relationship between accrued de - preciation ai d balance in reserve for accrued depreciation. We hold there is a d.rect relationship. According to Mr. Granfield (Record pgs. 105-109) if the reserve for accrued depreciation is excessive, it </seg>
            <seg id="p233">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT ! is due to the fact that in the past too many items of expense have been charged to maintenance which should have been charged to re - serve. If this is true be says, it has not been at the expense of the rate payers because since 1913, the company and its predecessor have not made more than a fair return and for the larger part of the period less than a fair return. Company's reports filed with this Commission show that in 1921, it paid 4% on common stock, 1922 5%, 1923, 6%, 1924 to 1932. SO'r. 1933, 7.5% and 1334. 4%. These dividends were paid to the American Telephone and Tele - graph Company, the owner of all common stock. The later company, whose principal source of revenue is derived from dividends of its subsidiaries, has for a long period of years paid regular dividends of 9%. It should'\also be noted that on November 16, 1935, Ameri - can Telephone and Telegraph Company common stock was quoted on the New York Stock Exchange at $149.50. The excessive reserves for accrued depreciation of respondent and associated Bell Comp - anies, may have some relationship to 9&lt;&gt; dividends and the present value of $149.50 for common stock. It is possible that rate payers have been paying a return on their own investment. According to the testimony of Mr. Grandfield, in estimating ser - vice lives, no consideration was given to the difference between existing balance in reserve for accrued depreciation and existing ac - crued depreciation. We held that the difference should be Riven full consideration. Reserves in excess of requirements should not be perpetuated and should be corrected by fixing depreciation rates in the future. Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, 2S2 U.S. 133; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, 11934; 292 U.S. 151. There should be better co-operation between company's accounting and engineering staffs. EHKOItS OF JUDGMENT It is possible and even probable that the disparity between accrued depreciation and reserve for accrued depreciation can be accounted for by errors of judgment in estimating service life and net salvage values. We cannot disregard the judgment of engineers but the fact remains that engineers are not divine, at least there is no evidence of divinity in this record. In each of the four methods used by the company in estimating service life and net salvage value there exists the factor of judgment. Plant retired from service for any cause may have salvage value. Estimates of cost of removal and sale price, when sold, may be accurately determined from experience plus consideration of changing price levels. When plant is reused by the company, it must bargain with itself as to value with judg - ment the controlling factor. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION For undei ground conduit, right of way, submarine cable and dial office e&lt; uipment, company uses the judgment method. For buildings and central office equipment, it uses the realized service method which starts with date of installation and an estimate of date of retirement. The large dial equipment building at Omaha was in - stalled in ser-ice in 1918. The estimated date of retirement is 1970. This is a mod jrn fire proof building. Who can now correctly estimate that this building will be retired from service in 1970 or that its net salvage vilue when retired will be only 3% of cost? Such an estimate is a mere guess. The groups of property whose service lives are computed by the foregoing two methods amount to $11, - 007,565 or 44 6% of all depreciable property. The turnover and mor - tality method! are the only methods which can be expected to rea - sonably apprcach to accuracy. Even in these methods, judgment in many case 3 becomes a factor. An example is the difference in service life o treated and untreated poles. As to untreated poles, company's experience as to mortality is sufficient to determine with a fair degre&lt; 1 of accuracy the service life. As to treated poles the company' 3 experience is insufficient and judgment must nec - essarily become a factor. It is the duty of the engineering staff to produce rates suf - ficient to keep company's investment intact. In the exercise of this duty, where judgment becomes a factor, it is only human that engineers wil overshoot the mark. Without regulatory supervision their judgment becomes final. When a utility builds up an exces - sive reserve !&gt;y overstating depreciation expense, a regulatory body cannot establ sh onfiscatory rates for service to recapture the ex - cess. Public Utility Comrs. V. New York Telephone Co. 271 U.S. 23. MAINTENANCE In ou." former order we discussed the factor of maintenance in computing d( preciation rates and reference is now made to same. In the past t lis factor must necessarily have been reflected in rates computed by the turnover and mortality methods. It could not have been rfflectec to the same degree in the judgment and realized ser - vice methods. The service life of some property retired for physical causes is inc ef inltely increased by proper maintenance until obso - lescence or inadequacy require retirements. The new Uniform System of Accounts &lt; lassifies the units of property which when retired from service constitute depreciation expense. Improvements in the art may and wil! find new ways of maintaining such units so as to in - crease the st rvice life resulting in lower depreciation rates in the future. :4, ;] </seg>
            <seg id="p235">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT INADEQUACY Reference is made to our discussion of inadequacy in our former order. It is a well known fact and examination of company's history of plant investment and number of stations reveal, that from 1913 to 1930 was a period of development and constant growth. The company's experience as to service life is based upon that period. Inadequacy on account of growth has been in the past the major factor in estimating service life. Since 1930 the company has had a different experience. On January 1, 1931, the peak period, company had in Nebraska 126,841 stations, on January 1, 1034. the number had dropped to' 102,558. On January 1, 1935 the number had increased to 106,066. Since January 1, 1931, inadequacy on account of growth has ceased to be a fac - tor. Depreciation rates based upon a period when inadequacy was the major factor, have no application for a period when inade - quacy has not been so active. What weight should be given this factor in the overall composite rate is not answered by the testimony. Assuming that all other causes of consumption or prospective retire - ment of plant was in current operation from January l. l !)2 1 to January 1, 1935, we can estimate, without application Of- judgment, the weight to be given to inadequacy by taking the weighted average retirements 'for all causes from January 1, 1921 to January 1. 19;'.], and substracting the weighted average retirements for all causes from January 1, 1931 to January 1, 1935. From Exhibit 2:!, sub - mitted by company at our request, we find: "A" "B" "C" Ave. "Depreciable Debits to % Plant Depreciation of 3 921 to 1930 Reserve "B" to "A " Total $214,068,457.33 ?7, 464, 567. 57 Ave. 10 yrs.. 21,406.845.73 746.456.75 :!.49&lt;T C 1931 to 1934 Total $115,945,407.23 $3,219,378.44 Ave. 4 yrs 28,986,351.81 804,844.61 2.7S&lt;7 r Difference 71% . In 1931, company made excessive retirements probably not anti - cipating the heavy loss in stations. Had we included the year 1931 as part of the growth period and not included it in the lack of growth period, the difference would have been 1.63%. Assuming that company had used the above 3.4 97c as its overall composite rate of depreciation for the growth period, then a rate of 2.78% would have been sufficient for the lack of growth period. On the </seg>
            <seg id="p236">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION basis of 3.49 y c , the difference of .71% equals 20.3% of overall com - posite rate. In 1930, company used a composite rate of 4.89% for depreciable property in the five states and 4.95% for Nebraska. Assuming th.it the Nebraska rate was correctly computed including the factor of inadequacy and consideration given to the factor of in - adequacy to the extent iof 20.3%, the Nebraska rate for 1935 should not exceed 3.94%. Jit is plainly evident that company has not given proper consideration to this important factor. On page 1, of Exhibit 13. Northwestern Bell Telephone Comp - any presents a computation in which each dollar invested in depre - ciable property is multiplied by the years which such dollar has been invested in such property. The resultant product is multiplied by the previously determined rate of depreciation for such property to determine the total dollars which represent the loss in value by rea - son of all tie elements of depreciation. Summing up the totals of these compilations for all of the twelve classes of property results in a total figure of $38,912,258 as the total depreciation to the total property for the company over the five states based on the in - vestment in depreciable property of $121,402,704. The actual dol - lars accumulated in the depreciation reserve as of December 31. 1934 was given by the comnany's representative as $35,156,025. The coin - panys valuation engineer, Mr. Granfield, testified that the small dif - ference between the total computed amount, which should be in the depreciation reserve, and the actual amounts accumulated therein is well, wit iin the accuracy of the computation and the difference is not serlcuV. The importance of this computation to our present inquiry ari ;es from the fact that in making the calculations the company's engineers have assumed that with the present condition of the property and assuming the application of a total composite rate of de t reciation of 4.41% as the resulting composite figure for the entire property and applying same to the dollars invested therein over the p ist fourteen years would result in accumulating an ade - quate and sufficient depreciation reserve. This figure must be con - trasted with the actual accumulations to such reserves which have been on the basis of j 5.16% average for each year of such fourteen year perioc. If 4.41 \/c. applied annually could be assumed to have accumulate I an approximate adequate depreciation reserve then the actual cliaiges of 5.16% average per year for fourteen years should have accumulated a more adequate reserve. Such history of charges warrants the conclusion, in our opinion, that the present reserve should be considered more than adequate, certainly more has been ap - propriated to said reserve than the calculations show to have been necessary. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT THE TEST OF EXPERIENCE In our report to the Interstate Commerce Commission, we re - commended an overall composite annual depreciation rate of 3.18%. This was based upon company's retirements for 1933. Our purpose was to prevent a further increase of balance in account for accrued de - preciation. We recognized then that we were not following the straight line method of depreciation accounting, but the line had already been broken by the economic depression; inadequacy had ceased to be a factor in current operation. We now hold that the experience of a single year does not form -a sound basis for estimating future de - preciation rates. On the other hand we hold that company's actual experience with retirements covering a period of time which equals or approaches to an average turnover or cycle of all depreciable property, forms a sound basis for estimating future depreciation rates. We have such a turnover or cycle or a close approach to it in the experience of Nebraska Telephone Company from 191" to 1020. and the experience of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company from 1921 to 1935 for the Nebraska and South Dakota area. Our ac - counting department has prepared the following data from annual reports of Nebraska Telephone Company from 191'! to 1921. and from exhibit 23 submitted by respondent at our request for the North - western Bell Telephone Company from 1921 to 19 "5.

            <seg id="p239">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL, REPORT added to the rate of 3.37% gives us a rate of 3.82%. We, therefore, conclude that an overall composite rate of 3.82% would have been adequate for the 22 year period to pay expense of all retirements and to have kept the investment intact. This rate gives no consi - deration to the fact that on account of inadequacy and improvements in the art, service life will be increased in the future. We believe that 2 2 years is fairly representative of a turnover or cycle period. Company's weighted average credits to depreciation reserve for this period is 5.12% of depreciable property. This would indicate an average turnover 1 period of 10.1! years. Company's proposed rate of 4.44% would indicate an average turnover period of 22.;"&gt; years. A rate of 3.S2% would indicate a turnover period of 2G.2 years. The total retirements of $14. "07, 632 for the 22 year period do not equal or approximate the average investment of $19,311,557 in depre - ciable property. This difference arises from the excessive increase in growth of investment in depreciable property from 1913 to 1932. There has not yet been an average turnover of depreciable property. It is to us conclusive evidence that company's estimate of service life in the past has been too conservative, resulting in excessive percentage rates. Until the time that the average depreciable investment equals or approximates the total retirements, it cannot be said that we have an average turnover period. The past period of excessive growth affords no basis for future estimates. If a composite rate of :i.N2 r ; should in the future be inadequate, it can be corrected by order of the Commission. Considering the excessive balance in reserve for accrued depreciation and that inadequacy will not be an active factor until lost stations have been restored, we are of the opinion and so find that an overall composite rate of 3.82% will be adequate to keep respondent's investment intact for 19 35, and that respondent should apply such rates to primary accounts as will result in an overall composite for all depreciable property in Nebraska, not ex - ceeding 3.82%. LAW By computing annual depreciation rates, based on company's act - ual experience over a long period of time, we are supported by the highest authority. In Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company. 282 U.S. 133, A PUR 13, that court said: "It is evident that past experience is an indication of the company's requirements for the future. The recognition of the ownership of the property represented by the reserve does not make it necessary to allow similiar accumulations to go on if experience shows that these are excessive. The experience of the Illinois Company, together with a careful analysis of the results shown, under comparable conditions. </seg>

In Llndhilmer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, 292 U. S. 141, 3 PDR (NS 348. thati court said: "Confiscation being the issue, the company has the burden of makii g a convincing showing that the amounts it has charged o operating expenses for depreciation have not been excessive That burden is not sustained by proof that its general r ccounting system has been correct. The calculations are mathematical but the predictions underlying them are essentially matters of opinion. They proceed from studies of the 'be.h ivior of large groups' of items. These studies are heset wi h a host of perplexing problems. Their determina - tion invc lves the examination of many variable elements and opportunities for excessive allowances, even under a correct system c f accounting, are always present. The necessity of checking the results is not questioned. The prediction must meet tin controlling test of experience.'' In view of what the Supreme Court of United States said in Smith v. Ilinois Bell Telephone Company, supra, decisions of other state comn issions relating to annual depreciation rates for other Bell Companies, become pertinent to our inquiry. On April 30, 1935, the Wiscon sin Commission concluded an investigation of depreciation rates for Wisconsin Telephone Company, identical in all respects to this procetding. With its large staff, the Wisconsin Commission was able to examine the company's records and make its own estimates us to service life and net salvage value for each primary account. It reduced company's proposed rate of 4.52% to 3.55%. (Exhibit 19). !» PUR (NS) lJ Similar proceedings are now pending before tin; Illinois and Oregon Commissions.

The next step to be considered in laying a foundation for our' jurisdiction is in the order to show cause issued by the Commission,, on March 12, 1935, a copy of which order is as follows: "IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company be and the same is hereby directed to show cause on the 2511 1 day of April, 1935, at the Commission's hearing room in Lincoln, Nebraska, why an order should not be en - tered b&gt; this Commission fixing the proposed composite 'rate of IMS^r , or such other rate as will be sufficient to keep res - pondent s investment intact, for the year 1935, upon all its depreciable property in Nebraska." Now. p irsuant to ; the above orders, respondent did appear and introduced testimony to support a showing that the proper rate of depreciation to be charged as an operating expense for 1935 was 4,41%, Tie record then includes some studies made by our own cnKineerinj and accounting staff, and some extraneous exhibits w.hlch arc- not coi ipetent or proper, altho made a part of the record. There is no testimony of any witnesses for the Commission which will break down the testimony of respondent's witnesses as to life or expectancy of any of the 29 different classes of property, and the cc nclusions reached by the majority herein must have and do come f-om outside the record, unless it can be considered that the Comm ssion has taken judicial knowledge of such factors. This is not a rate case, lit is an accounting case. It 1b within our jurisd ction to prescribe j the system of accounting and classifi - cation of accounts. If this were a rate case, while I could not concur in most of the theories expounded in the foregoing opinion, I would and do concur that as an expense item I would not allow at the pre - sent time the full amount of 4.41%, taking into consideration the percent ccndition and balance in reserve account. This is an ac - counting &lt; ase, and in order to have a legal order, there first must be a proper foundation for authority and then competent testimony to support . I cannot concur with the opinion that such Is true. The main question presented in the 1934)^86, now before the </seg>
            <seg id="p243">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT United States Supreme Court, was whether the primary or original jurisdiction was with the Federal Commission or with the State Commission. There is and can be no question about a classification of accounts. The Federal Commission has prescribed a classification, which classification is agreeable to this State Commission, so that no issue is presented on that question. The respondent herein .has used the classification of accounts prescribed, and there being no differem classification prescribed by this Commission, then the only question remaining is the percentage figure which respondent shall use in reporting to this Commission the amount charged as an expense item for 1935 and credited to the depreciation reserve account (No. 608). Respondent proves in a figure of 4.41%, our engineering staff a figure of 4.15%, and the majority opinion a figure of 3.82 per cent. This order then is not far out of line of what would be a proper figure, if this were a rate case and were supported by com - petent testimony. I do concur in the theories expressed in the first paragraphs under that part of the majority opinion labeled "Depreciation Ac - counting", and especially the following: "(J) 'Depreciation', as applied to depreciable telephone plant, means the loss in service value not restored by cur - rent maintenance, incurred in connection with the consump - tion or prospective retirement of telephone plant in the course of service from causes which are known to be in current operation, against which the company is not protected by in - surance, and the effect of which can be forecast with a reas - onable approach to accuracy. Among the causes to be given consideration are wear and tear, decay, action of the el - ements, inadequacy, obsolescence, changes in the art. changes in demand and requirements of public authorities." and "80. Computation of depreciation rates.— &lt;A)De - •preciation charges shall be computed by applying the com - posite annual percentage rates considered applicable to the original cost of each class of depreciable telephone plant owned or used by the company. These percentage rates shall be based upon the estimated service values and service lives de - veloped by a study of the company's history and experience and such engineering and other information as may be avail - able with respect to prospective future conditions. These percentage rates shall be computed in conformity with the group plan of accounting for depreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value of the property, except for losses excluded under the definition of depreciation may be distributed under the straight-line method during the ser - vice life of the property. Such percentage rates shall not include any allowance for loss in service value of property expected to be installed in the future. The percentage rates </seg>
            <seg id="p244">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION shall, for :ach primary account comprised of more than one class of property, produce a charge to operating expenses for that account equal to the sum of the amounts that would otherwise j e chargeable for each of the various classes of property ii eluded in the account." and the last paragraph under such heading which explains the real reason why t lere has been no proper record made in this case upon which the Commission might find a proper rate, if proper and nec - essary to do so. I cannot igree with ; the •'finding" that the existing accrued de - preciation is 12 per cent. The record will show that the per cent condition is ; bout 88%,j but the difference between that figure and 100% condition does not represent "accrued depreciation", as known by all author tics. The 12% is the observed depreciation, sometimes called actual deterioration. I cannot concur in the finding "We find that the reserve for accrued depieciation on Nebraska property to be $6,627,267 or 26. $7t/i and 14. 87% more depreciation than required to keep the investment in :act"\ for the reason that if the acknowledged principles of engineering are to be followed, there must be included other factors than he "observed depreciation" or actual deterioration. To allow, an indi.stry to charge to its depreciation reserve account only such an amount as will accure sufficient to take care of actual present deterioration, and refuse to acknowledge that there are any elements of "decay, inxtlequacy, obsolescence, changes in the art, or changes in demand and requirements of public authority," all elements which are quoted in majority opinion as being proper elements to consider, would soon wreck the industry. The majority opinion, by way of certain processes of comput - .-ition. comes :o a final result of 3.82% as the proper rate to be ap - plied to depreciable property in contrast to 4.41% proved in by respondent aid 4.15% as found by our engineering staff. While there is bnlj a small difference in these figures, it is probably true chat if :his were a rate case, the lowest of these figures, or maybe a lover figure, could be found, depending upon what a real investigation of the property might develop, and I cannot see that much importance can be placed on any of these figures. By this orde-, the Commission has ordered this company to sub - mit to us it i next annual report showing in Account No. 608 a figure which shall be computed on a basis of 3.82%. Account No. 608 is that c esignation of the proper account which under the ap - proved classification of accounts shows the depreciation reserve. However, I lnow of no restriction, no order of this Commission, and no orde- of the Interstate Commerce Commission which will </seg>
            <seg id="p245">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT deny them the right to set aside the difference between 4.41% and 3.82%, namely .39% in a special reserve or contingent fund, and in fact, the rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission do make provisions for special accounts. There is one more phase of this matter which is also important. The amount of dollars shown in the depreciation reserve belongs to the plant, and as such is subject to future consideration by reg - ulatory bodies and the rate payers. The amount thrown into sur - plus is immediately avaibable for dividends, and becomes lost to an interest of the rate payers. Assuming the fact to be that the total amount available in 1935 to be diverted to both depreciation reserve and surplus is less than 3.82% plus a fair return of C % on fair value, making a total of 9.82%, and assuming that we can make them put only 3.82 Cr In the depreciation reserve account, and force them to put the other 6 r / r into surplus where it is available for dividends, where the management says that for pro - per protection of the plant they want to put 4.41',; into reserve and only 5.G1% into surplus, then a conclusion can be reached that this Commission is more active in the interests of stockholders than in the interests of rate payers. The facts In this case will show that the total per cent available for both accounts will be less than as above stated. In other words, if a company has a net result of 9% which must be transferred to depreciation re - serve and surplus, 'then could put 3% into the reserve and C« into surplus, then pay the whole C % out in dividends, then" the stockholders could put that whole 6% back into capital, which cer - tainly would then be entitled to a return. Under this state of facts and theory, then a regulatory Commission should not step into the field of management unless the record and facts showed that the total of both accounts resulted in an adequate amount in reserve plus more than a fair return.

On Nevember 12, 1932, the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribed "Uniform System of Accounts First Revised Issue", effective January 1, 1933 for Class A Companies and January 1, 1934 for Class B Companies. This incorporated the principles, classes of property, definition of terms, manner of computation and procedure for determination of depre - ciation charges as contained in final report and order in Docket No. 14700.

            <seg id="p249">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEBRASKA IN RE DEPRECIATION CHARGES NORTHWESTERN BELL TELE - PHONE COMPANY V. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 29312 Filed March 1, 1935. (For reference of proceeding before the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission, see Twenty-Seventh Annual Report, 109.) 1. Appellant having had an opportunity to make a defense in the hearing before the state railway commission, upon which hear - ing a 1934 depreciation rate was fixed, the order fixing the rate is not void because appellant was not thus afforded due process of law under the state and federal Constitution. 2. Until the interstate commerce commission fixes the rates of depreciation upon local class A telephone company property for in - trastate purposes, the state railway commission has jurisdiction and authority to prescribe such rates. 3. Evidence and record examined and the final order of the state railway commission affirmed. Heard before Goss, C. J.. Good, Eberly, Day, Paine and Carter, JJ., and Thomsen, District Judge. GOSS, C. J. This is an appeal from the Nebraska .State Railway Commission. The matter was initiated by an order made by the Commission November 29, 1933, directing all class A telephone companies (those having average annual operating revenues exceeding $100,000) and class B telephone companies (those exceeding $50,000 and ui&gt; to $100,000) to file with the commission, not later than March 1. 1934, a schedule of depreciation rates by primary accounts which they propose to apply for the year 1934, together with supporting data. Appellant is a class A company. It seasonably filed its re - turn, but the commission, being dissatisfied, ordered the cause set for hearing March 19, 1934, for "oral examination ot the members of respondent's staff, who prepared said schedules, and for the in - troduction of such evidence as the commission may desire to sub - mit with opportunity of objections and cross-examination by res - pondent." The record and bill of exceptions show that attorneys and witnesses of appellant appeared and a hearing was held, last - ing two days and the record thereof covering upwards of 200 pages. An inventory and cost engineer and the general auditor for appellant and an accountant for the commission were examined and </seg>
            <seg id="p250">NEBRAS KA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION various schedules, :alculations and exhibits were introduced in ev - idence. At the cot elusion of the oral hearing, the cause was "sub - mitted on the recoid," as appears both in the bill of exceptions and in the transcript of the pleadings, orders and filings. On April 9, 19; 4, the record shows an opinion, finding and or - der. The Commission reduced appellant's proposed rate ot 4.48 per cent and entered an order fixing a depreciation rate of 3% per cent upon depreciable property, including right of way, to be applied by the resrondent for! the year 1934. Appellant presents four contentions: First. That is was not given full notice of the scope of the hearing and lull oi portunity to make a defense in the 1934 depre - ciation rate; that therefore the order was void because it did not afford appellant di e process of law under the state and federal Constitutions. Second. That, since appellant is engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerc &gt;, and the congress has committed the matter of uniform account ng of common carriers of interstate commerce, including telephone companies to the interstate commerce commission, the state commissio i was without authority to act on matters of ac - counting even with respect tb intrastate commerce. • Third. That th? order is ! void because it is not based on evi - dence sufficient to support it; and is contrary to the evidence. Fourth. That the commission erred in denying the motion of the appellant to v: cate the order and to grant a hearing and a new irial. The Constitutioi. and laws of Nebraska "confer administrative and judicial powers upon thej commission in addition to the main purpose of its creation, which: is the exercise of legislative powers." Hooper Telephone Co. v. Nebraska Telephone Co. 96 Neb. 245. The matter is not here for trial de novo, but for judical review as to the legality cf the order of which appellant complains. The appeal and procedt re are provided for by section 75-505, Comp. St. 1929. As to the claim that appellant had no sufficient notice of the scope of the hearing, the record shows that it appeared and for two days participated in the hearings and furnished its schedules showing the rates of depreciation on various kinds of property </seg>
            <seg id="p251">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT owned and used by it. Some of these percentage rates were high and others low, depending upon the character of the property to which the schedules applied. From them the company arrived at a composite rate of depreciation of 4.48 per cent. The commission fixed a composite rate of 2% per cent. We are not afforded much help by the evidence or by the printed and oral arguments, in deter - mining just how either the appellant or the commission reached their respective conclusions on this point. But when the record shows that all the evidence was taken that either party desired to offer and that the cause was submitted on the record without objections of any sort until after the decision, we think we ought not, in such a case, to reverse the action on the ground that, after the judgment was entered against a party, it can then claim it was taken by surprise as to the scope of the action. Indeed, even after the final order was entered, on the hearing of the motion for new trial, the parties stipulated (and it appears in the bill ot exceptions) on May 15. 19'J4. tor the admission of additional evi - dence. This was incorporated in the bill of exceptions in the form of a book of 101 pages on Uniform System of Accounts for Tele - phone Companies, issued by the interstate commerce commission in 1933. Until the motion for rehearing was filed, setting up the points now relied on, the record does not show that the commission as a court had any notice that appellant was aggrieved by the procedure. The evidence shows that counsel for the tele phone company at the outset of the hearing suggested names ot parties having to do with the calculation of the rate. Most of these were examined at length in a hearing apparently conducted with all the formality of any court. It appears all through tin - evidence that what the commission and telephone com puny were seeking was the proper evidence upon which to base a proper rate of depreciation to be used by the commission in 1934 only. If the telephone company had offered or proposed to offer other or further evidence and had been refused the opportunity, it would have presented a different question than that now before, us. We think appellant had timely notice of the scope of the hearing, ap - peared generally, and was afforded due process of law in the mat - ter. "The due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment has regard not to matters of form but to substance of right." Western Indemnity Co. v. Rupp, 235 U. S. 261. Paragraph 5, sec. 20, title 49 U. S. C. A. -the interstate com </seg>

Appellant argues thereirom that it has no right to keep, or to be required ay the state railway commission to keep, its ac - counts in the form prescribed by the state commission. We do not find that the interstate commerce commission has ever seen fit to act upon th« question of the rate of depreciation to be used in intrastate companies though they may do an interstate busi - ness. Even assum ng that the congress has authorized such action (which we do not decide), and assuming that the ultimate deci - sion would test v . iih the interstate commerce commission as to intrastate rates (which also we do not decide), and that the state railway commission would be bound by that decision, still, the federal commission not yet having acted upon the question, the state commission 1 as the right to act until such time as the fed - eral commission exercises its authority. The Supreme Court, Chief Justice Hughes writing the opinion, said in Smith v. llinois Bell Tel. Co. (1930) 282 U.S. 133 (on p. 159): "The conpany urges that, as Congress has granted jur - isdiction to the Ii terstate Commerce Commission over the depre - ciation rates of telephone companies doing an interstate business (Interstate Comme-ce Act, sec. 20 (5), as amended by Transport - ation Act (February 28), 1920, U.S.C., title 49, sec. 20) this sub - ject is now completely withdrawn from the power of the state. It is said that the two rates of depreciation cannot be charged on the same property. The interstate commerce commission has had the matter under consideration (Telephone and Railway Deprec - iation Charges, Hi: I.C.C. 328-333) but, so far as we are advised, a final determini tion has ; not yet been made. The Interstate Commerce Commission has its accounting rules with reference to depreciation charges and, pending its orders under section 20 (5) of the Interstate Com nerce Act, telephone companies as well as others subject to the act, have been directed to continue to observe these re - quirements. The company argues that, although the Interstate Com - merce Commission has not finally ruled, the action taken by Con - gress excludes the urisdiction of state tribunals under familiar prin - ciples, (citing cases). We are unable to assent to this view. As the Interstate Con merce Commission has not acted finally in the matter, we are not now called upon to consider the scope of its authority in relation to depreciation charges, but we are of the </seg>
            <seg id="p253">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT opinion that, in any event, until action has been taken which could be deemed validly to affect the amount to be charged to deprec - iation in connection with intrastate business so as to affect intra - state rates, the prerogative of the state to prescribe such rates, and the jurisdiction and duty of the statutory court in considering their validity to determine the amount properly allowable for deprec - iation in connection with the intrastate business, are not to be gainsaid. Compare Board of Railroad Commissioners v. Great Northern R. Co., 281 U. S. 412, 74 L. Ed. 936, 50 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391. Accordingly, the court should make appropriate findings with respect to the amount to be allowed in this case as an annual charge for depreciation in connection with the intrastate business." This case appears to be decisive authority on the precise point in - volved here. Appellant relies upon Interstate Commerce Commission v. Good - rich Transit Co. (1912) 224 U. S. 194. That relates to an order of the Interstate commerce commission "prescribing the method of accounts and bookkeeping as to the operating expenses of the car - riers" of freight and passengers-in this case a steamship company operating on the Great Lakes. The commerce court had enjoined the operation of the rates as applied to intrastate business. The supreme court held the orders valid and reversed the cause. We think the case is not applicable here. If the interstate commerce commission had entered the field by prescribing depreciation rates for class A telephone companies to use in intrastate business, the principles of the cited case might be usable. While we do not fully understand the logical processes by which appellant reached one rate and the appellee reached another rate of depreciation, yet, whether the rate here fixed is a legislative or judicial matter for the commission, it is, we think, a determin - ation over which the commission had jurisdiction. It was for 1934 only and steps had already been taken to fix the rate for 1935. If the rate should prove to be confiscatory, if and when applied, it is quite likely the appellant will be able to discover a remedy. We think the evidence was sufficient to support the order. Find - ing no reversible error in the proceedings the final order of the railway commission is AFFIRMED. </seg>

Supplemental order entered February 5, 1935, ordering certain of such companies to either file schedules of rates for electric energy at wholesale for dis - tribution by municipalities, with this Commission on or before the first day of March, 1935, or show cause before this Commission on March 1, 1935, why they have not complied with the order of the Commission heretofore entered.

' ■ •■ • . • • ■ OPINION AND FINDING BOLLEN, COMMISSIONER: Complainants are rural consumers of electric energy furnished by respondent, village of Salem, from its transmission line betweeu Falls City and Salem, Nebraska. Complainants own and maintain their individual transmission lines, transformers and other electric - al equipment. They complain that the following existing monthly rates are unfair, capricious, arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory and unjustifiable: LIGHT First 25 K.W.H 13 cents per K.W.H. Next 25 K.W.H 11 cents per K.W.H. Next 50 K.W.H 9 cents per K.W.H. Over 100 K.W.H 7% cents per K.W.H. Minimum Charge $3.00 |&gt; PQWER i First 50 K.W.H 5 cents per K.W.H. Next 50 K.W.H 4% cents per K.W.H. Excess 4 cents per K.W.H. Minimum Charge $3.00 Combined Minimum Charge $4.00 Respondents are municipal corporations. Both own and oper - ate electric distribution systems. Falls City owns its generating plant. The village of Salem does not, but purchases energy from the municipal plant at Falls City at a flat rate of 3 cents per K. W. H., delivered through a master meter at the Falls City plant. The village of Salem owns and operates the transmission line from the Falls City plant to the village of Salem. </seg>
            <seg id="p274">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ■ ■ • i A hearing wag held on September 12, 1934 and the evidence submitted. Before any evidence was offered, Falls City moved that the proceedings be dismissed as to it. We withheld any ruling on this motion until after the evidence was adduced. From the evi - dence, it appears ;that Falls City serves rural consumers at a rate of about one-half now charged by Salem to complainants and re - fuses to serve complainants or any of them while selling at whole - sale to Salem. For one company more favorably situated to charge a less rate than another company less favorably situated does not present a case of discrimination. For Falls City refusing to serve complainants while serving Salem at wholesale is a matter of ethics. We are without jurisdiction to enter any order against Falls City, and we are of the opinion and so find that complaint as to Falls City should be dismissed. Prior to the hearing, we had before us the case of Miller, et al vs. Iowa-Nebraska Light &amp; Power Company, In which respondent challenged our jurisdiction over the subject matter of the com - plaint. We entered an order overruling respondent's objections to our jurisdiction, 5 PUR (NS) 29. From this order respondent appealed. After the hearing in the instant case, we concluded not to enter a final order until the question of jurisdiction was settled by the Supreme Court. On October 29, 1935, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in the case of Miller, et al vs. Iowa- N'ebraska Light &amp; Power Co., 262 NW 855. We quote from sylla - bus: "5. Chapter 143, Laws 1925, being sections 70-501, 70 - 502, Comp. St. 1929, confers upon the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission jurisdiction, upon application of consumers, to hold hearings and determine what are reasonable rates for the furnishing of electric energy to rural users along the trans - mission lines of companies engaged in generating and trans - mitting electric current for sale." In Miller, et al vs. Iowa-Nebraska Light &amp; Power Co., supra, respondent was a private utility with transmission lines serving rural consumers, j In the instant case, respondent Is a municipal corporation with transmission line serving rural consumers. We are without jurisdiction to regulate rates and service of a municipal corporation to consumers within the corporate boundaries and the question now arises, do we have jurisdiction to regulate rates and service of a municipal corporation when it serves rural consumers from its transmission lines outside of its corporate boundaries? Sec - tion 70-501 of 1929 Statutes limits our jurisdiction to all persons. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT associations, companies and corporations engaged either in the gen - erating or transmitting of electric current for sale, or both, in the state for power or other purposes, where the said person, associa - tion, company or corporation operates an electric transmission line outside of the limits of incorporated cities or villages in this state. Municipal corporations are not specifically included or excluded. Our Legislature has wisely conferred upon the governing bodies of municipal corporations the power to regulate electric rates and service by ordinance when distribution system is owned by the municipality and by franchise when privately owned. The people pf the city or village elect the governing board and have an in - direct voice in fixing their own rates. If dissatisfied with exist - ing rates, consumers may complain to the governing board. If the board refuses relief, then the consumers may exercise their sover - eign powers by electing a' new board and In some cases the right of recall or the initiative and referendum. The rural consumer stands in a different position. He has no vote and it was he that the Legislature intended to protect when it conferred upon this Commission the power to regulate electric rates and service in ru - ral territory. Logic and reason compel us to say that the Leg - islature never intended to protect rural consumers against unjust and unreasonable rates of a private utility and leave him unpro - tected against unjust and unreasonable rates of a municipal corp - oration. We, therefore, hold that when a municipal corporation goes beyond its corporate limits with an electric transmission line, it at once conies under our jurisdiction as to service and rates to rural consumers. We are supported by authority. This identical question was before the Supreme Court of Colorado in the case Lamar v. Wiley (1926) 80 Colo. IS. PUR 1927 A. IT.",. 24S I'ac. 1009, and that court said. "We, therefore, hold that where a municipality, as owner of a public utility, furnishes the commodity in ciuestion to its own citizens and inhabitants, consumers within the munici - pal limits, the city itself, through its proper officers, pos - sesses the sole power to fix rates. When a municipality, whether in its operation of its own public utility it acts in its municipal or governmental, or in its proprietary, or quasi - public, capacity, or partly in one and partly in the other, and as such furnishes public service to its own citizens. and in connection therewith supplies its products to con - sumers outside of its own territorial boundaries, the function it thereby performs, whatever its nature may be. in supply- Ing outside consumers with a public utility, is and should be attended with the same conditions, and be subject to the same control and supervision, that apply to a private public utility owner who furnishes like service." </seg>

No additions or replacements have since been made. Village and rural rates were fixed to amortize the bonds in twenty years and were subject to call in ten years. Since 1924, Falls City has reduced the wholesale rate to respondent from 5 centd to :: cents per K.W.H. Since 1924 respondent has reduced the first olock of its village rate from 15 cents to 11 cents per K.W.H. and the first block of Us rural rate from 18 cents to 13 cents per K.W.H. and i ho minimum charge from $4.00 to $3.00 per month. During the same period respondent has called and paid from the earn - ings nf its electric jdistribution system $6,500 of its outstanding bonds, about $1,900 for improvements of distribution system in village, and at time of hearing had $1,123.50 balance in light fund. This is a splendid showing of municipal management, but what about these complaining rural consumers? When the bonds have heeri fully paid the village consumers will be the proud owners of an electric transmission 1 line all paid [or out of earnings. Not so with i ho complaining rural consumers. AH they will have left will bo their receipts for electric energy consumed and their contribu - tion!; to capital investment of a transmission line in which they have no interest. As far as the complainants are concerned the village of Salem is a, private electric utility and subject to the law uoverning private utilities. Rate payers of a public electric utility should pay a reasonable return upon that used for the public con - venience including consumption of capital investment. They should not be required to pay for capital investment and then be required to pay a return upon their own investment. KATE BASK . Respondent's investment in: plant which serves the rural con - sumers consists of 7J5 miles of transmission line built in 1924 at a cost of $8,500. The line Is ; used by rural consumers from Falls City to a point one-half mile from Salem. We will allocate $7,905 of cost on mileage basis to rural consumers. Another allo - cation must be made between rural consumers and village of Salem for street lighting and village consumers. Exhibit 12 discloses: </seg>

For accrued depreciation and annual depreciation charges, in the absence of evidence, we must resort to recent decisions of other state Commissions. A search of these authorities discloses that most of the commissions are allowing an annual composite rate of 3% upon original cost of depreciable property, where both distri - bution systems and generating systems are involved, and slightly less for distribution systems. Here we have a transmission line only and the depreciation should be less than distribution system. We will use Z r /r for annual depreciation and for the purpose of computing existing depreciation. The line has been in use for ten years and without evidence of any retirements or replacements, the existing accrued depreciation would be 30% of original cost or present fair value of $1,516.18 to be allocated to rural consumers for rate mak - ing purposes. While there is no supporting evidence, it is a well known fact that the present cost of material and labor is substan - tially less than in 1924. We will give no consideration to this change in price levels. ENEUGY COST The cost of energy delivered at the Falls city plant is 3 cents per K.W.H. From exhibit 5, for the years 1932 and 1933, we ascertain the line and the transformer loss to be 22.19%. This results in a cost of 3.9 cents per K.W.H. delivered at consumers' meters.

            <seg id="p279">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT Drake, Chairman, dissenting: I concur in the finding as to dismissal in this case as to Falln City. I concur generally that the present rates are unreasonable and that for the future lower rates should be prescribed, but do not concur in the findings as to the depreciation rate, the silence upon the question of two meters, issuance of an order on a stale record, and to some of the theories used and expressed. The hearing, in this case was held in September of 1934, and covers record data for the years of 1932 and 1933. The case should be reopened and the record brought down to date with additional data covering 1934 and 1935. This would be easy and simple and would not delay the case over thirty days. This is the first order of this Commission covering rural rates, and it is my opinion, this first order should be made on an up-to-date record, with at least a little evidence upon which to base some findings. The studies used in the majority opinion are faulty and du not truly reflect the facts. The record clearly shows that the Village of Salem was given a gift of over $4,000.00 worth of en - ergy due to a faulty meter at Falls City. If they had had to pay for that energy the studies would have been different, and in con - sidering rates for the future, surely, such facts must be taken into consideration. The plain facts in this case are that no scientific study has been made of either the facts or figures, and I believe proper procedure would be to, first, have some competent evidence, and second, to have some scientific studies by a competent engineer. It is my opinion that the establishment of rural rates must recognize: A. Operating expense. 1. Meter reading — at higher cost than in urban areas. 2. Clearing case of trouble, ditto. 3. Billing — at average operators cost. 4. Bookkeeping — at average operators cost. 5. Insurance — Public liability — at average operators cost. 6. Insurance — Storm &amp; Casualty — higher than average of oper - ator's cost. 7. Maintenance — per centage on allocated value of property. 8. Supervision and general operation — at average for operator. 9. Energy losses — higher than average energy lost cost — iron losses of customer's transformer. 10.

The record shows that in this case the operating expen - ses are lower than normal by about $500.00, due to several facts, one of which is that] the salaries paid for labor are ridicuously low. The city officials arti in fact donating their services as a matter of civic duty. I question the right of this Commission to accept such low figures as proper cost items. If those officials offer their ser - vices to the city, should not that saving be given to the city in place of being passed on by the Commission to rural patrons. Surely the managers and/or owners if a utility may forego usual and rea - sonable salaries, the savings to go to the stockholders. In this case the tax payers n Salem are the stockholders, and should this Commission condemn such practice? Taking everything into consideration, with a delay of only one month necessary, she uld not the Commission re-open and take fur - ther testimony, mak&lt;; a full and complete record, and then issue an order based upon correct recognized engineering and legal prin - cipals?

Heard before Goss, C J. Rose, Good, Eberly, Day, Paine and Carter, JJ. GOOD. J. This is an appea from an order made by the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The principal question for determination is: Does the State Railway Commission have jurisdiction over rural electric rates? . I The parties to this proceeding are the Nebraska State Railway Commission (hereinafter called' the Commission), the Iowa-Nebraska Light &amp; Power Company (hereinafter called the Company), and a number of rural users of electric current, customers of the Comp - any, who will hereinafter be referred to as the complainants. The complainants filed with the Commission a complaint, charg - ing that they were users of electric current, furnished by the Comp - any to their places of residence along its transmission lines, some distance- outside the corporate limits of the city of Lincoln. In their application they set forth the rates which they were being charged for electric energy, and alleged that such rates were ex - orbitant and unreasonable, and requesting the Commission to fix and determine reasonable rates for electric energy furnished them by the Company. They also charged that the Company, in violation of statute, was continuing to make a service charge to each of the </seg>
            <seg id="p283">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT complainants for the service rendered him, but in the guise of a so-called minimum charge. To this complaint the company filed an answer, in which it chal - lenged the jurisdiction of the Commission over the subject of electric rural rates; admitted that it was furnishing electric energy to comp - lainants from its transmission lines, and that the complainants re - sided outside of the incorporated limits of any city, town or village; denied that its rates were unreasonable or exorbitant, and denied that it was exacting a service charge in the guise of a minimum charge. To this answer the complainants filed a reply in the nature of a general denial. After evidence had been taken on the part of the complainants, the Company and complainants stipulated that the Commission should determine the question of jurisdiction, and that either party might appeal from such order, to determine the jurisdiction of the Commis - sion, and if it should be finally determined that the Commission hail jurisdiction, then a further hearing should be had with reference to rates. The Commission entered an order that it had jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and also determined that the Company, in the guise of a minimum charge, was, in fact, making a service charge to each of the complainants for the electric energy furnished him. From this order, the Company has appealed. The Commission was created in 1900 by a constitutional amend - ment. The powers conferred on the Commission by the Constitu - tion relate solely to common carriers. It is conceded by all the par - ties to this proceeding that companies engaged in generating and transmitting electric energy for sale are not common carriers. It follows that, if the Commission has jurisdiction over rural electric rates, it must be in statutory provisions. In 1923 the legislature enacted chapter 170. Laws 192.'!. bearing this title: "An act to provide that electric transmission lines and power companies of Nebraska shall afford and give to all persons. associations and corporations upon reasonable and equal terms, ser - vice facilities and physical connection to their lines running between cities, and villages within this state, and to provide for the enforce - ment of the provisions of this act." The principal object and pur - pose of this act was to require persons, associations, companies and corporations, engaged in generating and transmitting electric cur - rent for sale in the state, to furnish physical connection between their power lines to properties near or adjacent thereto outside the limits of incorporated cities and villages. It is contended by the complainants that this act conferred jurisdiction upon the Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p284">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION mission to fix reasonable rates to be charged to consumers of elec - tricity for light, heat or power purposes furnished to rural consumers of electric energy. We deem It unnecessary to determine whether that act was sufficient to confer such jurisdiction upon the Commis - sion. ..-'■■ The 1925 session of the legislature enacted chapter 143, Laws 1925 (now sections 70-501. 70-502, Comp. St. 1929), bearing this title: "An act to am 2nd sections 1 and 2, chapter 170, Laws of Neb - raska for 1923, reliting to electric transmission lines and power companies; clothing the Nebraska State Railway Commission with power and authority to make findings concerning rates and service concerning electric current distributed for light, heat or power pur - poses from such lines or companies; and to repeal said original sec - tions." And in the latter part of section 2 of that act it is pro - vided: "And the Nebraska State Railway Commission shall, upon application of any consumer, proceed to make an investigation and hold the necessary hearings and make a finding and order as to what reasonable rai e shall be charged to consumers of electricity lor lij;ht, heat, or power purposes, *** and the said Railway Com - mission shall, from time to time, make such reasonable regulations as to the service which shall be given to such consumers by such lines or companies." The Company contends thai, if the provisions of the 1925 act are sufficiently broad to give the Commission jurisdiction over rural electric rates, the act is unconstitutional because it violates section 14, art III of the Constitution, which, among other things, provides: "No bill shall contain more than one subject, and the same shall be clearly expressed in the title." As supporting- this contention the Conipany cites Miller v. Hurford, 11 Neb. 377, 9 N. W. 477 and Stake v. Tibbets, 52 Neb. 228, 71 N. W. 990. An examination of t ho se cases discloses that the titles to the amend - atory acts under consideration were ones only for the amendment of certain acts or sections of previous acts. In the instant case, the title to the 1925 act is |not one solely for the amendment of sections 1 and 2 of the act of 1923, but contains matter added there - to. So far as we : re aware,: this court has not previously passed upon the precise question. It has, however, been before other courts of last resort. In Jones v. Mayor and Council of Columbus, 25 Ga. 610, it was held: "The title of an act amending a former act of the legislature may be looked to, as well as that of the original act, to ascertain if the amending act has any matter different from what is expre: sed in the title." Similar rulings have been made </seg>
            <seg id="p285">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT In Frank V. Maguire, 201 Cal. 414, Miller v. Lux. Inc.. v. Sac - ramento and San Joaquin Drainage District, 182 Cal. 252. and Andrews v. Board of Commissioners, 7 Idaho, 453. The applicable rule is stated in 59 C. J. 819, in this language: "Where the title of an amendatory or supplemental act sufficiently indicates the nature of the legislation in it contained, or the nature of the changes or additions by it made, it is immaterial whether or not the provisions of the act are covered by the title of the act amended or supplemented." , It has frequently been held that the object and purpose of the quoted constitutional provision was to prevent surreptitious leg - islation; that, under the guise of a purely amendatory act, mat - ter not germane to the section or sections amended could not be included. The title to the 1925 act is broader than the title to the act of 1923 and is sufficient to embrace the proposition of conferring jurisdiction over rates and service concerning electric current distributed for light, heat or power to rural users thereof. We think it clear that, if the title to the 1923 act had contained the additional matter inserted in the title to the 1925 act, the leg - islature of 1923 might have conferred jurisdiction on the Com - mission with reference to rates for service and furnishing electric current in rural communities, because the subject of controlling rates was germane to the general subject on which the legislature was acting. In enacting the 1925 act the legislature was clothed with power to enlarge the title to the previous act of 1923, so long as it related to the same general subject. Certainly, any one reading the title to the 1925 act would be Informed that the pro - posed act would deal with the subject of regulating rates for electric energy in rural communities. The reason for the holding in the Nebraska cases above cited does not here exist. The Company also contends that the Commission has hereto - fore construed the act of 1925 as not conferring jurisdiction, and that such construction by the Commission should be controlling. In case of doubtful meaning of a statute, contemporaneous con - struction given it by those whose duty it is to enforce it may be persuasive. However, it is also a rule that "A resort to con - temporaneous construction Is both unnecessary and Improper where the language used is clear, or its meaning can be ascertained by the use of intrinsic aids alone." .59 C. J. 1022. We think that this rule is applicable to the present record. We are of the view, therefore, that chapter 143. Laws 1925. does not contravene the constitutional provisions that "No bill shall </seg>
            <seg id="p286">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION contain more than c ne subject, . and the same shall be clearly ex - pressed in|the title.' It is argued by the company that the intention of the legis - lature was to limit the fixing of rural rates, in any event, to those cases where a physical connection was ordered by the Commis - sion, as provided in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 1 of the act of 15 25. With this view we are unable to agree. The language of the title clearly indicates that it was the intent - ion of the legislature to clothe the Commission with power and authority to make findings concerning rates and service concern - ing electric current distributed for light, heat or power purposes from the lines of companies engaged either in the generating, or transmitting of electric current for sale in the state for power or other purposes. Tt e latter part of Section 2 of the act above quoted, in oui opinion, clearly confers upon the Commission, upon application of any consumer, power to make investigation ana noia the necessarj hearings, and make a finding and order as to what reasonable rates should be charged to consumers of electric cur - rent for light, hes t or power purposes, and, from time to time, to make such reasoi able regulations as to the service which should be given to such co lsumer. We therefore, hold that the act of 1925 does confer upon the Commission jurisdiction, upon application of consumers, to hold hearings and determine what are reasonable rates for the furnish - ing of electric currmt to rural users along the transmission lines of companies engaged in the generation and transmission of elec - tric current for sal ;. The Commission further found and determined that the Comp - any, in the guise of a minimum charge, was exacting a service charge, in violaticn of section 70-506, Comp. St. ' Supp 1933. Said section provid is, among other things, that charges for elec - tric energy in certain designated classes shall be based solely on the amount of such energy actually furnished to the purchaser, and prohibits any servlcj charge, but does authorize a minimum charge to be collected. Section 70-508, Comp. St. Supp. 1933, provides penalties for a violation of j said section 70-506. Such sections do not purport to jive to the Commission any power to inflict the penalties. The act of 1925 confers upon the Commission the power to regulate rates, aid under that power the Commission is author - ized to determine whether the so-called minimum charge is reas - onable. Under the stipulation of the parties, that after the deter - mination of the question of jurisdiction a hearing should be had, we think that the Commission acted prematurely in making any </seg>
            <seg id="p287">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT determination of the question of the minimum charge. No action should have been taken thereon until a full hearing was had. It follows that the order of the Commission in determining that the Company was exacting a service charge for current in the guise of a minimum charge is vacated, and the order in all other res - pects Is affirmed.

            <seg id="p303">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT Part IV WAREHOUSES WAREHOUSE DEPARTMENT Tlie warehouse department consists of the administration of the Public Grain Warehouse Act of 1931 with amendatory acts, and the Farm Storage Act of 1933 with amendatory acts. By an amend - ment in 1933 to the Public Grain Warehouse Act the Commission was authorized to designate and appoint a supervisor of public grain warehouses. By an amendment in 1935 to the Farm Stor - age Act the Commission was authorized to appoint a supervisor of farm warehouses who shall have general charge of the administrat - ion of the act, subject to the directiom and orders of the Commis - sion. In the interest of economical management the Commission appointed the same person as supervisor of public grain warehouses and supervisor of farm warehouses, with his salary equally divided between the two activities. The supervisor has one regular assis - tant for public grain warehouse administration, and one reg - ular assistant for farm warehouse administration. He is furnished extra help in the farm storage administration as required. (1) FARM WAREHOUSES Senate File No. 327 of the 1933 Legislature provided for the storage of grain upon farms and the issuance of warehouse certi - ficates as security for loans. The administration of the act was given to the Railway Commission. When the act was passed it was not contemplated that the Federal Government would make loans to farmers upon grain stored on farms. The act gave the Commis - sion full authority to prescribe such rules and regulations as would be required for the proper administration of the act. By this elastic provision the Commission was able to meet all re - quirements of the Federal Government in the 1933 and 19 34 pro - grams for loans upon ear corn stored on the farms. The fee for inspection and issuance of certificates was fixed by the Legislature at $5.00 for the first one thousand bushels and one-half cent per bushel for all In excess of one thousand bushels. In the fall of 1933 when the Federal Government proposed to loan funds from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation through the Commodity Credit Corporation to farmers on ear corn stored on farms, we knew that the fee fixed by the Legislature would be in excess of the amount required for the administration, and we then announc - ed that we would request the 1935 Legislature to authorize us to return all excess fees to the persons entitled thereto. </seg>

An appropriation of $4,326.44 was made by the Legislature to pay the ex - pense of the Commission in determining the amount due each person and making of refunds. A warrant in the sum of $122,673.56 was delivered to the Com - issioi:, which was desposited with the First National Bank of Lincoln. Against this account we issued 42,757 checks. On De - cember 31, 1935, there was a balance in this account of $327.89 which represented checks returned unclaimed, checks lost or de - stroyed, and checks still in the hands of payees. From the appropriation of $4,326.44 the Commission expended $2.!&gt;7M.O4 in determining the amount due and making the refunds. The unexpended balance of $1,453.40 was on October 22, 1935, trans - ferred by the State Auditor from the special appropriation back to the Farm Warehouse funds. Amendments to the Farm Warehouse Act by the 1935 Legis - lature authorized the Commission by rule to fix the fee to be charged each applicant for a farm warehouse certificate, to fix the compensation of| farm warehouse inspectors, and required such in - spectors to give a bond for the faithful performance of their dut - ies in such sum as may be required by the Commission. These -amendments became effective March 29, 1935. Prior to that date fees were collected under the 1933 act. Subsequent to that date fees were collected by rules adopted by the Commission. Pursuant to these admendments the Commission adopted the following rules and regulations: </seg>

Order entered July 16, 1935. (2) PUBLIC GRAIN' WAREHOUSES In 1933 the Legislature appropriated $5,000.00 for the, admin - istration of the Public Grain Warehouse Act. The Legislature also amended the act to provide for the registration of grain ware - house receipts. . The purpose of the amendment was to make such receipts eligible as security for loans with the Federal Reserve Banks. A fee of fifty cents for the first one thousand bushels was fixed by the Legislature, and the Commission was authorized by rule to fix an additional fee for all grain in excess of one thousand bushels. By Resolution No. 130, adopted May 19, 1933, the Commission fixed the additional fee at twenty-five cents for each one thousand bushels or any part thereof for all grain over one thousand bushels. Owing to the iarge number of certificates registered by the Car - gill Grain Company, this fee proved to be excessive. On December 6. 1934. the Commission had a surplus of $2,384.60 which appear - ed at that time ample to sustain the work of registering public i;ruin warehouse certificates ' and the regulation of public grain warehouse untiL July 1, 1935. By motion on December 6. 1934, the fee for registration of public grain warehouse certificates was re - duced to the minimum fee of fifty cents per certificate until July 1. 1935. On June 25, 1935, the Commission on motion fixed the registration fee for the year beginning July 1, 1935, at fifty cents tor the first one thousand bushels and twenty cents for each thous - and bushels thereafter. From May 13, 1933, to December 31, 1934, the fees for the registration of public grain warehouse receipts were as follows: Cargill Warehouse Company $5,395.00 Gooch Milling Company 46.50 Aller Grain Company. 3.75 $5,445.25 By amendment to the Public Grain Warehouse Act made by the Legislature of 1935, the Commission was directed by order to fix reasonable storage rates for the ensuing year. Pursuant to this amendment the Commission adopted and approved General Order No. 66-A. as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p307">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT "ORDER "IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that all public grain warehouses regulated by this department, and within the meaning of Chapter 88 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, as amended, shall charge for the storage of grain for the year commencing July 1, 1935, the following rate, which rate shall cover the receiving, hand - ling, storing, delivering and storing of the grain: 'A fee of 1/30 of lc per day per bushel for each day the grain is stored with a minimum charge of lc per bushel if the grain is sold to the warehouseman, otherwise a minimum fee of 2c per bushel.' "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this rate shall be ef - fective at all public grain warehouses under the jurisdiction of and/or licensed by the Nebraska State Railway Commission during the year beginning July 1, 1935, unless said rate is sooner changed, altered or canceled by order of this Commis - sion." "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the above rates do not apply to elevators doing a terminal elevator business and lo - cated in towns or cities having a grain exchange. It is hereby ordered that such elevators abide by and comply with the rates fixed by such exchange for terminal elevators." By General Order No. 66, adopted May 21, 1935, the Commission adopted the following general rules and regulations: I. "For the proper enforcement and administration of the Pub - lic Grain Warehouse Act there is hereby created the position of Supervisor of Public Grain Warehouses. Such supervisor shall be a person experienced in the handling of grain and will be required to give bond in such form, amount and liability as may be required by the Commission.

The reports must show the amount of jrrain on hand for each day of the month, and a separate rep &gt;rt must be made for each kind of grain. VII. "Section 9, as amended, provides for optional registration with the Commission of warehouse receipts. The purpose of this amendment is to permit the owners of warehouse receipts to use the sime as collateral for loans at the Federal Reserve Banks. Th« minimum fee for registering each receipt is fifty cents when such receipt represents 1,000, or less, bushels of grain, and when such receipt represents more than 1,000 bushels of grain, the State Railway Commission is authorized to fix such additional fee as to make this provision of the act self-sust Uning. Pursuant to this section the Commission will, prior to July 1 of each year, by motion recorded In Its minutes, fix such additional fee. VIII. "Pursuant to Section 8 as amended by H. R.

On account of the explosion of the Cargill terminal elevator in the latter part of 1934, all stored grain had to be removed. During 1935 the elevator was repaired and received very little grain for storage. The Cargill fees for registration of warehouse receipts in 1935 amounted to only $718.30, while during 1933 and 1934 the Cargill registration fees amounted to $5,394.00. In 1935 all pub - lic grain warehouse receipts for registration of warehouse receipts, license fees and sales of receipt books amounted to $1,205.30. The expenses of administration for the same period amounted to $1,914.35, paid from fees, and $2,452.30 paid from the 1933 ap - propriation of $5,000. We asked the 1935 Legislature to make no appropriation for administration, but to add $5,000.00 to our wages and salary appropriation. The Legislature made no appropriation, but did ,not add the $5,000.00 to our wages and salary appropriation. Had it not been for the surplus of $2,187.95 in our fee account on January 1, 1935, and $889.50 collected for fees earned in 1934. the Public Grain Warehouse Department could not have functioned throughout the year of 1935. We believe the Public Grain Warehouse Act can and should be made self-sustaining from fees collected. This would require a sub - stantial increase of license fees and an additional fee for inspection of warehouses. In 1935 the Supervisor of Public Grain Warehouses made one hundred inspections. When his inspection reports are filed with the Commission, all persons having grain in storage are contacted by letter advising them of the amount of grain they have in j storage as shown by our records, and that if the amount is not cprrect to at once advise the Commission. This system not only is conducive to correction of errors, but the detection of any fraud in its inception. During 1935 not one error or any evidence of fraud was discovered. The present license fee of $5.00 per year is ".-fiisufficient for the services rendered, and we be- </seg>

No. 526 of the 1933 Legislature, provides all models of liquid fuel tractors offered for sale in Nebraska shall first be tested by a board of three engineers under the control of the State University management. The results of such tests are certified to the State Railway Commission and if the representatioi s made by manufacturer conform to the official test made by the University, the Commission issues permits for the sale of such tra( tors in Nebraska. Since 1930, It has been the custom of nearly all manufacturers to first submit a tractor model for testing and t ion to make their representations conform to the official test made by the University. We incorporate herein data from reports of official tests of the horsepower nit in for ten consecutive hours of continuous load at the draw bar and the amount and kind of fuel used in developing such horsepower &gt;f such tractor models as were on the market on December 31, 19::5, and upon which reports we have issued per - mits for sale in Nebraska: ! </seg>
