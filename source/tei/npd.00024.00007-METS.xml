            <seg id="p049">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD 49 Seventy Associations were in active operation and sul&gt; mitted reports to this Department at the close of business June 30, 1909, an- increase of two over the number reporting last Etake pleasure in calling your attention to the dat;t g the building and loan associations under your super - contained in this report, and especially to the statement preceding page showing the increases and decreases the year. Ee exceptionally strong condition shown is certainly ing. The increase of nearly four million dollars in luring the last year demonstrates not only the activity of these associations in the financial field, but shows conclu - sively that the people of the state appreciate and are taking advantage of the opportunities they offer. They occupy a place in the financial structure of the state peculiar to them - selves and differing materially from all other financial or - ganizations contemplated by law. As the earned increment of the state increases in volume and the small saver and home builder increases, the field of building and loan associations widens and their usefulness becomes more apparent. I feel safe in predicting that in the years to come the foundations upon which these associations have been built in the beginning will be found to have been laid with great wisdom. No other state has used greater pre - caution for the protection of borrower and stockholder, and I believe no other state has a law which adheres more tena - ciously to the theory of mutuality, which is an ultimate corner stone of all building and loan associations. There has not been a building and loan failure in the state since the present law went into effect in 1899, and there are no "get-rich-quick" Home Co-operative installment in - vestment companies licensed to do business in the state.
