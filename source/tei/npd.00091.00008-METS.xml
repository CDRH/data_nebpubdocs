PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS We meet at this time, not only at the entrance to a new year, but also at the entrance to a new decade, under conditions which in my opinion portend a better outlook lor the future. lam firmly of the opinion that our combined efforts as we go forward to lay the ground work for the State Fair of 1940 and prepare for it in all its details, that we may from the outset, be justified in feeling a greater degree of confidence than has attended our efforts for a number of years here - tofore. One of the bright spots is the White Spot, a heavy blanket of snow all over the state, which has given to each and every one of us a feeling somehow of renewed confidence of even greater precipitation.

         <seg id="p011">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture which was similar in pavt to that of a number ot preceding years, to - gether with nearly a decade of depression, the temptation to many of us many times was to throw up our hands in despair and disgust. But the spirit of fight, that has made Nebraska all that it is today, was in us and as leaders in this great agricultural state, we hare fought back the forces of dissolution and dismay, until today we may confidently survey a happier horizon and I transmit to you at this time the confi - dent expectation that we are on the way to higher ground in our ef - forts for the future and especially in the building of the State Fair of 1940. ...'V- j:. .; . !- ; -;¦ ¦ '. . ;: . •' ¦ ' The State Board of Agriculture is one of the pioneer organizations of the state. Robert W. Furnas in the year 1858 conceived the necessity of establishing a territorial Board of Agriculture for Nebraska and being the duly accredited member to the Territorial Council from Ne - maha County, he prepared and on Friday, the 4th day of September, 1858, introduced a bill to establish a Territorial Board of Agriculture. On Monday, September 27, it was read the second time and referred to the Committee on Agriculture consisting of Mills S. Reeves, John R. Porter and Charles McDonald, who on Tuesday, the 28th, recommend - ed said bill for passage. On Thursday, September 30, it was reported as correctly engrossed and sent to the House of Representatives who passed and returned same on October 13. It was signed and approved by W. A. Richardson, Territorial Governor. Since that time many noted Nebraskans have been members of this organization and have helped mould the progress of the state. It was J. Sterling Morton, while a member of this organization, at a Board meeting held on January 4, 1872, offered the following resolu - tion, "Resolved: That Wednesday, the 10th day ot April, 1872, be and the same is hereby set apart and" consecrated for tree planting in the state of Nebraska, and the State Board of Agriculture hereby name it 'Arbor Day' and to urge upon the people of the state the vital impor - tance of tree planting, hereby offer a special premium of f 100.00 to the county agricultural society of that county in Nebraska which shall upon that day plant properly the largest number of trees, and a farm library of twenty-five dollars worth of books to that person who on that day shall plant properly in Nebraska the greatest number of trees." This great tree planting program was started within this orga - nization and was later established by the legislature and became a day of national importance. This is only one of the many accomplishments of this Board. • As one of the duties given this Board was the holding of the State Fair, it is to that phase of our work that I will now refer to. The his - tory of the Nebraska State Fair since this Board was organized has been a recital of agricultural achievement. History records the fair as </seg>
         <seg id="p012">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture an ancient institution. For centuries fairs have played an important part in the life of communities and nations, promoting the interests of the community or the nation by showing to the world the progress made in agriculture, art, industry, science and other fields of endeav - or. In this the Fair has been distinctly educational and beneficial, while affording pleasure and entertainment. For more than seventy years it has been the Nebraska State Fair's opportunity to show to the world the progress made in the growth of our state from wild prairie to a community of 1,300,000 people devoted to the development and great - est use of our resources of whatever nature. The continuous story thus presented in annual chapters by the state fair has been one of drama, a story of struggle against criticism, economics and climatic handicaps, and of triumph over besetting difficulties. The past nine years have been a very difficult time for the Fair. I recall quite vividly when 1 started work with this Board of Managers seven years ago, with Perry Reed as Secretary, and other members who have helped to steer the ship safely through much troubled water, at the outset we found a deficit of $98,000.00 and with bills and premiums unpaid exhibits had fallen off and the legislative appropriation had been reduced. Many of the buildings were in bad repair and with drouth and depression it was discouraging. Nor do I need to go back any further than the 1939 Fair to mention some of the adverse conditions that interfered with our progress to such an extent that at the time the damage done was hard to compute. You recall that on Veteran's Day, September 3, the world received the horrifying -word that what appeared at the time and has since been confirmed, another World War had broken loose. Whether we liked it or not it started instantly a new chain of thought in every mind, and a changed conversation on every tongue, many people want - ed to stay by their radios to hear the latest news from abroad. Then - even the elements turned against us in the worst combination ot wind, dust and heat that made it seem like nature itself was conspiring against us. I mention these facts to remind you how like a rocket out of a clear sky these events can occur and which in the aggregate mean such tremendous and unavoidable loss in attendance to the Fair. But with ail these adverse conditions we had a good fair and the Secreta - ry's report will show a large increase in entries in many of the depart - ments and a balance on the right side of the ledger. And while some - times it was discouraging, it has been a pleasure for me to be a mem - ber of this organization. n. At this time I wish to thank the members of the Board of Agricul - ture, County Fairs, and all who took a part in making the 1939 NeJ braska State Fair the success that it was, and ask for your continued support and cooperation for the 1940 Nebraska State Fair. MR. BOYD: Gentlemen, you have listened to ttie President's ad- </seg>
         <seg id="p013">; Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture dress. If there is no objection I move the address be approved as read. It is approved. . . •. ¦ PRESIDENT SHUBERT: (Resuming chair.) Thank you, Mr. Boyd. Now, Gentlemen, this is one of the most important.things, I think, to come before you this afternoon, or any other time; that is, the report of the secretary on general conditions. SECRETARY'S REPORT '¦ 1 ¦ ¦ :.' ' - ¦.. '-¦.¦¦ ¦ '¦¦'¦'.¦¦ ¦ In compliance with the Statutes it is my duty at this time to make a report of the proceedings and financial standing of the State Board of Agriculture for the year 1939. This year must be classed as very unsatisfactory for agriculture, as at least three-fourths of the state was classed in the "drouth area. This, with the depression, the thous - ands on relief and other thousands on W. P. A. does not tend to help the financial status of the people of the state. It is a difficult problem for the Board, with these conditions prevailing, to put on a state fair. However, I ffel that the 1939 State Fair was a credit to the state in spite of some adverse publicity and misstatements put out by some critics of the Board. : . .;.,-.-¦..¦ : ¦ . . Attendance The paid admissions at the 1939 state fair were 95,875. However, we could claim an attendance of 180,000 it we counted our attendance on the same basis as some state fairs. For example, on Sunday, Veter - an's Day, which is the largest day in attendance, all veterans, mem - bers of their 46 units of bands, drum corps, drill teams, those taking part in the program and their wives, were admitted free. All children up to twelve years of age are admitted free the entire week and on Tuesday, Children's Day, all high school children, their teachers and county superintendents are admitted free. Others admitted free include members of 16 bands, attraction people, carnival people and their em - ployees, superintendents of the various departments of the fair, jud - ges, clerks, ticket sellers, ticket takers, public safety men, owners of race horses—their wives, jockeys and grooms, helpers in the horse show and helpers in the live stock departments. The seventeen state institutions each have an exhibit, their help and many of the inmates are brought in by bus and admitted free. The Fish and Game Commis - sion exhibits at the Fair and their help and representatives are admitt - ed free. Free admission is granted to 2,000 4-H Club boys and girls. The president and secretary of each county fair in Nebraska were issued tickets. The Lancaster County Fair is held on the grounds at the same time as the State Fair and we furnish season ticketß to their officials and directors as well as apace for their exhibits and, stalla'for their Uve Btock. The editors ol the country newspapers thaC attended </seg>
         <seg id="p014">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the Fair were piven a refund. Also, there were 73 press passes issued of which the State Journal and Star received 55, they also receive 270 daily admission tickets for their carriers. The radio stations received 3 4 season passes. Most of these people are in attendance at the lair the entire week. It is not fair to compare our number of paid admissions with the attendance figures given out by some state fairs as for instance in 1938 the Kansas State Fair at Hutchlnson, gave out an attendance ol 250,000 but when asked for the number of paid admissions they re - plied—Bs,96o. Our 180,000 does not count the number in attendance at the seven days of races held before and after in connection with the, fair. Also, our Fair is only a six day fair while the other fairs have from seven to fourteen days. I want to read a letter here in regard to some criticism that was given out on the fair. I cut out some of the articles that were in the papers, and one of them ran something like this, it says: "Nebraska, whose state fair attendance fell to the pitiful low figure of 60,000; the best comparison ot all with Nebraska is Kansas, whose farm popula - tion is about the same, and whose crops and agriculture have suffered to the same degree", then he goes on to tell that Hutchlnson had 250, - -000, and Topeka had 300,000 people. I cut out some of these clippings and sent them to the secretary of the Kansas State Fair, and after a few days I received this letter: Hutchinson, Kansas. November 30, 1939. Mr. Perry Reed, Secretary, Nebraska State Fair, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Reed: I regret very much that my absence from the office much of the last two weeks has made it impossible for me to answer your letter of the 20th until today. Since reading reports in the Billboard and elsewhere regarding the State Fair situation in Lincoln, I have been very much distressed at the apparent lack of cooperation given the fair by residents of Lin - coln and perhaps some of the other large cities of the state. Your an - nounced paid attendance figure for 1939 of 95,875 seems to me to be a splendid record especially when consideration is given the extreme droughty condition of the entire state at and before fair time. At least it is absolutely unfair to compare this figure with those announced by the State Fair here and the free fair at Topeka. lam frank to admit that our attendance figure of 250,000 is more or less an estimate and </seg>
         <seg id="p015">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture probably is in excess of the actual number of persons on the grounds during the week counting all concession people, 4-H members, mem - bers and followers of the 34 high school bands; employees, and others entering on complimentary tickets. I am equally certain and indeed more so that Topeka's 400,000 or 500,000 is very highly exaggerated, in fact it would be next to impossible to crowd that many people on their 40 acre fair grounds in seven days. For the purpose of comparison, it seems to me that all fairs should get together and agree either to announce paid attendance or total at - tendance figures. To the concession people, those entering the grounds on passes are potential customers the same as those that pay, so it really appears logical that the total attendance figures should be the one 3 given. Our Superintendent of Admissions has as yet never turned over tome the records of his office so it will'be impossible for me to give you the exact number of paid admissions at our 1939 fair at this time. In the way of a rough estimate I would say that I do not believe our figure will exceed the one you have announced. SECRETARY REED: And I might say that I saw Mr. Mitchell in Chicago, and he said that their attendance in paid admission was not up to ours. State Pair Exhibits Class A—Horse Department. The draft horse show was very much of an improvement over the past few years. There were 39 exhibitors with 302 entries compared with 26 exhibitors with 202 entries in 1938. With the additional stalls in the new Horse and Pony Barn we were compelled to turn down the entries of several good breeders that wish - ed to come from the fairs at lowa and Minnesota. Many of the winners at our show were winners at other state fairs/ ! Class B—Beef Cattle Department. The Beef Cattle show was an improvement over previous shows. There were 44 exhibitors with 509 j entries compared with 32 exhibitors and 403 entries in 1938. Class B—Dairy Cattle Department. In the Dairy Cattle show there were 61 exhibitors with 362 entries compared with 60 exhibitors with 367 entries in 1938. Class C—Swine Department. In the Swine Show there were 72 exhibitors with 782 entries compared with 58 exhibitors and 606 en - tries in 1938. ' Class D—Sheep Department. In the Sheep show there were 25 ex - hibitors with 280 entries in 1939 compared with 29 exhibitors and 338 entries for 1938. </seg>
         <seg id="p016">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Class E—Poultry Department. The Poultry Show was larger than previous years with 91 exhibitors and 975 entries compared with 74 exhibitors with 756 entries in 1938. Class E — Pigeon Department. The Pigeon show has grown to such an extent that there is hardly room for it in the Poultry Building. There were 103 exhibitors with 810 entries and birds shown compared with 78 exhibitors with 700 entries in 1938. Class F Farm Products Department. This department had one of the finest agricultural exhibits ever in Agricultural Hall. There were 4,579 entries compared with 4,173 entries in 1938. There were 21 county collective exhibits compared with 19 in 1938. Class G—Horticulture Department. There were 1,051 entries in this exhibit this year with 904 in 1938. i Class H—Domestic Products Department. We had to arrange extra space for this department this year. There were 2,767 entries this year compared with 2,388 in 1938. Class I—Bees and Honey Department. In this department there were 77 entries compared with 69 in 1938. Class J —Needle Work Department. In this department there were 1,755 entries compared with 1,814 In 1938. Class X—Fine Arts Department. This was one of the fine exhibits and created a great deal of interest. There were 1,824 entries this year compared with 1,803 in 1938. Class L —Educational Department. The premium list in this de - partment was entirely revamped by the county superintendents and the educational people. With the enlarged classification it would be hard to compare the number of entries with 1938. In the spelling contest division there were 30 entries in 1939 com - pared with 1938 entries of 22. The rural school chorus was well attended considering the ex - treme heat on that day. The Spelling Contest and Rural School Chorus is held on Tuesday of the Fair which is Children's Day. The Chamber of Commerce again donated prizes for the children and the Pair Board donated bicycles. Class X—Horseshoe Pitching Contest. Renewed interest was shown in this department of the Fair. Last year there were only 18 contestants, this year there were 30. Class O —Baby Health Contest. There were 188 entries in this contest this year with 206 In 1938. The department is limited to 200 </seg>

There were 46 bands, drum corps and drill teams marching in the pa - rade in front of the grandstand on that day. The parade and the speeches make it a very patriotic occasion. The rodeo was put on after the Veteran's program which gave many people the opportunity to see the Fair and entertainment that could not attend on any other day. The grandstand attractions, I believe, were a3 good on an average as any we ever had. Graham's Western Riders were outstanding, the Aerial Ballet was one of the finest aerial acts of the year. The Aerial Bauers was also one of the best acts of its kind. Other ol the free acts included Edna Alee and Company, world's champion trick and fancy revolver shot; the Ross Brothers, hand balancers, champions in their class; the Bento Four with two thrill acts; the Les Safyres, two lady acrobats; and the clown, Red Carter, stole the show with his acts and songs. Several afternoons the wind was so strong that it was impossible for the high acts to perform. The rodeo had some good bucking horses and Brahma steers ridden by some of the best cowboys in the game, including Everett Shaw, who placed sixth in the standing ol cowboys in the United States for 1939, also Hub and Jim Whiteman, Kid Rob - erts and Milton Freel placed high in the 1939 national cowboy stand - ings competed at our Fair. The band of 25 Indians with their dances was something new for the Fair. The Everett Johnson Cowboy Band from New York was one of the best entertaining bands ever on the grounds. </seg>
         <seg id="p019">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Many in attendance at the Horse Show, which was held in the Coliseum five nights this year, said it was the best ever held at the Fair. There were approximately 200 more entries than last year and nearly fifty more head of horses entered than 1938. The running races were the best we ever had as there were 300 head of race horses on the grounds competing in the races. . Carnival .i ¦ . ¦ '¦ ¦ ¦ '.¦¦.. ¦ There has been much talk and criticism of the carnival on the midway. The Fairly and Little Shows that we contracted with last year also were at the Missouri and Kansas State Fairs. Mr. Green and Mr. Mitchell, secretaries of those fairs, told us in Chicago that they had no complaints against the carnival at their fairs. We have a section in our contract with the carnivals that states no exhibit or concession which is prohibited by the laws of the State of Nebraska shall be put on the midway. The Board does not sanction any shows or concessions that are deemed unlawful but it is impossible for members of the Board to be present at all times to see how they are conducted. We have made a tentative contract with the Goodman Wonder Shows, one of the larger midway attractions, with the contract reading that they will cut out all games and objectionable concessions that are not approved by local officials. . Advance Sale Tickets ; The advance sale of tickets at a reduced price has been adopted by a number of state fairs and the Board decided to try the plan out. 45,000 tickets were ordered—one lot of 5 tickets in a book at $1.50 and another book of 10 tickets for $2.50. These were on sale up to August 26. 42,000 were sold. This plan gave many people an opportun - ity to attend the Fair for twenty-five cents it they purchased their tick - ets in advance. Agricultural Activities Each biennlum the legislature appropriates a certain amount for agricultural activities to the State Board of Agriculture as custodians of this fund and the Board apportions this money to the different as - sociations. The last legislature cut this appropriation from $15,000 to $10,000 for the biennium. This made it necessary for the Board to change the allotment to each society and the following amounts were allowed: . .'..-..¦¦¦'¦ Improved Live Stock Breeders Association .......$1,000.00 State Crop Growers A550ciati0n..!................. 1,100.00 State Dalrymens Association... 1,100.00 </seg>

Finances and Improvements The 19 3 9 legislature, while working in the interests of economy, made a cut in our appropriation for the biennium from $51,600 to $4S 750. This put on a yearly basis of $24,375. with $9,400 of this amount for maintenance. Our maintenance expense for keeping up the buildings and grounds amounted to $33,723.02 or $9,400 more than the entire amount received from the state for our own use. The grand - stand receipts amounted to $15,040.88 which we must turn over to the First Trust Company for the bondholders. If we figure on the same basis as other state fairs, that have the use of their grandstand re - ceipts we are running the fair on an appropriation from the state ot $9,335 and of this amount $4,700 must be spent on 4-H boys and givls club work. The last five years all bills and premiums have been paid in full. The total appropriation received from the legislature for those years was ?124 800. During those years we expended $159,814.39 for main - tenance and upkeep ot the buildings and grounds or $35 0143£(more than we received from the state for our own use. Also, $7,654.48 was paid on bills contracted in former years. During those years we paid out in premiums to the exhibitors $117,398.35 and turned over to the First Trust Company for the bondholders $73,425.35. On January Ist we had a balance of $4,651.42.

PRES. SHUBERT: Gentlemen the next order of business now will be nominations for candidates for membership to the State Board, and they are by districts, starting with District No. 1, on down to No. 5 Now in the first district these names that I read off are the ones whose term expires this year, and the first is W. B. Banning, of Un - ion; L. C. Chapin, of Lincoln; and R. C. Johnson of Mead; and D. W. Osb'orn of Pawnee City. We are ready for nominations. I think now that we are all set to go, and you have your prem - ium books there and you can determine by that book'how many mem - bers whose terms expire and who they are, and make your nominations accordingly. We are now ready. MR MIILLE: I would like to suggest at this time that this body grant the privilege of voting to Eddie Schultz, a member of the board in Antelope County. Mr. Watkins is not here, and I understand that Mr McCall is not here, and I think it would be no more than fair to grant Antelope County that privilege of voting as long as one member of the board is here. PRES. SHUBERT: Now, would you make that as a motion, Mr. Millie. MR. MIILLE: Yes, I make that as a motion. PRBS. SHUBERT: And do I hear a second? A DELEGATE: Second the motion. PRBS SHUBERT: It has been moved and seconded that we sit Senator Schultz in this meeting. Now, all in favor of that motion will make It known by saying, "Aye." Contrary, "No." The motion is carried. Senator Schultz, will you stand up just a minute so that I can see that you are comfortably situated here, and we would like to have these men and what ladles we have to see this handsome young senator here- and we are mighty glad to have him here with us this afternoon, and we hope that he will stay with us and feel like voting, possibly for the bills we want later on. Nomination were made for the five districts as follows: FIRST DISTRICT —D. W. Osborn, Pawnee City; W. 0. Buel, Hick - man; R. C. Johnson, Mead; W. B. Banning, Union; L. C.

         <seg id="p034">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. MIDLE: I move the adoption of this report, Mr. Chairman. Said motion was duly seconded, and after discussion from the floor was qualified to the effect that the judges should be instructed to adhere to the provision appearing on page 119 of the premium list, regarding maximum numbers of varieties submitted; and with the understanding that the judges would be so instructed, said motion was put to a vote, and by the chair declared carried. MR. MIILLE: Just pardon me, Mr. Chairman. I forgot one thing. Now, on the school department, there are several changes in the score, and sometime back we had a school committee come in on this, and it has been worked out and an advance sheet has been sent out, and this is the form (indicating), and this has gone out, the secretary say's to everyone, and I presume you probably have it, maybe haven't looked over it; but that is the report of the changes, and that meets the ap - proval of a committee selected from the different schools and super - intendents along with our secretary, who worked that out. We think it 13 agreeable to all. MR. SORRELL: We adopted it at our annual meeting. MR. MIILLE: Yes, thanks. PRES. SHUBERT: Do we need another motion? Mr. Reed thinks we need another motion doing away with this. Will someone make the motion, then, that we permit this change to be made as to this matter you are discussing. MR. SORRELL: I will make that motion. Said motion duly seconded and upon being put to vote declared carried. PRES. SHUBERT: All right now, is there anything that anyone wants to do? I think so far as the business is concerned that concludes every - thing; but I do want to say to you this: We have the banquet tonight at 6:15, and we would like to see you out tonight. Then tomorrow morning let's come back after we have had a lot of fun at the ban - quet, and you can take it from me, I have heard this man two or three times, and he's swell. So come back here promptly at 9 o'clock in the morning. Whereupon said meeting was adjourned until 0 o'clock A.

Banner County wasn't able to get any of. their authorized delegates down here. They paid their dues and sent in their report as the law requires. Mrs. Lee, who has been very active in the fair there, is here and would like to represent them. The President has asked her to do that, and she voted here two years ago in the election from Banner County. I want to make a motion that she be seated as the regular dele - gate. -.-¦.¦¦¦ ¦ ¦ ¦", .¦".-. \ A DELEGATE: I second the motion. PRES. SHUBERT: Now, I am not so sure that I got this just exactly straight. I don't think, Mr. Steele, that I got the name of this party. '¦¦-.. .'..'¦¦¦ ¦ - " . ¦ '';; ¦' MR. STEELE: Mrs. Lee. PRBS. SHUBERT: Mrs. Lee to represent ... MR. STEELE: Banner County. PRES. SHUBERT: Banner County. That is the question are you ready for the question? MR. BAILEY: Mr. President. ; PRBS. SHUBERT: Mr. Bailey. : MR. BAILEY: Gentlemen of the Convention; The request was brought to the Credentials Committee previous to the calling of this house to order, and the Credentials Committee have been working on this proposition. We looked over the credentials from Banner County, and we do not find the name of Mrs. Lee connected with the Banner Fair. I give this statement for your information. It seems as though it requires a suspension of the rules and by-laws, which would mean a two-thirds vote if this predominate. </seg>
         <seg id="p036">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRES. SHUBERT: Now, I am just going to be frank with you. I don't just exactly know what the proper procedure Is, so will Mr. Bailey, under the heading of "further report of the Credentials Com - mittee," would that matter be taken up under that? Or is it time to put this to a vote? I don't know. MR. BAILEY: Mr. President, in answer to that question I would 3ay this be taken up later on when it is time for that committee to report. This motion made at this time is out of order and just a little previous to the time the Committee on Credentials is supposed to report. MR. STEELE: If I am out of order, Mr. Chaiman, I would be very willing to withdraw until the proper time to make the motion. PRES. SHUBERT: I think probably that would be the better way to do. I think what we are going to do now, we are going to have a fur - ther report of the Credentials Committee and see what they have to say on that. MR. BAILEY: Mr. President, we would like ten minutes. PRES. SHUBERT: All right. They ask for ten minutes, so we will grant that. Now, is the party here that wanted about two or three minutes before this body, while we have got just about ten minutes or a little less? Did you want the floor, Mr. Johnson? MR. R. C. JOHNSON: I didn't want ten minutes, Mr. Chairman. PRES. SHUBERT: I know that, but there are other things to do besides that. MR. JOHNSON: Mr. Chairman, and Fair Managers of Nebraska, and Friends: After all you know it isn't any secret that I have been considered as a candidate for secretary of the State Fair, and this morning at the breakfast table, not influenced by anyone, I have de - cided to withdraw; not in favor of anyone, but for the good of Ne - braska and the Nebraska State Fair. . I think I realize, and you do too, that we need the cooperation of all to make any fair function in these conditions that we live in now. I have no axe to grind with anyone, the other candidates mentioned are particular friends of mine, and always have been. I am only sorry that there has been some things published that I never sanctioned in the newspapers, but I have always said that misstatements made better </seg>
         <seg id="p037">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture reading than the statements that you make, better reading for the newspapers. Now, I dont' want to be misstated, of course, that they! make better reading; but many times, they don't know the facts, doa'tj know the truth. I am sure a lot of things have been published about! the State Fair Board in all papers of Nebraska in the last 12 months or I 24 months knowing that it has been part of the truth. Some things) have been true, but the truth half spoken is sometimes more injurious: to a character or an organization than the thing—well, I will call it a! lie. A half truth does more injury than a falsehood. Now, I don't want to take any time, but I wanted this convention to know at the outset, and I have been influenced by no group or body, but I have decided of my own free will and accord to not be considered; as a candidate for secretary. . I thank you. (applause). • . PRES. SHUBERT: Now, Gentlemen, while waiting on the Creden - tials Committee, I don't believe we can do much about it until we get a report. That is the way I feel about it anyway. I have two or three good lawyers down here, one on each, side of me, I think, to keep me straight; otherwise it would be a pretty hard thing to do. I wonder-right at this time if there is onyone else that has any - thing to say. If they do we can probably give them two or three min - utes before the Credentials Committee comes back to make the final report. . ¦ : : ' : Now, if there isn't I wonder if the Resolutions Committee is ready to report. .'..'• ANDY J. WELCH: The Resolutions Committee has nothing to report, on. . . PRES. SHUBERT: Nothing to report on. That is a kind of a red letter, isn't It? \ , MR. WELCH: Yes. PRES. SHUBERT: Now, men, I know this may be just a little bit tiresome. If some of you would come up here and talk it might do some good, but I don't think we can do anything until that Credentials Com - mittee comes in, and we can probably get a little more^nformation; ao we can tell whether this delegate should be seated or*not; I am sure I don't know. The way the matter stands now they are looking into it. It seems to me that while we are waiting we might congratulate; Mr. Steele and the helpers that he had down there with him last night. We had a lot of fun and heard a good speech, at least from the man from Kansas City. It seems to me like what he talked on last night, if we j </seg>
         <seg id="p038">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture woke up to a lot of that we might be in a better frame of mind this morning to do what business we have to do. Anyhow, it is a good cold day outside, and maybe we won't hurry off, and if we lose a few min - utes here it won't hurt anyway, so if you will just be patient a few minutes I think we can easily count on the return of the Credentials Committee to thresh this thing out. (At this point the convention was at ease for a few minutes.) The Credentials Committe is now ready to make their final report. MR. BAILEY: Mr. President, the Credentials Committee have the pleasure at this time to submit a supplemental report. The report stands as submitted yesterday, with the exception of Mr. Lemley, from Butler County. Their credentals weren't quite in shape, the name of Mr. Lemley did not appear on the credentials, but he being secretary of the Butler County Pair, he came before our committee and said the election was held and he was elected the regular delegate to this con - vention, but inadvertently forgot to insert his name on the credentials. The Committee felt justified in allowing him to place his name on the credentials at this time, he being the secretary of the Butler County Fair. On the matter of Mrs. Lee being seated for Banner County, the Credentials Committee respectfully makes this report; that we have again gone over the credentials of Banner County, and we do not find the name of Mrs. Lee connected with the Banner County Fair. The Credentials Committee in every instance has attempted to go according to the rules and regulations just as near as possible. We feel that we don't have the power as a committee of three to suspend the rules of this organization in recommending the seating of Mrs. Lee this morn - ing. We feel as though if she had been—her name had appeared on the Credentials the committee Is Inclined to be very lenient; how - ever, we could not violate the rules of this organization by seating or making the request that Mrs. Lee be seated, because it will require a suspension of the rules, and the Credentials Committee is powerless to do that. Therefore, this is the final supplement to our report as submitted yesterday; and, Mr. President, I move now that the report be accepted, and that the committee be discharged. MR. PURCELL: I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. Said motion, upon being put to a vote, was declared carried by the chair. MR. STEELE: Mr. Chairman, I want to beg your pardon for mak - ing a motion which was out of order here this morning. I didn't real - ize, which I should have, that the motion was out of order. </seg>
         <seg id="p039">- - ¦"¦;.' .. ¦ : I' ' ¦ : Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Now, I want to make the motion to suspend the rules and seat Mrs. Lee as official delegate of Banner County. A DELEGATE: I second the motion. : PHES. SHUBERT: It has been moved and seconded that the rules be suspended and that Mrs. Lee be admitted as a delegate. Now, are you ready for the question? - ¦ ' . ¦. ¦ ¦¦ ' • ¦¦ . ¦ - i MR. BAILEY: Mr. President, in the suspension of the rules it will require a two thirds vote. I think it will be necessary for a roll call on the proposition. PRES. SHUBERT: It takes a two-thirds vote, now, on that mo - tion." ¦-¦¦ ;¦'/¦¦.•¦'•'.• ¦:'¦¦ ¦¦. ¦ ¦.:-.¦': ..•"¦¦ ¦.•-¦ ¦ MR STEELB: Mr. Chairman, just in support of this motion I made I might explain who Mrs. Lee is. Mrs. Lee is County Superlnend - ent of Banner County, and owing to that being a small county and very few people there to do the actual work, Mrs. Lee really does the work of the County Fair Board. I know she done all of the soliciting of funds to support the fair, and takes care of the big end of the 4-H club work; so you will know that she is "Fair-minded," the same as with the rest of you people; and she was the official delegate two years ago. PRES. SHUBERT: Now, as I understand it will take a two-thirds vote to carry this question, and I want to read a little here to show you the position that I see to take on it. It says, "No county agri - cultural association will be allowed to vote in Annual Meeting of the State Board of Agriculture unless they have held a | fair the preceding year, and filed a report as inquired by law," Now, that seems plain to me, and if they don't have the proper creden - tials —I know it would be a shame to deny someone a seat and a vote in this body if they are entitled to it, but it they are not entitled to it, of course it wouldn't be the tbing to do. Now, the chair is going to rule that it we take this vote that it will be by ballot, and as I understand, it takes a two-thirds majority to carry. . Now, do you still insist on taking the vote? MR. STEELE: Yes sir, we want a vote on it, and we will be will - ing to stand on the two-thirds rule. ' MR. BANNING: Mr. Chairman, might we not be overstepping the report that was just passed here? Didn't the committee make a report that she could not; be seated, or what? ; PRES. SHUBERT: Yes, I don't know but what there is a motion before the house to that effect; that the report of the Credentials Com - mittee'be accepted and the committee be discharged. </seg>
         <seg id="p040">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. BANNING: It was carried too. We don't want to get tangled up. MR. SORRELL: Mr. President, may I ask a question? Is it per - missible, according to our constitution, to vote and to suspend the rules by a two-thirds majority? I feel it might be In the constitution. Is it in there? PRES. SHUBERT: Not that I know of. The only thing I found is what I read just a minute ago. It seemed to me that if they call for a vote on this and they rule that it takes a two-thirds vote, that we ought to vote by ballot. I may be wrong, I don't claim to knoyr very much. MR. BANNING: According to parliamentary rules isn't it always permissible to suspend the rules of any organization? PRES. SHUBERT: How about the two-thirds vote? MR BANNING: I don't know about that, I wouldn't say; but I believe they have the power to demand a two-thirds vote. I think it is always permissible to suspend the rules, and I think the majority in most cases carries. MR. BAILEY: Mr. President, may I have the floor for a minute? I hold in my hand a copy of the Nebraska State Fair By-Laws and Cons - titution. On page 17 of this book, if you will read paragraph 11, "The Constitution and By-Laws of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture may be amended or altered at the annual meeting by a two-thirds vote of the members present." Now, is that correct? MR. BANNING: Mr. Chairman, I think that it is specifically stat - ed it takes a two-thirds rule; but in the average case I think the ma - jority do decide; but with this in the rule here you have to follow. Otherwise the majority rules anyway, if you take it that way. MR. STEELB: I don't see any use of Quibbling on this, question of a two-thirds rule; we are willing to stand on the two-thirds vote. Let's go. PRES. SHUBERT: Are you willing to take that by ballot? MR. STEELE: Yes sir. PRES. SHUBERT: All right, we will do that. We will take a two - thirds vote, and that ought to settle It. I don't pretend to know par - liamentary rules. I hoped that you fellows wouldn't tie me up. If nec - essary we can stay here all day, I don't want to go home anyway until tomorrow. The secretary will call the roll on this question. </seg>

I will rule that that is what they do; MR. STEELE: You see, the board members have a vote and the county delegates have a vote. PRBS. SHUBERT: Yes. MR.

SHUBBRT: The question is this: That those in favor of seating this lady as a delegate will vote "Yes," and if you are against it vote "No;" and the secretary will call the roll, and as the roll is called get your ballots and drop them in the hat.

Now, Gentlemen, you are ready to vote. Now, all of those who have two votes just put in one of your tickets, because they will have to call the roll again, and when the roll is called again the tellers will take up your other ballot.

Mr. Reed spent a long time in the legislature; of which he was an acknowldged leader in both the Senate and House, and during his various terms has done a great deal towards fair worfc I think that we are indebted to him to a very great extent for the work he has done. It was my pleasure as president to appoint him on the Board of Managers, and I never felt I had any rea - son to regret that act. I think after we have listened to the report he made of the progess the fair has made It certainly is a credit to this organization that we have gone on and have got through such years as the past two or three years under the conditions of the country and state and still we are out of debt. I would place in nomination Perry Reed for secretary. MR. MATZKE: I wish to place in nomination the name ot a man for secretary of the State Board of Agriculture who has the interests of the^State Fair and Nebraska at heart; I have in mind the name of a man who will command the confidence of the people of the State of Nebraska. As to his ability to work for the best interests of the State Pair you members of the Board of Agriculture have had ample proof. There 1b not one of you but what can conscientiously say that from the standpoint of meeting exhibitors, of the general conduct of the policies of the fair, this man has done that which has been conductive to the best interests of our State Fair. Without any reflection on any other officer of the State Fair Board, without any reflection on any of those that have served, a number of us believe that for the best interests of our State Pair, to help our State Pair to conimand the respect and the support that it should from not only the county fair group, tout from all those throughout the state, I place in nomination the name of E. J. Millie for secretary. |. •''•"¦ ' PRES. SHUBERT: Now, wasn't there a nomination over here that hadn't been put? MR. MATZKE: No. PRES; SHUBERT: Are there any other nominations? ¦ : If there are none we will vote this by ballot, as I understand it;;if you you will prepare the ballots. ; .. • ¦¦! A DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman, I move that the nominations be closed before you paBB out the ballots. : </seg>
         <seg id="p046">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Said motion duly seconded and upon being put to vote was by the chair declared carried. PRBS. SHUBERT: Now, I think you all have paper and probably ready to vote, and the secretary will call the roll. SECRETARY REED: (Calls the roll). PRES. SHUBERT: Now, have all voted who wish? If so I will declare the ballot. A DELEGATE: (Interrupting) Mr. Chairman, here's a gentlemen here from Red Willow County. MR. HARRISON: I just came in. PRBS. SHUBERT: We would have to tind out from the Creden - tials Committee, I think, if Ms credentials are proper. MR. HARRISON: My name is Harrison, and I am from Red Willow County; I have been there for 55 years in Red Willow County. PRES. SHUBERT: I am sorry sir; but as I understand it we have discharged that committee, there would be no one to act and I don't believe it would be fair. I am mighty sorry about it. I wish you had been here sooner. MR. HARRISON: I just came in. PRES. SHUBERT: I think you can see the position we are in; that the committee that handled the credentials has been discharged, and it would be impossible, I think, to consider you. MR. HARRISON: All right. MR. PURCELL: Mr. Chairman, the Committee wants to tind out if he's a regularly elected delegate, or a president. MR. HARRISON: I am the vice-president. Elmer DeMay is the president. MR. PURCELL: While the committee has been discharged; the gentlemen is vice-president and not the president of the lair. If he was president of the fair he would be entitled to that by reason of his place, if he had the credentials as a delegate he would be entitled to be considered; but so far as I know he's neither. PRES. SHUBERT: Well, let me say this: We have a report here, and it shows Red Willow County, and probably you have complied with the other requirements; but there is no one designated as a delegate. Now, that should have been filled in here as to who the dele - gate was, and along with the other circumstances. I am sorry, but I still have to hold that you can't sit in and have a vote. </seg>
         <seg id="p047">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture i MR. HARRISON: All right. • - :^' ' PRES. SHUBERT: Now, we are going to have a little wait here, Polks, and you peopie'better not disturb the counters this time, be - cause they are getting pretty near through. ; I have been requested to mention this loud speaker system that we have here. It works so well, I thought, yesterday; and it seems to me that it was perfect down at the banquet last night, and it seems like about the only thing this thing won't do is tell you when you are making a mistake; but I am going to study up a little bit between now and next year; but just the same I think it is very kind ol the Vaughn and Hancock Sound System company to bring this outfit here, and as I understand it they make no charge' whatever, it has been free, and it seems to me that it has done good work, and it seems to me that it would be well for county fairs and pthers who might need some of their goods to have one of the catalogues and look it over, with the idea of buying it from them. MR. BANNING:. Mr. Chairman. . PRES. SHUBERT: Just one more word, Mr. Banning, and I will let you have the floor. That is this: I wish at this time, to thank the Vaughn and Hancock Sound System for bringing this stuff here, and I think I voice the sentiment of everyone, including the ladies who have come up here to listen to us; so we want them to know that we appre - ciate thier kindness and thoughtfulness in doing this. Now, Mr. Ban - ning. MR; BANNING: That is what I had in mind. PRES. SHUBERT: I am glad I got ahead of you. Now, if there is anyone that wishes to speak on any subject we would be glad to have them come forward. The counting committee i 3 ready to report the count. MR. VANCE; There were 72 ballots cast; Reed received 38, Millie 33, and one blank; I guess that blank was for me, I will own it any: way. Mr. Chairman, I would ask that the report be approved as read and the committee discharged. Said motion duly seconded and upon being put to vote was by the chair declared carried. . PRES. SHUBERT: Now, the next nomination we have is for treasurer. L MR. A. A. RUSSELL: I would like to place in nomination the name of Mr. E. R. Purcell, of Broken Bow. </seg>
         <seg id="p048">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRES. SHUBERT: Mr. E. R. Purcell has been nominated, are there any other nominations? MR. A. H. MILLER: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the nomin - ations be closed, and the rules suspended and the secretary instructed to cast the unanimous vote of the convention for E. R. Purcell. Said motion was duly seconded, and upon being put to vote was declared carried by the chair. SECRETARY REED: It gives me great pleasure to cast the entire vote of this organization for Mr. E. R. Purcell for treasurer. PRES. SHUBERT: We are down now to nominations for the Board of Managers. E. SINNER: I wish to place in nomination a man that has served on the board, served as board manager, and is well acquainted with county fair work, also with the State Fair program here. I wish to place in nomination A. A. Russell. PRES. SHUBERT: A. A. Russell has been nominated. MR. SORRELL: Mr. Chairman, I wish to place in nomination the name of Mr. E. J. Millie. PRES. SHUBERT: Mr. E. J. Millie has been nominated. A DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman, I wish to place in nomination J. S. Golder. PRES. SHUBERT: J. S. Golder has been nominated.

MILLER: Mr. Chairman, I move you that the nomina - tions be closed and the secretary Instructed to cast the entire vote of the organization for those four men as members of the Board of Managers. PRES. SHUBERT: It has been moved and seconded that the nom - inations be closed and the secretary cast the unanimous vote of this organization for the four men named on the Board of Managers. MR. R.

         <seg id="p049">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. MILLER: Mr. Chairman, I made a motion that the nomina - tions be closed, but it is immaterial to me. PRES. SHUBERT: There Is a motion before the house, Mr. John - son. Did you have a motion to make? MR. JOHNSON: Yes, I did. I understand that you can't close (Interrupted) PRES. SHUBERT: How? MR. JOHNSON: You can always make a motion. Before it has been voted on you can't close it; isn't that right? PRES. SHUBBRT: Well, there is a motion before the house, Mr. Johnson, if I am not wrong; but the motion is made, and you can speak on that if you want to. MR. JOHNSON: I have a nomination in addition on the Board of Managers to make. That was my idea. Of course I realize there is a motion before the house to close the nominations. If I am out of order I will withdraw. MR. SCHIEFELBEIN: Mr. Chairman, I believe that any man can put in nomination any candidate until the motion to close the nomin - ations is voted upon. Since the motion to close nominations has not been voted on I think Mr. Johnson is entitled to place one more nomination. , MR. BAILEY: Gentlemen, I think we all have a right to place further nominations until the call for ballots or a motion to close nominations is carried. I think \it would be in order to allow Mr. Johnson to place his nomination.! MR. MILLER: All right, I will withdraw my motion. PRES. SHUBERT: Now, if he withdraws the motion, Mr. John - son, you could go ahead and make another nomination. Would you like to do so? MR. JOHNSON: I thought I was correct or I wouldn't have got up. I was just a little slow, but I realize the time that you have on closing or making nominations even after a motion is made to close them. I have a man in mind that has been secretary of one of the lead - ing fairs in Nebraska; a man that is qualified to be on any Board of Managers in any state, a man that has made a success of his own fair, a man that has been on the State Board of Agriculture and is on at the present time, a man that will be an asset to the Board of Man - agers; and I would like to place in nomination at this time Mr. Bo - zarth, from Beatrice. </seg>
         <seg id="p050">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRES. SHUBERT: Now, I think that what we have got to do is to back up here ju3t a little bit, and I believe we are going to have to vote on these separately. I believe that is the thing to do. MR. SORRELL: You vote for tour. MR. BANNING: Mr. Chairman, they can place as many nomina - tion there as they want to, and vote for four of them. PRES. SHUBERT: I think that is what we will do; back up here, and the secretary has the names down of all these that have been nominated. Now, are there any further nominations? MR. MILLER: Mr. Chairman, I move that the nominations be closed and we proceed to vote. Said motion duly seconded, and upon being put to vote was by the chair declared carried. PRES. SHUBERT: The tellers will pass out the ballots now for your motion. Now, Gentlemen, if you will give your attention for a-moment more we will hurry along as fast as we can; but we have five names here, and you should vote for four. Now, I don't know, if you haven't them all in mind just let me give you the names. Mr. Russell, Mr. Millie, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Bozarth and Mr. Golder. Now, there are the nominations, and you vote for four. I realize that it will be a little hard, and if you want me to I will repeat that once more. Mr. Russell, Mr. Millie, Mr. Golder, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Bozarth; vote for four out of five. Now, it might be well to mention this too: If you are about ready to cast your ballots now; that you will vote for four of these men. You see, there are just five here, but the four receiving the highest number of votes will be declared elected. I think they have all voted now. The tellers will bring up the ballots as quickly as possible. SECRETARY REED: No, we have got to call the roll. PRES. SHUBERT: Oh, that is right. We will call the roll. SECRETARY REED: (Calls roll) PRES. SHUBERT: Have all voted who wish? If so, I declare the ballot closed. Just come to order a minute, and I want to have Perry Reed say a word or two, and we would like to have your undivided attention. (Applause) </seg>
         <seg id="p051">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture SECRETARY REED: Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you all for what you done for me in the past years. I have been a menvber of this organization since 1917, and as Mr. Ffyrcell told you, I was in the legislature for 16 years of that time. For ten years of that time I was chairman of the finance committee in the senate. I was in there and done a good deal of work when the swine barn was built, when the cattle barn was built, when the women's building and the sheep barn and the poultry building were built, and also the 4-H Club building; in fact, I think I have had part in nearly all of the buildings that are on that grounds. I have always thought that I done my part in the build - ing up of the State Fair. . I came in as secretary when it was down in the dumps and I think we have improved it some. I feel at this time that by the the time another year has rolled around that I have served long enough, and I expect to quit at that time; but that will not cease my efforts to make a good fair and to serve the people of Nebraska. I thank you. (Applause) PRES. SHUBERT: The commute on the board members is ready to report. ; V MR. VANCE: There were 57 votes cast. Russell received 50, Millie, 48, Golder, 47, Bailey, 46, Bozarth, 22. The first four are elected. I move, Mr. Chairman, that the report be adopted and the com - mittee be discharged. I PRES.

         <seg id="p072">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS H. L. Wahlgren, Elk City In keeping with the usual custom, I want to report ou activities ol your Association and comment on some of these activities as well as to offer some suggestions and tell you of some changes in, and perhaps some additions to the work, that are being discussed and planned. The Association carries on seed certification as provided for in the State Seed Law. Under this law, the Dean of the College of Agriculture is named as the one to select an organization to carry on the work and he designated our Association. The Dean also appoints what is known as a certification committee, members of which set up the rules and regulations and grading standards for certification of the various crops and varieties selected for certification. This committee is composed of (acuity and extension men and at the present time, W. H. Brokaw, T. A. Kiesselbach, H. 0. Werner, R. W. Go3s, and D. L. Gross form this com - mittee. Crops approved for certification are as follows: hybrid corn, sorghums (including sudan grass), small grains, and alfalfa. Right here I should like to mention that one of the varieties of alfalfa being certified is one which was found here in Nebraska. It had stood for about twenty years and was still a good stand while all other fields in the vicinity had suffered from wilt and other things until, in many cases, the stand was almost gone. Seed from this field was taken and iried out and found to be very wilt resistant, and because of this hard - iness was given the descriptive name, Hardistan. Below we give you jipproximate total amounts of the various seeds grown and certified in 1939. Hybrid coin 40,000 bushels Sorghums 60,000 bushels Spring wheat 100 bushels Winter wheat 28,945 bushels Barley 12,910 bushels Oats 5.255 bushels Alfalfa 8,000 lbs. Growers may often feel that standards for certification are rather high, but in the long run. I am sure that a high standard is both nec - essary and desirable for both the producer and buyer. We swelled with pride when we learned that Nebraska was one of nine states accredited by the Chief of the Seed Division of the Canadian Department of Agri - culture. Registered Seed In order to improve and maintain purity in our certified seeds, the certification committee is now discussing the addition of what would </seg>
         <seg id="p073">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association be called registered seed to our lists starting this spring with sorghums. It'seems tp.be especially hard to maintain purity in these crops and be - cause of the various methods of harvesting, purity is especially impor - tant. No one is too well satisfied with the present purity of some lots and varieties, and in the plan under consideration is seen a way o£ getting high purity in two or three years. The plan is briefly this: The certification committee would select growers who would be willing to put in a lot of extra work on selection and probably bagging —if that should appear to be practical in a given year—-and they might be expected to do further actual plant breeding in cooperation with the Experiment Station. The College would sell or supply these men with pure seed or 3eed as nearly pure as possible and they would be expected to give special attention to maintaining and improving this purity by methods above mentioned. This work would be under the supervision of the certifica - tion committee. Members of the Association who wished to grow certi - fied seed would secure registered seed from these growers. Second generation certified seed would be commercial grain only and not eligi - ble for further certification. I see in this plan a chance to make avail - able a good supply of nearlyloo % pure seed in a very tew years. In connection with this plan for registered seed, I should like to mention that the Kansas Association has sent out notices to all growers that certification of Early Kalo will not be completed this year owing to too much varietal mixture in all lots. We feel that in Nebraska the situation is not as bad because there have been some growers of this variety here who have kept it reasonably pure by thorough early rogueing. Production of Inbred Lines This year your Association assumed responsibility for maintain - ing and increasing inbred lines of hybrid corn. About three and one - half acres were rented from Albert Ahrens near Hartlngton and here in spite of extreme heat, fifteen lines were increased by hand pollination. These inbreds all go into our certified hybrids and some of this seed will sell at from $1.00 to $1.60 per pound. Even at this price the project may not pay out, but it was done, not for a profit/but for the purpose of having a supply, as well as a reserve ot pure parent seed stock for hybrid seed growers. For the benefit of those particularly interested, I should like to give you now a list of the inbred lines thus increased, as well as the composition of Nebraska Certified hybrids.. </seg>

Of this amount, $300.00 went to the Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program, $100.00 to the College Grain Judging Team who placed second at both Kansas City and Chicago, and $50.00 to the 4-H Judging Team who placed eighth. With nearly forty teams competing, this is very good in both cases. I'asture-Forage-Liivestock Program Of our part in the Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program, we are es - pecially proud. This activity ha 3 grown from a modest beginning to national prominence. I am convinced that this program is actually re - sponsible for adding a great deal of new wealth to the State by lessons learned and exchanged by cooperators along the lines of crop and stock production and management. To prove that others more than agree with me, I should like to mention its presentation at Chicago and quote from speeches of several outstanding individuals who are very close to our national agriculture. Extension agronomists from all states meeting in Chicago during the International were so interested in the Program that they asked Elvin Frollk. who carried the big load in this activity, to meet with them and give all details of the work. He gladly complied and his speech was received with great enthusiasm. Mr. Massey, President of the Seed Council of North America, in a speech at the International, spoke of it as "The greatest program developed in the country for the betterment of agriculture". High officials in the Extension Service in Washington had much praise for it and one referred to it as the "Most </seg>
         <seg id="p075">, Nebraska Crop Growers' Association outstanding program of Its kind in the United States". (Sixteen hundred farmers were entered in this program and nearly eight hundred at - tended the "finish-up" meeting and banquet at Omaha in November. This banquet was a Chamber of Commerce affair and was complimen - tary to all who completed reports; Funds for continued support of this activity are not abundant, but we cannot let such a program down. Now, I should like to call your attention to our Annual Report, which is a paper-bound volume of about 125 pages. It contains all pap - ers presented to our Organized Agriculture groups and is a storehouse of additional information covering a very wide range of subjects of value and importance to farmers in their business. Read your copy and see if you do not find many things of interest and value. It is worth many times its cost and is available only to members. In this connection I might suggest that if you are not a member, that you come in now while you can get a lite membership tor one dol - lar. It wouldn't surprise me if the Association were to go on an annual fee basis in the near future and it is my belief tfiat the change could' only affect new members. Both you and the Association can profit from your membership. We want to keep it a virile organization of real val - ue to every farmer in the state and you can help. SMALL GRAIN VARIETAL TRIALS IN NEBRASKA . .-' K. S. Quisenberry &gt; In Nebraska the behavior of different varieties of small grains is being investigated at Lincoln, North Platte, Alliance, Valentine, and oh many farms scattered throughout the State. The varieties tested in - clude those developed in Nebraska, as well as in neighboring states. The tests are so conducted that each variety receives the same treat - ment, thus giving results that are a true picture of the relative merits of each strain. It must be remembered that no two seasons are exactly alike, and conditions also may vary from county to county and from field to field. For this reason the Nebraska station is very reluctant to make any recommendations based on a single year's results. It is only by study - ing a variety under many conditions that its true characteristics can be discovered. Through cooperative arrangements with workers in other states, varieties are studied under many environments outside of Nebraska each year, thus giving a great deal of information in a rela - tively short period. „ „ * Agronomist, Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases.

         <seg id="p076">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The farmer wants a variety of -wheat, oats, ov barley that will give him the best returns over a period, of years. Because yield is so impor- Farmers show special interest in Nebraska's Wheat improvement program, taut, the data reported here are for yield only. Varieties are studied, however, for other characters such as time of maturity, stiffness of straw, insect and disease resistance, and grain quality. Final recom - mendations take into account all of this information, as well as yield. A low yielding strain is never released, and a high yielder might be discarded if it had some serious defect. In this discussion yields will be presented from the experiment stations in Nebraska, and also from the cooperative trials conducted on farms. The Lincoln yields have been taken from published and un - published records from the Experiment Station. Those from North Platte were furnished through the kindness of L. L. Zook, Superinten - dent, and 0. J. Webster, Field Assistant, of that station. George Schmid, Supervisor of the experimental farm, assisted in obtaining the data from Alliance, and the results from Valentine were supplied through the kindness of E. M. Brouse, Superintendent. The data from coopera - tive tests have been summarized from reports issued each year. Winter Wheat In 1939, 12 varieties of winter wheat were grown at each of three experiment stations in Nebraska. The results aye shown in Table 1 'with the varieties ranked in order of average yield for the three stations The crop at Valentine was a total failure and no data are presented. </seg>
         <seg id="p077">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Cheyenne had the highest average yield for all stations and ranked first at North Platte and tied for first place at Lincoln. At Alliance two other varieties slightly outyielded it. Nebraska No. 60 gave a very good yield at each of the three stations and Nebred averaged about two bushel 3 per acre less than Cheyenne. Tenmarq and Blackhull are found at the bottom of the list. These two varieties rank low chiefly because of relatively poor performance at North Platte. [At Lincoln these two wheats yielded about two bushels less than Cheyenne. Attention should be called to three new varieties which may have some promtee for Ne - braska. These are Cheyenne selection, Oro x Tenmarq, and Kawvale x Tenmarq. The first two strains are resistant to bunt, or stinking smut, and the last one has considerable resistance to loose Bmut as well as to leaf rust. It appears that the Kawvale x Tenmarq selection may have some value for southeastern Nebraska. Chiefkan ranked seventh among the varieties. It gave a vevy good yield at Lincoln but was six bushed under Cheyenne at North Platte and about one bushel under at Alliance. It is known that this variety has considerable yielding capacity but in none of the tests in Nebraska has it given the phenomenal yields accredited to it in other States. Summaries of yields of the varieties for various periods of years are presented in Table 2, with the varieties again listed in the order of average yield at the three stations. No data are shown for Valentine since yields-have been obtained at that station in only two years since 1931. It is probably more important to consider the average yields at each station than to the average for all stations because conditions at the stations are so different. For the period considered Nebred has the highest average yield at Lincoln, followed by Tenmarq, Kawvale, and Cheyenne, but the differences between varieties is small. At the North Platte station Cheyenne has the highest average, followed by Nebred and a local variety of Turkey. Except for these three there are no im - portant differences shown in yielding capacity of the varieties tested. At the Alliance station Cheyenne has the highest average yield, follow - ed by Turkey selection 1069 and Tenmarq. The high yield of Tenmarq must be discounted because Tenmarq is not particularly hardy and winterkilling is likely to occur at Alliance. The yields shown are for two years in which winterkilling was not a factor determining yield, the important factor.being earliness. After varieties have been thoroughly tested at the various experi - ment stations the more outstanding ones are put into cooperative tests on farms throughout the State. In Table 3 the data from such tests for winter wheat are presented for the years 1936 to 1939. During these four years Nebred and Cheyenne have been compared in 36 tests. AH varieties were not grown in all tests so the yields are expressed in per - centage of Nebred grown in comparable tests. On this basis Cheyenne </seg>

         <seg id="p079">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association has yielded 89 per cent as much as Nebred. The lower yield of Cheyenne probably is due to serious rust damage in 1937 and 1938. It will be seen that Tenmarq is the only variety outyielding Nebred. This variety has been included in the tests for only two years and during this time there has been no winterkilling. Earliness probably explains the high yield of Tenmarq. It will be noticed that Nebraska No. 60, lobred, and Blackhull all yielded less than Nebred. In 18 of the tests a local variety, usually Turkey, was included. These yields have been averaged and show that this variety was outyielded by some of the newer strains.

Enough has been said about the merits of these two varieties so that little need be added here. It is probable that Cheyenne suffers more from rust damage than does Nebred, although both are susceptible to rust. Up to the present time Nebred has shown resistance to the forms of bunt or stinking smut known to occur in Nebraska. In 1939, it was observed that Nebred could not withstand the hot, dry weather occurr - ing in the spring. Thi 3 may explain the low yield of the variety at some of the stations in 1939. Nebraska No. 60 is not equal to Nebred and Cheyenne in yielding ability and is recommended only where the farm - er wishes a more hardy variety than Nebred or Cheyenne. It probably does better under conditions similar to those at Alliance than those farther east. '¦'. Cheifkan, while having some very desirable characteristics, is not recommended for Nebraska. This variety produces good yields when winterkilling does not occur. It is early and has grain of good color and high test weight, but the milling and baking characteristics are such that the processors have difficulty in disposing of it. For this reason it </seg>
         <seg id="p080">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture does not seem either necessary or desirable to bring the variety into the State. lobred gives fairly good yields clong the eastern border of Nebraska but farther west in the State the tendency to shatter reduces the yields that can be obtained. Considerable Blackhull is grown in the south-central part of Ne - braska and according to all records has yielded well. It is known that the variety is not winter hardy and some loss may he expected in years of serious winterkilUnx. The milling and baking characteristics oJ Blackhull are not well-liked by the trade, although the variety is being used very extensively. In area 3 where Blackhull has been grown suc - cessfully it probably will be desirable for the farmers to grow Tenmarq which is slightly higher in yield and certainly has grain with better milling and baking characteristics. One serious fault of Tenmarq is that the grain tends to develop considerable yellow berry and to have a low test weight. When this happens grain dealers do not care for it particularly. Kawvale has considerable resistance to leaf rust and some resistance to stem rust and usually gives a good yield. It is neither a true hard nor a true soft variety so far as grain quality is concerned, and is not to be recommended for Nebraska. Spring Wheat The yields of a number of spring wheats grown at each of the four stations in 1939 are presented in Table 4. The varieties having the highest averages are Kearney (Java), Pilot, Ceres, and Thatcher. At Alliance, which more nearly represents the spring wheat area of the State than any of the other stations, Premier, a new variety, gave the highest yield, followed by Ceres, Komar, and Thatcher. Other new va - rieties giving good yields at Alliance were Pilot, Merit, and Renown. At North Platte, Kearney (Java) had the best yield, followed by Pre - nier and Thatcher. At Lincoln, Pilot and Reward ranked first and sec - ond, respectively. Data for longer periods at the four stations are presented in Table 5. Thatcher and Ceres are among the leading varieties at all stations. At Lincoln, Kearney (Java), a variety having rather soft kernels, has the highest average yield, followed by Mindum durum, with Thatcher averaging just a fraction of a bushel less. Komar has a good record at Alliance, but at the other stations the variety is not so outstanding and it has been discarded at Lincoln because it was no better than Ceres in yield and the grain quality was open to question. The cooperative tests with spring wheat have not been extensive (Table 6). Available data indicate that Ceres, Thatcher, and Komar common wheats and Mindum durum have decidedly outyielded the old Marquis variety. Reward, tested for the first time in 1939, equalled Ceres in four tests. </seg>
         <seg id="p081">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association As to recommendations for spring wheat varieties it would seem that Thatcher and Ceres are the best at present.

Oats Iv 1939 Fulton, a new variety of oats from Kansas, gave the high - est yield at each of the four Nebraska stations (Table 7), Brunker and Trojan ranking second and third. At Lincoln, Marion, Columbia, and Burt selection (518) all gave good yields. Kherson and Nebraska No. 21 were rather low at all stations tested. The performance of logold was poor at Lincoln and North Platte, but very good at Valentine where lateness in maturity was not disadvantageous. In the long-time record (Table 8) Brunker appears at or near the top at all stations. Trojan has made a good record at North Platte and Alliance. At the Valentine station, logold has given the best average yield in a two-year period, while at Lincoln and North Platte the vari - ety is near the bottom of the list. At Lncoln, Burt selection (518) and Columbia have yielded only slightly less than Brunker. The cooperative tests with oats have been rather extensive (Table 9).

Trojan is an early, stiff, short-straw - ed variety of considerable promise. At the present time no quantity of pure seed o£ the variety is available and since it is a Burt selection the matter of keeping the seed pure would seem to be difficult. Some spec - ially selected seed is being increased at Lincoln. As a group, Burt se - lections tend to break up and produce off types more than other oats. This probably is due to both natural crossing and to chromosomal in - stability Kanota is a good variety if seeded early, but should not he used if seeding is delayed. Burt selection N. 518 is one of the higher yielding strains at Lincoln and has some rust resistance. It has straw that is just a little weak and the test weight per bushel is usually lower than other standard varieties. Columbia, a selection from Fulghum made at Mis - souri, is earlier than Fulghum and at Lincoln seems to yield more, while at North Platte it may yield less. If it has a place in Nebraska it probably is in the eastern part of the State, although it is susceptible to rust. Unselected Burt oats will give a fairly good yield but generally the seed type is most variable with many black seeds appearing. Fulton is the result of a cross between Fulghum and Markton and has been tested extensively in Kansas. The variety has some resistance to smut and has recently been released to Kansas farmers. Based on a single year's test the variety may have promise in Nebraska although it is not resistant to rust. It will be watched very carefully for the next few years. </seg>
         <seg id="p085">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Barley The data for the barley trials are presented in Tables 10, 11, and 12. In Table 10 the varieties are arranged in order of average yield at the four stations in 1939. Spartan ranked among the first three varie - ties at two stations and gave the highest average for all stations. Ezond, Flynn, Club Marious,and Trebl followed In the order named. Glabron was very low in yield at all of the stations except Valentine. As in prev - ious years this variety was too late and suffered from grasshopper and heat damage. North Platte No. 1 gave a. better performance at North Platte and Alliance than at Lincoln. : In a longer period (Table 11) considering the data for the four stations, Glabron is inferior to Spartan, Club Mariout, and North Platte No. 1. At Lincoln for the last five years Flynn, Spartan, and Club Marl - out have the best yield records, while at North Platte, Ezond, North Platte No. 1, and Spartan rank highest. Ezond, Trebi, and Club Mari - out have the highest average yields at- Alliance, and Short Comfort and Spartan have the best records at Valentine. Yields from cooperative trials with barley conducted for the last 4 years are summarized in Table 12. Based on 58 comparable trials, Club Mariout has outyielded Spartan by an average of 0.4 bushel per acre, while in 50 trials Flynn has outyielded Spartan by 0.4 bushel. From these tests one would conclude that the three varieties, Spartan, Club Mariout, and Flynn, are about equal in yielding ability in Nebraska, and this agrees very well.with the tests at the stations.

Spartan is a two-rowed, smooth-awned, white-grained variety having stiff straw. It is fairly early and produces grain with good test weight. Spartan is highly recommended, especially if a two-rowed va - riety is desired. Flynn is six-rowed, and has smooth awns, white grain, medium height, and a fairly good straw. Based on the record shown so far it is a good variety for Nebraska. Trebi, Club Mariout, and North Platte No. 1 are rough-awned, six-rowed varieties. Trebi has large, bluish kernels, and, when grown under irrigation, has fair malting quality. Club Mariout has a short, thick head, is early, and has fair straw. One of the objections to North Platte No. 1 is that it has weak straw. All three varieties may be recom - mended where rough awns are not objectionable. Ezond is the result of </seg>
         <seg id="p087">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association an effort to produce a smooth-awned Trebi. At three stations where it has been tested it has outyielded Trebi. Glabron has some resistance to a number of barley diseases and for a number of years gave good yields in Nebraska, but in more recent years it has been at a disadvantage due to its lateness. In addition, the nodding type of head seems to suffer greater damage from grasshopp - ers, and at present Glabron is one of the lowest yielding varieties in the tests. Conclusions It has .been, shown that the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station and Extension Service has a rather complete system of testing small grain varieties thoroughly and rapidly. As soon as information of value is obtained it is passed on to the crop growers of the State. While these tests are not infallible they would seem to be reliable for the con - ditions under which they are conducted. It is suggested that before a grower spends money for seed of some variety highly advertised in another State that he find out what the Nebraska Experiment Station knows about it. By doing this some helpful information may be obtain - ed and money as well as grief may be saved. SORGHUM INVESTIGATIONS AT THE NEBRASKA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION . R. L. Cushing—Agri.: College Since 1929, when sorghums were virtually a curiosity in Nebraska, the acreage planted to this crop has increased 11 times. In 1929 there were 135,000 acres of grain and' forage sorghum harvested, -while In 1939 the State-Federal Division of Agricultural Statistics estimates that 1,443,000 acres were planted to sorghum. The harvested acreage in 1939 will probably be lowered slightly because of abandonment due to severe drouth damage. The increasing importance of sorghums can be illustrated in another way. In 1937, just two years ago, there were five crops, corn, wheat, oats, alfalfa, and barley, that were more ex - tensively grown than sorghum. According to the acreage figures we have, there were only two crops, corn and wheat, that exceeded sor - ghumin. planted acreage in 1939. . It is not difficult to explain this tremendous increase in sorghum production. Nebraska has been experiencing an unparalleled series of drouth years, which, it is hoped, will soon be succeeded by more favor - able conditions. During these drouth years the production of some crops has been very uncertain. For example, the yields of alfalfa have been low and there has been considerable loss of stand, particularly on uplands where subsoil moisture is exhausted. Corn yields have been </seg>
         <seg id="p088">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture low except in certain favored areas and in much of the state corn has been an absolute failure. It is under such conditions that sorghums can be used to best advantage. The relatively good supply of feed on hand this year in contrast with 1934 is largely the result of the in - n-eased use of sorghums. It is doubtful if there is any longer need for a much greater ex - pansion of the sorghum acreage. In 1939, the sorghum acreage was almost exactly 20 percent of the corn acreage, which is the proportion that has been recommended by various agencies interested In Nebraska agriculture. Probably what is needed most now is a stabilization of sorghum production rather than further increases. It is well known that there will be a tendency to revert to corn production when moi3ture condi - tions become more favorable. Such a tendency should be avoided in the light of what is known about Nebraska weather. It is reasonable to as - sume that there will be periods in the future when moisture conditions will be just as unfavorable as they have been recently. During such per - iods sorghums will unquestionably stabilize feed production and for Table I.—Comparative grain yields of sorghum varieties and corn at the Agricultural Experiment Station, Lincoln.

At the past two meetings of Organized Agriculture, adequate data have been presented to demonstrate the comparative dependability of sorghum and corn under drouth conditions. Also, there has been con - siderable data presented regarding the performance of various varieties In different parts of the state! Therefore, varietal tests will be consid - ered very briefly in this paper and primary consideration will be given </seg>
         <seg id="p089">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association to recent information on some of the other factors involved in sorghum production. ¦'.-.- ¦¦¦.•• Varietal Tests and Recommendations Experiment Station Tests.—Comprehensive variety yield tests are being conducted at the Lincoln and North Platte Agricultural experi - ment stations. Beginning in 1932, the tests at Lincoln have included the most promising varieties of grain and forage sorghum. Table 1 pre - sents the average grain yields from several of the more common varie - ties over a 7-year period. In general, the average yields of the different varieties have been changed very little by results of the past two years. The 1939 yields did change the position of Early Kalo and Sooner in the 7-year summary. Sooner yielded very poorly in 1939 as the result of a moderate infestation of chinch bugs and consequently its average yield was lowered. ' Cooperative Tests Outstate.—ln 1937 a program was established for statewide testing of promising sorghum varieties. These testa have been conducted by cooperative efforts of the Department of Agronomy, the Extension Service, County Farm bureaus, and interested farmers. During the past three yeai-3 results have been secured from a total of 109 tests located throughout the state. '¦ Table 2 presents a summary, by regions, of the grain yields of the most promising varieties that have been tested throughout the three - year period. After the first year of testing it was obvious that certain varieties were not adapted in all part 3 of the state. Therefore, the state was divided into four regions, the boundaries of which are indicated on Figure 1. Different varieties were assembled for the tests in each region so that only varieties which showed promise were tested. Varietal Recommendations.—Region 1. Kalo, Early Kalo, Sooner, Day, and Pink kafir have given good grain yields. The chinch-bug fac - tor should be considered when selecting a sorghum variety for this re - gion. Of the varieties mentioned above, Pink kaflr is the only one that is chinch-bug resistant, although Kalo and Early Kalo are less suscep - tible than Sooner and Day. Either Atlas or Leoti may be recommended for forage. Region 11. Early Kalo and Sooner are without question the best adapted grain sorghum varieties for this region and there is little to choose between them. There may be some preference for Early Kalo because the upright, cylindrical heads are easier to handle at harvest. Day milo has been the most satisfactory combine type tested. Prelimi - nary data indicate that Colby, a type very similar to Day, will yield somewhat less than Day. In some parts of Region II Atlas may be used for forage but for the region as a whole, Leoti or Early Sumac would </seg>
         <seg id="p090">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture appear to be more suitable. Some growers have been using Cheyenne for both grain and forage but with varying success.

Experiments with Cultural Practices In 1937, experiments were initiated with sorghum at the Experi - ment Station in Lincoln to determine: (1), the best method of seedbed preparation; (2), the optimum rate of planting; and (3), the optimum date of seeding. These experiments have now run for three years and while the data are not conclusive, they are probably worth considera - tion at this time. It should be remembered that the seasons during which these studies were run may be considered abnormal and the data may be changed by the results from future years. Manner of Seedbed Preparation.— ln Table 3 are reported average grain yields from five methods of seedbed preparation. The variety us - ed in this experiment was Kalo. While the yield from fall listing, curl- </seg>
         <seg id="p092">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ed in, and nosed out at planting, Is slightly greater than that from spring listing with the ridges split at planting, there la probably no sig - nificant difference between these two methods. They have, however, given slightly higher yields than any of the other three methods. Seed - bed conditions at the time of planting during the years this test has been run have been quite favorable and experience at other stations in - dicates that in more normal seasons the advantage of fall listing might be more marked than is indicated by these data. Regardless of the method used, the important considerations in the preparation of a seedbed for sorghums are: 1, storage of winter and 3pring precipitation; 2, thorough warming of the soil in which the seed is to be placed; and 3 .complete control of early weeds by means of tillage preceding planting. Rate of Planting.—The rate of planting problem has been attack - ed from the standpoint of optimum spacing of plants in the rows. Four varieties. Early Kalo, Kalo, Pink kaflr, and Atlas, are being .used in Table 3.

With Early Kalo and Kalo there are no real differences between the yields from any of the treatments except the 18-inch spacing which yielded slightly lower than the others. The yields of later types, Pink kaflr and Atlas, were definitely higher at the wider spacings. The small - er plants of the earlier maturing varieties can apparently be closer spaced without lowering the yield than can the larger plants of the lat - er varieties. If the crop is to be handtopped there i 3 a definite advan - tage in using a wide spacing since the heads are much larger and there aye fewer of them. </seg>
         <seg id="p093">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association The data indicate that relatively wide stand variations may have little influence on the grain yield of sorghum varieties. It is, however, advisable to have the stand a little too thin than too thick. In all cases forage yields were greater at the closer spacings. Typical heads of Nebraska's four leading forage sorghums. Left to right: Black Amber, Early Sumac, Leoti, Atlas Date of Seeding.—ln order to determine the effect of date of seed - ing on yield of sorghum varieties, all entries in the main yield test have been seeded on two dates since 1937. In addition, four varieties, Soon - er, Kalo, Black Amber, and Atlas, have been seeded on four dates, May 15, May 25, June 5, and June 15. Average grain yields of the four va - rieties seeded at the four dates are presented in Table 5. The optimum date of seeding for the two earlier maturing varie - ties. Sooner and Black Amber, has been June 5. With Kalo, which is somewhat later maturing, the optimum, dates have been May 25 and June 15 while Atlas, the latest of the four, has yielded equally well at all dates except June 5. At Lincoln there is no advantage in seeding sorghum before the last week in May, and further west in the state seeding should probably be delayed until the first week in June or later. ¦ ¦ .v ¦' .":¦'¦•¦'¦ : l ... ¦¦/.;¦ ¦ : </seg>

A moderate infestation of chinch-bugs on the Experi - ment Station farm in 1939 provided an excellent opportunity for first - hand observations on varietal resistance and susceptibility. In general, the milos are susceptible and the kaflrs and sorgos are resistant while varieties selected from milo-kafir crosses are intermediate. Sooner, Day, and Colby are very susceptible to chinch-bug injury and should not be grown in the chinch-bug area in seasons when there is likely to be an infestation. Some interesting data were secured this past season, in a date-of - seeding experiment, on the relationship between time of seeding and chinch-bug injury. No chinch-bug injury was observed in the April 15 and April 25 seedings. There was slight damage in the May 5, 15, and 25 seedings but seedings made on the 4th of June or later were severe - ly damaged. June 24 and July 4 seedings were injured less than the June 14 seedings but there was an increased amount of damage on the July 14 seeding which would indicate that this was about the time the second brood became active. Yield increased with later Sates of seeding until chinch-bugs be - came a factor. It is evident that the sharp decreases in yield following the May 25 date of seeding were caused by chinch-bug injury.

Scope of the 1939 Tests The 1939 program was made up of 18 official state tests. Eight of these were large 50-entry tests in eastern Nebraska; six tests had 30 </seg>
         <seg id="p098">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture entries, three in the east portion of central Nebraska and three in the irrigated Platte Valley. Four tests of 25 entries each, were located in the south-central dry land areas. The locations, dates of planting and harvesting, and the number of entries in the official corn yield tests and the experiment station test included in this report are shown in Table 1. Because of severe drouth damage to the crop in eight of these lo - calities and loss of one test from hail damage, only nine of the tests materialized and were harvested. Entries The commercial producers who made entries paid a fee to help finance the tests. Certain rules were made regarding the placement of hybrids in the various tests. These rules are as follows: A hybrid entered in one of the major 50-entry tests must have been entered in at least three other major teats. Only lour hybrids from any one person or firm were permitted in a large test. Only one hybrid, not in commercial production, could be entered by a firm or individual in a major test. This was called an experimental hybrid. Two hybrids (both in commercial production) from any one firm or individual could be entered in the smaller tests with the following re - quirements: A hybrid entered in Polk, Platte, or Knox county had to be entered in all three of these counties. A hybrid entered in any one of the irrigated tests was required in all three such tests, and a hybrid entered in one of the 25-entry tests was required in all four of these tests. Such an arrangement provided opportunity for testing and dem - onstrating hybrids on a regional basis and also for studying their range of adaptation. Hybrids included were submitted by commercial producers, the United States Department of Agriculture, and a number of state agri - cultural experiment stations as indicated in the following list: Trade name or state Company or Institution Address Companies: Carlson Carlson Hybrid Seed Co.

C. | : Testing Procedure ¦ Source of Seed.—Seed of all commercial hybrids was picked up ! from regular warehouse stocks of 10 bushels or more by a representa - | tive of the College. Seed of the experimental entries was submitted | to the College by the companies. Identity of Entries.—The individual hybrids and varieties were assigned code numbers as soon as they were received and thereafter were known and designated only by these numbers. Not until after the ¦ tests were harvested and calculations were complete were the names attached to the data. The only exception to this rule was made when the identity of the first replication was revealed before harvest to make a public field demonstration possible. Plots and Replication.—All of the tests were replicated six times, using the standard 2 x 10 hill field plot or its equivalent when drilled. Surface planting was the rule. The tests in Franklin, Clay, Madison, and Nemaha counties were planted in listed rows. \ The plots of each entry were distributed on a modified random plan in such a way that all levels of field productivity were sampled i insofar as was possible. | i ¦'¦-'¦ " .-¦''¦¦..-. .-\ .¦'¦ ' &gt; V Planting.—Planting was done with hand planters. To insure comparable stands the seed was dropped at a double rate. Later the ¦ tests were thinned to two plants per hill except in Richardson, Nema - ha, Keith, Dawson, and Morrill counties where three plants per hill were left. The thinning operation was done in such a way as to eliminate any possibility of selection of the more vigorous plants in the hill. Harvest and Yield Determinations.—The. entire plot (2 x; 10 hills) i was harvested and the corn from each of the six replications was weighed separately. Twenty-pound samples of field-run ear corn were j taken from each of two replications of each entry to serve for moisture and shelling percentage determinations. From all these data, and by averaging the six replicates, the acre yields of shelled corn containing : 14 per cent moisture were calculated for the various entries. </seg>
         <seg id="p100">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture To aid in the proper evaluation o£ the yield data the "standard er - ror" was calculated by the variance method tor each teat. From this value the amount ot difference required tor significance was obtained. Other Characteristics Reported.—Actual field counts were made on four of the six replications for the total number of suckers, smutty plants, lodged plants, ears, and fallen ears. These are reported in terms of 100 plants based on actual plant counts. Ordinarily the moisture content of ear corn at the time of har - vest is regarded as having some value as an indicator of relative late - ness of maturity. In a year such as this, these determinations are of little value except in the irrigated and northeastern Nebraska districts. It should be kept in mind, however, that the past few seasons have not been normal and hybrids which are far out of their normal range have been maturing in northeast Nebraska. These hybrids will cause much concern about "soft corn with the return of normal seasons. Results Results of the 1939 tests are reported in individual tables and these are followed by summary tables which include averages for hy - brids grown in the Official Yield Tests during 1938-39. There is also a summary table of certified hybrids over a 7-year period. A hybrid was the highest yielding entry in each of the tests. Only one hybrid ranked first in more than one test and this hybrid ranked fir3t in but two tests. The highest rank attained by and open-pollinated variety was seventh, occurred in the Polk county test. The lowest rank was made by a variety in eight of the tests and by an experi - mental hybrid in the other two tests. Considering the hybrids in general, in comparison with ordinary varieties, the increase in yield averaged 25 per cent tor the seven east - ern Nebraska te3ts, 7 per cent for the three irrigated tests, or 17 per cent for all 10 tests. Comparing yields of the 10 highest yielding hybrids in each test with the average of all varieties there was a hybrid advantage of 41 per cent for the seven eastern Nebraska tests, 22 per cent for the three irrigated tests, and 32 per cent for all tests. Prom these figures it can be seen that all hybrids are not necessarily good hybrids and that care - ful choice of adapted hybrids for the different localities is of great im - portance. The average superiority of hybrids in considerably greater in some tests than in others. In Morrill county where the hybrids overaged 86.7 </seg>

PROGRESS IN ALFALFA RESEARCH j H.M. Tysdal 1 j During the past summer your speaker has had an unusually good ! opportunity to study alfalfa seed setting and seed production in vari - . ious areas of the United States, and since this problem is of great mi - i terest to most of the Nebraska farmers, part of this talk ¦will be devoted | to some of the details of what actually takes place during the seed I setting process and to illustrations of insect activity on alfalfa flowers. I We all know of alfalfa growers who have made a very nice profit dur - j ing the last few years by leaving the field for seed instead of cutting j it tor hay. A numbnr ol growers right around Lincoln have produced j a seed crop; up to five, six, and eight bushels per acre. As you know, a j yield of even two or three bushels, which is average for the state, | makes a rather good crop with seed at present prices. You also know j that to produce one seed crop requires about the same amount of time 1 as to produce two hay crops, though the straw from the seed crop is i not entirely wasted as it is found to be Ijuite good feed. ;¦¦-¦. - - ..''.] | In the literature dealing with the necessity of tripping of the al - : falfa flower to produce seed, there is no unanimity of opinion. Tripp - ing is defined as a release of the staminal column from the keel of the ! flower, exposing the male and female parts. (Fig. 1). Some workers | state that tripping is caused by some inner force of the flower. Others i state that it requires some outer force such as wind, rain storms, or in - j sects, while others ascribe tripping to all forces combined. It is of great importance to know whether tripping is actually necessary for seed I .. „ * Agronomist, Division of Forage Crops and Diseases, Bureau of Plant Industry. V. S.

The fifth set of observations had as their objective </seg>
         <seg id="p107">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association the determining of the amount of automatic tripping and the amount of insect activity. This was done by continuous daylight observation of a group of flowers on one or two plants. The results, given in Table 1, show that under the conditions of these tests very few flowers set seed without tripping. Corroborating these results, the flowers which were bagged also set very little seed, even though other tests indicated that if the. flowers were tripped and then enclosed in similar bags they set seed very well. Prom 58 to 91% of the flowers which were artificially tripped and cross-pollinated set seed, while the percentage of the flowers setting seed under field con - ditions varied from five to 47%. The amount of natural tripping oc - j curring varied from 11 to 63%. In general, the better seed fields had more tripping, the correlation coefficient between amount of tripping and percent pods set being .805. : ¦ In these studies approximately 92% more flowers seit seed when tripped and cross-pollinated than when tripped and self-pollinated, although self-fertility among plants varied considerably. Also the num - ber of seeds per pod was 56% greater with cross-pollination as com - ; j pared with self-pollination. Altogether, the cross-pollinated flowers I produced three times as much seed'as the self-pollinated flowers. The percentage of flowers tripped and the percentage forming ¦' pods under natural conditions varied greatly at different of the season at any given place. At one place during a two-week period it ¦ varied from 0% tripping and 0% pods to 61% tripping and 28% pods. A large part of the tripping is caused by insects, very little auto - matic tripping (wind, rain, etc. included) occurring, with the excep - tion of some readings at Lincoln which were taken during very hot, windy, dry weather.

Although much emphasi3 is placed on tripping, it should be re - membered that many other {actors affect alfalfa seed production. It is only too true that under some conditions all the flowers could be tripp - ed and cross-pollinated and still set very little seed. Under other con - ditions, such as stimulation of the vegetative phase of growth as com - pared to the reproductive phase, or presence of harmful insects, such as Ljgus, very few flowers may be produced. Apparently the balance which is necessary for reproductive development in alfalfa can very easily be tipped toward the vegetative phase and no doubt that is why alfalfa is such a high forage producer. There are many examples, how - ever, where everything seems to be favorable for a seed crop, and yet the crop is very poor. Under these conditions a lack of tripping may be the determining factor. </seg>
         <seg id="p109">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Prom the pictures I have shown you, the manner in which the var - j ious insects visit the flowers and the actual tripping resulting from 1 such visits has been demonstrated. The application of this information 1 may be rather difficult at the moment, but when you realize that the I activity of these insects is very, very sensitive to weather conditions, some of the practical application can be seen. '. ¦ . j For example, we have made insect activity counts on a bright, j sunny day about noon and have counted as high as over 400 flowers i visited within a very small area in half an hour. In the same area on j the following day at the same time, we have found as few as 25 flowers j visited. The difference was due to a difference in weather conditions, • the second day being cloudy and cooler while the first day was bright and warm. If we can apply this directly to alfalfa seed setting condi - i tions, we can see that under cloudy, rainy conditions there is but very I little chance for insect activity and, from the standpoint of the results obtained, there would then be very little chance of seed production. On the other hand, if there is sufficient moisture in the soil to carry the plants through seed setting to a mature crop and the weather turns bright and dry, conditions are then more favorable for seed setting. From the experience of a number of growers, it would seem worth - while for the individual grower to watch, his field carefully at the time it comes into bloom, and if conditions appear favorable for seed pro - duction, he could then check his crop in detail by noting if the flowers were setting pods or if they were "stripping", that is, falling from the stem. If a fairly high percentage, say about 40%, of the flowers were setting pods, it would appear to be worthwhile to leave the crop tor seed or at least until it had a good chance to set.seed. If, on the other hand, the flowers appeared to be falling, the week or so required to make this observation will probably not greatly decrease the quality of the hay if it is cut immediately. ' Other Problems Turning to other phases of Alfalfa Improvement, breeding and se - lection for bacterial wilt resistance has been a major part of the pro - i gram. While we have hot heard so much of bacterial wilt disease in j Nebraska during the last few years because of the drought, it is still I present and we have had increasingly alarming reports of the spread : of the disease in the Corn Belt Sections of the United States. Therefore, ; if we wish to produce seed for those sections and the disease continues to develop as it has during the past few years, it will be highly deslr - : able, and perhaps even necessary, for our growers to produce, seed of varieties which are resistant to the disease. As is well-known, the di - ) sease is caused by. the bacteria known as Phytomonas insldiosa. The disease is prevalent throughout Nebraska but is serious only in those </seg>
         <seg id="p110">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture sections where alfalfa Is getting sufficient moisture for good growth. On the uplands of central Nebraska it has had very little opportunity to establish itself during the past few years because of the dry condi - tions. On bottom lands, however, and in irrigated or subirrigated val - leys it is still a serious threat to alfalfa growing. When and if normal precipitation returns, there is no doubt but what it will again be more serious on the uplands of eastern Nebraska. The symptons of the disease are the brown-colored ring found just beneath the bark in the roots of the plants. In diseased plants the tops are also usually stunted and of a yellowish appearance. It is believed that progress has been made in breeding for resis - tance to this disease because we now have selected strains which are more wilt resistant than any commercial varieties grown at the present time. A number of these strains have been tested in the so-called Uni - form Nursery tests in 40 different states of the Union and on the basis of these tests, several of the best strains have been selected and are this winter being put through a final wilt resistance test. If they stand up under these final controlled cold and wilt tests, they will be compos - ited and will go to make up a new variety which will be increased as fast as possible so that it will get out into commercial production with - in a very few years. Thi3 variety has not as yet been named, but plans are 'ueing developed at the present time for its rapid increase, not only in Nebraska but also in other favorable seed growing areas. Another important phase of the alfalfa breeding program has to do with selection and hybridization to produce a pasture-type alfalfa. Many of us believe that the greatest opportunity for expansion in al - falfa acreage is through its use in pasture mixtures. The pasture con - tests and observations have shown that a combination of alfalfa and brome grass in a mixture forms one of the most productive permanent pastures available for the eastern half of Nebraska. While ordinary alfalfa works fairly well in such a combination, it does not last as long as desired for a permanent pasture. It might be added, however, that the management of the pasture makes a great deal of difference In the longevity of the alfalfa. However, it is known that other types, particu - larly a more spreading type of alfalfa will live longer under relatively close grazing than the ordinary hay type. It would also be very desirable to have an alfalfa which would spread either by rhizomes or stolons, thus tending to re-establish itself, and also to establish a sod which would prevent erosion. This type of alfalfa has been found in a goat pasture of northern Turkey by H. L. Westover, plant explorer of the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. Plants of this type have been tested in Nebraska for one or two years, and al - though they conform to the description given above, they have not proved sufficiently vigorous for commercial use under our conditions. </seg>
         <seg id="p111">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Our present program, therefore, is aimed toward retaining these de - sirable characters in a more rigorous hybrid and some such hybrids are now being made with apparently rather a good chance of success. I'm sorry to say however, that at present there are no plants or seed avail - able of this hybrid. ' Alfalfa breeding nursery at the Agricultural Experiment Station, Lincoln, Nebr. A number of miscellaneous problems or characters are being giv - en consideration in the alfalfa breeding program. One of the more im - portant is that of seed production and we are quite sure that some of the selected strains, which are resistant to the bacterial wilt disease, have more inherent seed productivity than some of the commercial va - rieties, particularly the Turkistan group which are somewhat lacking in this respect. Along this same line, efforts are being made to cross Medicago satlva (common alfalfa) with other species of Medicago, some of which have a very large seed, in some cases at least five times as large as ordinary alfalfa. It is thought that if such a cross could be made and ultimately increase the size of alfalfa seed, it would be a de - cided advantage in securing stands, particularly when the moisture is one or two inches below the surface. ¦.¦..'. . ¦. ¦ i . - . A number of other characters are being studied, such as dormancy and response to the short day length, and efforts are being made to se - lect away from extreme fall dormancy as is found, for example, in La- </seg>

Quality of the crop, leafineas, etc. are also being given considera- | tion but time does not permit our considering all these items in detail. % In conclusion, a table Is presented giving the summary of yields | of all alfalfa variety tests at the experimental farm in Lincoln for the | period, 1922-1938. Comparable tests have been conducted over this j': period of years, involving large numbers of individual plots from which | actual hay yields were obtained. These are given in Table 2. The yields f • ...-p., ; ' ' '". ¦ . ' .

Table 3 gives the summary of the stand survival of the varieties | at the end of the same testa upon which yields are given in Table 2. i Thus, taking both Table 2 and 3 into consideration, the relative per- '¦¦ formance of the varieties can be judged with respect to both yfeld and longevity of stand. From these tables, therefore, it can be seen that most of the variegated varieties, with the exception of Sand Lucern and possibly Canadian Variegated, are among the better present commer - cial varieties for Nebraska conditions. It should be remembered that the varieties in this group are not resistant to the bacterial wilt disease. Among the Common group the northern and central Commons have proved fairly high in yielding ability, but the group of Commons from the south were decidedly low in yield and in stand. , The next group listed are those strains of Turkistan origin, and | since all of the varieties In this group are relatively resistant to the bac- &lt; terial wilt disease, it is not surprising to find them high in stand sur- i vival. On the average, however, they are somewhat lower than Grimm in yield. Thus, at the present time, there is not a commercial variety : available which combines both high yield and longevity of stand.

Among the group of foreign origin, a considerable variation is found, both as to yield and stand: In general, it is difficult to forecast the adaptation of foreign varieties, and since the majority of them are decidedly Inferior with respect to both yield and stand, they should be required to prove their worth before they are planted to any extent in Nebraska. The varieties now on the recommended list in Nebraska include Cossack, Grimm, Ladak, and Hardistan, with an additional group of Hardy Approved consisting of old Nebraska fields which have proved their worth by withstanding the elements for a period of at least eight years. Any individual grower wishing to plant alfalfa, whether for for - age or seed production, would do well to look to the origin of the seed. PROGRESS IN SWEET CLOVER RESEARCH * Karl F. Mnnke* It would seem appropriate ,to preface the report of progress In sweet clover research by defining the objectives of the program. Sweet clover is a more or less recent recruit into the ranks of important le - guminous forage crops. Twenty-five years ago it was considered a weed and, therefore, an objectionable plant on any farm; today it is most highly regarded as a pasture and soil improvement crop. Nationally organized research In sweet clover has not advanced very far as yet and the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases in their experimental work in cooperation with the Nebraska station and elsewhere have outlined the following objectives: 1. Establishment Of varieties possessing the ability to make rapid seedling growth and to become well established before the adverse ef - fects of dry weather and weed competition become limiting factors. 2. Establishment of varieties which bloom and set seed later than the general run of yellow or white blossomed varieties now in use. This objective, if attained, would tend to extend the pasturing season of sec - ond-year sweet clover well into the summer, to the time when spring seeded pastures of Sudan or first-year sweet clover are ready for graz - ing. -¦¦ • ¦..-.'¦ "¦¦ ._ .

         <seg id="p118">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 3. Selection of sweet clover types which furnish ample tonnage of consumable forage to warrant their general use. 4. Selection of varieties with increased palatability both in regard to forage quality, and to freedom from extreme bitterness. Observations for the past several seasons indicate that through an intensive breeding program it may be entirely possible to reach these goals. We have had under observation at Lincoln over 200 strains of several species and strains of sweet clover developed in this and in otner countries. The extreme variation in plant type, in growth habit, and in otber characters which this wide collection presented has been most interesting. The selection of the desirable types and their devel - opment is the next step to be undertaken. Seedling Vigor * One of the striking observations which has been made is that the strains diflered greatly in their seedling vigor. Two strains, from Spain, called Spanish (formerly called Madrid White) and Madrid (formerly called Madrid Yellow) exhibited an ability to germinate and to grow rapidly in the spring of the first year and to recover quickly in the spring of the second year. In plot trials this character seemed to give these strains a decided advantage in competing with annual weeds and in becoming established. An effort is being made to retain this desirable character in making selections for further study. Late Maturity Desirable Much emphasis in the sweet clover breeding program 1b being placed on the question of later maturity. It would seem that for pas - ture purposes a large percentage of the sweet clover now grown is far too early for maximum productivity. The sweet clover pastures too frequently tend to lose their productiveness rapidly after the first of July. This is due to more than one factor. Many growers prefer the low - er growing, yellow-blossomed varieties because they tend to be avail - able for pasturing earlier In the spring and are probably easier to han - dle for seed harvesting. In the past a great increase has been made in the production of seed of a type called Grundy County White sweet clover. In habit of growth this variety resembles the early biennial yel - low-blossomed sweet clover except that it has white flowers. Varieties that appear to serve best as pasture types are those which together might be called Common White-blossomed Biennial sweet clovers. One variety under observation that we teel is typical ot this group ia Ever - green. </seg>
         <seg id="p119">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association It is also of interest that several strains were introduced from the Manchurian-Siberian region of Asia which are far later than the do - mestic strains previously studied. It is evident that no difficulty will be experienced in selecting and maintaining strains which will bloom a full month later than the common biennial yellow-blossomed sweet clover. "This will produce the desirable feature of extending the produc - tive grazing period four or more weeks. ¦ Breeding to Eliminate Bitterness For several years strains of sweet clover have been available in Canada which are characterized by a dwarf, many-stemmed, crown branching growth habit. These Canadian types appear to be totally un - adapted to Nebraska conditions. Strains of more local origin are avail - able which may furnish a leaner, finer-stemmed type of forage not un - like alfalfa in character. But in sweet clover fineness of stems and in - creased leaflness alone are not the solutions to the palatability problem. : : ¦ ———¦——— : ~ " : : — | A late maturing, long pasture season sweet clover is the aim of the sweet { clover breeders -j In addition to coarse stems and relatively low leaf percentage, sweet clover contains chemical compounds which give the plant a bitter taste, i This bitterness is often referred to by livestock men as the limiting factor in the use of sweet clover for pasture. Recent chemical research indicates that in addition to the bitter principle, these, same compounds are closely related to the bleeding disease of livestock brought about by the feeding of improperly cured or spoiled sweet clover hay. For these reasons one of the most intensive phases of the breeding program is a study to determine whether or not by selection, crossing, or by some other means it might be possible to develop varieties which contain relatively small amounts of these bitter compounds, small enough amounts to remove the objectionable taste of sweet clover and </seg>
         <seg id="p120">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the possibility of the bleeding disease. Results here and In Canada in - dicate that considerable variations in content of these chemical com - pounds occur in sweet clover varieties. It is therefore, the plan to select individual sweet clover plants significantly low in bitterness to form the basis of a breeding program to remove these objectionable features. The problems in sweet clover breeding are not as much concerned with increasing the actual total tonnage of forage as they are concern - ed with increasing the quality of forage. Many varieties are available which yield a very high tonnage per acre, but these tons per acre do not equal the total amount of consumable forage. It is our purpose to help make the palatable tonnage equal to the total tonnage. The blending into a single variety of all the desirable characters of sweet clover is within the realm of possibility but will be difficult since many of these characters now exist in widely different strains, va - rieties, and species. To be successful such a program requires painstak - ing breeding methods and time. New Breeding Methods Many technical procedures used in the development of new sweet clovers have necessarily had to be worked out or adapted to the pur - poses of the program. In some cases these are involved and of limited practical interest, but the mention of some of these might be made. For example, it must be remembered that this is for the most part a biennial or two-year crop. Spring seeded biennial sweet clover, unlike oats or barley or corn, needs 16 to 18 months to produce a ripe seed crop. It has been possible to greatly speed up the breeding program through the use of the greenhouses. If seedings be made in October and the seedlings are placed under a long day where the natural winter day length is supplemented by several hours of artificial light, it is possible to produce ripe seeds in 90 to 100 days. These seeds can then be planted in the field in the normal way in the spring. It is interesting to note that this short generation in no way interferes with the normal bienni - al habit of the crop. Seeds from biennial plants subjected to this 100 - -day treatment behave as normal biennials when again planted in the field. In connection with the bitterness studies special chemical meth - ods for the determination of bitter compounds have been used and a sample consisting of only a dozen leaves from an individual plant Is sufficient for the test. The results of experiments have shown that first-year sweet clover plants can be vegetatively propagated by cuttings. In this way individ - ual plants which are outstanding in any particular character can be multiplied in much the same way as some of the horticultural crops. By this method cuttings can be made in the field, brought to the green- </seg>
         <seg id="p121">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association ¦ •¦ ¦• • ; . • ¦• ! : house, subjected to the 100-day treatment and seed can be produced a year in advance of that in the field. The common white varieties of sweet clover while freely self-pol - linated (as wheat) are also frequently cross-pollinated by bees. For these reasons crosses are made in the greenhouse in the wintertime when bees are not a problem, and self-pollinating is largely done in the field by merely protecting the flowers by means of cloth bags from visi - tation by bees. ;'| In closing, it might be well to summarize briefly: The history of the transition of sweet clover from an undesirable weed to a legumi - nous forage crop of importance in Corn Belt and Great Plains agricul - ture has taken place during the last quarter century. Now that it has attained a definite position as a forage crop, intensive investigations are being pursued with a view toward improvements in quality, in pala - tability, and in cultural value. These investigations are progressing by means of standard plant breeding procedures especially modified for application to sweet clover. NEW METHODS OF RAINFALL AND SOIL MOISTURE CONSERVATION »' F. t. Dnley and J. C. Russell 2 The new methods of rainfall and soil moisture conservation which are the subject of this paper have been collectively designated as "sub - surface tillage." They embrace a whole system of farming in which the soil is rarely if ever turned upside down, but instead is handled always with respect to the various operations of seedbed preparation, planting, and tillage in such manner as to leave all residues so far as possible on the surface of the ground. Specifically they include methods of summer fallowing, of seedbed preparation and planting of wheat, of planting and cultivating corn and other crops, all radically new by way of contrast with the present system wherein farmers bury or burn crop residues and turn soil over and over with plows, listers, discs and cultivators. Subsurface tillage has four objectives; namely facilitated intake of rainfall and concomitant reduction of run-off, reduced or retarded evaporation following rainß, decreased erosion by water, and improved control of the hazards of blowing. i . ¦ '. ¦ "¦¦¦-. ¦' |» Contribution from the Soil Conservation Service, U.

         <seg id="p122">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture It Is not the purpose here to present the technical details of how residues on the surface improve the intake of water or decrease the loss of evaporation. These may be found elswhere (3), (4), (5). Suffice it ia to say that one of the remarkable facts that has come to light during the last two years is the facility with which soils may absorb water if their surfaces are protected by some sort of fibrous mulch, and also the rapid decline in rate of absorption during the course of heavy rains when those same soils are bare and fully exposed to the impact of falling drops and the silting over by running water. Facilitated intake means reduced run-off, and reduced run-off means decreased water erosion. Furthermore when the surface is adequately protected with fibrous material, if there is any excess of rainfall over intake, the run-off is practically clear. As for evaporation control, it is well known how ground remains moist under leaves and trash and in shady places. Everyone is aware of the general utility of heavy mulches in conserving soil moisture. Our studies indicate that light mulches that can be worked through with machinery may be almost equally good under some conditions. In the control of soil blowing, the role of residues on the surface has been long recognized and already farmers are accepting subsurface tillage in Western Nebraska on this basis alone at the first demonstra - tion of mechanical practicability. Later on in this paper data for two seasons of experiments will be presented which indicate how moisture is conserved by subsurface tillage and how crop yields have been affected by this stored water. Be - fore these are given it is proper to discuss methods. The first essential for subsurface tillage is a tool that will run under the ground at a depth of 2 to 5 or G inches, cut loose the weeds so they will die, and pulverize the soil comparably with a plow or disk, but leave all residues more or less flattened out on the surface with a minimum of burial. It must be an implement that will operate through ordinary clean combine stubble or chopped up corn stalks without clogging, not only once but successively. The second essential is a sub - stitute for the harrow with which fields may be smoothed and compact - ed for seeding. A third essential is a drill or planter that will put the seed in the ground properly and leave the trash on top between the rows. Another essential is a substitute for the shovel or disk cultivator to keep weeds out of intertilled crops. (3) Duley, F. L. Surface factors affecting the rate of intake of water by soils. Proc. Sci.

         <seg id="p124">Report o.f Nebraska State Board of Agriculture but the ordinary 8, 10, or 12 inch duck-toot field cultivator in common use for black fallow Is not a subsurface tillage tool nor even a half-way substitute. It does not leave the ground smooth nor does it leave the residues on the surface. These are absolute requirements of this method. The 21 or 22 inch sweep of figure 1 was developed originally for our plot work at Lincoln, North Platte, and Alliance, Neb., and has been used by us for 2 seasons. It works at its best in clean combine stubble (fig. 2), but it performs satisfactorily in grassy or weedy ground, corn stubble, or chopped corn stalk land, if moisture condi - tions are reasonable. It will not work through large bushy Russian thistles. SS^'ii^Ks&lt;H EBSI BBS Fig 2-Subsurface tillage In clean, combine wheat stubble. The ground is left smooth but is thoroughly pulverized, and practically none of the residues are Juried. In this condition rains will be absorbed without run-off and water and wind erosion will be negligible. In this connection we want to insist that the ability to perform through heavy weeds where soil has been sapped of moisture is no pro - per requirement of a subsurface tiller. The purpose of subsurface till - age in large part is improved moisture conservation and the farmer who delays this operation until weeds are large has defeated the prime objective before he starts. It is fine it a machine will go through heavy weeds or dry, compact hard places but one has no business with a sub - surface tiller if he sets these as his requirements.

Fig. 3.—Drilling wheat with a 10-inch semi-deep furrow drill on a seedbed prepared by subsurface tillage. The mechanical difficulties were negligible but too much residue was buried for maximum protection. Only two operations ¦were in - volved' in preparing the seedbed, an initial subsurface tillage of the combine stubble and a second subsurface tillage to kill volunteer and weed growth. The second essential tool as listed above is a substitute for the harrow. Our experience herein is somewhat limited, but so far is defi - nitely satisfying. Ordinarily after a season of summer fallow or seed - bed preparation the land is not rough and except for some bunching of residues and some over-looseness if tillage has been recent, seeding can be done without any supplemental operations. To even up the resi - dues and properly compact the soil we have employed a rotary hoe with wheels reversed. It rides over the residues and scatters them somewhat like a hay tedder and at the same time compacts the soil without dragging or burying any trash. With a grass seeder attached ahead we have done a very satisfactory job of planting alfalfa under a 2-ton per acre mulch of straw. As for seeding grain the various makes of deep-furrow drills will work with reasonable mechanical satisfaction; A 10-inch semi-deep furrow drill performed nicely last fall (fig. 3) and in 1938 an ordinary disk drill spaced at 10 inches worked without difficulty. The ordinary 7-inch disk drill is not sufficiently staggered to clear the trash and even if it did would bury too much to be satisfactory. </seg>

         <seg id="p127">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association There are a number of other practices! that will suggest them - selves, such as subtillage for grain sorghum production, potato produc - tion, how to utilize the idea of protective residues in planting legumes and grass, how to handle sweet clover and alfalfa sod, what to do with manure and corn stalks where oats are to he planted, and numerous other points. We do not have answers yet for* these. We turn now to some of the results that have been obtained by subsurface tillage as compared with normal methods. In 1938, a group of plots was summer fallowed from April to Sep - tember, and then planted to rye. The methods of fallow, the storage of moisture, and the yields of rye in 1939 are shown in table 1. The first and last 30 days of the 1938 fallow season were wet, but the rains were not of a character to produce much run-off. The mid - season period was very dry. The total run-off on plowed black fallow was about 2 inches. On subsurface tillage it was practically zero. The respective Btorages of moisture on these two plots were 3.71 and 9.72 inches. The computed evaporation loss, that is rainfall minus storage and run-off, on plowed fallow was 12.18 inches; on subsurface tillage, where there was always a cover of straw, it was 8.18 inches. Of the latter, 5.55 inches occurred during the intermediate dry period. Not only did subsurface tillage give maximum storage, but it also gave the maximum yield of rye. ',"¦ • In 1938, seedbeds were prepared for whter wheat by subsurface tillage and four other methods. The treatments and moisture storage during the fall, and the wheat yields in 1939 ate shown in table 2. It is to be recalled that the early fall of 1938 was wet, a total of 8.34 inches of rain falling between the dates of soil sampling at the beginning and end of seedbed preparation. On black plowing! only 1.87 inches of this was conserved. On subsurface tillage and on disked land with a corre - sponding amount of .straw on the surface, the storage was over 4 inches. The 1939 yields reflected nicely the benefits o' residues on the surface, the average grain yield of subsurface tillage and disking being 24.5 bushels per acre as compared with 10.5 bushels on plowed land without residues. In another experiment in 1938, we sub tilled short oat stubble land supplemented with straw to make 2 tons per acre of residues, in com - parison with four other methods. This was done in September and the following spring the land was put to corn. The treatments, the winter storage of moisture, and the corn yields in 1939 are shown in table 3. There was practically no fall weed growth following the soil sampling in the fall, and as a consequence there was no advantage in moisture storage up to planting time from subsurface ullage as compared with protective residues without any tillage, but there was an advantage </seg>

The corn after planting was cultivated with large sweeps which left straw between the rows on the one plot but bare soil on others. The IS 39 season was so critically droughty that small differences in moisture economy reflected large in yields. The maximum yield was with subsurface Ullage throughout, the next largest was residue through the winter followed by spring plowing. The lowest yield was from fall plowing without straw. In another experiment, in 1939, corn was planted directly in stubble land without any previous treatme at except that the stubble and weeds had been mowed the fall before md left flat on the ground over winter. The tillage was done with sweer s so that the 1938 residues remained on! the ground all season. The yield was 18.5 bushels per acre as compared with 9.6 bushels on a portion of the same ground where the residue was plowed under 6 inches deej just before planting. This subsurface tilled land on a 7 percent slope lost no water by run-oft and no soil by erosion whereas adjacent.land on ;he same slope where there was no protective residue suffered seriously during several heavy . downpours. . ¦ j In 1939, summer fallow experiments were repeated with certain enlargements over the plan used in 1938. Thje treatments, the moisture storage during the season, and the run-off losses on certain plots are shown in table 4. j " The 1939 season was very unfavorable for moisture storage in fallow land! Rains were widely scattered which allowed much evapora - tion in spite of the mulches on certain plots, and the few heavy rains that accounted for the major portion of the total precipitation were practically all downpours that gave run-off. The maximum recorded run-off was 2.35 inches on a plot of bare disked fallow. The minimum measured run-off was 0.39 inches on a ptoi mulched with 2 tons per acre of straw. It certainly was less on the heavier mulched plots. All of the storage where residues were used can be accounted for through their effect on the decrease of run-off, except where 4 and 8 ton rates of mulches were used. In these there was a considerable additional storage due to evaporation control. At the beginning of the fallow season there was approximately 30 inches of wet subsoil in all plots. At the end of the season, the wet zone in all bare plots had advanced les3 than 6 inches. In the plots mulched with 2 tons of straw per acre the wet subsoil extended to about 48 inches, in the 4-ton mulch to about 60 inches, and in the 8-ton mulch plot the subsoil was wet to the bottom of the sixth foot.

Seedbed prep - aration was begun on July 7 when the soil to a depth of about 18 inch - es was fairly moist. The total rainfall from thence on to September 27 was 3.61 inches, the only good rain being one of 1.25 inches on August 7. Every bit of this rainfall was lost regardless of treatment, the aver - age storage in all plots being only 0.02 inches. Seeding was delayed until after two showers in early October that totalled 0.79 inches. At that time it was notable that the subsurface tilled land was in the best moisture condition of all plots for immediate germination, and the basin-listed land in the poorest condition and the wheat today reflects those differences. Regardless of the disappointing fall the prospects are that any precipitation from now on will be the most effective on the subtillage plots. In conclusion, we want to make three statements without equivo - cation. First, residues on the surface of the ground will facilitate and increase the intake of water and will reduce run-off and water erosion. Second, residues on the surface of the ground will reduce wind erosion. Third residues on the surface of the ground will decrease the evapora - tion of water immediately following rains which will thereby improve the effectiveness of rainfall on numerous occasions. </seg>

We are suggesting various practices to you only on the basis that they seem to deserve some experimentation on your part. J We caution you that there are numerous problems connected with subsurface tillage for which there are yet no answers such as the ag - gravation of certain insect pests and plant diseases, the possibility of nitrate repression on thin soils, the hazards of fire, and complications of tillage and weeds if conditions ever become too wet, not to mention the possibility that in certain sections the character of the rainfall may too frequently be like ours this fall at Lincoln when every method failed.; So far, the idea of residues on the surface seem to us to be one of ... the most hopeful prospects of conserving more of our rainfall, and at the same time conserving our soil from water and wind erosion. </seg>
         <seg id="p132">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture THE MOVEMENT OF SOIL MOISTURE M. D. Weldon, College of Agri. In discussing the movement of moisture in the soil, let us begin with a dry soil and consider the movement of moisture into the soil. We may then take up the movement within the soil mass, and finally the escape of water from the soil by various types of movement. When rain falls upon a dry soil, —one that contains no available water, —or when irrigation water is applied, we have a sheet or film of water maintained on the surface, and water moves into and fills the pores of the soil under the action of two forces, gravity and capillarity. If the soil is of medium texture, say a silt loam or clay loam, the satu - rated soil immediately under the sheet of free water on the surface will contain 60 to 75 percent of water. When this clay loam has absorbed all of a 2 inch or 2.25 inch rain, it will be saturated to the depth of 4 or 5 inches. In a sandier soil the same amount of moisture will of course penetrate deeper, and in a heavier soil it will not go as deep as in the clay loam, because the sandy soils have less pore space and the heavier soils have more pore space. When the rain stops, the moisture continues to move downward. The wet soil is no longer saturated; a part of the free water in the larger pore spaces moves downward into the dry soil. This movement of moisture within the soil mass, still under the action of gravity and capillarity, will be relatively rapid in sandy soils and slow in heavy soils. In a heavy clay soil, moisture may continue to move for four or five days after the rain or the irrigation ceases. A sandy soil may come to equilibrium in a few hours. The drying out of the surface soil after rain or irrigation is the result, not only of evaporation from the sur - face, but of the downward movement of moisture and its distribution through a greater depth in the soil mass. Eventually our 2 inches of water will penetrate to a depth of 10 or 12 inches in a soil of medium texture, 16 or 18 inches in a sand, or only 8 inches in a clay soil. There it stops, and neither gravity nor capillarity will move it any farther. The soil in this moisture condition is at its field carrying capacity as far down as the moisture penetrates. Below that point it remains com - pletely dry. If it is protected from loss by evaporation and plant growth, the moi3t soil will remain at the same moisture content Indefi - nitely, except as some movement of water vapor may occur from the moist, warm top soil to the dry, cool subsoil. How Summer Fallow Works When the moisture content of the soil is greater than the field carrying capacity in one zone and less than that in another zone not too far away, capillarity may cause the movement of moisture from the </seg>
         <seg id="p133">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association ¦ ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦"¦.' ¦ ¦¦ • ¦ i ¦ .. ' • wetter zone to the drier zone. When the moisture content is at or below the field carrying: capacity throughout, no' capillary movement occurs anywhere or'in any direction, and water can be lost from the soil only by evaporation or by the action of plant roots. It is lost by evaporation only to the depth of 8 or 10 inches. These facts are the basis for the practice of summer fallowing. The success of summer fallowing is bas - ed upon the elimination of all plant growth; and all losses of water thru growing plants, so that all of the water that gets into the soil is stored for future use, except what is lost by evaporation.

         <seg id="p134">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The field carrying capacity of the soil, then, is like the seating ca - pacity o{ a room. Free movement occurs when all the seats are occupied and there is standing room only; that is, when the moisture content is above the field carrying capacity. Once the moisture is all comfortably settled in its field carrying capacity seats, it is reluctant to move either by gravity or by capillarity. Movement will occur only by the action of forces that have considerably more energy than either capillarity or gravity; that is, by evaporation or by the root activities of growing plants. Loss of Water by Percolation The movement of water in the soil J3 in one way distinctly differ - ent from the movement of people in a roomful of chairs. If the soil is already moist to the field carrying capacity, and more water is added at the surface, the entire mass of soil moisture moves downward. When some more people come into a room, they have to go past the chairs that are already occupied and take seats toward the back of the room, but when more water enters the soil at the surface, the whole mass of moisture already present moves downward, making room for the new - ly added water at the top. Thus the nitrate and other substances dis - solved in the soil moisture are carried downward ahead of each newly added supply of moisture. Thus, if the upper foot of silt loam soil con - tains moisture and nitrate, and 2 inches of rain or irrigation water is absorbed at the surface, the moisture and nitrate already present are pushed down into the second foot of soil, leaving practically no nitrate in the upper foot, until more is produced by bacterial activities. Here in Nebraska this movement of soluble materials downward with the moisture has some value in distributing the elements of fertility throughout the root zone of plants. In wetter climates, where large amounts of moisture percolate through the soil into the groundwater, considerable amounts of fertility elements are carried out in the drain - age waters, find their way into the streams and rivers, and thus are lost completely. When water is stored in the soil, it may get out in three ways. It may percolate down into the groundwater as has just been mentioned. This is not an important loss in Nebraska. It may evaporate from the surface or from within the soil near the surface. This does not affect the moisture below the depth of 6 to 12 inches, but it is our most seri - ous cause of loss, because so much of our moisture never gets deeper than that. Finally, it may be drawn out by the roots of growing plants, and if weeds are allowed to grow, this is the worst loss of all. What can we do about it? We all know, of course, that weed con - trol, and that means the complete elimination of weeds, is highly im - portant in the conservation of soil moisture. Professors Duley and </seg>

H. Stewart, Manager—Farm Service Division Federal Land Bank of Omaha A farmer or any other person responsible for the operation of an average farm has to make, in the course of a year's time, a great many decisions about farm operations. I wonder if any one has ever tried to estimate the number of major and minor decisions that a farmer oper - ating a 240-acre mixed farming unit would} be called upon to make in the course of a year's time. I have put this question to several experi - enced farmers and find that some estimate the major decisions at ap - proximately 100, to which would be added two or three thousand min - or decisions. I ¦ The general of an army in the trenches;would have many decisions to make and wrong ones would cost, needlessly, the lives of many sol - diers.: The farmer who makes wrong decisions over a period of time would not cause the loss of lives, but he would sooner or later "lose his shirt". Let's consider for a minute some of I the main points that come up for consideration. To be sure; one can proceed by habit or custom and without modification because of current conditions such as soil moisture, new developments and facts, or the general outlook. We can operate mechanically so far as machinery is concerned and also in re - gard to enterprises and farm practices. ] Some of the major problems for consideration are: What crops and what acreages of each shall be planted? What planting, seedbed, and other practices shall be followed? What shall be done with the crops grown; shall they be marketed for cash, pastured off, or fed on the farm, and to what class, types, and ages of livestock? ¦''-.;' , These are but a few of the points which should be considered, some) in advance of.the year's operation and others on a day-to-day basis as conditions for the year unfold. Professor Hopt who is being honored on this Campus this week in the Agricultural Hall of Fame used to say, "what a farmer learns one year makes a darn fool out of him the next^'. It is true, that operating in Nebraska in the transition zone of the Great Plains and the Corn Belt, we flucuate from year to year as the rainfall varies, from rather typical Corn-Belt conditions to the less favorable Great Plains environ- </seg>
         <seg id="p136">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ment. For the last few years, we have had predominantly the Great Plains environment even in eastern Nebraska. The drouth, grasshopper, chinch bug, and the debt load, which recent unfavorable years have emphasized, makes it particularly hard to lay out and carry on a satis - factory farming program. Returning for a moment to the first question—what crops and what acreages of each should be planted? We must give consideration to such items as: How will it yield? How much will it cost to grow? How sure is it to make a crop? What is the after-effect on the land as to fertility, soil moisture, and soil erosion? What is its value in cash, as feed, or as to the soil? What I have said so far is a rather theoretical discussion of man - agement practices. It is always more interesting and usually more val - uable to consider some of the more definite practices. We might ask ourselves what, on the average, will be the returns and profits from the different small grain crops such as wheat, oats, barley, and rye? Importance of Wheat and Barley In checking over the returns from winter wheat, even though re - cent years have been relatively unfavorable ones, it is apparent, as has been pointed out by other studies, that wheat is among our most con - sistent yielding small grain crops. It has also been interesting in study - ing the yields from many Nebraska farms to note that oats appear to have yielded relatively well and with considerable consistency. .While we may question oats a3 a cash crop, it does have its place as is shown by the results during recent years, particularly in the South Platte area of Nebraska. The crop is particularly valuable to the livestock man. Barley too, as the Agricultural College has pointed out for many years, particularly where an early variety is used, makes relatively good returns. I have been very much interested in noting during the past three or four years that Spartan barley i 3 now very widely grown in western lowa and northeastern Nebraska. Its good yields, together with the high-test weight and general quality, pleases farmers and I believe that at the present time, we do not have, in commercial produc - tion, a variety that will equal it. If time permitted, we could discuss in detail many of the points regarding small grains, such as the use of the standard winter wheat variety, the treatment of seed for the con - trol of smut, and probably above all in importance, the early prepara- </seg>

South of the Platte and in the Panhandle, winter wheat is one of our surest and most profitable crops. Herman Ebers Farm, Seward County. Hybrid Corn As to the corn crop, probably the most important question raised is—shall.•we grow a hybrid or an open-pollinated variety? There is, I think, no question as to the superiority of adapted hybrids where cli - matic conditions are at all satisfactory. We have the troublesome ques - tion of—how far west from the Missouri River is it practical to grow hybrids on dryland? I believe wewill all agree that if the season is at least a reasonably good one, hybrids will prove profitable throughout much of Nebraska. We are perhaps at this time somewhat confused as to the adaptation of hybrids in the western third of the state as during recent years, there have been rather startling successes in growing hy - brids, thought adapted only to eastern Nebraska. Have our unreasonably warm and long seasons changed our old ideas or will a return to what we believe is normal again confirm pur old opinions? We have heard considerable discussion about the disadvantage of hybrids because of their characteristic of tasseling within a very short period of time. Should they tassel during an unfavorably hot period, we know the re - sults only too well.

Sorghums Grain sorghums during the past year or two have been in the "spot-light". Everyone who has traveled about the state during the past season no doubt has noticed numerous instances where corn has been practically a complete failure, but early grain sorghums have made 15 to 20 bushels or more per acre. While outstanding fields of grain sorghums can be found in every community, there i 3, on the av - erage farm 1 believe, less superiority of grain sorghums over corn than we might expect. This is apparently due chiefly to the fact that many still plant grain sorghums altogether too thick, using 6 to 8 lbs. of seed per acre, where V.i to 2 lbs. of good seed would be sufficient. Secondly, the actual yields of grain sorghums into the bin are lower than they should be because of waste in harvesting. We have summarized the re - turns for corn and grain sorghums in a number of representative Ne - braska counties. This comparison, Table 1, involves corn and grain sorghums on thirty-seven farms and represents a total of 1481 acres of corn and 453 acres of grain sorghum, chiefly Early Kalo and Sooner Milo.

While the grain sor - ghums yielded more than three times as much as corn, yet the yield of the grain sorghum was not high enough to make a profitable crop. Even when planted at the correct rate early grain sorghums may fail under extreme drouth conditions. They are however the last crop to go. </seg>

We found in checking corn versus grain sorghums in these six counties that the largest single yield differential between these two crops was on a Platte dounty farmVwhere corn yielded 5.2 bu., whereas grain sorghums made 32 bu., a superiority of 26.8 bu. You also may be in - terested to know that on these 37 farms there were 8 complete corn failures and 6 complete grain sorghum failures. Even grain sorghums require some moisture.

I believe that there are possibilities of hogging off a much larger acreage of grain sorghums. I tried this personally this fall, running 70 spring pigs into about four acres of Early Kalo, which made an esti - mated yield of 45 bu. We have been satisfied with the results and, al - though there is some waste, this probably is less than the cost of har - vesting the crop in the normal way. If we are to grow sorghums extensively we must give considera - tion to the problem of developing rotations and crop sequences which will overcome as far as possible the deleterious effects of sorghums on the land. It is commonly believed that crops following a heavy growth sorghums, particularly the large, late forage types are affected ad- </seg>
         <seg id="p140">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture versely. It will be interesting to note whether or not crops following the early grain sorghum varieties are affected to the same degree. Is the soil any drier in the upper three or lour feet after a 25 to 30 bu. crop of Kalo or Sooner Milo than it is after corn? I would like to see some soil moioture data on that point. During this particular season I question whether there is much difference since we have had no fall rains to soak up corn land following the maturity of this crop. I recall a striking illustration of the difference between corn and Early Kalo in their effect on the following winter wheat crop which was shown to me by Superintendent Zook at the North Platte Station. The 193 9 winter wheat on a field of Early Kalo, which made a good crop in 1938, was practically a failure this season, whereas winter wheat seeded on corn land in the fall of 1938 made a very satisfactory yield estimated at 18 to 20 bushel. Sorghums in the Rotation What crop shall we use following sorghums? We ordinarily rec - ommend, but 1 do not know that we are right, that we follow sorghums with summer fallow or with another crop of sorghum or with corn. We believe we should not put fall wheat nor early spring grain on sorghum land, but this may depend on soil moisture conditions. H. E. Myers, Assoc. Professor of Soils at the Kansas State College, writing under date of December 7, has the following to say about sor - ghum rotations: "Under extreme western Kansas conditions, we find that there is no agronomic advantage to be gained by rotating sor - ghums with other crops. At both Colby and Garden City con - tinuous milo and kafir have both yielded as well as or better than milo and kafir following other crops. We do believe, however, on the basis of these results, that the sorghums should be alternated with fallow. Farther east in the state crop rotation appears to affect favorably the yield of the milo and kafir. For crops to follow these, we have found that bar - ley has given very satisfactory results in northwestern Kan - sas. The yield of barley following the sorghums has been practically the same as the yield of barley following corn. If fallow is to be included in the crop rotation, we feel that af - ter the sorghum crop is a good place for it except that some of the fallowed land should be used for sorghum production. We have no information relative to the moisture re - quirements of the earlier grain sorghums as compared to the larger growing forage types. </seg>

During the past several seasons, the livestock man has been much » better off than the grain farmer. While probably the livestock man will not continue to have the same relative advantages of recent years, yet I believe the man who provides for sorghums, for forage and grain, and who carries over a feed reserve of roughage, all of which is marketed I : ; - - \:f fya 1 ¦ * +"m " *&amp;?sss.

May I, in closing, come back again to the fact that the farmer of today has many problems and practices to consider. My observations during twenty years with the Extension Service and the past two years with the Federal Land Bank have convinced me that the fellow with a well thought-out plan, which usually involves livestock, makes the most headway. Even a poor plan is better than no plan at all. </seg>
         <seg id="p142">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The successful farmer of today needs to be a keen business man. He need not be a technical man. The Experiment Station research man, the Extension Specialist, and the well-trained County Agent can supply the technical facts regarding crops, soils, livestock, livestock feeding, irrigation, and whatnot. Technical facts are not necessarily practical nor profitable facts when converted into farm mangement practices on the farm. The successful farmer must winnow out the technical facts and weld together for his particular farm those which form a program for sound practices, offering the greatest possibilities of success. In closing, I would like to say to the students in the audience that they should get, while in school, not only the basic subject matter facts, but also all of the information they can as to how they can fit these facts together into a sound, safe, workable and, —we hope,— a profitable plan. While I have emphasized the development of a plan that results in profits, I do not wish, to overemphasize profits, but of course some profits are necessary. A comfortable family home, the proper environ - ment for health and character building of youngsters, and a job that appeals to and satisfies the inner-man, these are, in the end, the mea - surements that we would prefer to use rather than profits. HOW I ERADICATED BINDWEED ON MY FARM Dwight Walkup, York, Nebr. While I would not say that I have profited by having bindweed on my farm, I am certain that I have profited by killing it out. It has giv - en me a great amount of satisfaction to know that one can eradicate such a persistent weed pest as bindweed and to see a good crop grow - ing on land that was once completely overrun with this crop destroy - ing vine. In 192 6 I bought 120 acres of unimproved level land across the road from my father's place. I built a home there and improved the place. I knew there were some parts of the land rather badly infested with bindweed, but we had been farming with bindweed at home and I was not so very apprehensive about this feature. However, as I began to work my own land, I took more notice of the bindweed. I found the infested areas were larger than I realized, they were getting larger each year, and smaller patches of bindweed were getting to be distrib - uted over all parts of the farm. It was very evident that something must be done to stop the spread of this weed and to kill it out if possi - ble. I had enough of harvesting only part of a crop or no crop at all where the bindweed was the heaviest, and of trying to cultivate corn or harvest small grain through a tangled mass of vines. Had I been asked in 1926 how much bindweed there was on my farm, while reluc- </seg>
         <seg id="p143">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association tant to admit there was any, I probably would have stated there might be five to eight acres if it all could be gotten together. In 1938 I com - pleted eradication of 38 acres on this farm, and this year finished 7 acres on my father's place, a total of 45 acres, all killed out by clean cultivation. I yet have some bindweed on this farm in a six-acre field of alfalfa and a small temporary pasture, all pastured with hogs. I expect to eradicate there as soon as a new field of alfalfa can be established. Bindweed Equipment In. 1934 came the first government crop control program with land to be idle in making compliance. It seemed the opportune time had come to make an effort at killing the bindweed. A. few years be - fore I had bought an old tool at a farm sale that had been sold when HI BP^%^"- - A home made bindweed machine. new as an alfalfa cultivator. I rebuilt this machine several times in making a bindweed eradicating tool. I tiave a farm shop equipped for doing such work. When finished, this machine worked to my complete satisfaction. It was fitted with nine 15"duckfoot shovels or sweeps on beams spaced 11% inches apart. It had ample clearance for the loose dirt and trash to work through the machine. It worked a strip 8% feet wide and four horses could pull it six or seven inches deep. In the spring of 1935 the John Deere Plow Company of Omaha placed at the disposal of the Agricultural. Engineering Department, College of Agriculture, a reconditioned two plow size tractor, an 8% foot duckfoot field cultivator, and another bindweed machine to be us - ed in bindweed eradicating experiments.

This change in the machine improved its performance greatly. I could pull it in the next higher gear thereby increasing the ground covering rapacity of the machine and lowering the cost per acre. Eradication Methods I began operations in the spring of 1934 on the side of the farm most infested with bindweed, with the belief that if the plants were cut off beneath the surface of the ground at frequent intervals and often enough they would finally weaken and die. I worked 13 acres of bindweed that year and my intervals between cultivations ranged from eight to ten days in mid-summer to nearly three weeks at the start and </seg>
         <seg id="p145">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association close of the growing season. I tried to work the bindweed each time the vine growth reached about eight inches long on top of the ground Following that plan required thirteen cultivations with the home made bindweed machine in 1934. In 1935 the vigor of the plants was notice - ably less and I worked the bindweed areas but ten times. In the spring of 1936 it was worked twice and as eradication seemed nearly 100 per - cent complete the field was planted to corn the last ot May. This field then was worked a total of twenty-five times and I was well pleased with the results.'A few surviving plants showed up that.summer but they were disposed of by digging out at spade depth when making a checkup of the field in late summer. This field has been in corn the four seasons since, completing eradication, excepting five acres across one end which will be mentioned later; I started working four more acres of bindweed in the late summer of 1934, four acres of infested land was started in the spring of 1935, and after small grain harvest in 1935 I began work on an 8% acre rectangular field which was nearly all infested with bindweed and which contained an old fence row and two straw stack bottoms where the growth was always especially vig - orous. That field was worked with the tractor and duckfoot cultivator seven times that season, fourteen times in 1936, and seven times in 1937. This field was.in corn in 1938 and 1939 and I have not seen a trace of bindweed there except for seedlings which started each spring and have been easily killed in planting and tending the crop. In the fall of 1936 and spring of 1937 a survey was made of that part of the farm where the patches of bindweed were more scattering. Due to the drought there was little other vegetation on the ground and the bindweed could be easily seen.: I would drive around the outer edge of each patch with the tractor and cultivator working to the center, then when it got too close to turn would lift and work back and forth to cover all the ground. I found that I was working sixty-five patches on about a sixty-acre field. These patches ranged from 4 to 54 square rods in area and the total area was about four and one-half acres. In addition, there were four acres in irregular width lands at one side and end of the field. These patches were worked in much the same manner as earlier fields, and at different times during the second sea - son, work stopped on patches as kill appeared complete. By working patches in this way I was able to more quickly free all the land of the bindweed menace. Each patch of bindweed is a prolific seed producer and a source of infesting clean ground around it. I would drive through the. crop growing on the clean ground and quickly work each patch in turn and consider this method very practical in combating the bind - weed.. . • '¦¦•¦' '¦;:¦• ' ¦ ¦ ".. ,: •. ¦ ¦ ..

         <seg id="p146">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture year, a total of seventeen. Outside of two exceptional spots, it appears safe to put this field into corn next year. The prolonged drought Is re - tarding the growth of bindweed and may make it easier to kill. I have a dim recollection of when I was a boy at home, probably thirty or more years ago. Father hauled out many loads o£ barnyard manure and covered deeply in an effort to smother out a patch of "wild morning glory" (now bindweed) on one side of the same field described above. That is what an lowa farmer did this year I am told, and others prob - ably also where the real menace of bindweed is not realized. Experience with Chlorate Late in the fall of 1935 I bought and spread, in solution, 200 pounds of sodium chlorate on part of those sixty-five patches on one end of the field, planning at that time to clean that part of the farm by chemical treatment. The kill was so poor that I resorted to cultivation a year later. I have later used chlorate on some small areas with satis - factory results. Except for areas too small or inaccessible for cultiva - tion, chlorate is too expensive and uncertain in results to be practical. Crops Fallowing Eradication I favor corn or other cultivated row crop to follow eradication. This permits a closer checkup on any surviving old plants and is more certain to destroy seedlings before they become established. Wheat or other smail grain is greatly stimulated by conditions in the soil result - ing from two years fallow. For two years I had some wheat on such ground and it grew very rank only to succumb to an attack of black rust before ripening. Wheat on continuous crop land was more profit - able. Corn seems to be adversely affected during its early life by soil conditions resulting from bindweed eradication. It often is vari-colored in foliage and puny in appearance for considerable time, then by mid - summer it appears to be growing out of it and by harvest time, due principally at least in the drought years, to greater soil moisture re - serves resulting from fallow, it likely will make a good yield as com - pared to a poor yield on adjacent continuous crop land. I have never failed to harvest much better corn the first crop following eradication, and in some seasons it has more than equalled what might be produced on the bindweed infested land in five seasons. Roadway Conditions My farm is bordered on one side by a county road, and by a town - ship road, by a bindweed infested rented farm, and by the right of way of a branch of the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad. Our county board has held to the policy for several years of cooperating with any farmer destroying bindweed on his farm by treating the adjacent roadside 'with sodium </seg>
         <seg id="p147">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association chlorate. Part of the county roadside has been treated four times and some plants yet remain. The township roadside was carefully treated once with a very poor kill resulting. With moisture, crop, and economic conditions so unfavorable, I have not asked for more work there The ¦cost of roadside chemical treatment in this locality has been out of pro - portion with the accomplishments. The problem of cleaning bindweed off cultivated land is simple and inexpensive compared to roadsides. Seedling Problem Despite the fact that there is much bindweed along the roadsides and on the farms in my locality, some nearby farms are completely covered with the pest, I expect to keep my land free of bindweed It will require considerable vigilance to do so. It is well known that bind - weed seed will remain viable in the soil without germinating for a number of years. This spring I seeded oats for pasture on five acres of land which was part of the first field eradicated on the farm. No bind - weed seed has been produced on that tract since 1933. I noticed, with apprehension, a lot of bindweed plants-starting on that oats field My Plan was to plow this field early and prepare for seeding alfalfa It was plowed about July first and worked down, then lay undisturbed through the rest of the summer waiting for rain. Plenty of bindweed seedlings survived the plowing. It was too dry to seed alfalfa. Anyway it is not yet safe to retire this field from a cultivated crop. I went carefully over this field in November and put a small amount of chlorate around the root of each plant found. There were hundreds of them. Perhaps a few workings with the duekfoot cultivator after plowing would have ended these young plants. As long as any viable bindweed seed remain in the soil on this farm, that will be a greater menace to the land than the infested farms and roadsides in the locality. Cost of Eradication The cost of killing bindweed is exactly proportionate to the num - ber of cultivations necessary to complete eradication. It will also vary with each farmer's layout and the efficiency of his equipment. My ex - perience indicates that ten cents per acre for each cultivation will cov - er the cost of fuel and oil, ten cents per acre may be allowed for labor, and twenty cents per acre for use of tractor and cultivator or a total of forty cents per acre for each cultivation. Thus, if twenty-five culti - vations are necessary to complete eradication, the cost would be $10.00 per acre. ¦¦¦'..•¦¦ Soil Conservation If we are to continue to have a government crop control program j under the guise of soil conservation, then I would like to see a pay - | ment set up which a farmer could earn by eradicating bindweed. Eradi- </seg>
         <seg id="p148">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture cation of bindweed is more than soil conservation. It is restoration of the land to productiveness. Under the rules of the 1939 program it -was possible to earn $7.50 per acre for bindweed eradication practice up to a limited amount, but applicable only in organized bindweed dis - tricts. This payment is more than the costs per acre per year should be for working bindweed and might well be reduced and spread over more acres. It probably is neither necessary or practical to organize bindweed districts at once in all localities where bindweed exists. Any farmer anywhere who eradicates one or more patches of bindweed has made a contribution towards conserving the resources of the land. Conclusion This is the time for every farm owner to make plans to clean up on bindweed. If he has but little on his farm he cannot afford not to eradicate to prevent its spread to other parts of the farm, and if he has much he can well afford to eradicate it to restore the productiveness of the land. NEW ATTACKS OX THK EROSIOX PROBLEM E. H. Doll, Agri. Collesc •New methods in rainfall conservation and the conservation of farms from destroyed values by noxious weeds have been ably discuss - ed this afternoon and now our discussion turns toward the new attack on the soil erosion problem. Contouring Increases Yields and Saves Soil It is gratifying to note the increased interest of fanners in saving the soil. Great credit is due to the Nebraska farmers, who are attempt - ing to save as much of their soil and water as possible, with the as - sistance of the Extension Service, county agricultural agents, and the Soil Conservation Service in demonstration areas and organized soil conservation districts. Probably the drouth has given as great an im - petus as anything to the adoption of contour tillage by farmers be - cause it has increased the yield of their row crops wherever several heavy rains have fallen sometime during the season. For example, at one of the ero3ion control experiment stations over a five-year period with an average annual precipitation of 25% inches on a 9 percent slope of loessial soil, the average yield of corn planted on the contour was 25.09 bushels per acre, while the adjoining plot listed up and down hill averaged 16.45 bushels which gives a difference of 11% bu - shels in favor of contouring. During the five-year period of this ex - periment at Clarinda, lowa, 12.6 inches of water ran off the plots list - ed down hill while only 1.3 inches escaped from the adjoining plot </seg>
         <seg id="p149">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association listed on the contour. It is recognized that contouring is practiced pri - marily to conserve soil, and with this same experiment the soil loss from this field was only one-fourth as much with contoured corn as with corn listed up and down hill, while the average increased yield of 1.1% bushels per acre due to conserved water was merely incidental or a by-product of this soil conserving practice: Fanners Organize to Fight Erosion Work on the control of soil erosion is not necessarily new to all Nebraska farmers. Some of them have practiced soil conservation on their own initiative for a good many years, while others have been as - sisted by county agents, the College of Agriculture, CCC camps, and the Soil Conservation Service. However, the greater attack on the ero - sion problem on a larger scale which might be called mass production was inaugurated with the enactment of the Nebraska Soil Conserva- Fig. I.— Contour farming with a crop rotation including grasses and legumes controls erosion on this farm. tion Districts Law, Legislative Bill 553, by our first unicameral legis - lature in 1937. Under this act, 10 soil conservation districts have now been organized wherein farmers attack the erosion problem from the angle of proper land use. They analyze and find out the causes of their erosion problems and then plan a conservation program to remedy these conditions. County land use committees are collecting data, to classify soils with regard to future recommendations for proper use of the land to maintain its fertility for a stabilized agriculture and yet give a satis- </seg>
         <seg id="p150">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture factory net return to the farmers of the county. These county com - mittees have assembled much valuable information in the form o£ pre - cipitation records, mortgage indebtedness, tax delinquency, land valu - ations, farm livestock numbers, etc. The five farmers who are super - visors of each organized district have used this information in.plann - ing a conseivaton program for their community. The district super - visors with the assistance of the Soil Conservation Service and Exten - sion Service have subdivided the soils in their district into 5 classes or subclasses for each typical farm in their district. By having a conser - vation survey map made of his farm showing the slope of each field, the loss of top soil, the soil type, and the present use of the land, each farmer in an organized soil conservation district ha:s an inventory of the natural resources of his farm and he can then plan a conservation program using these recommendations to fit this inventory. For exam - ple, some of their land use classifications are given in the following paragraph. Recommended Control Practices For Specific Land Classes The following classifications and recommendations are applicable to hardland in central and eastern Nebraska, where the districts now organized are located. Class I land is upland or bottomland that is level or has less than 2 percent slope, i 3 suited to cultivation, and will suffer little erosion, if the drainageways are grassed, a good crop rotation with legumes or preferably grasses and legumes is followed, and crop residues and weeds are left on the field. Class II land is gently sloping with from 3 to 5 or 6 percent slope, having slight to moderate sheet erosion with occasional crossable and very few uncrossable gullies. The proper use of this type of land is cultivation and erosion can be controlled on it by using simple conser - vation practices such as a good crop rotation, grassing drainageways, contour farming and the prevention of burning. Class 111 land has as much slope and generally a little more than Class II land, has lost considerably more top soil, and frequently has more finger gullies. The proper use of this land is cultivation with the use of some additional complex or intensive erosion control practices such as terracing, field diversions, strip cropping, and following a crop rotation with small grains and sod forming crops predominating row crops. Class IV land is steeply rolling and not suitable for continuous cultivation. Grasses and legumes should occupy the land at least 60 percent of the time. When the field is in cultivation the waterways should be left in grass, burning should be prevented, tillage operations </seg>
         <seg id="p151">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association performed on the contour, no row crops used in the rotation, and di - version terraces constructed where practical. Class V land includes areas that are severely eroded, or not suited to cultivation due to erodibility, stoniness, or severe gullying. Bottom - lands that are subject to frequent flooding or cut up by stream chan - nels are also in this class. Land in this group is incapable of returning the cost of producing a cultivated crop over a period of time. If not already in permanent vegetation, it is recommended that this land be Fig. 2.—Bromegrass and alfalfa is making good use of this class of land in eastern Nebraska. retired to grasses and legumes, tree 3, or used as wildlife areas. Special conservation practices recommended and used where applicable in - clude pasture ridging, contour furrowing or grooving, woodlot plant - ings, gully control by fencing, with grasses, the construction of dams, and in many cases fencing for wildlife. Organization of the Farm Cropping and Livestock System Of great importance in thi3 new attack on the erosion problem is the organization or frequently the reorganization of the farming en - terprises to balance the numbers of and kinds of livestock necessary to give the greatest net return from crops produced with proper use of the land. The farmer who cooperates with the district plans to adjust his livestock business to the crops he expects to have in the near future. With his eroded land seeded to grass, in most cases the farmer will be able to feed and sell more roughage consuming livestock. Thus his </seg>
         <seg id="p152">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture farm should make him a profit without mining the soil, and he will be making such use of this great natural resource that will maintain a permanent agriculture. In this respect the Pasture-Forage-Livestock program of the Ag - ricultural College Extension Service is one of proper land use wherein the building up of a reserve feed supply is encouraged to enable farm - ers to raise more livestock to consume roughase from severely eroded or erodible land that they are seeding to perennial grasses and legumes. What (lie Fanner Docs The landowner who wishes to cooperate with his soil conservation district in carrying out a soil and moisture conservation program makes an application to one of the supervisors who may be one of his neighbors.

At one of these educational meet - ings this landowner will bring the land use capability map of his farm and plan to start the application of some of the conservation practices. One of the first things he may do will probably be the grassing of na - tural draws and drainage ways on his cultivated land. He may also de- </seg>

If his land has considerable slope he will no doubt want to contour and will plan with the supervisors, agronomist, engineer, or conservationist of the district to reorganize his field layout in the future to facilitate contour farming and eliminate many short rows. Probably some of the field fences that are up and down hill from north to south or east or west may be taken out and the field boundaries rearranged on the con. tour. If it is a rented farm the tenant is consulted on all phases of the plan. When this farmer and his tenant have decided what they would like to do in saving the soil, the district technician may write up their plan and a map may be made showing how the fields will look when rearranged on the contour. The farmer might proceed to seed down the drainage ways, or otherwise make proper use of the land that has an erosion problem before the plan for his farm is completed. Progress in Soil Conservation District Organization Thirty-six states have passed laws enabling farmers to get assis - tance from the United States Department of Agriculture in putting complete erosion control programs into practice on their farms. The most recent report shows 214 districts have been organized in the U - nited States, ten of which are in eastern Nebraska. Farmers in Nebras - ka's soil conservation districts receive technical assistance from the conservationist, agronomist, or engineer in making necessary surveys for contouring, terracing, etc., and planning the complete conserva - tion program for their farms. These technically trained men are as - signed to the districts and are paid by the Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. Under the Nebraska law, no taxes, levies, or assessments can be made against any land in the district for any cost in carrying out the program. SOME OBSERVATIONS ON BROMEGRASS IN THE 1030 PASTURE-FORAGE-MVESTOCK PROGRAM Discussion led by Elvin F. Frolik, Agri. College The Nebraska Pasture-Forage-Livestock program is an education - al project. It has as its primary aim the production of: ample high quality pasture and forage, and its efficient utilization by livestock. The eight cardinal points of the program are: j 1. Produce high-quality roughage '¦'. ' 2. Restore pastures 3.. Return eroded land to grass &#132; 4. Increase acreage of soil-building crops </seg>
         <seg id="p154">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 5. Maintain proper livestock-forage balance 6. Utilize forage crops profitably 7. Build up feed reserves 8. Encourage livestock on tenant farms The program is sponsored by the Nebraska College of Agriculture Extension Service, the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, and the Nebraska Livestock Breeders' As - sociation. In addition, numerous civic organizations over the state this year cooperated in sponsoring county and district meetings in connection with the program. In a broader sense, many other agencies and organizations interested in Nebraska agriculture support the pro - ject. Over 1.600 farmers and ranchers enrolled in the 1939 Pasture- Forage-Livestock Program. These cooperators planned their year's feed program in the spring of the year, kept accurate records, and turned in final reports on their Pasture-Forage-Livestock management practices this fall. These records have been assembled here at the state office and will be summarized. Brome is a profitable crop from the standpoints of pasture, seed production, and soil improvement. It would be impossible to discuss in the short time allotted to this part of the program all of the subject matter included in the Pasture- Forage-Livestock Program. Hence, it will be confined only to one top - ic, viz., bromegrass. We have here today three farmers who coop.crated in the 1939 program and who have been successful in growing brome - grass. They are C. U. Cook, Arlington (Washington county); Merlyn </seg>
         <seg id="p155">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association C. Osborne, Talmage (Nemaha county); and Wes Frey, Beatrice (Gage county). We will now proceed to discuss with them their ex - periences with bromegrass. Mr. Cook, which is the best time of year to seed bromegrass, spring or fall? . COOK: I like fall seeding best for bromegrass. FROLIK: Have you started any in the spring? COOK: I have started a little but not so successfully as I have in the fall. FROLIK: How about you, Mr. Osborne? OSBORNE: We seeded in the fa 11..., We haven't been successful with spring seedings. FROLIK: Mr. Osborne, you have approximately 40 acres ol brome - grass and alfalfa. During what years did !you make these seedings? OSBORNE: All of this was established with fall seedings in 1937 and 1938. ; FROLIK: Just when in the fall did you make the plantings? OSBORNE: Around the first of September. FROLIK: Mr. Fry, I think you spent quite a little money for bromegrass and alfalfa seed in atempting to get stands. You now have 35 acres established. How much did you spend for seed in getting this acreage? FRY: We spent around $465.00 for seed before we got a stand. These unsuccessful attempts were made with spring seedings in 1935, 1936, and 1937. We secured stands each time but lost them during the hot summer months. Since then we plant only in the fall of the year and at present all fall seedings are in satisfactory condition. Our ex - perience was expensive but it helped to determine the proper time of year to plant bromegrass. FROLIK: That is a lot of money for seed. I'm sure most folks would have given up trying to establish bromegrass long before you did. What time in the fall would you recommend seeding? FRY: From August 15 to September 10. FROLIK: We are pretty well agreed on the optimum planting date. The three farmers here have all been most successful with fall seedings. Another problem is that of buying seed at the prices it has been selling for during the past few years. Mr. Cook, I was interested in your start in bromegrass. Will you tell us about it? </seg>
         <seg id="p156">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture COOK: In the fall of 1935 I didn't have any money and no seed either, ao I went up along the highway and stripped the seed by hand. I stripped a total of 120 pounds of seed. I sowed it that fall and secur - ed a very good stand. FROLIK: Have you bought any bromegrass seed since that time? COOK: This original planting gave us our start in bromegrass and since then we have secured seed from stands on the farm. FROLIK: Let's get over to seedbed preparation. Mr. Osborne, what do you consider a proper kind of seedbed? How do you prepare it —following what crop, and so on? OSBORNE: We sow bromegrass in the fall following a small grain crop. We have both plowed and double disked. Either method seems to be satisfactory provided there is plenty of harrowing done before the seed is sown. FROLIK: If you plow, what do you consider ample harrowing? OSBORNE: That depends on the state of the ground after it is plowed. For example, the depth of plowing makes a difference. The Important thing is to get a firm seedbed. We consider a good alfalfa seedbed suitable for bromegrass. FROLIK: Mr. Fry, you place a great deal of emphasis on seedbed preparation. Tell us how you prepare what you consider a satisfactory seedbed. FRY: I usually plow the ground very shallow and as early as pos - sible. I then double disk and harrow until it is what one might call a "perfect" seedbed. Then the ground is rolled, the seed drilled, and the ground rolled again afterwards. FROLIK: We saw bromegrass on your farm this summer from which you harvested a good seed crop less than a year after planting. How many times did you harrow for that particular planting? FRY: I would hesitate to say, probably twelve or fifteen times. FROLIK: That is a lot of harrowing. FRY: I think it pays. My idea is to harrow until I think the seed - bed is perfect and then harrow that many more times. FROLIK: Some farmers encounter difficulty in getting the seed through the drill or through the seeder. Do you have much trouble that way? </seg>
         <seg id="p157">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association PRY: I have never had any trouble seeding bromegrass with a drill, although it is necessary to have an agitator in the drill. We have used seed as it came from the combine, i.e., without recleaning it. FROLIK: What was that you were telling me about not putting bromegrass seed in the drill box before getting to the field? PRY: Leave your drill empty until you get to the field, then fill your box not over a third full. In that way it doesn't pack in the box. The agitator keeps the seed loose so that it feeds satisfactorily. Other - wise, the seed may "bridge over". ' OSBORNE: This year we used a drill with an agitator. In former years we used an endgate seeder. In either case we have always had to keep someone moving the seed with a stick to see that it didn't "bridge over". As a result there are no vacant places in the field. The alfalfa seed is put in a separate box with either the drill or endgate seeder. The two should not be mixed in the same box for planting. PROLIX: How do you plant bromegrass, Mr. Cook? COOK: I have an endgate seeder. A man keeps the seed stirred up so that it won't "bridge over". I generally mix a little barley or oats with the bromegrass seed. That helps to push the bromegrass seed through. Then too, the barley acts as a cover to catch the snow. I pre - fer a spring small grain crop to fall wheat or rye. The spring small grain winterkills. Winter varieties offer too much competition to the bromegrass during the: following spring. PROLIX: How much barley do you sow with your bromegrass? COOK: About one-half bushel per acre. FROLIK: Do you use a nurse crop, Mr. Osborne? OSBORNE: Yes, sometimes we use oats and barley with our seed - ings; Usually, however, enough volunteer small grain will come up to protect the small grass during the winter. PROLIX: What rate of seeding do you use, Mr. Pry? : FRY: We have been using from ten to fourteen pounds of brome - grass seed per acre. In some plantings we have used four pounds of al - falfa and four of sweet clover seed per acre with the bromegrass. \ OSBORNE: We plant ten or twelve pounds of bromegrass seed and four or five pounds of alfalfa seed per acre. PROLIX: Mr. Cook, you have used a surprisingly small amount of seed for your plantings. What is your rate of planting? COOK: In the first planting I used 120 pounds of seed on 20 acres, </seg>
         <seg id="p158">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture or 6 pounds per acre. I also used 4 pounds of alfalfa seed and 4 pounds of sweet clover with the bromegrass and I had a very good stand of each. I planted in a covering of sudan grass. I left the sudan grass on top and merely disked lightly, harrowed, sowed the seed, and harrow - ed again. The sudan grass provided a cover of straw over the ground and held the moisture. FROLIK: Was the sudan grass planted the year that you did the fall seeding? COOK: It was planted during the previous year. It laid upon the ground all winter and the following summer I sowed about the middle of July. There were no weeds. FROLIK: We strongly recommend rolling the ground in order to get a good seedbed. I wonder how many of you use a roller or culti - packer. Mr. Cook, what do you do? COOK: I have never used a roller, but I believe the use of this implement would be very helpful in getting a good seedbed. FROLIK: What about you, Mr. Osborne, do you use a roller? OSBORNE: We always use a roller when sowing alfalfa and bromegrass. We roll the ground after the seed is planted. In just one instance did we fail to use a roller; that was because it rained immed - iately after sowing and before we were able to do the rolling. Other fields were rolled twice after sowing, once north and south, and once east and west. Stands became established more rapidly on the fields which were rolled. FROLIK: I would as3ume that you do not consider rolling before planting necessary. OSBORNE: We pack our ground by harrowing before planting. Then we roll twice after planting and rolling four times would be even better. FRY: I would say it depends on the condition of the ground as to whether or not it is necessary to roll before seeding. Rolling after seeding is more important than before, that is, to pack the soil firmly around the seed. However, I have seeded different small seeds, (alfal - fa and bromegrass) where I thought it was necessary to roll before planting. FROLIK: How deep do you drill the bromegrass seed? FRY: Not over a half inch deep. FROLIK: And you, Mr. Osborne? </seg>
         <seg id="p159">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association OSBORNE: We broadcast the seed and cover it by rolling. That seems to get the seed amply covered. FROLIK: Do you attempt to take care of the bromegrass plant - ings more carefully the first year than you do later on? In other words, do you keep the stock off? COOK: I am very careful not to over-pasture the first year. I pas - ture some the first year but I let the grass get a good start before pas - turing. : PROLIX: When, in your opinion, can stock be turned on without injuring the stand? COOK: I would say June Ist. PROLIX: How about you, Mr. Osborne? You have thirty acres of bromegrass seeded last fall. When did you start grazing that particu - lar field? OSBORNE: There were brood sows running on part of it all win - ter. We turned the first cattle on it the fore part of April and from then on to the first of May we were adding to the number of cattle in there. "'¦¦_.- .' '. :•. '.-¦¦¦: ¦ -.-. - ' ; ,¦ ¦ \ PROLIX: Then you don't believe in taking any precautions to care for a new seeding? OSBORNE: I believe it is a good idea to keep the stock off as long as you can, but we needed the feed; there it was, and we took advan - tage of it. . . : PRY: My policy is to let the bromegrass go to seed the first year, and graze it after about the first of July. FROLIK: What was the yield of seed on the bromegrass you planted last fall? FRY: The yield on that field was 400 pounds of seed per acre. FROLIK: That's a goodyield, particularly in view of the fact that 1939 was considered an unfavorable one for bromegrass in Nebraska. FRY: It is the most profitable crop I had last year. PROLIX: We have discussed returns from bromegrass seed pro - duction. Last summer Director W. H. Brokaw took colored moving pictures of some of these fields we have mentioned. You may have an opportunity to see these pictures. They are part of the Pasture-Forage- Livestock film now being shown at various points over the state. Mr. Osborne, you submitted a good record in connection with the Pasture- Forage-Livestock program. You have some interesting figures on carrying capacity of pastures. In calculating carrying capacities, you </seg>
         <seg id="p160">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture deducted for supplementary feed given the stock. For example, If a cow was getting some hay while on pasture, proper deductions were made. OSBORNE: The carrying capacity was calculated on the basis ol mature cattle or horses which I believe is easier for all of us to under - stand. On this basis, the bromegrass carried two head of cattle on three acres for five and a half months. That was the per acre carrying ca - pacity. FROLIK: Your bromegrass and alfalfa certainly produced a great deal of feed. How did that compare with temporary pasture? In two year 3' tests here at the Agricultural College (1932-33) a combination of rye, sweet clover, and sudan grass provided more feed per acre than good permanent pasture. OSBORNE: We have had that experience too in earlier years. But in 1939, sudan grass, which i 3 our main pasture crop during the sum - mer in a temporary pasture program, produced very little feed. One acre of sudan provided approximately one week's pasture per cow. Wheat and rye pasture furnished only a little more feed than the Su - dan grass. FROLIK: What reason can you give for your sudan grass doing so poorly? OSBORNE: We had plenty of chinch bugs. They like sudan grass and there wasn't much left for the cattle after they got through with it. FROLIK: Much is said these day 3 about the use of bromegrass in soil and moisture conservation. What do you think of bromegrass for this purpose? COOK: I think it is a wonderful grass for conservation. It roots well and keeps the soil from eroding in the gullies. I have had three gullies across my place. In 1934, I terraced the field, filled the gullies, and seeded them to bromegrass. I have had no trouble with washing in that field since then. Last year, we had two four-inch rains. A lot of water ran down the gullies but because of the bromegrass no washing took place. My hillside land is going into bromegrass and alfalfa pas - ture just as rapidly as stands can be established. FROLIK: Mr. Fry, are you going to make any use of bromegrass for conservation purposes? FRY: Yes, I think bromegrass i 3 the best grass we have today for soil conservation. I have had bromegrass in the bottom of a gully where flood-water left it buried four or five inches under dirt or trash. Afterwards the grass would come on through. </seg>
         <seg id="p161">¦.¦¦•;¦ Nebraska Crop Growers' Association FROLIK: In your locality in Gage county there are many farms cut up with small draws. Are you going to plant bromegrass in such draws to control erosion? PRY: That is my plan at the present time. I will seed both bot - toms and sides of such draws to bromegrass. FROLIK: A short summary of this discussion on bromegrass may be helpful. These men have been most successful with plantings made in the fall rather than in the spring. They emphasize the importance of good seedbed preparation. Two of the three use rollers or culti-pack - ers. Mr. Cook, who doesn't use a roller gets a good seedbed by disking and trying to keep some trash on top of the ground. In broadcasting seed, the men use an endgate seeder, and have a man using a stick to keep the seed from ''bridging over". Mr. Fry uses a drill with an agi - tator. He has no difficulty getting seed through the drill providing there is not too much in the box at one time. Rate of seeding varies from six up to. fourteen pounds per acre. At the six pound rate there were other crops planted with the bromegrass. Yet this is a remarkably low rate of seed. One man uses a nurse crop.. In care after seeding, the men seem to agree that It is better to pasture lightly the first year, al - though Mr. Osborne secured a lot of pasture the first year after plant, ing. Mr. Osborne said that according to hi 3 figures one could carry two head of stock, two cows or three horses, for a period of five and a half months on three acres of brbmegrass and alfalfa. From the standpoint of seed production, Mr. Fry reported getting 400 pounds per acre on plantings made the previous year. Bromegrass is a good soil conserva - tion crop and will be used by all of these men to seed down gullies and rough land. PRACTICAL MAXAGEMBNT OF THE IRRIGATED FARM James G. Kunz, Wood River, Nebraska. : We irrigate from wells,- and my experience has been mostly with corn. We have irrigated some alfalfa and this year some, sorghums. Our farms are stocked and we raise nothing but feed crops. I cannot talk irrigation in an abstract way entirely. You will pardon me if I mention some of our own experiences and try to draw a lesson from them. For twelve years I have urged the more intensive use of wells. We thought we were using them a lot when we ran them night and day from Juiy Ist, to September. That was a lot compared with the way many wells were used. Now that seems like a feeble effort. As I look back over these years, I feel that I should apologize for my mistakes rather than mention my accomplishments. It is true that these wells have paid handsome,- —almost fantastic,—profit. But I am sure they could have been used to much greater advantage. They should have been run four or five months instead of two. </seg>
         <seg id="p162">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The Secret of Successful Pump Irrigation Few, I fear, have any adequate conception of the tremendous amount of water necessary for maximum crop production. If I can bring to the beginning Jrrlgators and to those whose results have not been entirely satisfactory, some realization of the magnitude of these moisture requirements I shall be satisfied. Some very good advice has been given in recent months to those contemplating the installation of rrigation. They have been told that to be successful irrigation must be an every year enterprise. In that short statement is embodied the whole secret of successful irrigation for it presupposes the intensive use of the system. It presup - poses that in no year is rainfall in Nebraska sufficient for maximum production. It visions a large increase in production in good years as well as bad. This we know can be done but to do it we must build up and main - tain a high state of soil fertility and a high degree of subsoil moisture. So long as we look upon irrigation as an emergency proposition as something to fall back on, as a last resort to prevent total disaster, we will not make much of a success with irrigation. The idea of usfng a well only a few weeks or month or two in the summer is all wrong and cannot bring maximum results. The soil is the greatest of all reservoirs. Moisture stored deep in the soil in the fall months will be there when needed the following summer. c This long and severe drouth has brought great loss and disap - pointment. But along with this loss and disappointment has come some small benefits. The observing farmer has learned that without the nor - mal fall rains that percolate deep into the soil, he cannot expect a crop the next year. If we enter the growing season with a dry subsoil crop failure is almost certain. We had normal spring and summer rains in '37 and crops looked very promising. But that promise faded in August. There was no sub - soil moisture. Pumping Costs The cost of pumping in the Platte valley is not great, and the fall months furnish an ideal time for building up this subsoil reserve The ditch irrigators have been doing this with fine results. Some pump ir - rigators do, but not many. We are just beginning to appreciate the value of this practice. By running the pumps during the fall months, and again in the </seg>
         <seg id="p163">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association spring, yields can be greatly increased and a much larger acreage handled by each well. It does not cost much to install an irrigation well and pump in our section of the Platte valley, about $700.00, and the cost of pump - ing i 3 not great. This year with corn 50 cents per bushel our cost of pumping was 12% of the value of the increased yield. For every dollar spent we got eight dollars back. C *"¦* fc j tji '*^ y *" * * * j. XJ # * .? pif j A good pump installation on the Haskins farm 5 miles south-east of Republican City, Nebraska. This set-up permits irrigation on two different levels. With six wells we raised eleven thousand bushels of corn, 8000 bushels of grain sorghum, 1200 tons of silage, alfalfa pasture for 500 hogs and some alfalfa hay. The co3t of pumping including fuel, oil and motor repairs was $1400.00. There was little fall rain and less than 12 inches since Janu - ary Ist. Without irrigation crops were a total failure. This leaves a net income of just 250% on the investment in wells above the cost of operation. We would have done better except for grasshoppers. They were terrible in places. We scattered thirty tons of poison with fine results. We killed .90 % of them—we had them lying in drifts. Still they damaged some fields nearly 50%. I have a friend who reports an average yield of 70 bushels of corn per acre and I hear reports of even larger yields. Sixty acres at 70 bu - shels is 4200 bushels and at fifty cents is $2100. Deduct $200 pumping cost and we have $1900. That is nearly 350% of the cost of his well and pump which was only $550 and one good well can handle more than sixty acres. </seg>
         <seg id="p164">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Strange as it seems, where one is making this showing there are several in the same locality that are not making six percent and some are not used at all and there are still men who maintain that it costs more to pump the water than the increase in yield is worth and it probably does the way they handle it. Others, with these demonstra- Spring and fall irrigation permits the use of the pump over a longer period thus enabling the irrigator to adequately water more acres per pump tions light under their nose, still argue that the tassel will burn in dry years no matter how much water the roots have. That has not been our experience. But they are gradually learning and each year we have more and better irrigators. Experimental Results I have had a great deal of help from an experiment at the North Platte station in 1927. I think every irrigator should have a copy of this report and not only read it but make a study of it. It throws a great deal of light on the great amount of water needed to produce a maximum yield of corn. It also shows how great the yields may be if the fertility of the soil is kept up and plenty of water used. 192 6 was very dry as many of you will remember. But the fall was wet. We had a lot of rain in August and this land was given six inches of irrigation water so the top six feet of soil had 12 inches of water. It still had practically the same amount when spring came. That is a lot of water. It would take a lot of pumping to put that much in the sub- </seg>
         <seg id="p165">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association ' soil on 160 acres. So you see they started the crop year with a nice lot of moisture and in addition 1927 was a year of greater than normal rainfall. . • The land was plowed and surface planted to corn but watered in several different ways. Some was not watered at all except the fall ir - rigation. This made 72 bushels. Most of us would jthink this good enough. Pew would ihink they could make any money watering corn that would make 72 bushels without irrigation. j ;¦...¦¦. ¦¦ ' . ¦ l The records tell a surprising story. With two summer irrigations in addition to the fall irrigation and the wet season the yield rose to 94 bushels, an increase of 22 bushels per acre. Well, now we feel sure that is the limit. We are positive no profit could be made watering corn that would yield 94 bushels. But we are mistaken again. A third watering brought the yield to 10214 bushels, an increase of 8% bushels.

There was an increase of thirty bu - . shels from the summer waterings alone. At 50 cent 3 this is $15.00 per acre. How much the fall watering made we do not know, but it must have been considerable. With us that last 8% bushels increase would have paid for all four waterings. And remember there would have been no 72 bushel yield without the fall irrigation. </seg>
         <seg id="p166">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I said earlier that irrigation could be made to pay in good years and these figures bear out that statement. It can be done with high fer - tility and plenty of water. Corn roots go many feet deep if the soil is wet. If the fall rains do not percolate that deep, and they seldom do, then we should add irrigation water until this whole root area is wet. We need to build up a good reserve and should try to keep as big a reserve as possible. Successful Methods We plow and surface plant because we get better yields that way. We put the dirt to the corn as fast as it will take it and as soon as we start to hill we like to start the pumps and when they are started they run night and day the balance of the season. I think it is a mistake to depend upon tractors for power. It de - lays the start. We have used old Buick motors for twelve years and with entire satisfaction. We use the lath system now. It is a great labor saver and permits night operation. With them we can do a better job. We run each set from 12 to 24 hours. We aim to get the water deep into the soil at each application. Leps is lost from surface evaporation. We get a land set early enough so it can be adjusted before dark. Then we go to bed and let it run. With six wells running nights all summer I am suve there wasn't a dollar's worth of water ever got out of the field. V/e all quit irrigating too early in the fall. When the corn is all dented and beginning to glaze we figure the corn made and stop the pump. That is a mistake. That is the time to prepare for the next year's crop. The ditches are made and the boxes set. It isn't much work to give it a couple more waterings and fill the subsoil. Water put into the subsoil will all be there ready to do its stuff the following summer. No stingy man ever made a great success as a pump irrigator. You have to be willing to bet a dollar or two per acre that Nebraska will furnish us a dry spell before the summer is over. That bet looks like a cinch, but few seem willing to put up the money. Too many wait until the corn is all but burned up before they start. Then they run the wat - er through as fast as they can and then wait till it starts to burn again and they think that they are irrigating. They seem to think that one look at the water should be enough for the corn. If you are a land owner and you are going to expect the renter to furnish all the cost of pumping then do not put in a well because it will not pay. He won't do it and I don't blame him. For corn it is important to get the pumps started as early as pos - sible. I prefer not to raise small grain on these irrigated farm 3. But if </seg>
         <seg id="p167">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association you must raise some small grain, then by all means hire some one to harvest it and keep the pumps going. . Livestock Essential to Success I believe that every irrigated farm should be a stock farm. I have seen no outstanding success that was not connected with some form of livestock production. We have come to think a great deal of the grain sorghums, especially day milo. We plan to plant only so much corn as we can keep thoroughly wet and the balance to day milo. We learned a valuable lesson this year. We found that on land given one good soaking before planting our day milo made more than forty bushels with no further watering and this was the dryest year in the history of our section. Then one well should handle 160 acres in good shape if kept going through September and October and again in the spring. With day milo instead of small grain the whole farm is set for irrigating..There is nothing to interrupt the pumping and the well can run steadily from July Ist to November. , Every stock farm should raise some alfalfa. I have reached the conclusion that no alfalfa should be seeded on any irrigated farm with - out the land first being prepared for irrigation. Alfalfa is the easiest of all crops to irrigate. It seems that the border system is by far the most popular method. If we water the land we should have little difficulty in getting a stand. ¦". ¦•'; Success and Failure Side by Side I put in my first well in the spring of 1927. We watered SO acres of corn on alfalfa sod. The result was marvelous. The Extension Ser - vice sent out a questionnaire asking the irrigators how much Increase in yield they got from irrigation. I think the average increase report - ed was about eight bushels. I reported sixty. I was quite embarrassed for a time. I wondered if I would be considered crazy or just a common liar: But I lost that embarrassment when I saw how they were doing it. I became very enthusiastic. I could not keep still. I told all of my friends of the results and advised them to put in wells. There is where I made my mistake. Half of those wells have stood idle most of the years since. I know several successful men who have accumulated a string of good farms. They have wells but they are seldom used. They expect the renter to furnish all the cost of pumping and applying the water and he will not, and cannot do it and give 2-5 of the crop. With all the possibilities that, are there these owners say their farms are liabilities-—lemons, etc. And they are to them. They have not paid the taxes for several years. </seg>
         <seg id="p168">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture So I am slow to advise any one to install Irrigation. Pew make them really pay. If you are thinking of putting in a well to tide you over dry spells, don't put it in. If you plan to get through the summer with as little pumping expense as possible, lay off the well. It will never pay. If you plan to use the well as many days in the year as pos - sible; if you plan to run water any time the soil will take it and will not flinch at some expense, then there is a chance you may make a success. And again you must know how to farm. It never yet paid to water weeds. If you rent your land out, better furnish a liberal share of the cost and you will get better results. We like to keep our farms stocked. It is difficult to find good men who can finance their share of stock and equipment. So we sometimes furnish all stock and equipment and give the renter one-third of the njt income for doing the work. I did that this year and I furnished all the cost of pumping. We kept the well going night and day and when he couldn't use it in the corn or grain or sorghum, he turned it in the. alfalfa. He raised 3000 bushels of corn, 1000 bushels of grain sorghum and enough alfalfa to nearly pay the cost of the water. Besides he raised one hundred spring pigs that we sold at $7.75. So he will get a check next spring for more than one thousand dollars and the farm will pay me more than ten dollars per acre net. Careful Land Preparation is Essential If you can survey your land yourself all well and good. If not, it will pay you to hire it surveyed and get your farm laid out right. Do not think the rows must run east and west or north and south. Run them any or all directions. Run them any way that will make watering easy, just enough fall to make the water flow. If it runs fast, it will not soak in and you will erode your land. When we started thirteen years ago we had a lot of trouble with our ditches breaking out. We did not make them wide enough. Now we make them wide; with capacity to handle twice the water we ex - pect to carry. And it is not necessary to buy an expensive ditcher. I think a two by ten eighteen feet long makes a good ditcher. I like them better than the iron ones. They are not hard to throw around and just as efficient. We make a round with a two bottom plow, leaving a foot in the center. Then we make one round with this cheap ditcher and our ditch is finished. Leave the center there, it does no harm. This makes a ditch that will hold any well in the Platte valley and makes it in short order. If you want a little better ditch, make one round with the plow real shallow to clean the surface. Then plow one round deep, leaving one foot center, and one round with the ditcher. You can't beat that ditch. My county agent asked me what it cost per acre of land irrigat- </seg>
         <seg id="p169">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association cd. I told him about three and one-half dollars in dry years. He asked how much I charged for depreciation. These wells owe me nothing. They have paid lor themselves twenty times. "Why should I charge de - preciation? I realize that lam talking for the best interest of the public. I also realize that I may be talking against my own interest; because the more wells put in and the more intensively these wells are used the more the danger of exhausting the water supply. But sooner or lat - er these wells will be put in and some day they will be operated by men that will make a better use of them. And while the water lasts I expect to keep a good reserve in my subsoil and by so doing, I hope to maintain a little reserve in the bank. FARM MANURE AND BALANCED CROPPING PROGRAMS Lionel Harris, Asst. Agronomist, Scottsbluff Field Station Farm manure, at the Scottsbluff Field Station has been found to be an important contributing factor in maintaining the yields of irri - gated crops at profitable levels. The high production; costs associated with irrigation farming, make it essentialto produce high yields of crops annually. In the removal of large quantities of plant food ma - terials from the soil in the form of high crop yields, consideration must be given to methods by which the productivity of the soil can be main - tained. In irrigation farming it has been found important to utilize part of the farm for the production of livestock feeds which can be utilized in the feeding of animals, and. for the production of manure that can be returned to the soil. Feeding livestock, the production of livestock feeds, and the production of cash crops are considered im - portant essentials in a well balanced irrigation farming program. The Value of Manure The value of farm manure has been studied in various crop rota - tions at the Scottsbluff Field Station since 1911. The Scottsbluff Field Station is located in western Neb., on the north bench land in the North Platte valley, at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet. The soil has been classified as Trip very fine sandy loam. The annual precipitation is approximately fourteen inches. The soil on the station, was broken from the native sod in 1910. The rotation experiments were started in 1912. •'-¦; ''¦ ;/....-¦ ¦¦-.; ..:¦-¦ '• :; '.-.. ..'• Included in these rotations are three types of manured rotations, represented by three 2-year rotations, one 3-year rotation and one 6 - year rotation. The five manured rotations are numbered as follows: 21, 31, 23, 25, and 61; Rotation 21 Is a 2-year rotation of sugar beets and potatoes with manure applied to the potato crop annually at the </seg>

Rotation 23 is a 2-year rotation of sugar beets and oats with an annual application of manure applied to the sugar beet crop. Rotation 25 is a 2-year rotation of oats and potatoes with ¦'W'ji | L' 1 ,' | .(^ l]^] ) y^ivjjjW M^^B View of rotation Plots at the Scottsbluff Field Station. manure applied to the potato crop. Rotation 31 is a 3-year rotation of potatoes, oat 3, and sugar beets with manure applied to the sugar beet crop. Rotation 61 is a 6-year rotation of alfalfa (3 years), potatoes, oats, and sugar beets with mauure applied to the sugar beet crop. At the Scottsbluff Field Station there are five unmanured rotations cor - responding to the manured rotations. By comparing the yields of crops. in the manured rotations as compared with yfelds in the unmanured rotations, it is possible to obtain some measure of the value of farm manure. In the manured rotations the yield of sugar beets during the 26 - -yeav period 1912-38 has been 17.8 tons per acre, as compared with 11.2 tons in the unmanured rotations. The yield of potatoes in the ma - nured rotations has been 261.2 bu3hels as compared with 192.2 bushels in the unmanured rotations. The yield of oats in the manured rotations has been 14 bushels higher than in the unmanured rotations. From these increased crop yields the mean value of farm manure has been calculated to be ?3.72 per ton. Balancing The Irrigated Cropping Program The increased yields obtained from the use of farm manure, should induce farmers to g/ve consideration to the production and con - servation of manure on their farms. It is apparent that the production of manure should be considered as important as the production of cash crops. Livestock feed is essential in the production of farm manure, consequently in planning a cropping program for an irrigated farm, it is important to give consideration to the production of sufficient live- </seg>
         <seg id="p171">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association stock feed for converting into an adequate quantity of manure for the operation of the program. By determining the amount of manure ordi - narily produced by feeding a ton of livestock feed, the amount of live - stock feed produced in various manured rotations, and the amount ot manure necessary to operate these rotations, it is: possible to ascertain the type of rotation which answers the description of a balanced irri - gated cropping program. Manure Available From A Ton Of Livestock Feed The amount of recoverable manure which may be obtained from various animals varies to a large degree. Factors affecting the amount of recoverable manure include the kind and amount of ration fed, the kind and amount of bedding used, the nature of the floor on which the manure accumulates, and the economic function of the animal. However, from data available regarding manure recovered from a given number of animals, and the food consumed by the animals dur - ing the manure recovery period, it is possible to arrive at approximate figures indicating the manure recoverable from a given quantity of feed consumed by animals. Data regarding the amounts of manure re - covered during a given feeding period are available from experiments conducted at the Ohio Agric. Experiment Station, and also the Cornell Agric. Experiment Station. ; At New York the manure from 71 cows was collected for a period ofone day. The dairy cows consumed 2.43 tona of feed, and produced 3.27 tons of manure, or a ratio of one ton of feed to 1.34 tons of ma - nure. At Ohio, 48 steers feed for a period of 13 months, consumed 223.3 tons of feed and produced 349.8 tons of manure or a ratio of one ton of feed to 1.57 tons of manure. At Ohio 160 feeder lambs were fed for a period of 112 days. During this time the lambs consumed 24.4 tons of feed, and produced 24.9 tons of manure or a ratio of one ton of feed to 1.02 tons of manure. The ratio obtained in a test with hogs at New York was one ton of feed to 1.45 tons of manure. The mean ratio from these experiments indicates that 1.40 tons of manure was obtain - ed from each ton of livestock feed consumed by animals. The manure was composed of approximately 12 percent bedding, and ranged in moisture content from 63.1 percent in the sheep manure to 78.8 per - cent in the cattle manure. The moisture percents are probably some - what higher than the moisture content of manure produced in the wes - tern regions where rainfall is much lower. Livestock Feed Produced In Various Rotations On An 80-Acre Basis This study includes the five manured rotations at the Scottsbluff Field Station. The livestock feeds available in these rotations include beet tops, oats, and alfalfa. </seg>
         <seg id="p172">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture On an 80-acre basis each crop in a 2-year rotation occupies forty acres of ground, in a 3-year rotation, 26.2-3 acres, and in a G-year ro - tation, each crop occupies 13.1-3 acres annually. The total livestock feed produced in the various rotations on an 80-acre basis amounts to 92 tons for rotation 21, 138 tons for rotation 23, 37 tons for rotation 25. 92 tons for rotation 31, and 199 tons for rotation 61. Possible Manure Production From The Feeds Grown In The Manured Rotations Using the livestock feed-manure ratio of one ton of leed to 1.40 tons of manure, the following amounts of manure may be produced by the feed in the following rotations: Rotation 21, 129 tons of manure; rotation 23, 193 tons; rotation 25, 52 tons; rotation 31, 129 tons; and rotation 61, 279 tons. In the 2-year rotations 480 tons of manure are required annually for their operation; 320 tons are required in the 3 - year rotations; and 160 tons are required in the 6-year rotations. In the 2-year and 3-year rotations the livestock feed produced is not suf - ficient to cover the amount required to produce the necessary manure. The shortage ranges from 287 tons in rotation 23 to 428 tons in rota - lion 25. In the 6-year rotation, where alfalfa is grown, sufficient live - stock feed is produced, permitting the production of a surplus of 119 tons of manure above the amount required for the operation of tie rotation. I The data reported in this paper are important chiefly for aiding fanners in planning balanced, self supporting, manured cropping pro - grams for their farms. The adequately planned program includes suf - ficient livestock feed for the production of an adequate quantity of ma - nure for maintaining productivity of soils from which high yields of crops must be produced annually. j PRODUCING HOME GROAVN PROTEINS I). L. Gross, Agri. College One of the most serious consequences of the prolonged drouth in Nebraska has been the great reduction in alfalfa acreage. In 1930' there were approximately 1,200,000 acres of alfalfa in the state. The latest figure as provided by the division of crop estimates indicates that this acreage is now not far from 700,000, a decline of approxi-; mately 40 percent. Aside from this the production per acre ha 3 been greatly reduced as a result of subsoil moisture depletion. Many of our old stands have disappeared and new seedings have largely failed as a result of drouth and grasshopper damage. In the past we have depended upon alfalfa as the principal source of protein feed for roughage consuming livestock. The corn-alfalfa </seg>
         <seg id="p173">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association ration has long been the standard one of Nebraska cattle leeders. To - day on many farms livestock is either not receiving a balanced ration or commercial protein supplements are used. These are more costly than alfalfa used on the farm where it is produced. The high cost of transporting alfalfa from the high producing areas in our irrigated or sub-irrigated valleys has made the use of commercial feeds more eco - nomical on many farms. The increased use of low protein roughages, particularly the sorghums, either as silage or fodder, may bring about a still greater U3e of commercial concentrates. Make the Most of Our Alfalfa If, however, we are to look to our farms to produce our protein, it will be neccessary that we give greater consideration to new crops or new methods that will insure our livestock an adequate supply. ¦,^^^m • g|||||jPif»| ¦ Second year sweet clover may be used profitably for silage, thus providing a high protein feed for winter use. There are many attacks that can be made on this'problem. It may be some time before we can expect our subsoils to be replenished with moisture sufficient to promote a good growth of alfalfa. Perhaps if we are to get productive stands at all we will need to establish them on the more favored low lying areas where runoff accumulates. With a limited acreage of alfalfa we can do much to make more efficient use of what we have. Seventy-five percent of the protein in alfalfa is in the leaves yet we lose many of them by our haying methods. First cutting alfalfa is often stemmy, "curing conditions are often not the best, and the result is a low quality low protein product. In addition to this, its stemminess results in much wastage when fed. Considering that the </seg>
         <seg id="p174">174 Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture first cutting often represents one-half or more of the total seasonal yield, many farmers in recent years have given attenion to methods by which they could prevent this loss. Alfalfa Silage One of the first experiments conducted by the Nebraska Experi - ment Station was that of making a good quality of silage from alfalfa. It has been only in recent years that the practical use of the informa - tion gained from these experiments has been made by farmers. East - ern states with less favorable hay curing weather have advanced fur - ther in this practice than has Nebraska. The key to success in the mak - ing of alfalfa silage is the adding of from 2 percent to 4 percent of mo - lasses to the green material as it enters the silo. Without the molasses, putrefaction takes place and much of the protein is decomposed and lost. A less palatable and less valuable feed is thus produced. With molasses, a very palatable feed is produced with little loss in feed con - stituents. Alfalfa should be slightly wilted before ensiling. This re - duces costs and eliminates leakage of juices from the silo accompanied by loss of valuable feed elements. Alfalfa that will make a ton of hay to the acre will make about two and a half tons of silage. One of the more common ways of handling alfalfa In making silage is to allow it to wilt slightly in the swath, -windrow it with, the side delivery rake, and load it with a hay loader. It is then pitched from the rack into the cutter. The molasses is diluted and a small stream is run into the cutt - er. Alfalfa packs tightly in the silo thus permitting a higher tonnage per cubic foot capacity of the silo than with corn or sorghum silage. Sweet Clover Sweet clover when used for hay often destroys the clotting pow - er of the blood in cattle and has resulted in many death losses. This can be avoided by using the green plants for silage. Having the same composition as alfalfa, sweet clover should make silage of equal qual - ity and feed value. It would need to be handled in the same manner as alfalfa. Many heavy stands of second year sweet clover are permitted to mature and if seed is not harvested, they are burned in order to fa - cilitate tillage. This not only represents a distinct loss from the stand - point of soil fertility, but at the same time the crop cut at the proper time and ensiled would in many instances provide from three to five tons of high quality ensilage per acre. Although experimental data are lacking, it would seem that the maximum protein content per acre would be obtained if the crop were harvested at the early bloom stage before many leaves have fallen. Soybeans Much has been said about soybeans in recent years. The acreage of this crop has increased greatly in the past six or eight years until </seg>
         <seg id="p175">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association now it can almost be classed as a major crop in the states immediately to our east. In Nebraska, experience with this crop has not been so favorable. Here at the Experiment Station, over a 30-year period soy - beans have yielded about 15 bushels compared to 35 bushels for corn. At average prices, soybeans have been less profitable than corn or wheat. From the standpoint of cash returns per acre, soybeans have been about equal to oats. The cost of producing the bean 3 has been higher than that of the spring small grains. Considering soybeans as a feed crop rather than a cash crop, they would undoubtedly have a high - er comparable rating. On farms where protein feeds are scarce, a little will go a long way towards increasing the efficiency of other feeds us - ed. Where alfalfa or other protein feeds are not available, soybeans may fill a real need. Soybeans will yield from one tojtwo tons of hay per acre with favorable growing conditions. Soybean hay has approxi - mately the same composition as alfalfa or sweet clover. There is more waste in feeding soybean hay, however, because of the coarseness of the stems. Soybean hay i 3 also much more difficult to cure than alfalfa. It takes a longer curing period and more hand work if the best quality is to be obtained. For this reason, the use of soybeans as silage would seem to be advisable. Experiments have shown soybean silage to be equal to alfalfa silage. They should be handled in the same way. They are ready for harvest as hay or silage when the pods are filled but be - fore the leaves begin to yellow and fall. i Ground soybeans have been shown to be an excellent feed for dairy cows where they can be used to replace other protein feeds. Be - cause of the high oil content of soybeans, however, the quantity fed must be limited. Sc-ybeans should not be fed to fattening hogs since they cause soft pork] The Omaha hog market is favored at the present time by eastern shippers since few soft pork hogs come to this market. Should the number increase, relative prices at the Omaha market as compared to tho3e in the heart of the soybean producing area would undoubtedly be lowered. Small Grain In some parts of the United States small grains are used exten - sively for hay. In recent years this practice has been growing in Ne - braska. Small grain cut at the full bloom to early milk stage is equal to alfalfa from the standpoint of protein content. Wheat cut in the early milk stage and used as silage thi3 year by the Dairy Department went into the silo with a protein content of slightly more than i 6 per - cent. This compares to 13 percent as the average protein content of alfalfa hay. Very leafy alfalfa hay may of course contain from 16 per - cent to 17 percent protein. When small grain growth is heavy and lodging and rust likely, its use as hay or silage, cut at an early stage, would in mo3t instances yield more feed per acre than as grain. At the </seg>
         <seg id="p176">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture same time the percent of protein could be expected to be much higher than where the crop is permitted to mature. The use of molasses with such crops when ensiling is necessary if the best results are to be ob - tained. Sudan The Poultry Department has been conducting some interesting experiments dealing with the use of sudan grass as a feed for poultry. Sudan cut at a height of 30 inches before the crop headed had a pro - tein content of 17 percent when cured in the ordinary way. Artificially dried hay had a protein content of over 20 percent. Ground and fed as meal to poultry it replaced alfalfa meal with excellent results. On farms where other protein feeds, are scarce, the use of sudan can ap - parently be given consideration. Several cuttings of the immature crop could be harvested where soil moisture conditions were favorable. Pastures In any discussion of home grown proteins, we must not lose sight of the importance of good pastures, for these can be made to provide our cheapest source of proteins considering that harvesting is accomplish - ed with little cost other than fencing. The longer we can extend the pasture season, the cheaper can we produce proteins. The use of ter - n pastures provide the cheapest source of protein for livestock porary pastures of fall rye, sudan, and sweet clover provides the most practical means of not only doing this job, but also making it possible to protect our permanent pastures, thus permitting them to give their maximum yield. </seg>
         <seg id="p177">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association WINTER FEEDING HORSES Ross Miller, Agri. College In a recent report from the Secretary of Agriculture this state - ment was made: "Our farmers now pay the city people something like 1 billion, 600 million dollars annually for power and power machinery, whereas before the World War our farmers sold power to the cities in the form of work animals worth several hundred million dollars annu - ally". I think we all realize that that is a drastic change and has called for many adjustments among the farming people of the Middlewest since a large number of horses and mules that were sold to the citiey come 'from the corn belt region. . : While the subject, "Winter Feeding Horses" was assigned to me, this statement from our Secretary has caused me to feel that it would be well to discuss with you for a few moments what these changes have meant to farmers in Nebraska. We all realize that the horse and mule population has suffered a gradual decline in Nebraska as well as the entire nation. In the past five years this reduction has amounted to 205,000 head or 30 percent. Such a change in horse and mule popula - tion is sure to require some changes in: crop production. One would think that with horses seemingly going out of the picture at that rate that there would not be much profit in the continued raising of a few horses or mules; however this is not quite true when we stop and think that even this past fall the weanling mule foals have been selling throughout Nebraska for some $40 to $45 on up to as high as $85 and $90 per head. While it would be impossible to get a complete list of all the mule foals that have been sold in a state this large, I feel lam quite safe in Baying.that the average price for all these foals that have changed hands has been in the neighborhood of $55 to $60. If we would subtract the service fee from this, we still can see that we have around $40 to $45 left, which means that a mule foal raised from a mare, that without doubt has been or at least is capable of doing her fair share of farm work, would bring to the farmer as much as a wean - ling calf. Ido not want you to think from these remarks that I feel that any farmer should consider going into mule production on a large commercial basis but I do feel that the farmer who continues to use horses for at least a part of his farm power and in many cases on small - er farms for his entire source of farm power can, by breeding one, two, or three of his work mares, take in some revenue that otherwise would not be available. I have been talking here about mules. We all know, of course, ; that we must continue to have good mares in order to continue produc - ing some mules, so consequently it is also necessary to continue on many of these farms to breed some of these mares to good stallions in order to keep up our source of horse stock. Right now mules are sell- </seg>
         <seg id="p178">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ing for more than horses. The spread between the horse and mule mar - ket no doubt would prove to be much smaller if our horse supply should begin to decline too rapidly. I also want to point out that it would be a mistake for the farmer to just raise colts. He must raise good ones. There has been and will continue to be an excellent market for the good ones of the right kind. The poor ones just will not sell. Many people say that by reducing the horse numbers on a farm and replacing with power equipment, it has given the farmer more opportunity to make some changes in his livestock program. In other words, this has allowed him to replace some of his horses with cattle, sheep, or hogs. I am wondering whether this i 3 always the case. In a recent questionnaire which I handed to some sixty freshmen, I asked them to give me information relative to the type of power used on their farm and also the amount of livestock of various kinds they carried. Surprising as it might seem in nearly all cases where horses were used as a large part or all of the farm power these farms actually had more livestock than the ones that were using motorized power to a large ex - tent or in its entirety. Economy in Horse Production and Maintainance For the farmers who are continuing to use horses or mules a3 a part or all of their source of farm power, it certainly is necessary for them to try to economize as much as possible so that this power can be made available at a very low cost. Winter feed costs have always come up for a great deal of discussion when we think about horses'as ¦ HI IBK li I I I ; ill Nine yearling colts being wintered on sorghum fodder at College of Agriculture </seg>
         <seg id="p179">¦'. ¦ ' * Nebraska Crop Growers' Association It is through this season of the year that requirements on the average farm for motive power are very small and many horses that should ibe available on the average farm for the spring, summer, and early fall work are idle through the winter months. Through these drought years we have had in Nebraska we have seen certain changes as far as type of crops being produced is concerned. We have all noticed the greatler amount ot sorghums that have been grown. Both the grain from the sorghum as well as the sorghum fodder can be used efficiently in the work horse ration. Thi3 past winter here at the Agricultural College we carried on an experiment comparing sorghum fodder and good Nebraska wild hay as the main part of the ration for yearling colts and foals and in this experiment the colts receiving sorghum fodder made a greater amount of growth than those receiving wild hay and made this growth much cheaper. The colts that received the sorghum fodder also showed a great deal more bloom at the end of the trial than the colts receiving wild hay and there actually was a little less waste of feed in the sorg - hum lot than there was in the lot of colts fed wild hay. At the present time here at the University we are feeding sorghum .fodder practically as our entire roughage to brood mares, growing colts, work horses, and our stallions. Last winter we also fed our brood mares sorghum fodder as almost their sole roughage. We had no foaling troubles that could possibly be attributed to the type of ration fed. The idle work horses can be maintained through the winter on such rough feeds as Four brood mares that not only take their regular turn in the field, but also raise good saleable colts. </seg>
         <seg id="p180">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture straw, cornstalks and winter pasture; however the condition of these horses should be watched at all times and if they are getting a little too thin one feed of sorghum fodder or hay, or in case 1 neither of these is available, a pound and a half of protein supplement can be given to the horses, which will help to keep them in fair physical condition. Conditioning for Spring Work Horses wintered in this manner should be properly conditioned for spring work. Two or three weeks of light grain feeding prior to the time the heavy work is to start should put the horse in shape to stand the spring work in fairly good shape. We all realize that oats long has been considered the standard ration for horses; however in the case of where drought has prevented the raising of a good oats crop and there has been a fair sorghum grain crop, the sorghum grain can be efficiently used in the work horse ration. However, some protein sup - plement such as one-half to one pound of cottonseed, linseed, or soy - bean meal should be given each horse daily where the sorghum grain is fed as the sole grain, since the sorghum grain is very low in protein and mineral. Pasture should be utilized to the maximum extent for all classes of horses. We have all heard much discussion regarding the Pasture- Forage-Livestock program in Nebraska. In cases where farmers are trying to follow out such a program, horses certainly fit into the pic - ture as they can produce power on a maximum amount of roughage and a minimum amount of grain. The grain, of course, that the horse uses should be given to him at the season of the year when he is re - quired to do the heaviest amount of work. All of these changes, have had some effect on the type of horse that should be produced. Our city trade is gone and with it disappeared the demand for a heavy horse with considerable size, bone, and rugged - ness. Our present day demand is largely a country one and the farmer wants a horse of medium type, weighing from 1400 to 1550 pounds, that is not too awfully tall. He wants a horse that is alert, has a good fast walk and above all, one that is ble to endure hrd work during hot weather. Another point that should be considered in selecting farm work horses or the breeding of horses for farm work is to get a horse with a good middle.The deep ribbed horse is a much easier keeper than the long-coupled, shallow bodied horse and these easy keeping horses will stay in good condition on a minimum amount of grain and a maximum amount of roughage much easier than will the leggy type. </seg>
         <seg id="p181">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association PROCESSING FEEDS FOR LIVESTOCK By Ij. W. Hurlbut, College of Agri. From 'the inquiries we receive we can conclude that a number of feeders would like to know if it will pay them to buy a feed mill; and if they buy one, how much it will cost them to process their feeds. In general, there will be about as many answers to these questions a3 there are feeders. Here are a few reasons why this is the case, The value received from mechanical processing of feeds will de - pend largely upon: (1) the value of the feed; (2) the nature of the feed; (3) class of livestock; (4) method of feeding; (5) co3t of pro - cessing the feed. ' Feed is by far the largest single cost item in livestock production. It ranges from 40 to 90 percent of the total cost depending, of course, on the type and class of livestock fed, their care and feeding practices followed. The processing of feed may be considered as an added ex - pense to the feed cost; therefore, those factors leading to economic processing of feed should receive very careful consideration. The in - formation we have on grains the livestock feeders have found profitable to grind shows benefits ranging from S to 17 per cent of whole grains, averaging about 10 per cent In general, if the total cost of grinding any grain exceeds 10 per cent of the cost of the grain during a feeding period, the value of processing grains to increase its feeding value is questionable. Where mixtures are made for definite rations the cost of grinding must be based, to a considerable extent at least, on the advantage of proper mixture rather than on the comparisons of the feeding values of whole or ground grain. Consideration of the val - ue of the feed is important because if feeds are high in price, it will be more profitable to process them than when they are low in price. The processing of low cost roughages to a fine state usually does not justi - fy the added cost due to the small amount of digestible nutrients pre - sent. However, for maintaining mature animals, which generally re - quire little protein but a large amount of energy building material, it may sometimes pay to grind or otherwise process roughages to a fine state. . . .:'.¦'• Nature of the Feed ¦ I am sure that many feeders believe that processing feeds to a very fine state proportionately increases the nutritive value of the feed. It is practically impossible to increase the amount of nutrients in a feed simply by pjulverizing it. For example, when feeding cattle whole corn under some methods of feeding, we may find many kernels passing through undigested. Immediately one thinks of grinding the corn to reduce this loss and it can be reduced that way. However, in grinding the corn we attempt to increase the digestibility and the rate. </seg>
         <seg id="p182">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of digestibility; we grind it to expose the digestible nutrients of the feed to the digestive juices so that more complete and rapid digestion may take place. Feeds are broken down for digestion by two means-— animal and mechanical. It is only logical and natural that the animal should be given every opportunity to process its own feed. However, because all animals do not possess adequate means for fully processing certain feeds and under some feeding methods they do not masticate the feed properly, the mechanical process has been used to aid the ani - mal process. Mechanical processing may also help to reduce feeding waste. The nature of the feed will determine to a considerable extent the amount of processing required. Usually coarse grinding is recommend - ed for grains high in starch while for those high in fiber a medium to coarse grinding is recommended. The Animal Husbandry men inform us that in general if does not pay to grind roughages. With chopped or ground roughages the feeding value may be slightly higher than whole roughage; however, other advantages for chopping roughages are: (1) reduced feeding waste; and (2) ease of storing and handling. CLASS OF LIVESTOCK Considering the class of livestock, B. A. Silver of Ohio State Uni - versity, reports that a close study of test cattle and samples taken from their stomachs indicated that cattle will masticate hay, for example, to a fine degree of reduction regardless of the method of mechanical processing or the fineness to which it is processed. The hay was more finely masticated by the younger animals because of their greater ac - tivity. Only small reduction was made on the finely ground material by mastication. Yet the animals spent from one-half to two-thirds of the time spent on the mastication of whole hay. Mr. Silver feels it is safe to conclude that much of the extended chewing is not entirely for the purpose of breaking down the food, but to mix it thoroughly and to moisten it before swallowing. The test also showed that young animals of about 18 months of age when fed corn -will break up or masticate approximately 90% of the kernels, while animals from 28 to 36 months will break up from 35 to 65% of the kernels. If the hard outer coatings of the corn kernels are pierced in any manner to allow the digestive juices to enter, they will become soft and soon be digested. These data presented by Silver and others help to emphasize that the class and age of livestock may be an important factor in determining the value re - ceived from the mechanical processing of feeds. Generally, coarse grinding is recommended for beef cattle; a little finer grade is recom - mended for the hard-working, high producing dairy cow; sheep require very little grinding; swine and poultry require both coarse and fine grinding in different methods of feeding. </seg>
         <seg id="p183">1 Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Alethod of Feeding When discussing value of processing feeds, I always recall the statement made by Dr. McCampbell of Kansas State College, during one of our past Organized Agriculture meetings. He said, "The benefits received from processing, grinding or refining feeds in any way depend" as much on the man doing the feeding as upon the feed and the animal receiving the feed".. Professor Loeffel has suggested as a supplement to Dr. McCampbell's statement: "The method of feeding by hand or by self feeder often greatly influences the benefits received from process - ed feeds". ¦j -. '.¦¦¦'¦. Cost of Processing ; The manufacturers of feed processing machinery claim that feed is saved and more meat and milk are produced if grains are ground and roughages cut. It is quite apparent that many feeders are of the same opinion as the manufacturers. The user or purchaser must not assume, however, that the economies of grinding or processing feed 3 are fur - nished as standard accessories with the equipment. If the economies are to be obtained, careful consideration must be given to the effective utilization of equipment. . ! In general, grinding costs may be divided into the following class - ifications: ' ! ' ¦ '¦-¦¦'¦'¦ ¦ - A. Fixed costs or overhead costs. ( 1. Interest on investment -¦; ' ¦ 2. Taxes and insurance ¦'¦¦¦. 3. Depreciations on various items and equipment ; B. Attendance costs. C. Operation costs. , : ¦¦; 1. Fuel or energy costs ; ; 2. Lubricating oils and greases . [ . i : 3. Repairs ' Fixed or Overhead Costs : ; In considering how fixed costs affect grinding costs, let us take for example, a small mill costing: $50.00; a medium sized mill costing $100.00; and a large mill costing $400.00 The fixed costs per year, that is, [interest, depreciation, and taxes may run about $5.32 for the small mill; $10.64 for the medium mill; and $42.67 for the large mill. If 500 bushela of grain per year are processed with the small mill the fixed cost will be about 1 cent per bushel; for the medium mill about 2 cents per bushel; and for the large mill about 8.5 cents per bushel. This esti - mate does not include fixed charges for the power unit. In order to </seg>
         <seg id="p184">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture have the fixed cost per bushel the same with both the large and small mills, it would be necessary to process about 4,200 bushels with the large mill. To grind economically one must either grind with a small unit, thus holding down the fixed charges, or when using a large unit, must grind large quantities of grain. Attendance Costs The attendance costs for feed processing installations i 3 the sec - ond important factor affecting the economies of grinding. Let us as - sume for example, that it is possible for a given installation to grind 30 bushels per hour with one man in attendance during all of the grinding period. If we consider his time to be worth 30 cents per hour then the attendance charge per bushel with this installation would be one cent per bushel. The attendance charge for such an installation will be directly proportional to the amount of feed processed. If this same mill is installed for automatic operation, the time required fpr its operation will be nearly fixed —let us say 15 minutes for starting and 15 minutes for stopping, cleaning the mill, lubricating, and so forth. In this case if 30 bushels are ground the labor charge would be M cent per bushel and the charge would decrease as the quantity ground increases. We may conclude that the large capacity mill is eco - nomical in labor costs, but is likely to be high in fixed costs. The small mill reduces the fixed costs but may be high in labor costs if it is not installed for automatic operation. Operating Costs Considering the third main factor, the operating costs for pro - cessing feeds—in general we find that the minimum power costs per bushel do not vary much with the size of the mill used. Variations of the total grinding costs will depend largely upon attendance costs and fixed costs. The operating costs depend, however, on the kind and nature of the materials to be ground, type of mill and equipment used, fineness of grinding, and the operation of the mill. In general, ear corn requires the most power for grinding and other grains fall in about the following order: oats, barley, shelled corn, cane, wheat, and kaflr. In regard to the type of mill, burr mills surpass hammer mills for medium and coarse grinding, but are less efficient for fine and very fine grinding. Particles of more even size are produced by burr mills than hammer mills. Composite samples show more very coarse and more fine particles in ground grain from a hammer type mill. For grinding grains having a high dry starch content, the burr mill is very </seg>
         <seg id="p185">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association i satisfactory. For the fine grinding of such grains or the grinding of grains high in fiber the hammer mill shows better results than the burr mill. We find several types of mills on the market because one type of mill may be more adaptable for one kind of grain or one kind of instal - lation than another; or it may give good results on 1 coarse grinding and poor results on fine grinding. | The degree of fineness of grinding is a factor of great importance in i determining the operating costs. For example, the cost of producing finely ground oats may be three to five times the cost of producing med - ium ground oats. Finely ground wheat may show a cost for grinding about twice that for medium grinding. It is very fortunate, from the cost of operations standpoint, that the Animal Husbandry men find it possible to recommend in most cases, coarse or fairly coarse processing of feeds most desirable. Coarse processing of feeds will 1 reduce the wear and tear on the equipment,'increase its capacity and decrease the per - unit power costs. | Last but not least, is the factor of mill operation which has con - siderable influence on the operating costs. It is important to see that the proper size of pulley is used on a feed mill so that the proper speed will be obtained; that the proper size of screens be chosen for the ham - mer mill or that the proper burrs are chosen for the burr mill; and that the burrs are properly adjusted for clearance. I have observed ground grain coming from a burr mill so hot that one could not bury his hand in the grain and hold it there for a short time. The heat in this case was a result of excessive friction between the grinder burrs. If the burrs are rigidly adjusted so that there is zero clearance between them, and no pressure exists between them, they are set for the finest possible grinding with that particular set of burrs. An attempt to force them closer together will result only in wasted power through friction and badly worn burrs. I hope that I have pointed out in this very sketchy discussion that the cost of processing feeds is made up of a number of variable factors, each of which is difficult to measure, yet careful consideration must be given in.evaluating each variable if the total cost is to be controlled with any degree of accuracy. The human factor is a very important one. Regardless of type or size of machine, efficiency of operation is in proportion to the efficiency of the operator. The following sources of information should be of aid in choosing a grinder, determining tractor costs, estimating and fixed costs of a mill installation: : '/::.-. Bulletin 324—"Cost of Tractor Power oh Nebraska Farms". Bulletin 302—"Processing Feeds on Nebraska Farms". </seg>
         <seg id="p186">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture "Tractor Co3ts" a mimeographed paper presented by C. W. Smith dur - ing our 1938 Organized Agriculture meeting. It is interesting to note that new developments in processing feeds are being reported from time to time. Considerable work is now being done with grass silage—oats, wheat and rye silage. Developments along this line will be watched with considerable interest by farmers in the drouth stricken areas. Such feeds may fit in very -well -with the very successful Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program. I believe that we are making very good use of our drouth beaten corn and sorghums. I see no reason why we should have to depend on our small grain crops to yield only grain. A small grain crop may be worth considerably more in the form of silage than it would yield in the form of grain. During the best years a large portion of our grain finally goes to market in the form of livestock. I believe it is fair to ask ourselves if we are using our small grain crops as efficiently as they can be used. "We hope that research and experimental work will give us the answer to this ques - tion in the near future.

THE STORY OF MY TRIP TO CHICAGO Kenneth Herrold At seven-thirty Sunday morning, December 3rd, 1939, we of the Nebraskan delegation to the National Boys' and Girls' 4-H Club Con - gress clambered down from our Rock Island train which we had board - ed in Omaha at seven-thirty the evening before. We found ourselves in the world's healthiest large city, Chicago. A very heavy schedule lay before us and from this time on we found very few hours to rest. Immediately after arriving in Chicago we marched in formation to the Harrison Hotel which became the headquarters for the Nebras - kan delegation. Sunday morning we attended the First Methodist Church of Chicago and heard an inspiring sermon by the Reverend John Thompson, D. D. In the afternoon we took a forty-five mile bus tour of the city. On this tour we became acquainted with the city at large and saw many points of interest including The Fountain of Time, a statue carved by Lorado Taft, Grant Park built by filling dirt into the lake, the University of Chicago, The Billings Medical Center, and the home of Edith Rockefeller McCormick. We traveled on the Lake Shore Drive, and Leif Ericson Drive. In the evening we attended the Chicago Sunday Evening Club in Orchestra Hall. This Club was orga - nized in 190 7 to maintain a service of Christian inspiration and fellow - ship in the business center of Chicago and to promote the moral and religious welfare of the city. Here we heard an address entitled "The Escape from the Flatlands" delivered by Dr. Lynn Harold Hough of New Jersey. Early Monday morning our team went to the Livestock Exchange Building to judge grain. Almost all the contests were held Monday morning. In the afternoon we attended the twenty-second anniversary of the Annual Thomas E. Wilson Day. Mr. Wilson presented the Thom - as E. Wilson National 4-H Meat Animal Livestock and Junior Feeding </seg>
         <seg id="p189">I Nebraska Crop Growers' Association awards to their winnera. A very fine program followed. The perform - ers included Uncle Ezra, the Hoosier Hot Shots, and Lowe, Hite and Stanly, the European Sensation, those tall, short and tiny men. The music was furnished by Waddy Wadsworth and his World Broadcast - ing System Orchestra. After the program Thomas E. Wilson gave the 4-pH members a delightful banquet. Tuesday morning 4-H Club boys went to the Swllt and Company Cafeteria to eat breakfast. Afterwards we went through their plant which covers 640 acres of land. From here we went directly into the Libby, McNeill and Libby Canning plant and watched the process of canning. By this time, we had an empty feeling in our stomachs and were glad when we found a dinner waiting for us made possible by the National Live Stock Marketing Association. After dinner we were en - tertained by another program. , Wednesday we went/through the International Harvester Com - pany's Tractor plants. At these works models A and B and Trac Trac Tors are built. We were later taken through the McCormick Deering binder-twine plant after which all 4-H delegates lined up to have a pic - ture taken. At this time a new rubber tire Farmall was not In the exact location to be seen best in the picture. Two International Harvester Office men tried to move it by hand but at length they gave up and a broad-shouldered Texas 4-H boy stepped up, unlocked the brake, and rolled the tractor to its destination. We then enjoyed a fine dinner and short program in one of the International Harvester Company's ware - houses, decorated for the purpose. That evening the 4-H delegates at - tended a banquet and 4-H Club Girls' style show at the Stevens Hotel. Here winners of Club activities were introduced and their awards given. On Thursday we were taken to the Museum of Science and Indus - try. Many of us boys who were near the front of the procession spent thirty minutes in a room where new machines which had been display - ed in the San Francisco World's Fair, were explained to us. It was very interesting and most of us would have liked to spend the entire day in this Museum. Later we went to the Adler Planetarium, a great dome - shaped building standing on man-made land near thej lake. The Plane - tarium, Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium are all located on this ar - tificial land, the 300 acre "Front Yard" of Chicago which is called Grant Park. The Planetarium was set up to enable the people of Chi - cago to study the heavens. People of the city seldom see the stars, for it is usually too foggy, smoky or misty. The buildings are too tall to permit them to even see the sunrise. The great room of the planetarium was darkened and Chicago's skyline was. seen on the lower horizon of the dome. An intricate "Planetarium" machine in the middle of the room went into action and the positions of heavenly bodies were focus - ed on the dome as if on a clear night. AH movements and positions of </seg>
         <seg id="p190">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the bodies were shown. The machine sped so fast that in a few minutes we saw the motions of heavenly bodies for several years. I, like several other boys, stayed awake till 1946, but that was far enough so conse - quently we found ourselves sleeping but we were back in 1939 when the house lights went on. In Field Museum we found many interesting sights which dated from very ancient times. The animal displays were very interesting but we found that we had time to see only a small portion of the mu - seum. The farewell party Thursday evening consisted of a picture show and a dance. It certainly was a farewell party, for the dancing had scarcely begun when it was announced that the Nebraska delegates would have to leave immediately if they were to catch their train. Truly, I believe that I will remember this educational trip all of my life, but I am sorry that we lacked time to see many other point 3 of interest. There were 1500 4-H Club boys and girls in Chicago and every one seemed to be very friendly. There were fifty-eight of us from Ne - braska, the largest state delegation, and seven of us from Hamilton County, the largest delegation of any county in Nebraska. Nebraska was the only state that had a team or contestants for every contest. The delegates were from forty-six states and Canada. I hope in the near future that Nebraska will be able to send a 4-H band to Chicago like that of Shawnee County, Kansas and that many other Hamilton County boys and girls will be able to take this fine trip.

         <seg id="p191">Nebraska Crop Growers'Assocation This year's team was composed of Milo Tesar of Tobias, Will Pit - nev of Stratton, Jean Lambert of Ewlng, Andrew Andrewson of Omaha, and August Dreier of McCool Junction. The boys placed second at the Kansas City contest which was held during the latter part of November. At this contest, Milo Tesar placed as second high man, Pitner fifth, and Lambert ninth. In the Chicago contest which was held in connection with the International Hay and Grain Show, the boys again placed second, being nosed out by only one point by the Oklahoma A. &amp; M. team. The Nebraska boys compiled a score of 4,139 points, but the Oklahoma team made 4,140. Tesar was the high man of the contest, tying the all-time high individual score. Andrew Andrewson placed eighth and Will Pitner fourteenth. We wish to thank the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association for their interest and fine help in connection with this work. We feel that it is a very stimulating project in our teaching work and the boys who have been members of these teams are very appreciative of the help which they receive from your organization. j i ; Very truly yours; ; A.

L. SEVERE, PALMYRA SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, LINCOLN </seg>
         <seg id="p213">' Nebraska State Dairymen's Association H. L. Severe— We have a very practical and I am sure a very interesting pro - gram arranged for this morning. Mr. O. H. Liebers will preside over the portion of the discussion which will deal with the feeding of sorghums to dairy cattle. This is a practice which has been fol - lowed in Nebraska the last few years because of necessity and with - out sufficient information to assure us i that we were utilizing these feeds to the best advantage. The suggestions gained through prac - tical experience by these men, who are scheduled to appear on the program, will be welcomed by all of us. I will now turn the meet - ing over to Mr. I/febers. O. H. Liebers— My part in this program is primarily to introduce those who, through practical experience with unusual feeding| conditions, are well qualified to talk upon subjects assigned to them. As our first speaker I wish to introduce to you Mr. Don Morton of Beatrice, whose subject is "Sorghum Silage as Compared with Other Silages". Don Morton— • ; It is quite significant that this year we should be using sor - ghum silage as our standard of comparison. It hasn't been so many years ago that most of us had not even heard of sorghum silage. Today it seems sorghums are one of our most dependable silage crops. A still more recent development of silage Is the preserving of green crops by means of molasses, acids or special cultures of bac - teria. By means of these preservatives almost any green crop can be made into silage at almost any time of the year and in almost any kind of weather. ¦ By far the most practical of these preservatives is molasses and that is the only one that we have used. The crops that we have used are oats and rye. All the cereal crops, alfalfa, sweet clover,' soy beans and many others will work equally as well. Alfalfa seems to be the best of any crops that have been tried. The oats and rye were cut in the dough stage and put in with about 80 lbs. of mo - lasses to the ton. We used the grass silage in our feeding program just as we would sorghum silage. Las£ winter we were feeding atlas silage and when it ran out we changed to rye. Our production remained practically the same. But we did notice a distinct improvement in the flavor of the milk. ¦ j , There are several reasons why we like to use molasses silage. </seg>
         <seg id="p214">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The main reason is that it is good cow feed. We can get good pala - table feed from crops that might be damaged if we had to cure them in the field. It can be stored in silos that we already have. If a silo is emptied in the winter it can be filled with a spring crop to be used during the pasture season and be empty ready for atlas in the fall. It has been proven many times that by use of silage we can pre - serve more nutrients of feed per acre. When we have a system by means of which we can put almost any crop we raise in the silo in - stead of just one or two, we are bound to increase the amount of nutrients that can be taken from an acre of ground. The Vermont Experiment Station found out, through a rather extensive survey which took in 380 cooperators from 18 states, many interesting things, only a few of which can be mentioned here. The station found that a wide range of crops and combinations of crops were used in making of grass silage. Alfalfa and combinations of al - falfa with wheat, oats, clover and timothy were used. Soybeans alone and in combination with other crops were a big favorite with many of the oooperators. Such combinations as oats and peas, oats and al - falfa, oats and clover made very palatable silage. Many other cereal grasses were used, such as rye, barley and millet. The station found out other interesting facts such as: 1. Oats alone and in combinations with other crops made up a large acreage of material used by the cooperators in the eighteen states for making grass silage. 2. They also found that crops in the after bloom or mature stage did not keep as well in the silo unless large amounts of water were used. Also the feeding value was materially lowered, especially the protein. 3. Results showed that alfalfa probably made the best grass or legume silage. 4. Three hundred and thirty-two of the farm operators in the survey reported that their cows ate the grass silage readily. Twenty - six reported difficulty. Their trouble probably came from not having good silage, perhaps getting it up in poor shape. 5. Eighty-three percent of the operators said grass silage was equal or superior to corn silage. 6. Thirty-nine percent reported that grass silage improved the milk color. 7. Ninety-five percent said it was equal or superior to good hay. 8. Seventy-five percent of the 380 cooperators said they were </seg>
         <seg id="p215">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association putting- up grass or legume silage for regular winter feeding, either to replace corn silage or hay or part of both. 9. Over 50 percent of the cooperators said they planned to use their grass or legume silage to supplement their summer pasture. It must be remembered that in order to put grasses, or legumes, into silos best results are had where molasses is added. Fifty pounds to the ton for grasses, and 70 to 80 pounds for legumes. There is con-' siderable work involved in putting green crops into the silo. Before doing this particular job you should make inquiry with reference to machinery need, for sometimes ordinary hay tools will not handle heavy green crops economically. Above all, you need a good tight silo. DISCUSSION Q—What stage should rye be put in silo? A—Early dough stage or blossom stage. ¦' •¦ Q —ls black stem rust a great disadvantage to the silage and is it a poison? ; A—Rust would make it somewhat unpalatable but not much ex - perience has been had in this case. . : Q—Compare palatibility and yield of rye and oats silage. A—Somewhat the same, although it depends on the season, time of cutting, and variety. The yield is questionable but rye perhaps yields more. Q —How can you get the right amount of molasses in the silage? A—ln cases of large amounts a pump may be fitted to the cutter. Be sure there Is plenty. For small amounts mix molasses and water in .tank and pour several bucketfuls on each load. Q—Do you use salt on grass silage? ¦;¦•¦ A--No. . .;' ¦'¦¦' ¦ ¦•¦"¦•¦ ¦ ' ¦.¦'¦''' Q—ls last cutting for alfalfa better than firat? A—Last cutting may be somewhat better if it can be cured long enough. . . i Q_What kind of field cutter for alfalfa? ¦ ..'¦- A- —Use inexpensive, machine—some are like combines with knives instead of beaters. Q—-How about cutting cereal grain for. silage and then planting sorghum on same ground? A—Drouth prohibits. Under conditions of irrigation it is possible and profitable. Q —How does Atlas yield compare with grasses? . </seg>
         <seg id="p216">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture A—Rye 50% to 70% as much as Atlas. Q —What stage should Atlas be cut? A —Judgement determines time to cut. Do not let it get too dry. Q —ls it possible to cut Atlas young enough for cattle to consume grain and not pass it? A —Silage cut just when coming into the hard dough stage was fed and the seeds in droppings were noticed. When fully matured seed was fed the passage of seed doubled. "The Use of Sorghum Fodder in the Dairy Ration"—H. H. Birkett Mr. Birkett— In regard to my experience in feeding sorgo to dairy cattle: I, like most everybody, thought I couldn't milk cows without alfalfa hay. In the years of 1935 to 1937 we fed on an average of 40 tons a year and had to buy it all. In the last two years we have replaced it with Atlas sorgo. We put 200 to 250 tons in a trench silo and had plenty of sorgo fodder for hay. In cutting sorgo we tind it best to cut it when it is in the blossom stage or a little later. At that time you will find it has more sugar in the stalk. What we cut for hay we cut at this time, and that to be put in the silo is left until matured. That gives us a third more tonnage to the acre. What we have left after filling the silo we shock up and in about two or three weeks we take a combine with an upright sickle and go from shock to shock holding the ends of the bundles on the sickle. This made 30 tons to the acre. We hauled the bundles in the barn, as sorgo is hard to keep, and set it up around the sides of the barn. We strung wire through the middle and ricked the bundles against it—it kept in fine shape. In selecting seed we find it best to get new seed every year from southern Arizona, because the sugar seems to run out in two or three years in this country. We ground some of the sorgo fodder and found that the cattle ate it just as well as in the stalk. In the spring when the cows were getting a little green we ground it, and they seemed to eat it better. Since the sugar is dried up a little more, it will help to sprinkle dilut - ed molasses over it. In feeding all sorgo and no alfalfa, as we have in the last two years, you must remember a good grain ration is neces - sary. In fact, that is where you must get your protein—which we all know dairy cows must have. Our grain ration in 1938 consisted of 200 lbs. Atlas sorgho seed, 100 lbs. oats, 100 lbs. bran, and 100 lbs. soybean meal, all ground fine. This last year we are feeding early Kalo instead of sorgo seed. For mineral and salt our cows have free access to it. </seg>
         <seg id="p217">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Our cows have made more money the last two years than they ever did, making a herd average of 423 pounds of fat. ! DISCUSSION Q —Does it pay to grind alfalfa hay? A—No. •¦¦¦ '. '. ¦•,-¦ ..--.¦¦• .'•..'¦¦ ¦ Q—Do you feed protein supplement with Atla3 sorghum silage? A—Yes—2oo lhs. Kalo; 200 lbs. bran; 100 lbs. soybean meal. . ¦¦¦ Q—Does this supplement make up for the absence of alfalfa? : A—Yes. ; .-¦ . v " . '¦:'¦¦ Q —ls there any difference in value of linseed oil meal and soy - bean meal? A—Linseed oil meal seems to be better. Q—Do you feed, minerals with this ration of sorghum silage and grain? A—Yes. It should be fed in a box so they can eat at will. Armour's minerals are good. \ '. ¦ ¦ '" ¦¦' ¦. ¦ ¦ * ¦.. ¦ -¦ / Q—Do you have any experience with ground Kalo heads? A—No, but there seems to be no objection to it. Q—M pure Atlas sorgo seed is planted and the same seed used for a number of years will the plant tend to decrease in sweetness? i A—Yes, it seems to. ; Q—How do you dehead your sorgo? A—Combine with an upright sickle. It can also be cut out of the shock by the bundle and then shocked: up again. The feeding of Atlas silage and 1 grain ration for the last two years, with no feeding of alfalfa has shown good production in the herd and has maintained fleshing and appearance of the herd. One question seems to be prominent: Will the feeding of sorghum silage and sorghums tend to impair the health of the offspring over a period of years? There seems to be some doubt about this. . ••• "The Feeding of Grain Sorghums"—J. S. Wishart Mr. Wishart— This discussion is limited to the use.of sorghum grain and stover on our farm during the year 1939 as compared with the year 193,8, when no sorghums were included in the feeding ration. Subsequent to 1934, bur dairy ration consisted of corn ensilage and alfalfa hay; supplemented by a 14 percent protein ration, con - sisting of 350 pounds of corn cob meal, oats, bran, linseed, cotton seed and soy bean meal, steamed bran meal, lime stone and salt. Part </seg>
         <seg id="p218">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of the alfalfa used was first cutting from our own fields and second cutting bought at Lexington at prices ranging from $18.00 to $24.00 a ton. In 1939 the ration was changed, substituting 400 pounds of Cheyenne sweet stalk kaffir seed for the 350 pounds of corn cob meal, and thrashed kaffir stover was used in place of one-half of the alfalfa ration. In both 1938 and 1939 drouth-injured corn ensilage, containing very little grain, was used, and in 1939 all of the alfalfa was first cutting raised on the farm. With the exceptions noted, the grain supplement for both years was the same and was fed at the rate of one pound of supplement to each three pounds of milk pro - duced. In 1939 the kaffir grain yielded forty bushels to the acre, the roughage produced being estimated at 12 tons to the acre when cut. The threshing broke up the stalks to such an extent that the unedible portion was reduced to a minimum. The stover proved to be moder - ately sweet and rather aromatic and wa3 quite palatable. The experiment was commenced on December 1, 1938, and we continued to feed the stover until the cattle were on full pasture, the middle of May, 1939. Kaffir was used as a grain until the Ist of Aug - ust, at which time the supply was exhausted. Comparisons are made of nine cows, who had been in milk both years and whose freshening periods and other circumstances were sufficiently similar to justify comparison. Of the nine compared, five showed a gain over their 1938 record and four lost. The average gain was 37 pounds per cow over the five month period. For the same period, four cows lost 12 pounds each. In other words, the 1939 record showed an average net gain of five pounds of fat per cow per month during the first five months of the year. In 1939 there were eleven cows in the herd which had completed a lactation in 1938. On an annual basis, seven of the eleven cows gained and four lost. The seven cows gained 688 pounds of fat over 1938, or an average gain of 98 pounds per cow. Four cows lost 93 pounds, or 23 pounds per cow. The average herd gain for the year 1939 was 54 pounds per cow. During the five month period, the D. H. I. A. record, under the supervision of Mr. Vance, who made the compilation, showed that in 1938 sixteen cows in milk produced 2176 pounds of fat, averaging 27.2 pounds of fat. During the same period in 1939, sixteen cows produced 2600 pounds of fat or an average of 32.5 pounds of fat per cow per month. The cost of production was reduced to 13tf per pound of butter fat. </seg>
         <seg id="p219">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Reduced to a money basis, the 16 cows in milk during the first five months in 1939 paid $166.48 more than sixteen cowa in milk in the herd in 1938, or $1.10 per day net gain. In interpreting the re - sults, the normal and usual element of animal variance must be tak - en into consideration. In the herd there were three cows which had not reached maturity in 1938 and a gain was to be expected as a matter of course. Also, one or two which had done rather badly in 1938 showed a surprising recovery in 1939. How much the feeding ration was responsible is naturally speculative. Ot the cows that lost, some of them were past their prime and a minor fluctuation could reasonably be expected. In one instance an injury to a teat causing loss of milk explained the loss. On the whole, it is our opinion that the change of ration was satisfactory in that the herd showed improvement in production at a reduced co3t. It is also true that during 1939 the herd maintained a normal, healthy condition. It must also be noted that the kaffir has proved a dependable source of supply under extreme drouth conditions. Starting December Ist, we have been using Atlas sorgo silage instead of the corn silage. This sorghum matured normally with a heavy yield of grain; whereas, all of our corn was drouth injured with an unsatisfactory yield. We had planned to cut the sorgo just after the grain had reached the hard dough stage. The extreme heat and drouth after September Ist caused a premature hardening of the shell of the seed. However* when placed in the silo, the seed was still chalky and easily broken. Examination seems to indicate that the cattle have been able to more fully utilize the seed in the ensilage than was possible when feeding fully matured seed in bundles. I might add that both the grain and stover were fed to horses with satisfactory results, especially where a small portion of oil meal was used as a supplement. "Precautions in the Use of Sorghum and Sudan Pastures" Dr. I/. V. Skidmore Dr. Skidmove— During the past few years the pasturing of sorghum and sudan grass has been a problem of considerable concern to the livestock raisers of Nebraska. This has been due largely to extremes in climatic conditions. ; V ' Sorghum belongs to the grass family. Sudan grass belongs to this genus. These plants are generally considered valuable stock feeds for pasture and hay. Nevertheless, they may be dangerous to livestock because, under certain soil and climatic conditions, they may develop a deadly poison, prussic acid, in sufficient quantity to kill livestock, </seg>
         <seg id="p220">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture especially cattle, sometimes sheep, and very rarely horses or swine. Prussic acid poisons the nervous system, causing paralysis and, often - times, death. This poison is in the form of complex compounds called glucosides. They may be broken down in the plant or set free in the digestive tract of an animal. The smallest fatal dose for cattle is esti - mated to be close to 0.000204 percent of the animal's weight, and for sheep 0.000231 percent. Poisoning of livestock by sorghum and Sudan grass is largely confined to the western section of the country, which is subjected to adverse climatic changes of heat, cold, and dryness. In the south but few cases have been reported. Ordinarily sorghum has about ten times as much cyanide as su - dan grass. It is a dangerous practice to pasture sorghum and usually it is not fed until it forms grain. Just how prussic acid or hydrocyanic acid is formed in sorghum and sudan grass, and under exactly what conditions it may cause poisoning to livestock, has been and still continues to be a very perplexing problem. For this reason, during the past few years, several of our experiment stations have devoted considerable study in an effort to solve the mysteries connected with sorghum and sudan grass poisoning in livestock. It appears that most cases of poisoning occurs in those years when there are periods of sudden dryness followed by rain stimulat - ing the plants to quick growth. During the past season of continued dryness and lack of rain very little trouble was experienced from pas - turing sudan grass or the feeding of sorghum. Briefly, here are some, precautions which may prove of value in preventing losses of live - stock from prussic acid poisoning: 1. Do not pasture in the early stages of growth; the plants are most dangerous at that time. Wait until the sudan gvass is V&amp; to 2 feet high, for it then furnishes the most feed. 2. Plant two or more fields of sudan grass so that animals can be rotated from field to field and, thus, are not forced to eat the new growth. By means of temporary fences, pasture a small part of the field at a time so that animals will graze the plants somewhat uni - formly. When this is done the animals are kept off until the plants grow to a height of from 1% to 2 feet. Then pasture again. 3. Young, vigorous growing plants and particularly the second growth of sorghum and sudan grass following rains is very dangerous and should not be pastured. 4. Some varieties of these plants appear to be more poisonous than others. It is highly desirous to find and plant those varieties that are least dangerous. </seg>
         <seg id="p221">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association 5. Avoid pasturing when the plants are severely wilted. There may be less danger in pasturing in the early morning and late evening when the plants contain more water. 6. Animals in a low state of vigor, poorly fed, emaciated and hungry are most likely to be poisoned. Those well-filled before turn - ing on pasture have a better chance of surviving. 7. The feeding of molasses, or starchy feeds, such as corn or ground sorghum grain, before allowing animals to graze appears to reduce hazards. ; 8. Soils, having an unbalanced ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus, those especially high in available nitrogen and a low level of phos - phorus tend to produce more poison in the plants. Some of your pas - tures may be more dangerous than others. : 9. The safety of pastures may sometimes be determined by col - lecting specimens of the plants, having these tested for poison. It may also be determined by turning into the field an animal of the least value and waiting results for one hour. Animals that are not too hungry, when turned into a sudan grass pasture that is poison, will sometimes stop eating after about fifteen minutes and look about for other grass to eat —this is a danger signal. ! 10. Plants high in poison content,, even when cut for hay, care - fully cured and stored, will be dangerous for some time. Likewise, sorghums having a high poisonous content, even though ensilaged, may be a dangerous feed for several weeks. i 11. It is believed that the feeding of sulphur in the feed, two tablespoonsful a day, may prevent losses. ; ¦ 12. If treatment is given to affected animals it should be given immediately. Therefore, the medicine to be given must be already prepared, ready to use, and at hand. j , Sodium Thiosulphate has proven to be a valuable Medicine to use. If the animal is only slightly affected and can swallow, drench with one-fourth to one^half pound of sodium thiosulphate in one quart of water. This may be all that is necessary to save the life of the animal. If the animal is down and cannot swallow, then 30-50 cc. of a 20-30 percent solution of sodium thiosulphate should be slowly injected in - to the Jugular vein or the sub-cutaneous abdominal rein (milk vein) with a syringe fitted with a 15 or 16 gauge needle two inches long. Sheep require 15-30 cc. The jugular vein may be difficult to find in sheep and so one can inject the solution intraperitoneally (into the belly cavity in the region of the flank). The solution of sodium thio - sulphate is prepared by adding a heaping tablespoonful of the sodium </seg>
         <seg id="p222">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture thiosuiphate to four ounces of water. The solution keeps well and so it may be made up and kept ready for use. If desired, the solution can be sterilized by boiling without being materially changed. Likewise, you may purchase drugs from a veterinarian, ready to use, to treat poisoned animals. By following the above precautions and treatment of affected animals you may reduce your animal losses from pasturing sudan grass and the feeding of sorghum. REFERENCES 1.

Heizer—University of Wisconsin We are interested in presenting here a brief analysis of some of the essentials of a constructive breeding program. We are aware of the fact that little progress has been made through use of improved breeding methods until recently. Only about 10 pounds of butterfat increase in production has been credited to the average American dairy cow in the past 35 years. Certainly modern knowledge of feed - ing, management and disease control can more than account for this small increase. Four essential procedures stand out as keystones to the building of more efficient herds in the future. We will confine our attention to these points in the remainder of this discussion. 1. The First Essential of a Sound Breeding Program is a Sound Health Program. With the average American cow going to slaughter at 6 years of age, we may well consider programs which will contribute to a longer, more useful, and incidentally a more profitable life for our dairy cattle. It is common knowledge among better dairymen that a diseas - ed cow is not and cannot be a profitable cow. Tuberculosis, Bangs, </seg>
         <seg id="p223">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Mastitis, and common breeding troubles and a host of minor diseases take a costly toll from our dairy herds each, year. The annual replace - ments in our D. H. I. A.,herds is 28 percent per year, which indicates a normal life of slightly under 6 years for cows in these herds. To summarize brielfy our advice on the maintenance of healthy disease-free herds, we can simply state that studies of hundreds of herds located throughout the nation show conclusively that those breeders who start modestly and continue by breeding their own re - placements have much less loss from disease than those who buy their replacements. 2. The Second Essential in a Constructive Breeding Program is a Sound Testing Program. A sound testing program tests all the cows in the herd all the time. It measures lifetime production of all cows, as contrasted with selective testing which measures the best years of the best cows. In one herd with which we worked, twenty years of selective testing where only about ten percent of the cows were tested yielded very little increase in the herd production or efficiency. After five years of continuous testing in D. H. I. A., the production of this herd was doubled through the elimination of the inferior animals, which had gone unnoticed before a sound testing program was adopted. That continuous testing of all cows in the herd is part of a constructive program is evidenced by th fact that the herds enrolled in D. H. I. A. work throughout the entire nation average over Zoo§ of butterfat. 3. Our Third Cornerstone for a Constructive Breeding Program Might be Termed Intelligent Use of Records. ¦ Results'in our; D. H. I. A. herds indicate that participating dairy - men are using these records to feed and cull their herds. Here, how - ever, we are concerned with another use for these records. They con - stitute the only real measure of the breeding worth of our sires and cow families, and as such form the basis for selection of superior germ plasm for future generations. When we use records for evaluation of our cattle or cattle owned by others, let us not become confused as a result of the effects of environment on the production of dairy cows. A record is not worth the paper it is printed on unless the person at - tempting to appraise it is thoroughly familiar with the conditions under which the animal or herd in question worked and takes these conditions into account. Many herds whose average production is 300jjf fat are genetically'superior to some of those which we honor with 400 to 500 pound averages. The difference in many cases is only feed, care and other management factors. If we know about these environment factors and correctly ap - praise them, it is possible for us to closely judge the breeding worth </seg>
         <seg id="p224">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of a sire. In addition to the production picture, we must study the con - formation of his offspring, especially as regards size, good constitu - tion, capacity, udders, particularly attachments, and leet and legs. Without these essentials of conformation a dairy cow has little hope for a long, profitable life. Sires that transmit production plus desir - able type are rare, and one of the tragedies of modern dairying is the fact that so few offspring are produced by really superior sires. Some hope is in sight for this situation. The modern county breeding co - operatives which employ outstanding sires and artificial breeding techniques should rapidly improve the cattle of these communities. Not only are sires important in the building of better herds. Every calf we raise for replacement purposes receives half of its in - heritance from its mother. Therefore, we can well afford to carefully develop those female lines which combine the "most of the best". Year after year persistent and sustained production, regular breeding characteristics, plus acceptable conformation and the ability to trans - mit these qualities, constitutes the basic requirements of a desirable cow family. Length of life is a generally overlooked factor in our breeding operations. Perhaps if breeders recognized its importance, they would increase their efforts to secure longer productive life for their herds. The first two years of a cow's life represents an investment period and no return is realized. The average good cow in D. H. I. A. work (300# fat) will pay off her indebtedness to her owner in two years. If her life span is six years, she will leave him a net profit of about $100 and his annual replacements will be about 25 percent. If cows of similar ability could live but two years longer, the net profit to the owner would be doubled, and if the life span could be lengthened to 10 years, the net profit per cow would be trebled as compared with our six year variety. Therefore, it is imperative that we seriously attempt to breed those qualities which permit long, useful lives if we are in - terested in more efficient and profitable dairy herds. 4. The Fourth Cornerstone in Our Constructive Breeding Program might be called intelligent Selection of Young Sires. Proved sire records show that even in our D. H. I. A. herds we have proved a poor bull every time we have proved a good sire. This means just one thing. The average D. H. I. A. member has not been too successful in his sire selection in the past. This is probably ac - counted tor by lack of information or misleading information. Record analyses point out some sign posts to guide us in future sire selection which should eliminate much of the gamble and disappointment if we but heed them. These records show that good sires come from good sires. Therefore, in selecting a young sire, purchase a son of the best proved sire that can be found. Second, select young bulls from good </seg>
         <seg id="p225">Nebraska State Dairymen's. Association !' ¦ ¦¦• ' ' . '.--. ' ¦ ¦ ¦ . cow families with lifetime performance records on every member of the family. If possible, pick sons of cows that are themselves daughters of outstanding proved sires. If these points are noted, there is just one other important consideration in selecting a young sire. Pick sire 3 from herds which possess the same environmental standards as your own. High pressure records back of a sire mean little to a breed - er who may have better cows in Wb herd but whose feeding and man - agement practices only permit 300 to 400 pounds butterfat production. In addition to the four considerations mentioned in his discus - sion, it is necessary that breeders have an ideal to strive toward. An old Scotch breeder, Thomas Barr of Hobsland Farm, once told us that he was trying to breed "useful cows.", That is a worthy ideal for any breeder. It takes a great amount of perseverance and an overdose of common sense to develop and manage an outstanding breeding herd, but it can and is being done by leading breeders throughout the nation. However, we must never forgst that there is no hitch-hiking on the highway to success in breeding better dairy cattle. DAIRY AUDITORIUM .; '¦'; Afternoon H.L.

Our first speaker is a </seg>

Nebraska State Dairymen's Association ' ¦¦•¦¦¦••"¦ '.¦ . : . j- . : ¦ i ¦ .¦ very noted gentlemen who has to do with the regulation of quality milk as it is received in the city of Lincoln. It is quite a problem to control the quality of milk so as to satisfy not only the consumer but those producing the milk. Therefore, I want to introduce Dr. M. F. Arnholt of the City Health D apartment of Lincoln who will discuss the subject—"What a Milk Ordinance Should and Can Do". Dr. Arnholt— In this short discussion, I wish to define or make clear several points. Wherever the term milk is used, it refers only to that milk which is to be consumed as fluid milk. The discussion of manufactur - ed milk products is entirely. beyond the scope of this paper. When the term milk ordinance is used, it refers only to the United States Public Health Service Milk Ordinance which is in effect in about 797 communities in the United States. ' A milk ordinance should 'guarantee to the consumer a bottle of milk that is fresh, clean, wholesome and safe from a public health standpoint. . ....¦&gt;.• I believe the advantages of the standard milk ordinance are shown by the uniform established requirements and code on the farm, as follows: 1. Proper sanitation on tie farm. 2. Proper methods of handling milk on the farm. 3. Proper health supervision of milk handlers and animals. ; 4. A milk house of proper type and construction to handle milk. ; This farm supervision in he standard milk code seems to me to supply the missing link of enforcement to guarantee proper fluid milk. We now come to the three main points which an ordinance should do. '¦¦-.' -:' r .." '¦¦'. / ¦-. "¦ . . •; . ' . First: The question of Production. The health authorities should be satisfied that milk is produced on farms from cows and by individuals which are not dangerous di - sease carriers. Farm conditions should be such, and buildings such, that clean, safe milk can be easily produced. If the above conditions are satisfactory, a permit shou d be issued, allowing that farm to pro - duce milk for fluid consumpticn. The Standard Milk Code sets up the proper standards. Second: Plant Supervision. The Health Department should be interested in seeing that the </seg>
         <seg id="p228">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture plant meets the standards set up for both the health of employees and the proper handling in the processing of milk. Vat samples should be periodically checked and the quality of milk after pasteurization continually examined. Third: The Health Department should be interested in seeing that the consumer received a clean, fresh, wholesome, and safe bottle of milk. A record should be kept of every individual handling every bottle of milk. All milk consumed by the public should be properly labeled, so that every consumer should know the type and grade of milk he is receiving, and whether or not it is handled and processed by authorized individuals or corporations. We now come to the second phase of the discussion: What can an ordinance do? A proper standard ordinance can, with support of the market milk industry and the public, improve and maintain a quality milk in any community. In communities where the present conditions do not meet such requirements, gradual improvements can be made without undue hardships to anyone, if the standard ordinance is taken as a standard goal in the course of several years. This can only be accom - plished where an educational program and constructive criticisms are developed, and the enforcement placed in the hands of competent in - dividuals who understand all angles of the problem. This would nat - urally be in the hands of the Department of Health and Milk Inspec - tion force, no politicians. In this way only, a sensible and satisfactory method of handling milk supervision in the city can be maintained, which will be as free as possible from outside interference and pressure. In the last eight years the greatest improvement in Lincoln's supply of milk has been in milk sold as raw. Very little improvement, if any, has been shown in the raw supply to the pasteurizer. This is probably due to lack of supervision of the raw farm supply. The milk to be used as market (fluid) supply is not handled separately from milk for manufactured purposes. The operation of any ordinance can be established, so that the individuals receiving services should pay their proportionate part of the expense: the farm pays for inspection, the dealer pays for services (laboratory tests, etc.) and the taxpayer pays for protection. After considerable study, a change has been suggested in the present Lincoln milk ordinance which would help bring about the ideals set forth in this discussion and awaits the action of those con - cerned. If it is found that conditions are such that due to lack of cold </seg>

I cite this last statement to illustrate a cardinal principle in milk control; namely, that milk control is a living and changing subject and that the Health Officer should not be hampered in meeting these changes with new interpretations and regulations. : In conclusion, I dare say this discussion of what an ordinance should and can do is merely outlined and sketchy, but after all it covers only a few salient points jotted down by a busy health officer of only nineteen years experience. ' Mr. Pfeif fer then opened the meeting for questions and discus - sion, after which he introduced the next speaker, Miss Alice Yon Ber - gen, Manager of Roberts Dairy!, Lincoln. Her discussion of the subject "What the Milk Distributor Expects in Milk Quality" follows: Miss Yon Bergen— ¦ . . : "Milk is the lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows"; so reads the. definition of the United States public healtn service mi'k code. But to the city milk distributor the term milk includes a great deal more. Years ago when more than seventy percent of the population of the United States lived in rural districts, nearly every family owned a cow and the problem of milk distribution was simple. The growth of large urban centers has made necessary the development of the market milk industry. More than seventy percent of the population now lives in cities. And more than forty percent of the milk produced by 26,000,000 cows in the United States is used as fluid milk. Consequently, some length of time must necessarily elapse after the milk is produced before it is delivered to the consumer. Proper protection of the milk supply during this period is the job of the milk distributor. &#132;..'. ¦.:' Milk is a highly perishabl; food. It is a good medium for bacter - ial growth as well as a nearly perfect food for man. And because milk goes into nearly every home, :he milk supply is generally considered second only to the water supp y as a factor concerning the health of a city. • " . ¦'. / ••' ¦.;-"¦'"- ¦; ' Bach year progress is made in the : manufacture of equipment for the processing of dairy products. Proper and efficient operation of such equipment, well-trained employees, and daily tests by the control laboratory to determine the efficiency of methods used, are all a part of the well-managed milk plant. Modern dairy science has solved the problem of safe-guarding the milk supply against disease. Efficient pasteurization, generally considered to be the most powerful </seg>
         <seg id="p230">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture single instrument in milk sanitation, is intended to make good milk safe and to make possible a wholesome milk supply for cities. Pas - teurization, however, cannot cover up faulty methods of production and handling, nor can superior products ever be produced from inferior raw materials. Therefore, the moat important problem of the distrib - utor becomes that of securing high quality milk from the farm. Field men, trained in dairy science, work among producers con - stantly. They make inspection of farm premises, observe methods us - ed, and cany on an educational program. But much of the quality control of incoming milk must be carried on by tests at the milk plant. The laboratory is staffed with men who are trained in food chemistry, bacteriology, and biology. These men make examinations of milk by the Sediment test, the Babcock test, the Methylene Blue reduction test which indicates the approximate number of bacteria present. They also make microscopic examination of milk for bacteria, and the plate count for bacteria, which is the most satisfactory sanitary test known and the test to which health departments attach great importance. But the most important and most significant test in the selection of good milk, is the examination by taste and by smell, as it comes into the plant. Detecting off-flavors is a matter of practice and train - ing, and the good milk grader is one of the most valuable men on the payroll. Although the sense of taste alone actually involves only four sensations: sweet, sour, bitter, and salty, the combination of taste and smell can detect many other abnormal conditions. Every can of incoming milk is examined by taste and by smell before it is accepted. During certain periods of the year when poor feeding conditions cause much off-flavored milk, two graders are used, the second testing only the milk that has been passed by the first as satisfactory. Years ago the principal problems in selecting milk were the de - tection of watering, of skimming, and the use of chemical preserva - tives. Today the defects which result in milk being rejected usually come from feed, from the condition of the cow, or from careless hand - ling after milking. Feed Flavors are commonly caused by silage, rye pasture, and such weeds as wild onions, rag weed, and penny cress. Ropy milk has an unappetizing appearance. Uusually this milk can be traced to con - tamination by dirty stagnant water. Bloody milk is usually the result of an injured udder, and the milk should not be sent to the plant until it is shown by microscopic test that the condition has been corrected. Salty milk usually comes from cows in advanced stage of lactation. Fishy-flavored milk may also be produced by advanced lactation, from feed, particularly rye pasture, or from storing milk in rusty cans. Mastitis usually produces a slight musty after-taste. </seg>
         <seg id="p231">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Sweet curdling of milk it detected by sight. This condition may come from improperly cleanse a and sterilized utensils. Odors of ker - sene, gasoline, oil, carbolic acid, or chemical sterilizers used a short time before using utensils will affect the flavor of milk. Flies, straw, dust in miJk are caused by lack of protection. Smothered milk is caus - ed by putting the cover on th&lt;| can of warm milk. Cowy flavor comes from the absorption of barn odors, especially when the barn doors are closed and the ventilation is pbor. It takes only a short time for such odors to be absorbed by milk. Sour milk or clabbered milk result from high bacteria count, due to carelessness in the production, handling, or cooling of the milk before it is delivered. These are the principal defects In flavor and appearance which cause milk to be rejected at the city milk plant. By careful selection, the grader accepts only milk of a sweet, clean flavor; it has a low bacteria count; and is free from objection - able odors and flavors. Further examination of all milk is made reg - ularly in the laboratory, and tie record of the results sent to the far - mer to help him to locate the difficulties and to improve the quality of his milk. ; How, then, can milk whijh meets these requirements day after day be produced on the farm? Any producer, who will acquaint himself with the factors that cause d faculties, can uniformly produce milk that is acceptable. ' * Clean barns and premises are of great importance in the produc - tion of good milk. This does not mean, however, that a high-scoring barn and surroundings will na;urally result in good milk. High quali - ty milk can be produced in a poorly equipped barn; but usually when the premises are not well taken care of, the methods used are also poor; and milk of low quality tesults. If the cow 3 are fed in the barn, the most reliable protection frcjm feed flavors is to milk first and feed afterward. Dusty hay, silage, and other feeds are breeding-places for bacteria which easily gain access to milk. Strong-flavored feeds re - quire only a short time to impErt their flavor to milk. In this territory whenever there is wheat and rye pasture, samples of milk unfit for use come into every plant in tie city. If the cows are taken from the rye field several hours before milking, there will be no noticeable taint in the milk. Particularly during the past few years off-flavored milk from penny cress has beer a serious problem and a source of loss both to the producer and the manufacturer of dairy products. Only last week milk of very bad flavor came in from one of our producers. When our field man called he found that a lane, through which the cattle passed as they came in from the pasture, contained a great deal of penny cress. If the farmer will disc the lane, as was recommended, his off-flavor troubles will be solved. </seg>
         <seg id="p232">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Clean healthy cows are necessary. Since certain diseases may be transmitted through the milk from a cow, it is of the greatest impor - tance that cows producing milk for market should be free from di - sease. The Bureau of Animal Industry of the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture has recently announced that: "Every herd of cattle in the United States has now been tested for tuberculosis at least once. This assures the successful completion of eradication bo - vine tuberculosis from the United States." Already all states, except California, have qualified as modified accredited areas. Milk as it comes from the udder of a healthy cow is practically sterile. The next problem is to prevent contamination from external sources. There is real value in keeping the cows groomed by clipping the hair short on udders, tails, and flanks. Clean bedding and dry floors are important. The health and personal habits of the milk handler are important. To produce good milk all persons connected with its production and handling must be in good health and be clean in their habits. It is just as easy to produce clean milk as it is to be careless and depend on the milk strainer to take out the dirt. Certain types of strainers are ap - proved by health departments. But the main effect of straining the milk is to improve its appearance. Straining does little or nothing to improve its keeping quality. Milk utensils should be well tinned with no open seams. The tin - ware should be kept bright and shining. It should be rinsed as soon a3 emptied, thoroughly washed, scalded, and dried. The proper washing, sterilizing, and drying of the milk cans is the responsibility of the milk distributor. The cans when returned to the farm are practically sterile. Cooling the milk as soon as it is poured into the can is the next step. The can should not be kept in the barn. There are many satis - factory cooling tanks. Some are expensive; others are manufactured at small cost by the use of half an oil drum or a barrel, a length of pipe, and a few fittings. To do a good cooling job, cold well water must pass through the cooling tank on its way to the stock tank. Our farm service men have installed hundreds of such cooling tanks and will continue to install them wherever needed. Usually the necessary ma - terial is available on the farm. A clean sterile stirring rod should be used to stir the milk thoroughly while cooling. Except during periods of highly-flavored feed difficulties, about eight percent of the milk that is rejected at the plant is sour or clabb - ered. Poor cooling is the principal cause. Bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature and very slowly below 60 degrees P. Proper cooling of all milk would almost entirely eliminate sour and clabbered milk from the market and thereby add thousands of dollars to the income of the producers in this vicinity each year. </seg>
         <seg id="p233">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Covered trucks transporting the milk to the city plant in the least possible time comes next in the production of good milk. These then are the requirements for producing milk of high qual - ity on the farms—clean premises, clean healthy cows, cared for by men in good health and with clean personal habits, pure feed, sterile uten - sils, and proper cooling. If the producer will follow these instructions he may be reasonably sure that the milk he sends to the milk distribut - ing plant, will be accepted. :'.'¦' Flavor ranks above all other considerations in the selection of milk products by the user, and good flavor invariably increases con - sumption. Professor Mortenson tells of an experiment conducted at lowa State College. A group of fraternity boys were given butter scor - ing 93, when previously they had been eating butter scoring about 90. The boys were not told of the change. The first week they used about sixty percent more butter. The second week 90 score butter was again supplied and boys ate forty percent less. The third week the higher grade-butter was returned to the table/and the amount used again in - creased to the previous high level. Milk consumption has shown a decided Increase within recent years, but is still well below the amount required for proper nutrition. Improved quality of milk as it is produced on the farm, improved methods of quality control in selection of milk at the plant, and im - proved methods of handling milk in the plant, will result in a better milk for the housewife. Progressive quality control is the most impor - tant factor in increasing the consumption of milk, and such increase will be of benefit to the entire dairy industry. In introducing the next speaker, Mr. Roland Ramsey of Seward, Mr. Pfeiffer said, "A producer-.distributpr is a man who does the whole job. He produces and does his own marketing. At this time I want to call on Roland Ramsey of Seward to give us a few words on what he thinks milk quality should be." \ Mr. Ramsey- Today marks the close of the sth year of our experience as a pro - ducer-distributor, and while the five years is a comparatively short time to gain a lot of experience in thi3 field, it is long enough to have discovered a few of what we believe are fundamental factors in pro - ducing and distributing "Quality Milk". : First of all dairymen, and particularly the producer-distributor, should always remember, preach, and believe in the truth of this well worn statement: That MILK as it is drawn from the udder of the </seg>
         <seg id="p234">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture healthy, sound, properly fed dairy cow is the greatest single food known to man. Then, it seems and we believe, the first requirement in the production of "quality" milk is that the producer-distributor have a herd that is free from all disease and is reasonably sound. The reasons for this first requirement are too well understood to require further comment and most of us are willing to accept that point. We all appreciate the fact that the cows should be kept clean, and we also know that quality milk cannot be produced in a foul barn or stable. I do not mean to infer that the barn must be elaborate or impressive. It should be sealed, have a good floor, and be kept clean and "sweet smelling" especially at milking time. At Seward, as most of you know, we use the very low-cost "shed type" system. We find that it i 3 easy to keep our cows clean; and since only four cows are taken into ouv milking room at a time and are there but about 20 minutes at a time, our milking room can be kept clean and free from all odors. We scrub this milking room out after each milking. However, if you do not have water pressure and sewage disposal available at your barn, the use of plenty of lime on the floors will pass in good shape. All right, now we have the "healthy herd" and the "clean barn" — what about equipment and milkhouse or room. The milk room should be located where it can be kept clean and free from barn odors at all times; it should have plenty of windows, tight smooth walls and ceil - ings, and a well drained cement floor. Here water pressure of some kind is a necessity. As to equipment in the production of quality milk, we say that depends on the size of the business. The equipment, of course, must be clean and sterile, and since milk, as it is drawn from the healthy, well fed, clean cow, is already "tops" for quality, then the fewer steps we take and the sooner we can get the milk into the sterile bottles the better chances we have of maintaining that high quality. At Seward, where we usually bottle around 150 quarts daily, we use a "Surge" milker, carry the milk under vacumn into our milk room, filter the milk into the tank of a small wall cooler (using fresh well water in the cooling coils), filter the milk again as it leaves the cooler, and bottle out of the separator bowl ju3t as soon as we have a half a can cooled. In larger producer-distributor dairies the use of a bottle and capper is usually used. That, of course, is all right, but it just makes one more piece of equipment to buy, clean, and keep up—one more chance to contaminate the milk, and we are usually better off without it unless we are bottling well over 200 quarts daily. The big distributor who buys milk from hundreds of dairymen have their ex - pensive Clairifiers, Pasteurizers, areators, coolers, etc., NOT to im - prove the quality of the milk as produced by healthy, clean cows but to RESTORE the milk they get to as near top quality as they can get it. They do a good job of it, too, but cannot ever quite restore their milk to the quality the first class producer-distributor can turn out. </seg>
         <seg id="p235">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association There are four principle factors that govern the quality of milk and the price the consumer is willing to pay and I -will list them and comment on them very briefly. First comes FLAVOR, second CLEANLINESS, third SERVICE and I fourth CREAM LINE. . i ¦ ¦ ¦_¦• . • . ¦ • . In the matter of FLAVOR in milk, the producer-distributor has almost complete control and the larger distributor has but little con - trol. We can pasture wheat and rye in the spring but we have to take our cows off pasture by noon or 1 P. M., and again bring them in be - fore retiring for the night. When "penny-cress" starts to bother later, we are looking for it and move the herd to a clean field. We, and I am speaking of all producer-distributors, can watch out for rag-weed, etc., where the big distributor just can't do much about it but try to drive out the disagreeable flavors by areating, etc. We find that from cows that are too full of alfalfa hay at milk time, an off-flavor milk is produced. Too much: "sorgo is bad also. The perfect pasture seems to be Sudan grass and it just seems that one cannot get too far away from ; alfalfa hay, corn silage, corn bran, and oats, and have perfect flavor - ed milk, i In second place, I put CLEANLINESS. Just examine a quart each of the highest to lowest priced milk in your town and see if the price and the degree of cleanliness doesn't follow all the way down. In third place; comes SERVICE. People like to receive their dairy supplies at a regular hour each day, delivered by an intelligent, neat, business-like man. The "route man" means a lot to any dairy. Fourth, I place CREAM LINE. Dairymen have brought on them - selves most of the fuss and stew about cream line 3. To be sure the customer likes a decent cream line, but she is more interested in FLA - VOR, CLEANLINESS, and SERVICE. Before starting our retail route we figured that that was about the last resort as a means to livelihood. We anticipated several calls each day about this or that or the other thing, but so far, much to our surprise and delight, we go month after month without a complaint. j The amount of "grief", a producer-distributor has, depends pretty much on how well he follows the simple, little old rules I have been talking to you about. We find that the customer is usually a pretty happy, friendly person as long as the quality of our milk and cream really measure up to our standard and suit us in our own home. Mr. R. C. Johnson of Mead was then introduced. He discussed the subject "Milk Quality Problems of a Small Dairy". Mr. Johnson pre - faced his remarks by defining four kinds of speeches as follows: </seg>
         <seg id="p236"/>
         <seg id="p237"/>
         <seg id="p238">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture "One can be likened to a dog's tail — It is bound to occur. The second is like a cat's tail —It's fur to the end. The third is like a rat's tail —Because it comes to a point. The fourth is like a rabbit's tail—lt is only a mere suggestion." Mr. Johnson used his own experience for his subject matter, em - phasizing the fact that he was not a dairyman in the strictest sense of the word, but merely a one horse farmer. He said he had just finished his 15th year of selling bottle milk and had yet to have his first bottle returned as sour. Mr. Johnson reviewed the more important factors in the production of good milk as given by Mr. Ramsey and agreed with him that the cream line is far from being of most importance. He stressed cleanliness and sanitary methods as first at all times, and proper and rapid cooling in the second place. He cited cases where his milk had been prescribed for babies who were not making proper growth. He emphasized over and over that there was no need or excuse for delivering milk with a high bacterial count and said there was no reason why raw milk would not keep a week. He then exhibited four bottles of his milk which had been tested at the State Department. One bottle was 3 weeks old; one, two weeks old; one, one week old; and one, one day old. He explained that most of his cows were well ad - vanced in lactation and for that reason one could not expect as good quality milk as at the first of their lactation periods. He then read the report given him by the State chemist who had examined the milk for bacteria, sediment, and butterfat. The count on the three weeks' old bottle was 20,000; the two weeks' old bottle, 3,000; the one week bottle, 3,000; and the 1 day bottle, 2,000. No special care was taken in the handling of this milk but it was taken out of the regular supply. Mr. Johnson explained that his equipment was very inexpensive, prob - ably costing not over $15, and that any farmer in Nebraska could, ac - complish the same results that he had in the past 15 year 3. He deplor - ed the farmer who would come in from the field, jump off a tractor with his clothes covered with dust and dirt, grab a milk bucket from ihe fence by the water tank which has been washed in the tank, and go in to milk his cows. Mr. Johnson summarized his remarks by im - pressing it upon all those attending—REMEMßEß, YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL IN THE HANDLING OF MILK. Mr. Pfeiffer then introduced the next speaker, Mr. Arnold Witt of Scribner, Nebraska, who is a producer who does not distribute his own milk, but for a good many years has sold his milk in ten-gallon cans to a distributor. Mr. Witt's subject "A Milk Producer's Opinion of Milk Quality". Mr. Witt— A discussion of quality milk production from the producer's view - point may well cover four major factors; that is, the cows, the barn, the milking equipment, and the cooling of the milk. </seg>
         <seg id="p239">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association ; The cows should be healthy, good producers, and kept clean. They should be free from tuberculosis, Bang's disease, and mastitis. Pro - duction of the cows may be only an indirect factor, but it is important because of the known greater profit above feed cost with higher pro - duction. Profit above feed cost is an incentive for the owner to have more interest in his cattle and the quality of the milk sold from the farm. Cows must be given a clean well-bedded place to vest and then cleaned at milking time. 1 The barn should be well lighted, well ventilated, and clean. It is more pleasant to work in a well-lighted barn, and cobwebs and dirt will be more likely to be removed because they are more easily seen. The barn may be sprayed with a 1 percent lye solution (1 can of lye to 10 gallons of water), a cresbl solution (1 pint to 5 gallons of water) or with a good whitewash mixture. If you wish to do a good Job use all three with the white wash as the last coat. The gutters must be kept clean and the barn well bedded with good clean straw. Before milking the cows, either by hand or with a machine, the udders and teats should be -well cleaned either by washing or brushing to remove straw and dirt. Eech teat should be stripped two or three times in a strip cup in order to be sure there is no thick milk. These strippings should be disposed of outside the barn and not allowed to contaminate the barn floor or bedding. By all means you must milk dry handed. The milking machine offers an opportunity to produce clean milk only when it is properly cared for. Following milking, the milk should be strained, using a cotton disc strainer. I would suggest putting a clean cloth over the top of the strainer for two reasons: first, to break the force of the milk when pouring it out of the pail; second, to take out all the larger portions of straw and dirt which may have accidentally fallen into the milk and which may tend to clog the qotton filter disc. ' Milk should be cooled as quickly as possible after it is drawn from the cow and strained. If possible, a cooling tank should be plac - ed just outside the barn door so that when the first can is filled with milk it may be set in the cooling tank and started to cooling before all the milking is completed. Stirring the milk frequently while in the cooling tank will hasten cooling. The lid should be only loosely set on the can or the can may be covered with a clean fine mesh cloth. When milking is completed, change the water in the cooling tank or take the milk to another tank near the well to assure good cold milk. Mrs. Mark Pierce, President of the Lincoln P. T. A., was then in - troduced, and spoke on the subject—"What a Consumer Has a Right to Expect in a Bottle of Milk". </seg>
         <seg id="p240">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Mrs. Pierce— What a consumer has a right to expect falls under three general headings: (1) A wholesome, good flavored milk which has been hand - led carefully and delivered promptly; (2) A clean milk that is safe, supplied at the price consistent with a fair return to the producer and the distributor; and (3) An ordinance adequate to give protection, enforced by efficient officers and properly trained inspectors under the supervision of the health department. A consumer when 3he removes the cap from a bottle of milk ex - pects to find a wholesome milk with a good, rich flavor. Milk must taste and smell good and be free from dirt on the inside and outside of the bottle. In fact it should look and taste so good that no one needs to be urged to use more of it. Tim group may know the figures on milk consumption in Amer - ica ; to me the following are quite enlightening. Thirty million quarts of milk are delivered every day to the doorsteps of America. Twenty - six million cows produce this endless flow of milk. 170,000 people are required to make the deliveries daily. I am not trying to repre - sent 30,000 homes nor the organization with which I am listed. The handling of quantities of milk each day requires great care and rapid delivery because milk is perishable and easily contaminat - ed. To satisfy the customer the milk mu3t have good keeping qualities. Milk has been termed the "most nearly perfect food". In Amer - ica the dairy industry and the health authorities have worked to give the safest milk in the world. Milk provides almost every type of nourishment that is needed for the human body, giving 46 kinds of food substances in all. If you bought the foods in a quart of milk at a chemists, he would have to charge you more than $44.00 for them. You can have a quart of milk delivered at your door for from 9 to 14 cents. Here is another interesting comparison. We may think of milk as not much above the consistency of water. It contains 13% of solids by weight, which is more than is contained in onions, beets, pine - apple, celery, squash, or tomatoes. When we buy 1 pint or 1 pound of milk we buy more actual dry solid food than we get in 1 pound of any of the foods just mentioned. Since milk is such a necessary part of the diet of young and old, weak and strong, greater consumption should be encouraged by keep - ing the price at the minimum level consistent with good quality and a fair return to the producer and distributor. </seg>
         <seg id="p241">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association It seems reasonable that, in the future, public health officials will not grade milk on the basis of cleanliness and safety alone, but will also grade it with reference to its nutritive value for it is appar - ent that the kind of food a cow gets affects the nutritive value of the milk she gives/Therefore Grade A milk may sometime be required to have been produced by cows which receive at least a standard balanc - ed ration, so that the milk will possess the maximum food value. . It i 3 unfortunate that milk can be such an excellent food and at the same time be so dangerous if not properly safeguarded. Every year there are thirty-five or forty milk-borne epidemics in this coun - try according to the records of the United States Public Health Ser - vice. They occur most frequently in small market areas where sani - tary precautions in the production and handling of milk are not strict - ly enforced. Occasionally there is a milk-borne outbreak of appalling magnitude. Consumers are naturally greatly concerned over the possibilities of contracting tuberculosis, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, septic sore throat, or any other disease that may be contracted through the milk supply. Safe-guarding the milk supply is a municipal problem. If health authorities simply said to all people, "Boil your milk", they could not depend upon a sufficient number doing it to prevent epidemics. That is why most health authorities feel that pasteurized milk is the safest milk. A low grade, unclean milk will not become a Grade A milk through pasteurization, nor will pasteurized milk be safe if not hand - led in a sanitary manner after pasteurization. The word "pasteurized" on a label should be a protection from: communicable disease germs. Milk inspection has made progress. There is much yet to be done before all consumers have the benefit and protection guaranteed by rigid milk inspection and supervised and controlled by health author - ities.-- ' ' .

L. Severe, President of the Association. </seg>
         <seg id="p242">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Mr. Severe spoke briefly of the topics that had been covered and announced the meetings for the following morning as well as the banquet at 6:30. Meeting was dismissed. The Characteristics of A Great Sire and How He Can Be Used to .Advantage—E. E. Heizer—University ot Wisconsin Inasmuch as we discussed at some length the characteristics of outstanding sires in our first presentation, we will merely review them at this time. Truly great sires are very rave, and this condition will probably continue indefinitely. They can be identified by the un - iformly high records of their daughters, coupled with the ability of their daughters to stand up under high production for many profit - able years in farmers' herds. In addition, these rare sires transmit size, good constitutions, capacity of body and udder, and strong ud - der attachments. Quality, pronounced dairy temperament, and good feet and legs are also characteristics common to daughters ol great sires. One of the best indications of true greatness in a sire, however, is the performance of the daughters of his sons. Ordinarily, by the time we have enough information to decide whether a sire is outstanding, he has passed on to the butcher or his breeding worth has been impaired. Outstanding sires which are no longer capable of producing offspring are of no value whatsoever, and when one is contemplating purchase of these old proved i sires, he should do so with full knowledge of the sire's condition. Great sires may be used in various ways. In the past the service of such sires has been confined to one or two herds, and usually a very limited number of offspring have been produced. More recently bull associations have aided in extending the usefulness of great sires. In 193 7 in Denmark, there was developed a practical organiza - tion for more effective use of great sires by artificial insemination. By 1938 the success of this type of cooperative was assured and the first similar organization began operations in New Jersey. A number of states have similar organizations in operation today. Picture a county where 120 farmers are breeding 1500 cows to 6 proved sires of two breeds and you have a vision of the operation of the most pow - erful tool for herd improvement since the discovery of Mendel's laws in 1900. A description of these Cooperative Breeding Associations follows. ARTIFICIAL, INSEMINATION OF CATTLE Artificial insemination is not new. It is reported that certain Arab horsemen made use of it some 600 years ago. As much as 150 years ago, it was demonstrated conclusively that the mere introduc- </seg>
         <seg id="p243">, Nebraska State Dairymen's Association lion of the male secretions into the reproductive tract of the female will produce young in the absence of natural matings. In more recent times, Russia has been a leader in demonstrating the usefulness of artificial insemination with cattle. English workers have also made use of this tool. Denmark was the first country to set up artificial breeding rings in which the bulls were kept at a central location and the semen collected there and carried out to the differ - ent herds having cows to be bred. New Jersey has completed a year . and a half of successful operation of this type of breeding association, and two such rings have been in operation in Wisconsin since April of this year. What is an artificial breeding ring? ¦ As organized in Wisconsin, such a ring is a cooperative organiza - tion.of a number of dairymen interested in the improvement of their herds through the use of better sires than they could afford to own individually. ¦'. How is, one organized? Meetings are held to acquaint the interested dairymen with the problems involved and to sign up members. A temporary committee is elected or appointed to contact the breeders and sign up additional members, When a sufficient number of cows are signed up, permanent officers and a board of directors are elected by the members. These officers are responsible for the management of the association and its successful operation. : ¦ , How does it operate? i-. ¦&#132;,¦".'¦¦ . - . ¦ ¦" . . I ; A qualified veterinarian is hired, suitable sires are selected, jcentral laboratory facilities and bull quarters are set up, and the ring is ready to operate. \} '¦'. "¦'"':¦:'" ¦"'¦¦'¦ .'¦'':¦ ' ¦''/ ¦¦'¦ . . ' When a member has a cow or cows in heat, he calls the veteri - narian. The animals in heat are left in the barn. The veterinarian collects his samples from the proper bulls and inseminates all the cattle that have been reported in heat. k .The service fee of $6.00 entitles the owner to three services for any animals that require this number. I Advantages of an Artificial Insemination Association 1. It provides the advantages of a large herd for the smaller herd owner in securing services of superior sires. ¦ The smaller herd owner is usually at a great disadvantage in securing superior sires for the improvement of his herd. By joining </seg>
         <seg id="p244">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture an organization of this type, he is able, at a reasonable cost, to secure the services of good bulls. 2. Offers a means of sharing the risk in proving young bulls Even though the best bred young bulls may be used, experience tells us that some of them do not come up to expectations. In a ring of this type, any one breeder need have only one or two daughters of any one unproved bull, and his herd need not be ruined if a bull proves poor. Where an untried bull i 3 used on a whole herd, the owner often finds his crop of calves to be inferior. 3. Larger number of daughters for proving bulls. While we call a bull proved when he has five or ten daughters with records in one herd, we know that a large number of daughters with records made in different herds under different conditions of - fers much better proof of a bull's worth. 4. Proving sires at a younger age. Experience teaches us that bulls are usually 7 to 9 years old be - fore we have enough information to evaluate their breeding ability. In a ring of this type, bulls can be proved when they are 5 to 5% years old, while the good ones still have many years of usefulness ahead of them. 5. Better sires at no increase in cost. Cost accounting records show us that it co3ts from $50 to $60 to feed a bull for a year. In an association of this type a herd of 12 cows may be serviced for $60. 6. Eliminates danger of having a bull on the farm. Many dairymen count this a very important advantage. Bulls are always potentially dangerous animals; and especially where there are children on the farm, this i 3 an important consideration. 7. Disease control. Only clean, healthy bulls are used, and inasmuch as no cows are bred direct, there is not the danger of spreading Infection from one cow to another that we sometimes encounter in direct service. 8. Veterinary advice. In the course of the veterinarian's visits to a farm, he sometimes sees things that the farmer would not recognize until they become serious. The old saying, "A stitch in time saves nine", applies in the early recognition of livestock ailments. Then, too, in inseminating cows, the veterinarian may find animals that will never be breeders </seg>
         <seg id="p245">I Nebraska State Dairymen's Association !.' •¦.¦'¦¦¦¦¦¦..' ¦' ;Or that need some treatment to get them functioning properly. While ¦ he. does not have time to do the veterinary work on the farms of his members, his advice often jsaves a breeder considerable grief. 9 Pregnancy exams. The veterinarian -will make pregnancy examinations of animals :that have been bred. Occasionally cows are bred, and although they do not conceive, never come back in heat. The veterinarian will pick ,up these cases, and if they are not likely to become breeders they may be disposed of. In the case of all cows in the herd, it is worth a good deal to the peace of mind of the owner to know rather early that his cows are safely with calf. 10. Improved cattle in a community will attract buyers. Buyers will be attracted to communities that are using the type of bulls that will be in service in a well organized artificial insemina - tion ring. Some Requirements for the Success of an Artificial Breeding Association 1. Co-operative spirit in the community. While a breeders co-op may be very different from some of our organized cooperatives, It does require the full cooperation and inter - est of the members for its complete success. . i 2. Realization of need for improvement. When they realize the relatively low production of many of our dairy herds and the difficulty of staying in business with low produc - ing cows, many dairymen appreciate the importance of doing some - thing about improving their herds. In one Wisconsin county, 186 dairymen petitioned the county board to help them work out a con - structive herd improvement program. This county has started a breed - ing ring as an important step in their program of improvement. 3. Capable and informed leadership. Any organization of this character needs good leaders that have the confidence of the members. ; 4. Adequate membership (1200 cows) ( The successful operation of a breeding ring requires that 1200 cows be signed up before operations are started. 5. Limited membership area. </seg>
         <seg id="p246">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture A concentration of the members within an area, no part of which is over 20 miles from headquarters, makes for most efficient opera - tion. This makes for low travel costs. 6. Central bull quarters and suitable laboratory under a compe - tent veterinarian. This type of organization requires the services of a good veteri - narian with proper facilities for doing the work. Experience indicates that a trained and competent man is necessary to carry on all the de - tailed work involved in a setup of this kind. Central location of the bulls has been demonstrated to be highly important. The veterinarian can supervise the feeding, exercise and management which is so im - portant in keeping the bull 3 in good service condition. In an organization of this kind, usually three sires for each breed are maintained. One or two of the best proved bulls that can be ob - tained for each breed are highly desirable. Young bulls of outstanding breeding may be used along with the older bulls. The young bulls that prove good may then be put in heavy service and all members receive the benefits. While disease-free herds are not an essential for operation of a bleeding ring of this type, certainly any constructive breeding pro - gram will make headway much faster in herds that are healthy and free from disease. The veterinarian disinfects his boots and equip - ment as he leaves each farm so that he will not carry infections from one farm to another. Naturally some form of a production testing program in connec - tion with a breeding ring is highly desirable, and even though mem - bers are not following a testing program, when a ring is started every effort should be made to secure production records on cows in mem - bers' herds. An association of this kind offers possibilities for setting up an effective low cost testing program. The Nebraska Guernsey Breeders Association program for their annual meeting included the following topicsr "Results of 1939 I). H. I. A. Testing"—M. L. Flack, Dairy Extension Specialist, Lincoln In spite of the long drouth and relatively low prices for milk and butterfat, the Nebraska dairymen have made good progress through their Dairy Herd Improvement project. During 1939 the number of herds on test increased 45% over 1938. The soundness of testing and culling herds for more economical production becomes more apparent as time goes on. In order to meet competition and lower prices, the dairymen mu3t have more efficient cows. </seg>
         <seg id="p247">I Nebraska State Dairymen's Association j Of the 200 herds tested in 1939, 117 made an average of over 300 pounds fat. This is the largest number of herds making over 300 pounds fat for the past several years. 69 of the 117 herds made over 350 pounds average, and 24 of the 117 made over 400 pounds butter - fat. Three herds of the 117 made over 500 pound 3 fat. "" j Dairy Herd Improvement associations in Nebraska are largely responsible for the constructive building of better dairy herds. It is almost impossible to build soundly without a measure of some kind. Itjis the Dairy Herd Improvement Associations that furnish the meth - od of keeping accurate records on the dairy herds of Nebraska. On the other hand considerable responsibility rests on the breeder himself. He must not only have the guidance of the Dairy Herd Improvement Association records but he must also have foresight in selecting sires, in! growing the feed necessary, and in guarding against infectious di - seases which are present in almost all communities. .. | ¦.-.-.- .•,•... . ; .-. ¦. . . ¦ - .... .¦ .. -' I The Dairy Herd Improvement members of Nebraska have just completed one of their very best years. The herds that have been in Dairy Herd Improvement Associations for the past several years are largely purebred herds. Prom these herds will come the seed stock for the improvement of other herds in the state. The direct and indirect results of the herds now on test cannot be measured, but there is no doubt their influence on the improvement of the dairy herds in Ne - braska will be far reaching. . Aside from the 200 herds doing D. H. I. A. work in Nebraska, there are 23 herds doing official herd testing. As weather conditions become more favorable for the growing of pastures, roughage, and grain crops, D. H. LA. work will increase in Nebraska and do even more to improve the incomes of the Nebraska dairymen. I 23 herds on herd test— 1. Holsteins have 10 herds on Herd Test. - 2.

         <seg id="p248">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture NEBRASKA 4-H DAIRY CALF GLUB WORK M. N. Lawvitson, Dairy Extension Specialist Lincoln During the past year we had the largest number of dairy calf club members in Nebraska we have ever had. There were approximately 1000 boys and girls enrolled in the project, which is an increase of about 40% over last year. Nebraska State Fair A very creditable showing was made by 4-H Dairy Club members at the State Fair this year in spite of the fact that crop and financial conditions were about as bad as during the past few years. 106 ani - mals, representing the five major dairy breeds, were shown, which is 29 more than last year and 49 more than two years ago. While the number of calves exhibited was not as large as some previous years the quality of the exhibits was very good. We feel that a show should not be judged entirely by the number of animals exhibited, but we should consider quality as an important factor. Since financial conditions were such that many of the 4-H mem - bers could not purchase purebred calves, it was thought advisable to encourage the purchase of high class grades rather than inferior pure - breds. In order to encourage this practice a class for grade calves, four months and under one year, was added to the State Fair classifi - cation in the 4-H dairy division. This resulted in several club mem - bers exhibiting good quality calves, who otherwise would not have fitted and exhibited calves. The training and experience received by these club members was just as valuable and important as if the calves had been purebred. Demonstration Teams In addition to counties previously having demonstration teams at the Nebraska State Fair this year, there were several new counties represented. The quality of the demonstrations were excellent and covered a wide field in the dairy industry. The winning teams in each division represented Nebraska in the National Contest at the National Dairy Show, where they made a very creditable showing. Nebraska's 4-H Club delegation, comprising a dairy cattle judg - ing team, and two demonstration teams made a very creditable record in national contests held in connection with the National Dairy Show at San Francisco. There were 39 states represented in the various contests. The dairy production demonstration team from York Coun - ty, made up of Donald Tracy and Gordon McNiell, demonstrated steps in production of quality milk. They were the highest ranking regional </seg>
         <seg id="p249">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association team in production demonstrations, and each received a $250 college scholarship awarded by Mr. J. ,L. Kraft of the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Company. The dairy foods demonstration team, Charlotte Mines and Phoebe Sellhorn from Dodge County, placed in the second group. They demonstrated the use of sour milk and cream in malting tasty dishes for the various meals, from breakfast to desert for dinner. ¦.. ¦ Silver medals and imported Swiss Cow Bells were won by the dairy cattle judging team for being the third highest in the country on judging all breeds. Members of the team were Jack Paulson and Elmer Zeis, both of Valley, and Wallace Borman, Papillion. Paulson was the sixth and Borman eighth among the 51 contestants. Zeis was first in judging Brown Swiss, and each member was presented with an imported Swiss Cow Bell by the Brown Swiss Breeders Association. They placed fourth in judging Guernseys and Holsteins, seventh in judging Ayrshires and Jerseys. ADEQUATE HERD RECORDS : Mr. R. L. Holden, Guernsey Pieldman Lafayette, Indiana There are certain fundamental practices which form the very foundation of any possibility for success in the breeding of purebred cattle. : i First, and of fundamental importance, is the recording of accur - ate and complete data as to the health and the breeding of the herd. Without this data no breeder has anything. Without this data no breeder can expect the public to have sufficient confidence in his pure bred cattle to pay him more than a pittance above grade prices. A herd book in which there is a page devoted entirely to the life history of each female in the herd is the basis of these records. Slckne3s, dates of heat, dates of breeding, including day, month, and year and the name and number of the service sire, dates of calving, and the sex and identification of the calf are the data needed. A breeder and his herdsmen must acquire the diary habit and set down everything that happens in the herd when it happens. Given this fundamental data a breeder then collects a premium for his efforts, largely in proportion to the extent and thoroughness with which he keeps production records. In the Guernsey breed for years the public has paid handsomely for recorded production, espec - ially when made with daily milk weights and with a preliminary milking on test day. For years averages figured on individual sales and on all the sales in any one year have indicated the Guernsey cows with records and heifers and bulls supported by Advanced Register records close up have brought from double to four times as much money as have cattle unsupported by these records. </seg>
         <seg id="p250">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture There is considerable difference of breeder opinion as to jusl what form of Advanced Register testing is the most desirable. With - out question the glamour of the more or less high pressure 600 and 700 pound record has advertising value and sales value. Regardless of all the propaganda for herd testing and lifetime testing, the more or less unthinking general public falls easiest for a bull out of a 700 pound dam. On the other hand, anyone who has managed a herd care - fully over a period of years knows that there are two difficult search - es always on. The first is the search to enable the breeder to make up his mind whether or not his herd sires are transmitting the charact - eristics that he desires satisfactorily and to what extent. One record doesn't prove a cow. One good daughter doesn't prove a bull, but a lifetime of sound, profitable records and a high percentage of sound, profitable daughters doea prove something. The other search is for the individual cows that can stand up year after year under genuine - ly hard work and that have offspring as good or better than they are. These cows are all too rare. These are the cows that men search for. These are the cows that men pay in the Guernsey breed from a thou - sand dollars up for. These cows are only found and developed to the point of value by testing. In this writer's opinion the most sound and the most profitable scheme of testing offered by the American Guernsey Cattle Club is known as the Advanced Register Herd Test. Under this program a breeder agrees to test every cow in the herd that has not previously made an Advanced Register record. The fee to the Cattle Club for this is three dollars per cow per record. The monthly cost of supervision paid to the Experiment Station varies with the states from about five dollars per month to about nine. Even in those states in which the cost of testing falls into the higher bracket, for value received, it has proven time and again to be worth the cost. Daily milk weights are required. The fee and the application for entry must be filed with the Cattle Club at the start of the record. Monthly credits are returned to the owner and are published in the Guernsey Breeders' Journal. The advertising alone, which accrues to a breeder from the monthly pub - lishing of his credits in the Guernsey Breeders' Journal, is worth more than all the cost of his testing, to say nothing of the added value of his cattle and the greater soundness of his breeding program. It is not necessary when testing under the Advanced Register Herd Test plan to re-enter cows after the completion of one record. In the opin - ion of many this is unfortunate. In the opinion of others, who to some extent kid themselves into the idea that they can take short cuts, this is the main reason why they test under the Herd Test program rather than strictly the old line selective testing. Nevertheless, the sentiment for the soundness of life-time records on every lactation of every cow in the herd that is physically sound is gaining rapidly. Its commercial value accrues with time, and gradually rolls up tremendously, and its </seg>
         <seg id="p251">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association accrued value from the standpoint of the breeder who studies his breeding program and builds accordingly is invaluable. That our breeders are accepting this program widely is evidenced by the tremendous increase in Advanced Register testing in the Guernsey breed within the last few years. We are the only breed in America with over 1000 breeders testing. We have approximately 10,000 cows now on test. There is only one answer to this acceptance, the program is commercially sound. Annual Exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair Again an effort has been made to bring to our Nebraska State Fair visitors an appreciation of milk and its products as food. We be - lieve that the dairyman may be accused of too much modesty in state - ments pertaining to his product. Those knowing the chararteristics of dairy products realize that they have much more to recommend them than many other products for which national advertising con - stantly faces us through the printed and the spoken word. The accompanying photographs, we believe, give a good per - spective of the display but without color fail to represent it properly. </seg>

The thirteen in our group traveled in three cars, and stayed at cabin camps and hotels, whichever provided satisfactory accomodations at the most economical rates. The delegation lett Nebraska on October 15 and returned November 1. ! Needless to say, it cost a lot of money to send a delegation as large as this so far. You or the organization you represent contribut - ed liberally to help defray the expenses of this trip. We want you to know that your interest in 4-H club work and your contribution was appreciated by us. i The trip on the way to San Francisco with night stops at Laramie, Wyoming; Salt Lake City, Utah; Reno, Nevada; and Sacramento, Cal - ifornia, was of unusual interest to us because none of us except Mr. Scheldt had ever seen the mountains before. Everything was new and different. We were particularly interested in the range country, mines, smelters, oil refineries, the desert areas, the salt flats, and many other sights too numerous to mention. We were thrilled when we drove into the productive valleys of California after crossing the great American desert. The National Dairy Show itself was held in about the most inter - esting place imagineable on Treasure Island. After competing in the National 4-H Judging contest, we thoroughly enjoyed the Exposition. In the judging contest, the Douglas County team placed third out of eighteen teams. Ten classes of cattle of the various breeds were judg - ed. Our team placed high in judging Brown Swiss, was fourth in Holsteiris and Guernseys, and seventh in Jerseys and Ayrshires.

Respectfully yours, Wallace Bovman Elmer Zeis Jack Paulson Douglas Co. Dairy Judging Team G. E. Scheidt Douglas Co. Extension Agent My Trip to National Dairy Show On October 15, 1939, thirteen happy 4-H folks left Grand Island, Nebraska, on what was to be the grandest and most interesting trip any of us had ever experienced. We were on our way to San Francisco, California, to attend the National Dairy Show being held on Treasure Island. California seemed like a long way off and our eager faces show - ed that we were going to do our best to get all we could out of this trip that we had dreamed of for so long. Tho3e in our group were: Don Tracy and Gordon McNeill, York County; Wallace Borman, Elmer Zeis, Jack Paulson, and Mr. Sheidt, Douglas County; J. Merton Kuhr and Adrian Flynn, Washington County; Mr. Lawritson and Mr. Flack, Ag. College; and Mrs. Snover, Pheobe Sellhorn, and Myself, Charlotte Mines, Dodge County. This trip was to be especially wonderful to me because I had nev - er been out of Nebraska. Although Nebraska is the best place in the U. S. A. in which to live, I was anxious to see some of the rest of Amer - ica. I certainly was not disappointed. Sunday passed very quickly and at 4:46 P. M. I got my first view of the mountains. They seemed only a few miles away, but they were much farther than that, as I found out later. We stayed in Laramie, Wyoming, Sunday night and I for one did not waste much time in get - ting into bed. </seg>
         <seg id="p257">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Leaving Laramie at 6:10 A. M. Monday, we traveled lor some - time before entering the mountains that I had seen the day before. Traveling through the Medicine Bow National Forest the scenery was beautiful and we even haa a snowball fight, as it had snowed there recently. After passing several crystal clear lakes, most of which were frozen over the top, we were glad to be on our way to sunny Californ - ia where the lakes do not freeze. It was interesting to eat dinner in Rock Springs, Wyoming, the home of Rock Springs coal, where we passed several coal mines both coming into and going out of the city. [ Our party entered Utah 1 at 3:55 P. M. and traveled through beau - tiful mountain scenery all the way to Salt Lake City. The mountains were mostly of red clay and the sun struck them in such a way that it made them look as if they had been painted by an artist. : - ¦ ¦'¦'"¦ .'¦-¦'¦.¦. ¦ I ' ' I.caught my first glimpse of Great Salt Lake and Salt Lake City at 5:40 P. M. and can imagine how the Mormons must have felt when they reached, the exact spot on which I was standing. It must have giv - en them a feeling of peace when they gazed down into that serene val - ley with the great lake stretching out far into the distance. Although Salt Lake is the same, my view of the valley was much different from theirs. They saw only a green valley below them and they could only dream of a city planted there. I saw thousands of twinkling lights and broad paved roads winding down into the valley. It was a picture I shall never forget. Our hotel, called the Temple Square Hotel, was just across from the Mormon Temple, and the way the Temple and Tabernacle are lighted up is perfectly gorgeous. ..:.¦¦ J The next morning, bright and early, we left Salt Lake City as our plans were to make Reno by Tuesday night, and it was 500 miles away. During the morning we traveled through the Salt Plats of Utah, and also saw the Bonneville race track, where several 3peed records have been made. For miles and miles there were only two colors visible. The blue of the sky and the white. of the salt.. It was very impressing although I thanked my lucky stars I live in Nebraska, where the main colors are the golden color of the wheat and the green of the corn in the summer. All afternoon we traveled across the Nevada desert, where nothing could be seen for miles and miles but sage brush and telephone poles. Arriving in Reno about 7:30 P. M. after supper we visited some of the gambling dens for which Reno is famous. It was all very interesting, but gambling is not my idea of a wise way to invest one' 3 money. ' At 11:15 A. M. Wednesday we left Reno and took the road up to the summit of Mt. Rose, and caught our first glimpse of Lake Tahoe </seg>
         <seg id="p258">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture about noon. It is repetition, saying that this is beautiful and that is beautiful, but Lake Tahoe is by far the most beautiful sight I have ever seen. To look down from the road Into the clear blue of the larg - est mountain lake in America is a sight that almost take 3 one's breath away. I received my first impression of the ruggedness of the Sierra Ne - vada Mts. at this point. Having climbed up to the top of the mountain in order to get a better picture of the lake on my camera, I had started to climb down, when a root, on which I was standing broke, and I ar - rived at the bottom much quicker than I had expected and in a most undignified and unladylike manner. That is one impression I shall not soon forget. We ate a picnic lunch on the south shore of the lake, and there is nothing like mountain air to give one an appetite. Ours were as large or larger than those of our threshing crews back in Nebraska. After leaving Lake Tahoe we suddenly started to climb. Mr. Scheldt shifted into low and up the hills and around the curves we went, always climbing higher. In two miles the altitude raised 1200 feet which was quite a climb for people who are used to Nebraska's level plains. We arrived in Sacremento Wednesday evening and stayed at the Welcome Grove Auto Court all night. Ouv group remained in Sacremento all day Thursday visiting the California State Capitol Thursday afternoon. A park has been built around the capitol and it is very beautiful. The magnolia trees and the well kept lawns and flower beds were of special interest to me, but the capitol does not begin to compare with our own. It i 3 patterned after the capitol at Washington, D. C, with a huge'gleaming white dome and Roman Columns on all sides of it. The park around the capitol building provides a beautiful setting that is well worth remembering. We were also privileged to go aboard the Delta King, a river launch running on the Sacramento river between Sacramento and San Francisco. It was built just like an ocean liner, with a dining room and lounge for the passengers. Our whole group went down to the bridge at 6:00 P. M. to watch it leave for San Francisco. It was so large that it could scarcely turn around in the river, and we all mar - veled at the skill of the captain in getting the big launch headed down stream. Friday morning found us on our way from Sacramento to San Francisco. We were passing through the Sacramento Valley, which Is a very good farming region. All along the way were fruit orchards, truck gardens, and many different kinds of nut trees. Cattle and sheep also are raised in that valley. </seg>
         <seg id="p259">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association At 7:35 A. M. San Francisco Bay came into view, and I was very much impressed by the manyj different kinds of ships on the bay. There ¦were tramp steamers, freighters, tankers, and many small barges. The whole bay carried an air of importance and friendliness which was very striking. , We continued on to Oakland, where arrangements were .made for borrowing the equipment for our demonstration from Montgomery Wards. Our car drove onto the Oakland Bay Bridge at 11:10 A. M. and before us was our destination, Treasure Island, with San Francisco in the distance. Many thoughts went through my mind in that one glance. Of how Phoebe and I.had planned our demonstration on-dairy con - sumption, not daring to say out loud the one thought we both had in our minds, to win this trip to the National Dairy Show. And now we were really here and looking down onto the real Treasure Island. The Tower of the Sun and the Elephant Portals sparkled in the sunlight and gave the whole island an almost magic appearance. It took us sev - en minutes to cross the bridge, and in that length of time we could not begin to see all that can be seen from the bridge, but we had seen enough to give us an idea of what a wonderful place this was to visit, and I made up my mind to do my best to make Nebraska proud of me for sending me on such a wonderful trip. ¦'] After '.crossing the bridge and entering San Francisco, we drove down Market Street, the busiest street in the city. There are four street car tracks on this street, which is very unusal. I had never seen so many people before and so much traffic. I wondered what the people back in North Bend would do if we had four street car tracks running through our main street.. After considerable driving around, we located the Fielding Hotel, where our rooms had been reserved. By this time, Mrs. Snover, Phoebe and I had been officially christened, "The Women", by the rest of the group. "The Women" went directly to their room and stayed there the rest, of the afternoon^ unpacking and getting "rested up" after their trip. That night we visited the place that everyone who goes to San Francisco visits, Chinatown. It was very interesting to see the Chinese dressed in their native costume 3, although many of them were dressed in American clothes. We visited Chinese novelty shops, where everything imaginable was displayed/They even had some individual pearl salt spoons about an inch long. Also Chinese kimonas, jewelry, dishes, and chop sticks we're for sale. All of the time we were walking along the streets there was weird Chinese music coming from the up - per stories of the buildings, where there were nightclubs or restaur - ants. Chinatown is very hilly,-and the hills are quite steep. I started running down Knob Hill, which was a very foolish thing to do. Not </seg>
         <seg id="p260">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture being able to stop, and as it was three blocks to the bottom, I was a little short of breath upon reaching a level street. It seems strange that I always manage to come down hills and mountains much quicker than I climb them. After visiting Chinatown, we went back to the hotel, and wrote some of the many postcards on our list of: "Don't forget to write to me, will you?" Saturday was a big day for all of us. We took our first trip to Treasure Island. Of course, it would be almost impossible for me to describe the fair in detail, so I will just mention some of the many in - teresting things to be seen there. We took the ferry over to the island, and the view of the bay from the boat was grand. As we neared the island, everyone on the boat be - gan crowding to the front in order to get off in a hurry. It seemed as though everyone was just as eager to see the fair as I was. After passing the turnstyles at the gateway, we were officially at the Golden Gate Exposition. It certainly was a thrill to walk through the Court of the Seven Seas, with the giant statue of Paclfica looking down on us from the throne at the west end of the Court. Some of the other interesting places we visited were: The Federal Building, Livestock Barns, Coliseum, Tower of the Sun, Recreation Building, and many foreign country buildings. There are lagoons, lakes and fountains scattered all over the island, and the many beautiful trees and flowers make the island a place of rare beauty. There were also many airplanes flying about over the island, and as there is a landing field right on the island, it was interesting to watch them land. That night we ate at the Indian Lodge, which is located on the old naval station, an island just south of Treasure Island and almost di - rectly under the Oakland Bay Bridge. All of the Indians who are in the Indian Exhibit at the fair, live at this lodge. Since the head of this exhibit is a friend of Mrs. Snover's we were privileged to visit this lodge. My attitude toward the Indians changed entirely during that evening. I realized that instead of the tomohawking, scalping type, they were folks just like us, and some of them used much more perfect English than I did, and were also more versed in current ¦world pro - blems. After dinner we rode the ferry back to Frisco and took a street car to the hotel. I know now just how a sardine must feel in one of those cans. There is an art to riding on street cars in San Francisco. </seg>
         <seg id="p261">: i Nebraska State Dairymen's Association You have to learn how to breathe with your nose up against someone's fur coat or against the window pane. | Sunday was rather a quiet day, very little sight-seeing. We went to; church in the morning and rested and practiced our demonstration in the afternoon. Our evening was spent at the movies, featuring "Babes in Arms". Monday Phoebe and I gave our demonstration at the fair. Al - though we did our best, it wasn't quite good enough for our rating was inthe red ribbon group. There were some very good demonstrations given and I gained some very valuable information in regard to cook - ing with dairy products. ! Tuesday and Wednesday were spent in sight-seeing trips about the city. Being fortunate in having some friends who could show us around, Tuesday night we went for a drive up to Twin Peaks where we could get a view of the bay. That was the most impressive sight on the entire trip. To look down and see the thousands of twinkling lights of San Francisco and then to look across the bay to Oakland and Berkley. We could see both bridges, the Golden Gate Bridge and Oakland Bay Bi-idge, Treasure Island and Alcatraz. One can see for miles and miles from Twin Peaks, and everything seems so near that you could almost reach out and touch the bridges or Treasure Island, when they are really quite a distance from you. j Wednesday we visited The Persideo (thel largest army base in United States besides West Point), Cliff House, Legion of Honor, Fisherman's Wharf and Golden Gate Park. I was kept very busy trying to' see everything at Once. : - Wednesday night was the big Dairy Banquet given by J. L. Kraft. It;was the best banquet I have ever attended. Doris Jeanne Peterson, the world's champion marimbist played. She was excellent. Mr. Kraft must take a keen interest in 4-H boys and girls to do so much toward helping them. We 4-H club folks should be very proud to have such an important and helpful man interested in:our welfare. Thursday our group left San Francisco at 5:00 a. m. in order to arrive in Los Angeles in time to attend Kraft Music Hall on which Don and Gordon were to be guests. We enjoyed beautiful scenery all the way, the blue waters of the Pacific stretching out to the west as far as the eye could see, and fertile valleys and high mountains stretching out to the east. Arriving in Hollywood too late for the broadcast, we drove around and saw many of the places we had previously seen only in the movie magazines. . , Friday was spent in Hollywood. Six of us bought a map and went </seg>
         <seg id="p262">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture on a sight-seeing tour of the movie stars' homes. Visiting also Warner Bros. Studio, The Brown Derby and The Trocadero. Friday night was spent on another drive through the L. A. business district and also visiting the new Union Depot and an old Spanish Village. Hollywood and L. A. are all I expected them to be. I don't know why so many people are disappointed when they visit there. Saturday morning we left L. A. and headed east. Just outside L. A., Mr. Flack suddenly stopped his car and jumped out. All of us look - ed around to find the cause of the delay and we soon found it. A larger sign, reading: "Ail the orange Juice you can drink for 10c", had caught Mr. Flack's eye and he could not pass up such an opportunity. Everyone tried to outdo everyone else in drinking orange juice, but Mr. Flack broke the record by drinking six huge glasses. We continued on through Las Vegas, Nevada, and arrived at Boulder Dam about 4:00 P. M. Taking an elevator down to the base of the dam we descended 538 feet or 44 stories. It was quite a thrill to think that I was standing at the base of the highest dam in the world. There is much to be seen at Boulder Dam besides just the dam itself. The scenery on all sides is beautiful. About an hour was spent there and then we continued on to Kingman, Arizona to spend the night. Sunday we visited Grand Canyon and The Painted Desert. In the canyon walls can be seen almost every color imaginable. It was a very impressive sight. It is all the more remarkable when you stop and think of the thousands of years it must have taken the Colorado Riv - er to cut that canyon down through solid rock. We drove along the rim of the canyon for about thirty miles and could also catch glimpses of the Painted Desert every once in a while. After leaving the canyon, we came upon an assemblage of Indi - ans, all in their native costumes. Stopping to inquire, we were intovm - ed that they were going to hold a ceremony tor a sick man as soon as the sun went down. I imagine it would have been very interesting to stay and watch them, but our plans were to reach Holbrook, Arizona before dark. Most of the Indians in that section of the country raise sheep and make blankets and rugs out of the wool. They sell these blankets to tourists. That day I also had my picture taken on a bucking bronco. Sun - day night was spent in Holbrook. Monday morning's drive took us through the Petrified Forest and another Painted Desert. The Petrified Forest Is 160,000,000 years old, and the tree trunks look like huge pieces of Christmas candy that is all different colors. The Painted Desert is properly named. It looks as though an artist has just dipped his brush into every color in the rain - bow, and has tinted all of the hills in a remarkable color scheme. </seg>
         <seg id="p263">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Monday afternoon we traveled through Albuquerque, New Mexi - co, and stayed in Las Vegas, New Mexico, all night. Leaving Las Vegas Tuesday morning, we traveled north into Col - oi-ado, driving through Pueblo and Colorado Springs. There is a won - derful view of Pike's Peak from Colorado Springs. In Denver, we drove through the city park, which is supposed to be the most beautiful park in the United States. It certainly lives up to its reputation. The Mu - seum of Natural History, located in the park, was very educational. r From Denver our route took us north to Brush, Colorado, where we spent the night. Everyone was rather quiet that night, as it was our last \riight together and we were thinking of the good times on the trip. We all gathered together and retold all the things that had been done and the funny things that had. happened to us during the trip. Wednesday morning we left Brush about 4:15 A. M. in order to arrive in Lincoln by the middle of the afternoon. Nebraska was reach - ed about 6:00 A. M. Here we were back in our own state after two and a. half weeks' absence. Nebraska looked rather barren after the palm trees of California, but I felt very good to be back, and out of all the states through which we traveled we unanimously agreed that Nebras - ka was by far the best. We said good-bye to Don and Gordon at Fairmont and continued on to Lincoln, arriving about 4:00 P. M. after traveling 4450 miles without a flat tire or an accident. '"'¦¦¦ Back in North Bend again safe and sound, my head was filled with memories of the most wonderful 2% weeks of my life. It was a grand trip and a grand group of people for traveling companions. I made many new friendships which I prize very highly and will be for - ever grateful to 4-H club work for making this trip possible. So now it is: "Good-bye to San Francisco" and "Hello to another year in 4-H club work". • V¦¦•¦/. —Charlotte Mines j Dodge County ' RULES PERTAINING TO AWARDS MADE BY THE !

         <seg id="p296">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture HOME ECONOMICS PROGRAM WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13, 1030 MISS MARGARET FEDDE, Presiding The Thirty-Fifth Session of the Home Economics Section of Or - ganized Agriculture was called to order by MiS3 Margaret Fedde, Chairman of the Home Economics Department of the College of Agriculture. Miss Fedde introduced Mrs. Altinas Tullis, Music Di - rector of the College of Agriculture, who directed the group singing. The songs sung were "Joy to the World" and "Silent Night". Rev. W. L. Ruyle was then asked by Miss Fedde to give the Invocation. REV. RUYLE: Our Heavenly Father, we come before thee this morning with a spirit of gratification and humility. We are grate - ful because we have been priviliged to share so many blessings, so help us, we pray, to be grateful. We are humble, Our Father, because we realize that most of these blessings come because others have served Thee, because others have lived before us in such a way that good could be passed on to us. We are thankful for what blessings we have gained through our heritage. We are made humble because we realize how little we have done. We hope you will consecrate us to higher earthly tasks. We thank thee for the organization under whose leadership we meet today. We ask that our physical well-being be accompanied by - spiritual understanding and inspiration in this day when there is such need for understanding among nations. This can not be, unless there is understanding and goodwill in our own lives. May the approaching Christmas, then, control and direct us as we meet each day. In Thy Name, we ask it. MISS FEDDE: That makes me think a little of what I told the students this week, that though we may be discouraged we must seek inspiration which will guide us on and give our contribution to the world even if we do not have the money we would like to have. I believe it was in 1922 that someone made a study of those in WHO'S WHO and it was found that of those people Nebraska ranked not twentieth, or tenth, but third, in the number of native sons and daughters listed as being prominent in the various fields of art, litera - ture, and business. Only the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut exceeded the Nebraska number. The reason for this fine representation could not be because of money, could it? We can continue, I am sure, to expect fine men and women to be contributed from Nebraska to society. In the 70's and SO's we did not have even the money that we do today. I am sure it is the homes from which these young folks come that instills In them a great deal of inspiration and philosophy. </seg>
         <seg id="p297">Nebraska Home Economics Association , Recently when some South American visitors were in the city I heard this philosophy, "I am, now since I am, I can, and since I can, I must, and since I must, I will." ; ¦ This is the first time, I believe, in twenty-five years that we have met without Miss Mary-Ellen Brown. We are.very sorry to tell you that she was in a slight accident the other evening, but as she said, "Itimight have been much worse." We hope she will be out in a few days, and she wants to express her deep regrets in not being here with us 4nd we are indeed sorry not to have her with us. . I now/would like to present your president, Mrs. Gard. ; MRS. GARD: Indeed, I am happy to again have the privilege of greeting you and bidding all of you "Welcome" as we begin the thirty - fifth session of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. Can it be possible there have been Home Economics meetings of Organized Agriculture for the past thirty-five years? Or that this year is the twenty-fifth anniversary of Agricultural Extension? A quarter of a century and more! Yet, seemingly those years have passed in swift succession, each contributing its part to the development and growth of these two fine organizations. ¦What splendid achievements have been attained and what worthwhile undertakings have been completed are readily apparent when we review this period of time. To better appreciate the vast ad - vancement that has come about, let us recall some of the prevailing conditions of twenty-five or more years ago. ' Horse-drawn vehicles were the common modes of travel within our communities. Journeys of any distances were made by train. Auto - mobiles were still an uncommon sight. Horses furnished the motive power for nearly all farm operations. Radios, television, technicolor and talking motion pictures had not been heard of. Paved highways forming a criss-crossing network over our country, or air transporta - tion: of people and mail had not been thought of. Women's Project Clubs were not even a nebulous dream. : [Today, we can journey with speed and comfort in cars across the length and breadth of our land. A trip by train is the more unusual way of travel now. Tractors and tractor-drawn machinery are exten - sively used in agricultural pursuits. A slight turning of the dials on our radios brings us the latest news, timely information, fine music, entertainment from far and near. Technicolor and talking motion pic - ture fare accepted achievements. Airway travel has brought all parts of the world into a closer proximity. Project Clubs today show a steadily widening scope of varied activities. These are only a few of the things that have produced such im- </seg>
         <seg id="p298">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture mense and rapid transitions in the growth of our country, our nation, our people. Some modes of living have undergone changes. Even some of our customs and traditions seem to be gradually shifting to keep up with the current trends of today. However, there are certain basic principles that the passing years with their growth and progress can not change or alter. An abiding Jove for home and those dwelling therein, a wholesome respect for [he rights and properties of others, a genuine pride in an unsullied family name, an honest ambition to be self-sustaining, a friendly concern for neighbors, a loyal allegiance to the land, an unfaltering faith in God and His ways, are just as indispensable for worthwhile living now as twenty-five or even fifty years ago. The sturdy pioneers achieved such satisfying family relation - ships in their living and left to us a priceless heritage because they adhered to these principles. We, as the homebuilders of today, must inspire our youth to strive for and maintain these essentials for our sons and daughters will be the homebuilders of tomorrow. We would not have them lower the standard given into our keeping by our pioneer folk. "We have a charge to keep." As we together with our families attempt to enrich our family living thusly, I believe that we shall discover that we are attaining another goal, that of Effective Rural Living. Truly, the homemakers of today face a gigantic task, but with the extension service assisting us in innumerable ways, with timely helps and suggestions, and to wisely select worthwhile things of life we are accomplishing results. Through the untiring efforts of the extension people our homes have gained a labor saving device, an added comfort, a bit of beauty, fresh inspiration. Let us not forget those, who, passing us on life's highway paused for a moment to help us with our loads, before they journeyed on. We aye hoping you will find these sessions with the theme "Ef - fective Rural Living" of inspiration and help. As your president, I have enjoyed planning with the program committee, a group of women who have tried to arrange programs that will aid you and me in our job of homemaking and home building. I wish to express my appreciation to the women of the Extension Service, the Home Economics staff and the executive committee for their untiring efforts. I want to thank you women of the Home Ec - onomics Section of Organized Agriculture for the privilege of serving as your president. A word of praise is due the folks at home, your folks and my folks, who are carrying on so that you and I may meet here. </seg>

Some women have said that their husbands expect them to under - stand some of the problems that face us in the economic situation There is really only one person that we can call upon because he knows how to give this to us in a language we can understand and that is Dr. Filley, Chairman of the Rural Economics Department here at the College of Agriculture. We are very happy at this time to hear Dr. Filley talk to us on "Why Prices for Farm Products Go Ud and Down". Dr. Filley. WHY THE PRICES OF FARM PRODUCTS GO UP AND DOWN DR. H.c. FILLEY, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska j A discussion of why the prices of farm products go up' and down involves two distinct questions: 1. Why does the price level of favm products as a group go ud and down? • 2. Why does the price of specific farm products go up and dowB? It is well known that some one farm product or probably sev - eral farm products will rise or fall in price while the price of other products remain nearly stationary, or possibly move in the opposite direction. ' </seg>
         <seg id="p300">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I will attempt to answer the first question before discussing the second. The extent to which the general level of prices rises and falls is presented graphically in Figure 1. There have been three periods of very high prices in the United States since Washington was inaugur - ated president. The first period came during the later years of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and the War of 1812-14 between the United States and Great Britain. The second period occurred during the Civil War, and the third period during the World War. The graph indicates that the price level did not remain stationary for any con - siderable length of time. Prices fluctuated not only from year to year, but from month to month. Any period when the general level of prices is rising is commonly spoken of as a period of inflation. Deflation is best defined as any fall in the general level of prices. In explaining why the price level rises and falls economists sometimes use the algebraic formula MV + M'V 1 = PT. M = Money in circulation V = Velocity M* = Bank deposits subject to check V'= Velocity of circulation of bank deposits subject to check P = Prices T = Volume of trade It can be readily seen that if there were no credit sales or if all credit sales were settled during a given period, that the equation would balance. Payments are ordinarily made by money or by check, and the sum total of these payments necessarily equals the physical volume of goods multiplied by the price. If any of the factors on one side of the equation is increased, then some factor on the other side must be increased to keep the equation in balance. For example, if there is a large increase in the amount of money in circulation and the other factors on the left side of the equation do not change, it is very evident that either the volume of goods or the price of goods must increase in order that the equation may remain in balance. From this simple algebraic equation it is pos - sible to determine the major causes of inflation and deflation. I. CAUSES OF INFLATION A. An increase in the amount of money in circulation 1. Gold 2.

         <seg id="p304">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture discovery of gold in California and Australia preceded the price rise in the eighteen fifties. The quantity of gold in circulation accompanied the rise in prices between 1898 and 1910. The new gold came in major part from mines in the Cripple Creek district of Colorado, the Klon - dike, Nevada and the Rand District of South Africa. An increase in installment selling and extension of other credits undoubtedly aided in maintaining prices during the nineteen twenties. One reason for the very high prices of the Civil War period was the fear that the Federal Government would not be able to redeem the United States notes which it issued. For several months the "greenbacks" were worth less than 40 cents in terms ot gold and did not reach par until late in 1878. Since prices were quoted in terms of the depreciated paper currency they were unusually high. The phenomena which set in motion the forces which cause de - flation are the opposite of those which cause inflation. The more im - portant of these phenomena are given in the following list: IV. PHENOMENA WHICH SET IN MOTION FORCES WHICH CAUSE DEFLATION A. Monetary deflation B. Contraction of credit 1. Fear 2. Reaction from over-expansion 3. Change in policy C. A more rapid increase in the volume of business than in the volume of money (or use of substitutes for money) D. Crystalization of capital in unused or little used pro - duction goods 1. Railroads 2. Canals 3. Factories and other buildings 4. Equipment E. Reaction from speculation F. Payment of debts 1. Governmental .1 War .2 Extravagence 2. Private After the close of the Civil War the government began to reduce the volume of "greenbacks" outstanding as a part of its debt paying program. This increased the confidence of the public in the ability of </seg>
         <seg id="p305">I Nebraska Home Economics Association the United States to pay the vast Civil "War debt, and as confidence increased the "greenbacks" rose in value and prices dropped. Because of the rapid drop in prices, Congress enacted legislation forbidding * any further reduction in the volume of United States notes out - standing. ' Some periods of inflation have been accompanied by the con - struction of canals, railroads, factories, and other forms of produc - tion goods in excess of the needs of the country. This "freezing of capital" has aided in bringing on deflation. The real reason for this is that the production and transportation of good 3 is checked by using capital and labor to produce something that is worth less when completed than the cost of production. - .

         <seg id="p306">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The payment of debts Is deflationary, because the dollars which are paid to creditors cannot be used by the person who earns them to purchase goods. The effect is the same whether the Individual uses a part of his income to pay for goods purchased on the install - ment plan at some past time, or whether he pays an equivalent part of his income to the government as taxes and the government uses the money to pay for past purchases. In either event the money cannot be used by the man earning it to aid in creating a demand for new goods. The average rate of the rise and fall in the price of farm products varies quite widely from the average rate at which the price of goods purchased by farmers rises and falls. At the beginning of a period of Inflation raw materials rise in price faster than manufactured goods. Since farm products are raw materials,, they are among the first to rise. This gives farmers an increase in purchasing power. When de - flation sets in the prices of farm products fall faster and fall farther, and recover more slowly than the prices of most kinds of manu - factured goods. The rise and fall of the price of farm products, and products purchased by farmers during the years 1910 to 1938 is pre - sented graphically in Figure 2. The price of many manufactured goods Is fairly well stabilized. As a general thing manufacturers do not wish the retail price of their products to change. Since the cost of raw materials is much less in most manufacturing industries than the wages paid to labor and var - ious selling and overhead costs, a considerable increase in the price of the raw material can be absorbed by the company without chang - ing the advertised retail price. Even if the price of the finished product changes with every change in the price of the farm product U3ed in manufacture, the per - centage change in the price of the finished product is less than the percentage change in the price of the farm product. For example, let us suppose that corn enters into a finished product but that the cost of the corn is only 25 per cent of the total cost of the finished product. A rise of 40 per cent in the price of corn should result in a rise of only 10 per cent in the finished product. The average price paid for wheat at local elevators in Nebraska in 1919 was 153 per cent higher than the average price paid in the two years 1913 and 1914. The average price of bread in the United States was 69 per cent higher in 1919 than in 1914. In 1932 the aver - age price paid for wheat was only 41 per cent of the 1913-14 price, but the price of bread was 114 per cent of the 1913-14 price. Wheat, a raw material rose in price faster than bread which is a finished product. It also fell faster and fell farther. When the demand for goods decreases and a price drop is an - ticipated, the manufacturer immediately restricts production so that </seg>
         <seg id="p307">I Nebraska Home Economics Association supply will correspond to the decreased demand. He does not continue to produce hig-h-cost goods for which the market Is uncertain By reg - ulating the supply, he exerts a measure of control over the market For; example, the production of pig iron decreased from 36,415 000 tons in 1920 to 16,544,000 tons in 1921. The averse price of'pig iron in 1920 was ?44.47; lii 1921 it was $26.68 per ton. Production decreased 55 per cent: price decreased 40 per cent. Manufacturers re - duce their operating costs by reducing the amount of materials pur - chased, and the hours of labor hired. Usually some employees are laid off", and the working week of those retained is materially shortened. The employees bear a part of the cost'of deflation; by reduced hours of labor rather than by a large reduction in the rate of pay per hour. JThe farmer, because of the nature of his business, is not able to adjust production quickly to meet changes in demand. Agricultural production is necessarily a slow process. More than six months inter - venes between the planting of com and the harvesting of the crop Many things can happen in,six months. The 1920 corn crop was planted in the height of inflation. It was harvested when the country was almost panic stricken. The crop was produced when labor, farm equipment, food, clothing, and practically everything else purchased by the farmer were very high in price; in fact prices averaged higher, measured in dollars, than in any other period of which we have a record. In December when the corn was husked and ready for market, it was worth only one-fifth to one-fourth as much per bushel as was corn; during the spring and summer. In the spring farmers expected the price of corn would be relatively high the following winter. The time; of maturity and marketing was, however', so far removed from the time of planting and cultivation that conditions changed. The producer was compelled either to sell his crop at a low price or else place it in storage for an indefinite period with no certainty of ever securing a price that would give him a better net return. In the pro - duction of winter wheat the ground is prepared for sowing almost a year before the crop can be marketed and in the raising of livestock, the time for planning production until the animals are ready for market is considerably longer. The total production of any crop depends to a considerable ex - tent upon weather conditions, and farmers can neither control the weather nor obtain long-time forecasts which are reliable. They must base their production plans upon normal temperature and normal rainfall. The 1920 corn acreage was the smallest in any year since 1909 with but one exception. Weather conditions were unusually favorable that year in the major part of the Corn Belt. As a result the average yield of corn per acre was the highest ever recorded in the United States, and the total yield has been exceeded only once. Until farmers can control growing conditions they will be unable to </seg>
         <seg id="p308">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture control production. As a matter of course, a farmer can influence the production of any particular crop on his own farm by increasing or decreasing the acreage planted, by cultural methods, by applying or failing to apply fertilizer, and in other -ways. Natural forces are always at work. The farmers of the United States do not have a natural monopoly upon the production of a single product. The price which American farmers receive for the major part of their products is influenced materially by the volume of production in other parts of the world. This is particularly true of those products of which we produce an exportable surplus. Reducing the production on a single farm makes little difference in the cost of operating the farm but usually increases the cost of production per unit. A farmer cannot reduce his labor cost by "laying off" his employees, if the major part of the farm labor is performed by himself and his family. According to the 1920 census, there were only 36,199 hired men on the 125,000 farms in Nebraska. Labor costs, payments for materials, and even overhead costs on the average farm would not be very greatly reduced by reducing production to 50 per cent of normal. Because so small a part of any commodity is produced on one farm, the production of a single farm has no appreciable effect on pi-ice. As a result of these conditions, a single year of low prices has little effect on agricultural production. The farmer continues to plow and plant, to cultivate and harvest because he wishes to utilize his time, his farm land, and M 3 equipment, and there is nothing else that he can do. His fruit trees continue to bear and he is inclined to in - crease rather than decrease his production of milk and eggs. Nearly all farm products are perishable or semi-perishable. Fruit, vegetables, eggs and milk deteriorate very quickly in ordinary storage. Livestock can be kept on a farm after it is ready for market only at a heavy cost. The storage of such products as grain, hay, and cotton is expensive and such products are likely to deteriorate under farm storage. The farmer is practically forced to sell on a fast-moving market subject to rapid fluctuations. Among all producers he doubt - less finds it hardest to wait before selling until readjustment reaches the point where he will sustain the least loss. Prices of Farm Products Change With the Seasons The price of a farm product is usually lowest at harvest time, and highest when fresh supplies are most difficult to obtain. The av - erage price paid producers for wheat in September for the 16 years, 1920-1935, was 9 9.1 cents. The average price in May for these same years was $1,094 cents, and increase of 10.3 cent 3. The usual rate charged by terminal elevators for storage is one cent a month, or 8 cents from September 1 to May 1. The owner of the wheat must </seg>
         <seg id="p309">Nebraska Home Economics Association consider interest on investment; taxes, and insurance. The total cost of folding wheat in commercial storage from September to May is slightly more than the average increase in price during these 8 months for the years 1920-1935. The man who stored his own wheat in his own bin-on his own farm, or who owned his own terminal elevator and kept it filled made a slight profit from holding during these years providing he held every year. : ' , Corn varies slightly more in price from December to August than does jheat during the eight months following harvest. The reason for this is that corn ordinarily contains so much moisture when it is first husked that it must be kept in a slatted crib for several months after husking, or else run through a commercial drier before it is Placed in a bin. The man who stores corn on his farm is usually fairly well paid for the service he performs. Eggs are higher in November and December than in the spring for the obvious reason that more eggs are produced in the spring months than during the autumn and early winter. Since cold storage is a service that cost Sl money, no one will perform the service unless he can ordinarily secure enough more for the eggs when he takes them out of storage than he paid for them to cover all the costs of storage and leave him a profit in return for .his risk. Men who speculate by buying eggs and placing them in cold storage sometimes secure very satisfac - tory profits but sometimes lose heavily. Butterfat is another farm product that is lower in price duri - ing the season of plenty when butter is being placed in storage than in season of scarcity when storage stocks are being consumed. Hog prices average highest in August and early September and lowest in December. jConversely, many more hogs are marketed in December than in August and September. Hog prices are usually high - er in late March and April than in May and June when more fall pigs are being sent to market. Some farmers follow the practice of breed - ing sows for late in February or early March litters, expecting to market the pigs late in August or the first half of September at an average , weight of about 200 po'undB. These early pigs must have better shelter ; and more care than is usually given April and May pigs, but they almost invariably bring a materially better price. Hog prices also vary from year to year. A -period of heavy pro - duction culminating in low prices is always followed by a decrease in production and higher j prices. In pre-depression years the price of corn usually rose when hog production was unusually large, and fell when fewer hogs were raised. The explanation for this is that a large pig crop makes a heavy demand for corn. One reason for the present low price of hogs is the relatively low </seg>
         <seg id="p310">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture price of lard. The foreign demand for lard Is small and the American housewife is using lard substitutes. As a result of this decrease in de - mand, lard is literally selling on the bargain counter. If the women who live in agricultural states would use lard whenever the cost is less than the cost of substitutes, their purchases would have a notice - able influence on hog prices. It is impossible to tell you this morning about all the forces that affect prices paid for farm products. I have attempted merely to mention a few of the forces that are most important and to give some concrete evidence of how they affect prices. The price system is complex, because of the large number of price making forces, but in spite of this complexity it is possible to forecast seasonal price changes, and sometimes to forecast cyclical changes. Farm men and women are vitally affected not only by the prices which they receive for what they produce but by the prices which they pay for the goods they buy. They need to remember that if the price of the goods they buy is increased because men and women who pro - duce the goods work fewer hours per year than farmers work, and re - ceive a materially higher return per hour, that as a result the quantity of goods that can be sold is decreased and unemployment results. In a nation where the various workers exchange goods and ser - vices everyone is affected not only by what he does himself but by the policies followed by other groups. We are mutually inter-dependent. We need a greater knowledge of prices and of laws, rules, regulations and economic forces which affect prices. * * • MISS FEDDE: Do any of you have a question, one that may be personal to you, which you wish to ask Dr. Filley? From the group it was asked, "Do you feel that this four-year corn-hog cycle will be repeated?" DR. FILLEY: Why it will be repeated is in part due to the fact that we have government control now. We are not raising more corn now but we are controlling the price pretty well. That means we will not have very cheap corn. We wouldn't have the incentive to increase our production as in the early 1900's. We are not consuming the per capita hog or beef as we did in the years 1900-05. Why? I think the folks who do the buying can answer this. Some people would rather go without beef and buy gas, instead. The question was asked, "When will the hog prices start up?" DR. FILLEY: They will start up about in February. The season changes the hog prices. More hogs come in during March. Later in </seg>
         <seg id="p311">I Nebraska Home Economics Association April the price will go down because fall pigs will again come on the market. In July and August prices usually go up. I raise hogs on my farm in Gage county and we expect to sell before the middle of September at about 200 pounds each and six months old. We did not get the high price this year. The crop last year in the spring was large. We sold just before the prices went up. August pigs will sell in March. We have found it worth the money to have early season hogs. We expect a large crop next spring. Until there is no longer a surplus of corn, I am not looking for the price of hogs to be as high as I would like to see it. • MISS FEDDE: We have heard a lecture similar to what your sons and daughters get at the College and'your husbands hear else - where; and you can understand what they are talking about now that we have heard Dr. Filley.

Mr. Barager of the Housing and Equipment Department will tell us about his department's exhibit. MR. BARAGER: While in most Agricultural Experiment Stations Home Economics research is being limited to one field, namely, foods and nutrition, we have in active progress at this experiment station re - search in three fields: foods and nutrition, family relationships, and household equipment. Poods and nutrition is a very large field and work is usually limited to some specific phase of the field. Here the work is being limited to human nutrition. In the division of human nutrition a study is being made of the requirements for growth of bone and muscle dur - ing late adolescence. For this a hundred girls, most of them Home Economic students, are being studied. The results of the research are not yet ready for publication. In the division of Family Life, two problems are being investl- </seg>
         <seg id="p313">Nebraska Home Economics Association gited. Assuming that one of the most important functions of family life is to produce well adjusted and socially useful individuals, one purpose of our family life research is to try to discover and describe some of the conditions, customs and patterns of family life which in - fluence; for good or ill the personality development of children. An - oi;her main problem is to determine some of the combinations of per - sonality traits and characterisics in husband and wife which are favor - able for the establishment of a happy and successful family life. In the division of Household Equipment, investigations are at p-esent being made of gasoline stoves and small electrical food mixers. \^e are studying the performance of gasoline stoves by determining the heat transfer efficiency of the cooking top burners, by finding the heat distribution and heat loss of an ;oven, and by analyz - ing the combustion products for carbon monoxide, to cite only a few tests. The food mixers are being studied to find changes that will im - prove their ability to whip, beat, mix and mash different foods. Our exhibit, in front of the door as you come in, is an attempt to show what kind of work has been and is being done in the various flilds. We cannot attempt to display very many results. We have fast - ened to the table some bulletins and circulars covering work done in tie past few years. We invite you to glance at these publications to see more in detail what problems have been investigated. If at any time we can be of any help in any of your problems tl !at would fall in our respective field, we would be very glad to have you write to us for information or call at our laboratories.

These exhibits are to be found on the tables as you come into the room. I thank you. MISS FEDDE: Thank you, Miss Smith. Now I would like to just say something about research in home economics. In agriculture we have had research for fifty years, and as a result we hear much about pastures, soil conservation, crops and livestock feeding. The research in home economics is just about ten years old and so we do not have as much available. Just give us fifty years and see what we have, but we want to benefit families in Nebraska as we go along. Mis. Tullis, could we have just a little singing at this time? Mrs. Tullis led the group singing of the following—"America", "Home on the Range". MISS FEDDE: What would we do without Mrs. Tullis? She adds so much enthusiasm to our group singing. We have a treat in store for us. My. Thomas P. Wilson comes to us through the courtesy of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Corporation. They lend him to us. The folks who have attended Western Nebraska Organized Agriculture during previous years tell us how he has thrilled and inspired them and they always want him to come back. We are very happy to have with us, Mr. Wilson: MR. WILSON: Madam Chairman and Leaders: It is extremely pleasant to be with you this morning and have a part in the program. You will wonder about my strange manner of talking. You see, I was born in Australia. It 13 the best I can do, as I can never get Australia quite off the end of my tongue. It has been my privilege to travel in this great land from Cana - da to the lower part of the Mississippi and from the eastern boundary to the beautiful western shores of these United States. While travel - ing over this great area I have seen many types of people and I want to weave Into my tapestry a pattern of the people I have found on the ranches and farms. I want the Maxfield Parrish blue and the pathos of the everyday life of people. The blues should be crossed with the browns of the commonplace. Traveling over the west in the footprints of pioneers, I have the firm conviction that these have been gallant soldiers of the soil. Ou* on the plains and in the hills with the trail of the Indians ever about them, I think of those soldiers of the soil who stayed on the job and performed their tasks. Here is a Charm Strip. I like to take it with me for I find that many do not know of this custom of our pioneers. One lady told me </seg>
         <seg id="p315">¦¦ /¦ _ ¦ ¦¦-. ... ¦ • • ¦ ¦ ¦(.. Nebraska Home Economics Association hat there were 999 buttons on this strip. Frequently, these Charm Strips brought the only touch of beauty to these crude homes. The 16ther day I stopped beside the first sod house that I have ever seen hat wasn't plastered over with plaster. An old man of ninety-six told me this story. Once as he came own into a canyon he saw a "soddie" before him, upon the roof of |hich were two children screaming at the top of their voices. As he approached, a woman met him as she came in from the potato field with a rifle. What were the children doing up there? "I lost my man and the children are up there to warn me while I dig potatoes." I have appreciation for those women who lived in these "soddies" and raised I children. I want to weave some of this into my tapestry. A Custer County man told me that it was hard to keep going tack in the old days and how hard to was to feed 230 chickens they lad one year. He told of taking those 230 chickens 80 miles to Grand I3land and getting only a cent a piece for them. He had to take the two dollars and thirty cents out in groceries. "I hated to go home," he s»id, "My sister needed shoes, and my mother had planned great things to do with money we expected to get." We think times are difficult today, but let us remember the hardships of these hardy pioneers. An old lady came to me once offering me a bedspread made eighty yjears ago. She sent it to me, and this is her story. Her grandmother grew the sheep, washed the wool and dyed the thread and wove the spread. No one on earth can picture the labor, or details, that are woven into her tapestry. I weave into my tapestry my admiration of this wo - man who did these things. The Indians were their friends, but sometimes they were their c lemies. I have in my collection of stories a story of &amp; gray-haired old woman! who told me how the Indians would come every Saturady nqrning and would\ sit in the kitchen until the baking came out of the oven and demand the larger portion of it. "One day I didn't give the baking to them," she said, " and I chased them out." It was risky. As they left a squaw shoved into her hands a little papoose and told hsr to keep it. She said," I took good care of it night and day, because wje knew it would be too bad for us if anything should happen to the lidian; child." The next weok when they came back she gave them all of the baking and the papoose. These are the very threads of life tl at we have from our ancestry out on the plains. In! Wyoming a lady gave me this story. The pioneer shacks up tlere were made of slabs of wood and quite frequently were pretty rickety. Into one of ithese one winter evening some strangers came. Oht in it ( would take a, lot of fuel to keep warm in one of these flimsy structures the wind would shake. During this night one stranger heard a chopping sound. Upon investigating, he found in the </seg>
         <seg id="p316">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture lean-to an eight-year old boy was chopping at a frozen carcass of beef to cut off some food so that these strangers might eat. They shared what they had, these soldiers of the sod. I heard a story in the plains regions of Colorado that once there was heard shouting and shooting in the distance and it was found that a traveling saw-mill company had been attacked by the Ute Indians. They found that the men and women had been killed, but there was a r little child captured by the Indians. Knowing that the Utes never hurt children, the men followed the Utes for days hoping they might drop the baby. One day they stopped and discovered in the reeds a three - year old child. They took her to the then village of Denver. Thirty-three years later one of the men told this story to a reporter and a grand - mother in California read the story and learned the name 3 of the men who rescued her so long ago. She wrote this man and thanked him for saving her life. It was this that had happened so long ago made it live again. In Idaho a woman told me of the Hospitality String her mother had. Food and shelter would be given willingly to passers-by and a woman would not accept pay for this, but sometimes would mention the Hospitality String to -which the guests might add from -wagon sup - plies. Sometimes she would give an idea as to what they might put on there. Perhaps it would be a pot or pan, or even an old dress to be fixed over. In the early days o! Pueblo a trader settled and established a strange home. A 49'er on his way to California, stopped at the house his horses and chickens about dead, and his wife discouraged. He traded his horses for fine horses, and left his wife. The trader and the wife he got by trade, lived there ever after, as far as I know. South of Pueblo is a mountain, Watheno, and it is also called "Little Orphan." Loneliness is the thing people in this part of the coun - try had to fight. Once each year they would get together to tell all the scandal and bake the bread for the rest of the year. One old Spanish mother would grind the grain and certain other old ladies would pre - pare for the baking. The oven was an adobe beehive affair and would be wiped out with a turkey wing this one time a year that it was used. The bread was left in the oven for twenty-four hours and taken back to the ranches and could be eaten as long as a year later. It would have to be broken with an ax, but the inside would be good to 'eat. This is the way these soldiers of the sod would break the loneliness which surrounded them on the plains. One man told me of seeing a raft on the Platte river back in the early days and upon this raft was a little hoy and girl of five and seven years. Their parents and they had been on the road to Oregon and while they were camping along the Platte the children </seg>
         <seg id="p317">, Nebraska Home Economics Association Played down by the river. They heard shouting and shooting and looked through the rushes and saw their mother and father shot down. There was terror in their hearts, but the little boy made a raft and they drifted down the river. The man took them to St. Joseph where some Catholic sisters took care of them. I weave this story into my tapestry. . I think of the fathers arid mothers who left fine homes and braved the hazards of pioneer life, who went over the hill into oblivion \n order to give their children a chance. If necessary, I believe, the fathers and mothers today would do the same. I weave into my tap - estry my admiration for these people. I 1 have a diary of a Belgian Jesuit, called Black Robe, who came up the Platte. He tells of meeting 10,000 Mormons. Their leader told the priest they did not know where they were going, but the place had been revealed to him in a dream. The priest told him of the great Salt Lake and they went there. He said, "I am not a prophet, but as I have seen the Platte, I know there shall come a time when the hun - dreds in Europe shall come here. This great plain will be under the protection of the church and people shall live here in peace and security." As I see lovely cities like this one and small villages and townsj I see that which has been hoped for has been accomplished. So I weave into my tapestry this story of a land where those from all lands and of all creeds live side by side as friends. Once, while in El Paso I was astonished to see high up on the mountain a great white painted cross. Each year the Catholic people hold a pilgrimage up to the cross. I found that it is called, "Christ the King". I climbed up this mountain and as I stopped at each station of the i cross my mind went back to Jerusalem, and I thought, "What a fine place this America'really is". It isn't like this in the Holy Land. In Jerusalem the streets are filthy and muddy. I have seen Christian women; kneel in the mud and the Arabs would spit on them. Oh, but in Texas I thought, what a grand place this America is. On the top of the :hill was this great, shining cross with Mexico on one side and the United States oh the other. I thought what a great thing to have between these two countries, just a cross on a hill.

         <seg id="p320">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and got very sick. I ate a hamburger and became sick for about three days. I felt much better on land. We sailed on the Queen Mary. My cabin was filled with letters, cards and greetings from over the state. I wasn't able to read them when two days out. One lady wrote that we had received rain since I left home and that was the best news I could hear. It was a nice trip across the water. I had as cabin mates a lady from Canada and another from Missouri. Our first day in England was Memorial Day and we didn't attend the meeting of the Conference, but went to St. Margaret's church, for the memorial services for World War soldiers. We later went through Westminster Abbey. We were taken on shopping trips and on sight - seeing trips and were told about the organization of women as it is in England. One trip was to Windsor. We saw Lord Astor who gave a talk. It was the largest home in England we visited. The college boys were out for the first day of vacation. I don't believe there are more beautiful flowers anywhere than in London. Especially do I remember the white poppies, rhodendrons, buttercups and tor-get-me-nots even in the pastures. We saw the smallest house in London, just a door and window above on the next floor. "We had a party at St. James Palace. Our invitation read to come to the Palace in evening dress and with jewelry on and to what door to come. It was just impossible to take in all of the events. On Sunday Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford invited us to visit their Institute. One hundred and fifty American ladies were taken out there. Busses took and unloaded us at the barns. From there we walked over the cobblestones. They keep 7 or 8 hogs in a pen. They are sent to be butohered when weighing 210 pounds as they might shrink and they must weigh 200. They raise "bacon" and the hog 3 are butchered so as to give more bacon. Lord Perry conducted us through the house. They were at that time ready to take 32 children from the London schools. The plan was for every ten children to have a teacher. The wine cellar had been prepared for use as an air raid shelter. The farms just seemed to raise one thing, just cattle, or just bean 3, or cabbage. Mr. Ford was trying on his farm to show how to raise enough variety to sustain a farm family and to introduce this idea in England. One day I spent at the Catalonia markets, going out by train. We saw some pitifully poor people and beggars. On one of my shopping trips I wanted to see a Woolworth store. At the hotel they told me it would be a fifteen minute walk. It wa3 painted just like ours at home, and a great many things were from America. I found that the charge of bus fare was only a penny back to the hotel, but while wait - ings little fellow told me it wasn't worth a penny and directed me to the hotel. I thought afterward that it would have been worth a penny to ride. </seg>

         <seg id="p322">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture TAILORED AND RUFFLED CURTAINS 4-H DEMONSTRATION KATHLEEN: Good afternoon, folks. We are the members of the Wide Awake Girls Room Club of Elkhorn, Nebraska, which consists of twelve members. Our leaders are Mrs. Roy Johnson and Mrs. John Bull. We have a music leader, Mrs. K. Magnusson. My teammate, Loretta Claussen, and I, Kathleen Magnusson, have been in club work for five years, and each year brings new and better ideas. We have found this year's project, "The Girls Room, a Place to live," to be interesting as well as instructive. We have made patchwork pillows stitched by hand, and window curtains. We have re - finished a piece of furniture and arranged a dressing center. Any girl may be happy and proud if she has a room she enjoys, especially if it is the result of her own planning and workmanship. We have chosen for our demonstration the making of tailored and ruffled curtains, for we feel they play a very important part in the furnishing of a girl's room. Window curtains are used for these rea - sons: (Card Displayed) By making our own curtains, we save money and they will fit the windows for which they are made. We feel sure that the workman - ship will be superior to that of curtains purchased at a store, and what a joy we feel when we see something of our own planning and handwork. We will show you how to make tailored curtains, a curtain with ruffles and one type of tie-back. Loretta will show you how to make tailored curtains. LORETTA: I have selected dotted marquisette for the tailored curtain we will make. Other types of material suitable for curtains are voil, marquisette, net, scrim, unbleached muslin, and batiste. Before we make our curtains, we must measure the window to determine the amount of material needed. Here on thi3 model of a window we will show you. Use a yardstick and measure so the cur - tain covers the top of the casing and extends to the bottom of the apron or the length desired. The window for which this curtain is made is 12 inches long. We will allow 3% inches for the hem on either end, making 7 inches; also 2 Inches for shrinkage, which makes our mater - ial 81 inches in length. Therefore, we shall need 162 inches, or 4% yards plus % yard for tie-backs, making 5 yards the necessary amount of material for one pair of finished curtains.. This material is 40 inches in width. The selvages on both sides are trimmed off because they are un - attractive and likely to draw into puckers when sewed or •washed. </seg>
         <seg id="p323">Nebraska Home Economics Association ¦.!'¦¦''¦¦¦•" ¦¦'¦: • ; '¦":'¦¦¦ Both sides of the curtain will have an equal hem of 1 inch. The top and bottom will also have equal hems of 3 inches. This is an advantage | because the curtain can he turned top to the bottom by removing the 'stitching for the casing and placing it in the bottom hem. By turn - ing the curtain in this manner, its life.is increased because everyone knows the part the sunlight strikes wears out sooner. Put in the side hems first. In measuring tor the side hems, we will measure with our rulers and mark first 1 inch, than a second inch, iAs we turn this, bur hem will be double and the raw edges will not show when the light shines through. In dotted marquisette, as thi3, if the dots run straight, we can fold on them. When sheer ma - terials are used, the two curtains for each window should be about twice the width of the window to allow for fullness. If the material is heavy, 1% times is plenty. Skimpy curtains are unattractive. Our curtains are twice the width of the windows. All hems are basted and then stitched on the machine. We will baste 1 only. We shall place in our top and bottom hems, First, make a turji % inch, then 3 inches as measured with our ruler. The cas - ing should 'be wide enough to slip easily over the rod. Our casing will be 1 inch wide. An excellent devise to save the rod from catching the material when running it through the casing is to slip an old dress belt or finger from an old glove bver the sharp end of the rod. When stltcning on the machine, stitch back an inch from each end to secure the thread ends. Clip close to the material. Here is the other half of the curtain I have made at home. Kathleen will proceed with the ruf - fled curtain and tie-backs. KATHLEEN: The ruffled curtain is more frilly and will suit the type of girl who likes frilly things. As our ruffles will be 2% inches wide when finished, we Bhall need to cut strips 3 inches wide, allowing % inch for hem and ii inch for fastening to the curtain. It is best jto cut on drawn or measured line so as to keep edges true for hemming, but on this material we can follow dots. ; i . ¦.¦¦.' . . ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ .. ¦ We shall allow 1 and 1-3 yards of material for each yard of fin - ished ruffle. For fuller ruffles, allow up to 2 yards of material for 1 yard jof finished ruffle. I have here measurements to determine the amount of material for your curtain. : i ¦ ¦ ...¦.....¦ . -. In joining the strips of material, use tiny french seams. I have hemmed the ruffles at home and also gathered it % inch from!the edge. lam ready to join the ruffles to the curtain. This goods, 81% inches long, has been cut to fit a certain window. The selvages have been removed. A felled seam is a good finish and is one which we will use. To do this, lay the right side of the ruffle to the right side of the curtain with % inch of the curtain extending. Pin and baste iii place. </seg>
         <seg id="p324">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Then stitch on the machine on basted line. To finish lay flat and turn under raw edge. This is again machine stlched, making It secure. On this curtain, the ruffle extends down the inside edge and across the bottom. This end is hemmed. After the ruffle has been sewed in place, finish the top in the same manner as the tailored curtain. Many people use tie-backs to clear the window for a better view, and to add grace to the curtain. They should be long enough so that the line of the curtain will in general follow the line of the window. They should be placed low enough so that they are In pleasing pro - portion to the length of the curtain. Twelve inches from the sill Is the general rules for the average window. Ruffled tie-backs are used with ruffled curtains to maintain harmony. The tie-backs I am going to make are shaped and are ones suitable for tailored curtains. I will cut a paper pattern. I have here a piece of paper 20 inches long and 5Vi inches wide. I will fold it in the center. Measure 4% inches from curtain bottom; draw shaped line to outside top corner. Measure down 2 inches and draw to lower center. Then cut along lines. This tie - back has been cut at home and allowance has been made for seams. It should be sewed on the machine % inch from the edges, having one end open for turning to right side. This should be finished by hand. Here is the finished tie-back. A small loop of material is used to fasten the tie-back to the edge of the casing. An excellent device to secure the tie-backs to the casing is a small screw hook. Loretta will conclude our demonstration. LORETTA: Today we have shown you the different materials used for curtains, how to make tailored and ruffled curtains, and one style of tie-back. In order to make satisfactory curtains, we must first measure the windows to be curtained and the length of our curtains, allowing 1 for hems and shrinkage. At a project meeting of women several weeks ago, our leader asked for their opinion of "Does it pay to make your own curtains?". They all agreed that a saving was made. They all agreed that when making curtains yourself the material used was wider and of better quality and the thread ends were secured more firmly. The curtain was made to fit the window while the purchased one must be shortened or thread ends tied. The curtains they made wore longer, making the yearly cost of curtains much less. The same question was asked three clerks in drapery departments. They were all most emphatic in their statements that it paid to make your own and mentioned the reasons just mentioned. In the tailored curtain, we used twice 81 inches of material which is 162 inches, or 4% yards, plus % yard for tie-backs, making a total of 5 yards @ 15 cents a yard, or 75 cents. We used about 3 cents worth of thread, or a total of 7 8 cents. We were told a curtain like this would </seg>
         <seg id="p325">I Nebraska Home Economics Association sell for around a dollar. The ruffled curtain requires -5 5-6 yards @ 15 cents per yard, or 87% cents, plus 5 cents for thread. The cost of this curtain is 92% cents. Such a curtain is purchased at a store at a cost of around $2.00. We would like to call to your attention, three curtains made by members of our club. This tailored pair was made by Lois Johnson. I made the ruffled curtains, while this pair trimmed with the ball fringe was made by Kathleen. We hope that we have been of some help to you in making your next set of curtains. Are there any questions? If not, we sincerely thank you. ' i ¦ : . ¦";¦/. . ... . . . MRS: GARD: Thank you, girls.

MISS LISTON: Our resident staff is making it possible for you to have conferences and we wish you to avail yourselves of the fac - ility before you go home. We want you to go idea shopping while you are here. Friday morning at 10:30 you can shop for your family, or yourself. The Nursery School will be in session for observation, in the Home Economics Building, Room 103, the discussion of "Delicious Foods, for Dry Years" will be in the form of a demonstration. "Rejuv - [enatirig the Interior" will be in room 213 and "Looking Your Best on 'a-Little",;-will be in room 307. Remember, it is shopping for ideas on Friday morning. itIRS. GARD: I am sure, Miss Liston, we will plan to go shopping Friday morning. Since most of us live in a rural community, this next topic will be close to the heart of each of us. It 1b with pleasure that I announce our next speaker, Dr. C. B. Smith, who has returned to his first love, the fields and woods of his Michigan farm. He is also a poet and a philosopher, and I know we shall all find something of interest to us in hi 3 topic, "The Rural Home". Dr. Smith. THE BUBAL HOME AND EXTENSION DR. SMITH: In my paper before the General Assembly I brought out the thought that there is something about country life that builds strong self-reliant, understanding and accomplishing men and wo - "¦[¦/.. : '¦ ''" ¦ ".-.-• . ¦ ; '"¦¦•. .-¦...¦¦' </seg>
         <seg id="p326">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture men. I also brought out the thought that rural youth would eventually inherit all the farms and produce all the food and fiber of the nation. It was further suggested that because of the higher birth.rate in rural areas and the consequent overflow of rural youth into our towns and cities rural youth would have an ever increasing influence on urban life, and that the reaction would be for the Ideals and thinking of rural raised people to increasingly set the pattern and dominate the ideals and thinking of the whole nation. If rural people are to have this great influence in the nation, it will be because they come from great homes themselves and have built equally great homes for their own children. It is in the home where such matters as integrity, honesty, ideals of life are best taught, and where such matters as cooperatlveness, tolerance and considera - tion are best learned. The rural home then takes on an increased significance in Ameri - can life and becomes the concern of all our people. It is the end ob - jective of all our Extension work, of all our Home Economics and Ag - ricultural 'Clubs. It is our thought that we might well examine the matter a little this afternoon and see, if we can, what some of the factors are that enter into the making of a great rural home. First, great homes are not made except through great effort. God understood what he was doing when he required that we clear and break, plow and cultivate, plant and tend, before we can harvest and store. In this way are we compelled to learn the virtues of patience, of intelligence, of work, and of hope and reward, all of which enter Into the building of character. Creative work keeps the mind busy and contented. It is a wise father and mother who sees that each of their children have some creative worthwhile work to do each day, and nowhere can this be done more effectively than on the farm, and in the farm home. There is education and training in feeding a calf or colt, in gath - ering eggs, in chopping and bringing in wood, in baking bread, wash - ing dishes, canning fruit; there is education in plowing, seeding and harvesting, in dressing the children, feeding the baby, milking the cows. All these give training in the small things in life, but rarely are great things in life brought about that do not have their be - ginnings in small things. The farm home gives training in many kinds of small but important things in life. Second, farm living gives training in descerning true values in life. If you plant diseased seed you harvest a diseased crop, if you feed poor hay, you get less milk. If you use careless methods in canning the fruit mold 3. If you let the weeds grow the crop is choked. If you plant too early, frost kills the crop. If you plant too late, there </seg>
         <seg id="p327">¦ Nebraska Home Economics Association is no harvest. If you beat your neighbor in a trade, he retaliates when he can. As you sow so do you reap, and all these are important les - sons in life's, journey that you can learn early in the farm home. They entej-into the making of an understanding man or woman. (Thirdly, it is on the farm too that you best learn the beauty of silence. The hills from whence cometh our strength are silent. The sun shines and crops grow tall in silence. God fills this world -with great pictures of autumn forests, orchards in bloom, desert mirages, western sunsets, and all speak to you in the still small voice of silence. On the farm there is time to think and reflect, time to sense God, and that is the way great lives begin and grow. And that is why we all long for the quiet and peace of country homes, and that is what goes; with country youth when they go to the city—the memory of the soul's growth in the quiet of their country home. Let's not lose them but keep them. Fourthly, there is the virtue of thrift which one learns on the farm. The farm family has to work for and earn every dollar that cornea into the farm home. It is thus that farm youth early learns the value of money, what it costs in labor, what it costs in bushels of wheat or corn, or pounds of beef to earn a dollar. Its scarcity and the things you have to deny yourself because of it makes still sweeter and more to be treasured the few necessities and luxuries you do get, and makes more certain too the care with which you handle other people's money or assess taxes when you later may come into positions of public trust. We put our trust in people and institutions that know the value of thrift and don't spend too lavishly. Rural homes and life build men of this type and make for conservatism jThere is another thing I want to mention about the farm home, and that is the rich memories of our youth that follow on down through the years and makes one want to send their children back to the farm where spaces are far and activities are wholesome and many memories of hunting afield with dog and gun, memories of threshing time j with heaped up tables, memories of gathering hickory nuts and walnuts on bright autumn days, of swimming holes down in the back [lot with sun burned backs, of fishing day and trapping on ponds and lakes. Memories of Sundays and riding to church with father and mpthter and the rest of the family, of popping corn in the kitchen on long winter evenings or making taffy out of sorghum molasses; mem - mories of the whole family and some of the neighbors singing together around the family organ Sunday evenings or at parties. These are some; of the wholesome things of country home life that go into the making of understanding men and women. Let' 3 not lose them, but keep them. ; While we speak of the whole farm as home, the heart of the home </seg>
         <seg id="p328">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture is the dwelling place on the farm where father, mother, children and one or more ol the grand parents or aunts or uncles live together. Here in the inner sanctuary of the home, the place where ideals and character in children are formed, where ambition is stimulated, where dreams are dreamed, where cooperation is learned, where pre - cepts of life are taught. Here is where the whole family see into each others' hearts and learn the motives that move men. Here is where you ffrst learn of a mother's love and tenderness of a fathers's jus - tice and discipline, of brother's and sister's frankness and sincerity. Here you see yourself as you are, learn to estimate yourself justly and without flattery. Here in the home is a small kingdom. May there by a real king and real queen within it who will observe faithfully the biblical pre - cept to deal justly, love mercy and walk humbly with God in dealing with their children and with each other. A real home is built on love, respect, faith, trust, justice; love between busband and wife, love of father and mother for their children, respect and love of brothers and sisters for each other and for their parents, for it is only a partial home unless there are children in it. You do not know the meaning of home or the discipline or the love of home unless there are children in it. Rural people will hardly fulfill their destiny unless there are children in the home. Have children and have them early in your married life. Extension forces, Home Economics and Agricultural Clubs may well discuss program planning, soil erosion control, farm management, crops and livestock, cooperatives, etc.; but we aren't getting at the heart of our problems unless we give some time and consideration also to the home and its problems. Some phase of homemaking and home life should be on the club or Extension program at about every meeting. There are successful homes in every community as well as successful farms and they are worth discussing and talking about at your club meetings. May we be a little more intimate now and discuss briefly some factors that help make fine homes. If you have a disagreement with your husband or children, don't go to sleep at night until you have reached an understanding, and don't stand on ceremony; be the first to extend the olive branch and seek understanding. Such a proce - dure makes for peace of mind and good feeling in the family. Don't nag, forget the smart repartee. While both these things may give you personal satisfaction and show off your individuality and wit, they are the sure road to a discontented family life. Don't scold and talk loud. Control your temper and your voice. Read the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. It will help you see how a great man became great through the practice of small vitues and consideration of others. Don't talk too much; have some reserve, but encourage your husband and children and the stranger within your gate to talk. Most </seg>
         <seg id="p329">Nebraska Home Economics Association folks find satisfaction in expressing themselves. Make it easy for them to do so. Men like an orderly, clean, peaceful home with wel - come in it. Women want lore, consideration, respect. May these things be theirs in every home. On the whole, men give to women about what women expect of them. In the North, you find women carrying their own suitcase and grabbing onto the street car without assistance. "When I went to Wash - ington, I found the Southern girl I first met, waited, expectantly for me to help her on the street car. She stood at attention and looked at her and I picked up the satchel and carried it. If you expect courtesy, you get it. You can't do these things in a demanding way, but in an expectant way that makes a man want to work for a woman throughout life. ¦Observe the courtesies of life in the home. Good manners count heavily in the world's estimation of you and in your success in life, not manners put on for the occasion, but manners that come from the heart and expressed only when the family is present. You help your children much when you encourage them to have parties of both hoys and girls in the home from time to time. At 14, 15, 16 and beyond, they are eager to learn how to act in company, how to escort a girl to a party and what to do with her after getting her there. These are the years when youth are eager to learn good manners. Give them help by providing them opportunity to practice them. !If rural youth and rural people are to have an increasing influence on the thinking and the destiny of the Nation, it will be not only on account of the splendid training they get which is inherent in rural life and rural homes, but also because that natural training has been supplemented by the training of our schools and colleges and churches. There are great matters ahead of us that require all the training we can give our children for their solution. How shall we preserve our soils? How high shall we erect our tariff barriers? Shall we limit our production? Shall we continue benefit payments to farm-, ers?,Shall we remain a democracy? How can we best dispose of our sur - pluses? Shall we plan our economy so that all men and women shall have some work to do, some income, some leisure for reading, for study, recreation, travel, and continuance of our education throughout life? It is'in the home where ambition and desire for an education is stimu - lated and in most homes it is the mother who is the greatest factor in promoting that stimulation. She it is who is most willing to scrimp and save and deny herself that her children may complete high school and go on to college. ; And let me add this further thought, you don't always have to llnd the money yourself to send Son John or Daughter Mary to college. In most cases your encouragement is enough. They themselves will </seg>

It is the hope too that out of your home and your example may come religious youth, youth who stand for clean living, honest govern - ment, for education for all and the abundant life. With all the preceding matters in mind, what shall be our Extension program in rural areas? What of the Home Demonstration Club, the Agricultural Club program? In your speaker's mind we may well con - tinue our efforts to make farm and home work more efficient. We may well continue our efforts to have beautiful and orderly homes, but our greatest effort may well be to develop great souls within every farm home, men and women who forget the small and mean and concern themselves with the larger, more important things of life, men and women who dream big dreams and who find ways of making their dreams come true. Crops and income may fail for a season, but we can still read great books, can still have gentle manners, can still be considerate of others, can still visit our neighbors, can still have com - panionship of our fine family and neighbors. There are many, many more matters we might take up concern - ing the home, but these are probably enough for this occasion. May I review in closing some of the things I would leave on your mind. The greatest teaching institution, the most significant factor in life now and always is the home and the future welfare of our na - tion is dependent in greatest measure on rural homes. The kind of children that come from our rural homes will determine in a large measure the kind of nation we will be. Since urban centers are failing io reproduce themselves, it i 3 the rural youth of the nation they must depend for their upbuilding and maintenance. May we send them com - petent God fearing men and women from the farms of the nation! The struggle to make a living on the farm, the fight against weather conditions, plant diseases, insect pests, and economic forces, builds character in rural men and women. Work along, day after day, in fields or orchards or garden, away from the noise and hurry of the world, give 3 opportunity for inde - pendent thinking and growth of the soil. The heart of the farm is the family and the purpose of the stern struggle there to make a living, is that the family may grow up to be independent, understanding, and fearless, law-abiding men and women, partners with the Creator. Farm men and women are the great teachers of the nation. They have the privilege of associating and working with their children throughout all the early years of the children's lives. On the farm, schooling goes on day after day, Saturdays, Sundays, and all. Parents teach by doing, by precept and example. The teaching is not out of </seg>

With this close association of parents and children in the farm family through all the early and formative years of the child's life may there be understanding fathers and mothers who know how to deal justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God. i Youth grows in understanding through constructive work, play, study, and worship, through expression, and doing things. They grow into men and women of noble; character when they early learn the value of service to others, love, sacrifice, and cooperation in the fam - ily.-. ¦¦ . .;¦ '..- ¦. ¦ : v ; ¦' . • ¦.-.¦¦. - -i We help our children to success in life when we teach them good manners in the home, courtesy, consideration for others, sincerity. And the best way to teach them is to practice these virtues ourselves. Youth imitates and honors parents who are sincere, fair, and show courtesy and respect toward each other. It is the little things that make up-life. The big things rarely come. The farm family is truly the salt of the earth. Through its pre - servative power will our nation be kept wholesome, efficient, independ - ent, and strong. I The greatest single factor in the training of youth in the rural homes is the mother, who has the largest share in the care of the children. Prom her more than any one else they draw their notions of right and wrong, ambition to achieve, and willtoido in their outlook .on life.- ¦' ¦-, : . ' ¦...- ¦-¦'¦¦¦¦-¦¦".¦ p. . .

It takes both the tenderness of a mother and the discipline and understanding of a father to raise children. It is not so much money that makes a home, as it is love, concern, right thinking, just discipline, consideration, respect, good manners, de - sire to accomplish, orderliness, peace righteousness. And all these may be observed in the home whether there be drouth or floods, insect pests or wars. If you have raised a fine family your life has been a suc - cess. You have contributed to the welfare of your country and are en - titled to enter the kingdom not made with hands. |MRS. GARD: Thank you very much Dr. Smith.

MR FRISBIE: You will be pleased to hear, I know, that this -roup of boys and girls I am about to tell you of was the finest bunch I have ever taken to Chicago. I have wondered a great deal why we got the results we did. Dr. Smith gave me the answer. We expected to be proud and we were proud. Nebraska was the only state entered in every judging and demonstration activity, so I think we started off with a full schedule. In addition to our state champions, Betty McMeekin of Polk coun - ty won a $200 00 scholarship in the National Rural Electrification contest In potatoes we exhibited the full quota and received two blue and five red ribbons. In canning we received two blue, one red and one white ribbon. In clothing there was two blue and two red. You can see all the clothing exhibits over the side of the room. In our livestock demonstration work we had two teams. One from Madison county represented the Sioux City Market, and the Hamilton county team represented the Omaha market at the International Livestock Show and ranked in fourth place. The Madison county team won first place honors. Our team in Animal Husbandry placed fourteenth in the group of thirty-two. Canning was second out of seventeen. Crops was eighth out of thirteen teams. Girls room was second of the twelve teams The poultry teams ranked twelfth in sixteen and in the meat judging and identification Nebraska's team was third with eight com - peting. Our food preparation team comes from Seward county and one member of that team took first individual place in the national con - test Janet Ebers was the individual placing high. Her teammate was Lois Eberspacher. Janet was awarded one of the Capper Trophies and I am happy to present at this time Miss Greene who will give this trophy to Janet. MISS GREENE: I am very happy at this time to present this trophy to you, Janet, for your work. MR FRISBIE- It takes a lot of cooperation of parents, local leaders, county agent? Yes. In taking fifty-two individuals to Chicago and back it takes some scraping, and I know. I would like to have the leaders, Mrs. Kayser, Miss Rachel Peterson and Miss Helen Rocke stand while I ask Miss Wilkens to present to the clothing individual, who also won first place in the national competition, the trophy she won. This is Betty Toothaker of Lancaster county.

You would have thought we were the first to meet him when he came with an outstretched hand , and said, "What can I do for you this afternoon". The little girl was j myself with my mother when we went to see the county superintendent (at that time, Mr. W. H. Brokaw. That little incident has come to me many times, and I try to remember It when others come to me for a request when my home is a busy place. Once i I was almost ready to refuse, when out of the clear sky came this picture again, "What can I do for you", and I managed to squeeze in that little request. I thought that since this is the twenty-fifth anniversary I would like to add this little bit about Director Brokaw. </seg>
         <seg id="p334">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Miss Brown regrets that she can not be with us for the Recog - nition Service. As you know, she met with an accident the other evening and Is now at the Lincoln General Hospital. I would like to suggest that if you could take time to write a card and tell her about how we miss her I am sure she would be glad to hear from you. She is al - ways thinking of nice things to do for us so let us pass this on. Today, one the state extension specialists will carry on for Miss Brown. It has been a pleasure for me to know Miss Rizpah Doug - lass when she has come to our county at various times. It gives me great pleasure to introduce Miss Douglass. MISS DOUGLASS: Thank you, Mrs. Gard. I am sure I am saying Miss Brown's words when I say she deeply regrets not being here as rhis is one occasion she looks forward to and enjoys very much. I do think it is a privilege for me to take this place for Miss Brown and participate in this recognition of the service rendered by our county chairmen. As we come to this part of the home economics program of Or - ganized Agriculture we are struck with the thought that what we can say here will be but a small tribute in comparison to the splendid service which has been given to the state by these alert and efficient county chairman. The home economics program of Organized Agricul - ture honors those who have had a part in making home demonstration work a success. We do appreciate the leadership shown in the counties and in the individual clubs. Without that leadership home demonstra - tion work could not advance and many homes would not receive the help which they now do. This recognition comes to you chairmen because of your faithful service, your cooperative spirit and the fact that you have a vision to see ahead the possibilities of the work that can be accomplished In your county and of the service you can render to your community. You women who are sitting on my left have been county chair - men in the past. You deserve much honor lor the splendid -way you have carried on the work in the past year 3. There are now 402 of you who are wearing the little gold leadership pins. Some of you are serving your counties as chairmen now, some of you have passed this duty on to other women. Today we welcome a new group who are serving their county and community in this capacity for the first time. There are 56 more women who will be wearing the little leadership pins by May when all of the county achievement programs have been held. We wish especially to honor you new chairmen today. Mo3t of you began your work as project club leader and have probably served your club and community in other ways. Now the county is looking to you lor lead- </seg>

We are especially honored this year in having Dr. B. B. Smith participate in this service. He has just talked to you on "The Rural Home". He appreciates what leadership can mean to the nation, to the state,'and to the community. Through his years of extension work he has contacted many rural groups and has seen the results of lead - ership. I am sure he will toe glad to share with us at this time some ol his thoughts on leadership. It is my pleasure to present to you, Dr. C B. Smith. : '" : DR. SMITH: I would like to say just a word to you leaders. You have •been chosen in your counties for your outstanding leadership by your neighbors and friends. I feel sure that you are going to enjoy your commission and that you will have the satisfaction of having done your job well. There is so much to be done and I believe that you will be inspired throughout the year to give a great service to your neigh - bors, friends and community, as well as your county, state and nation. MISS DOUGLASS: Thank you, Dr. Smith. A. group who depends upon the advice and understanding of the county chairmen is the county home demonstration agents. Miss Ethel' Sax ton, the home demonstration'agent from Dawson county, is the president of the home demonstration Agent Association and she wishes to express the appreciation of that Association for the work done by you leaders. Miss Saxton. ' :\-~.-- Miss SAXTON: In extension work we have a broad view over many; years. In looking back over the tweny-five.years of extension work iwe are celebrating this year we see people who have found a way of lite, happy homes with people who have achieved certain sat - isfaction in life and have determined for themselves a sustaining philosophy. County chairmen in the past like yourselves have helped to bring this to pass. "We have achieved this by our efforts plus the ef - forts of loyal leaders back home. We have shared together disap - pointments and success. In behalf of the other home demonstration agents I.wish to express our appreciation for your leadership, your sympathy, your ttioughfulness ana loyalty. Leadership is a privilege that carries with it certain responsibilities. Once we accept this privilege we have the obligation to he builders as long as we are able. It is true that the time may come when your duties as county chairman are over, but your place in your community remains the same 'and those who worked with you then still look to you for enthusiastic support in. any program that furthers successful homemaklng and building' of happy, communities. . </seg>
         <seg id="p336">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Your help is needed to help some other woman share in the com - munity leadership. Your task is not completed with a term of service, but your experience is a symbol and laurel of a task well done. Leader - ship has its many compensations, as you and I are well aware. Lead - ership carries a challenge of gallant, thoughtful living. I challenge you. MISS DOUGLASS: Director Brokaw, likewise, has had many years of experience with leaders and knows that almost unsurmountable difficulties can be overcome by a group of determiued women led by an energetic leader. He appreciates the fine leadership shown by the county chairman in Nebraska and each year we are happy to have him present the charge to the new chairmen. It is my pleasure to pre - sent to you. Director Erokaw. MR. BROKAW: r think that you folks appreciate with me the hard situation I am in this afternoon due to two things-; through the fine statements of Dr. Smith and the fine statements relative to rural leadership. How much that means in our rural life. Mrs. Gard made it doubly difficult. It would be impossible to express twenty-five years of appreciation In the time we have this afternoon, and so I think that it would be best for me to leave things in the past. I would like to say that it is a pleasure to meet again with those leaders who have carried on in the past and also those who are to carry on this year. I am especially grateful for the fine way each of the past leaders have expressed themselves and the fine way they have carried on in their work. In this national life of ours it is a tremen - dously important place that such things as home economics and 4-H boys and girls clubs serve through individuals in the Extension pro - gram. As we have reviewed in the past it will be reviewed again this afternoon, the thoughts expressed in the "Appreciation of Leader - ship". An Appreciation of Leadership Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairmen of home demonstration project work. They believe you to possess that ability to serve and that spirit of self sacrifice so necessary for successful leadership. By this choice there devolves upon you that duty of inspiring your fellow workers with a loyalty to service and a desire for achieve - ment of those things In home making and home life that are nec - essary for better agriculture and more complete living on Nebraska farms. </seg>

THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 14, 1939 MRS. ALVIN GARD, Presiding MRS. GARD: Mrs Tullis is ready at this time to lead us in a few - songs and I will turn the meeting over to her. MRS. TULLIS: What would you like to sing this morning, Ladies? "Old Black Joe"? Very well. Let us sing three verses of "The First Noel" on page 67 in our books, too. MRS. GARD: Thank you, Mrs. Tullis. I don't think there is any better way to begin our morning than with a song and especially is it nice to have such a lovely morning. Most of you probably know that Miss Brown met with an acci - dent and that is the reason she is not here with us this morning. I feel as if my shoes are too big for me, because no one could really take Miss Brown's place. We have with us a homemaker from Cozad who has participated in the public speaking contest sponsored by the Nebraska Farm Bureau in 1939. I am sure that Mrs. Edwin Owen has something very interest - ing to tell us on "The Farmer's Stake in World Peace". Mrs. Owens. THE FARMER'S STAKE IN WORLD PEACE MRS. OWENS: In far off Germany a dictator primes his war machine, and we farm women in the middlewest feel the reverberation of marching feet. Isolation and security seems to be mere phases and their verity dependent upon the will of a ruler greedy for more and more power. Though thousands of miles from the seething caldron of racial hates and prejudices the farmer and his family must give heed to the possibility of war, and its effect upon him and his family. For the farmer has a tremendous stake in world peace. The interest of the farmer in world peace is interpreted first in terms of the family. If the United States is dragged into war which the statesmen and rulers deem inevitable, our son or sons will doubtless have to shoulder arms. That lad, who possess fond dreams of work - ing on the land, will go forth to kill other young men at the bidding of a higher officer. The deepest toll of war is human grief and suf - fering. Those of us who can recall the World War have not forgotten </seg>
         <seg id="p339">I ; Nebraska Home Economics Association I i : :'¦ '".¦¦.' - - ¦ | that thousands of our young men perished on foreign soil, and that | , .. "~ds more are still confined to hospital beds where they have an through long years of suffering. Yes, truly the farmer's first | Merest in world peace is related to his family; The next factor in the question of world peace which directly | concerns the farmer is the economic factor. Cordell Hull, secretary ; of state, says that "the crucial question is to find markets, at home , and; abroad, for our vast productive acreage." Farm prosperity is an integral part of the nation's welfare. I (Depression and unemployment, which are among our chief STVI PreB6nt Ume&gt; are results of the last great war. The Unijed States also has had to increase federal taxes because of the rearmament race, and in some measure, because European debtor nations have defaulted their huge war debts. »»»?!? 68 Pafd £°r fam»roducts during and immediately after the World War brought about the economics downfall of many a farmer Purchasing a farm at the peak prices of the early twenties he watched the steady decrease of prices, and lost his farm when he was unable to meet the interest payments. Some short sighted people say that if war must come it will at least bring higher prices for farm products. But these temporary higher prices would only be followed by economic chaos. All sem - blances of prosperity would disappear, many of our long boasted privileges and rights would be subject to strict regulations, and it seems inevitable that some form of dictatorship would be imposed up - on the American people. Another factor to be considered in the relation of the farmer to world peace is the matter of foreign trade. To quote Secretary Hull again, "Foreign trade is of great importance to the farmer. Under ; average weather conditions we produce a great surplus in excess of do - mestic requirements, and can produce more easily. It is not a policy of embargo against imports but one of moderate and reasonable tar- , iffs that will serve the best interests of agriculture. We are not only one of the world's largest producers of foodstuffs but the largest i | ¦ ¦. single market due to our huge population and the highest living stan - dard .in the world." ¦'.:.. *he Trade Agreements Act has greatly benefited the farmer and continued peace; is necessary for its enduring good. And the program of reciprocal trade is itself a great force in maintaining this same peace and in advancing prosperity. I quote from a Department of State! pamphlet on this vital question. supplying the farm products that the people of the | United States can buy at a reasonable price, the additional farm pro- </seg>
         <seg id="p340">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ducts must either find foreign markets or pile up in surplusses in this country and force prices down to levels so low as to be ruinious to farmers. The departments and agencies of the United States govern - ment which are primarily concerned with commerce and trade have been working out this trade agreements program with various coun - tries. "Trade agreements have so far been concluded with nineteen countries; the United States has obtained more favorable treatment on about two-thirds of its farm exports to these countries. Concessions on farm products obtained from these countries are far more num - erous than the concessions on agricultural imports granted by the United States. "American farmers are helped in two ways by increasing the exports of manufactured products. Industrial workers in the United States employed in producing these goods for export are better custom - ers for farm products, and many farm products are used in the manu - facture of industrial goods exported. So the farmer depends upon the export not only of raw material but also of finished products: In - creased foreign markets mean more employment and higher living standards on American farms and fn American cities. "One of this country's principal aims in developing this Trade Agreement program is to strengthen the basis of peace and to main - tain peaceful international relations." So in another instance the American farmer is related to the problem of world peace, through his interest in the Trade Agree - ment program. The United States is the richest of all nations, and has within its borders nearly all of the primary raw materials. All nations have equal access to raw materials through the channels of international trade. In a survey book called "Peaceful Change" the author shows that countries like Japan and Italy, whose populations are increasing ra - pidly, import a large percentage of raw materials. Germany is now enforcing stringent rules in an effort to become self-supporting. The arms race stands in the way of economic recovery in many ways; raw materials are being put to unproductive uses. The Ger - man people are told that they must learn to prefer cannon to butter. Some day the people will no longer be able to pay taxes to support the gigantic burden of armament. Then factories must close down, throw - ing millions of men out of work. With the purchasing power of these consumers at a standstill, the farmer, the producer of foods, will suffer. Early this summer farm women from thirty countries met at London, met as the Associated Country Women of the World. Them </seg>
         <seg id="p341">i Nebraska Home Economics Association were two hundred and fifty women from the United States in at - tendance. Political differences were kept out of the meeting and it ,was proved that rural home makers, whatever their nationality, have much in common. Our Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts from all over the world meet together and dwell in harmony. It seems that we should all be good neighbors. Both from a humanitarian and economic standpoint the farmer has much at stake in World Peace. We believe that peace and pros - perity go hand in hand and we pledge our earnest efforts to the cause of World Peace which will bring a lasting and sound prosperity and happiness to the nations of the world. ' MRS. GARD: Thank you, Mrs. Owens, for this very enlighten - ing talk. You have given us much to think about and to remember when we get home. ;.;¦; Nebraska had two delegates to the Conference of the Associated Country Women of the World in London this last June. Mrs. Eutsler spoke yesterday to the county chairmen group, and now this morning wejhave the privilege of hearing from our other delegate, Mrs. Clora Butts of Burwell, Nebraska. I am pleased to introduce to you, Mrs. BUttS. • •'. ' ' .: " '"', . ¦•' ' ' ¦ ¦ ' -.' . . .¦ . ' ¦ . . MEMORIES OF THE LONDON CONFERENCE j MRS. BUTTS: Every person sets goals for life. They are out there somewhere in the future beckoning. In the back of our subconscious thoughts we are planning; "When I'm fifty I want a farm, a car fine furniture, an assured income", on and on. Since I can remember oneiof my goals has been to take a trip on a big steamship. Whenever I sat in a darkened theatre and watched an ocean liner outward bound, something of the deep of the ocean has called to the deep of my soul, and I have known that sometime I must go. j Perhaps I should tell you something of the nature of this or - ganization under the auspices of which the conference was held. The Associated Conference of the Women of the World is an international organization, the membership of which is made up of women's clubs having as their primary objective the study of agriculture/food shel - ter and clothing; in fact the physical welfare of humanity After all this,basis of physical needs is one on which all humanity can unite' It is one in which womanhood plays an important part. It has been said that) the country woman not only makes life pleasant, she makes it possible. [This organization was started in 1929 at London by the March - ioness of Aberdeen. It met the following year to perfect the organi- </seg>
         <seg id="p342">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture zation. In 1933 it met at Vienna, in 1936 at Washington, D. C, in 1939 at London, and invitations were extended for it to meet in 1942 Irom South Africa, Australia, Canada, Holland and Germany. In spite of the fine program offered by this conference, I felt two great lacks. There was nothing whatever said about -world peace or religion. However, I realized that with such a wide divergence o£ thought (there were representatives from more than thirty countries, and there were more than the Christian religion represented) it might not have been an amicable discussion. In discussing world peace ways and means are likely to be suggested. Countries have not yet agreed as to the best way of achieving this long sought goal. The men of Europe are fighting today on this question, "What is best for world peace?" The totalitarian governments are saying, "Let there be one great gov - ernment in the world, and let it be my government". And the de - mocracies are saying, "Let there be many independent governments side by side in neighborliness". This is the question which need to be settled by the present war. Shall we have totalitarian or democratic governments? Even though world peace was not mentioned from the platform, the conference was valuable for promoting its attainment. When children are quarreling over the back fence, and making faces at each other, if they will sit down and play a game together their difficulties are forgotten. Five thousand women meeting together and discussing the things they have in common, then returning to their homes in all parts of the world and radiating the influence stimulated by friendly contacts are a most important factor in achieving peace. As I sat in that great hall on the opening day of the conference, I watched the women coming in. I searched their faces. There was a look of ex - pectancy, a desire to give and to receive. Many of them were dressed in native costume. The Scandinavian women wore tight fitting blouses, with full gathered skirts covered with an apron. A head dress of stiffly starched white material complet - ed their costume. It was all very colorful and interesting. It seemed to me that this meeting was like the homecoming of one large family. A family, the members of which, had married, cen - turies before and scattered to the ends of the earth, and now they were returning as if at Thanksgiving; each of course concerned with the interests of their own family and community yet pulled together by the common good of the whole human race. Much of the first week of the conference was taken up with greetings, presentations and reports. I was greatly interested in the reports which told us of the club women of other countries, their ob- </seg>
         <seg id="p343">Nebraska Home Economics Association jectives, their handicrafts and methods of achieving their goals Many of the reports were given with the aid of films, showing the activities of the clubwomen. Of particular interest was the film showing the work of the German Woman, it portrayed the preparation of the soil bed, planting the seeds, the.cultivation and harvesting of fruits and vegetables and the preparation for the table. The German clubwoman is occupied with doing her bit to make Germany self-sufficient in Physical needs. Young girls wishing to join the club hires out to a woman who is a club member prepared to teach home'training and for two years works for no wages. After passing a test, she may set up her own home and have girls work for her for two years with no pay. In Hawaii the racial problem has been solved through the meeting together of all women in club work. In the Scandinavian countries the effectiveness of cooperatives is furthered by women's groups. German club women are helping in the development of na - tional sufficiency of physical needs. Denmark and New Zealand are the best organized, agriculturally, and the Extension Service and wo - men's clubs are the most important factors in reaching; this attain - ment; A week in London gave us the opportunity to visit many of the old historic spots, the ancient cathedrals, castles and the homes of England's King and Queen. We found rural England to be very beautiful. It all looked as though it had been laid out into fields and pastures, trimmed with flowers, grasses, hedges, centuries before and no one seemed to be occupied with the upkeep of it all. Life moves along leisurely with the English. No one seemed to be in a hurry, they are strong for tradition. The past with its glory is of more importance it seems that the future with its unknown and untried opportunities. In England, if one would suggest a change he would be asked, "Why change? It has always been done this way and it has been done all right." In America we think, "It has never been aone, let's try it." After a week spent at the conference many of the American ivomen set out on a tour to Ireland, Scotland, the Scandinavian coun - tries and to the western countries on the continent.

We thank you, Mrs. Butts, for the many splendid things you have brought to us. Per - haps, it will help you and I, here in Nebraska ,to have a better ap - preciation of things in our country and to better enjoy the many comforts we take so much for granted. Mrs. Butts told us of how confusing it was to use foreign money. Perhaps we need to learn more about buying right here at home. We have with us this morning someone very capable of doing that very thing. She will speak to us on the subject, "Education of the Consumer as a Buyer". I am pleased to present to you, Mrs. Viola Brickson, General Manager of the Better Business Bureau of Lincoln. EDUCATION OP THE CONSUMER AS A BUYER MRS. ERICKSON: For more than a quarter of a century Better Business Bureau has operated in the interest of and for the pro - tection of the public and legitimate business. Originally they were established to further truth in advertising and this function is still a very important part of their work. As early as 1904 and even before that time individual publish - ers and advertisers who were members of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, were making an effort to eliminate and correct misleading deceptive advertising. But it was not until 1911 that a definite step was taken by business to correct advertising abuses and to police its own copy. At that time the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, now known as the Advertising Federation of America, set up the National Vigilance Committe which was a volunteer group organized to com - bat fraud and deception in national advertising. During the first years of its operation, the Vigilance Committee conducted about 100 investigations in New York city. It is rather interesting to note that in comparison our Lincoln Bureau makes between 35 and 50 investiga - tions a month, and it is gratifying to be able to state that an in - creasingly large percentage of reports brought back by our shoppers show that local advertisers maintain a very high level of accuracy and truthfulness in their advertising </seg>
         <seg id="p345">¦ ¦ I ¦ ' "' • : ¦ :- / I Nebraska Home Economics Association After the. establishment of this; volunteer group to check na - tional advertising, communities in various parts of the country form - ed local Volunteer Vigilance Committees, but it was soon found that full time staffs and especially trained men and women were needed and in 1914 in Minneapolis the Associated Advertising Club hired a full time j secretary. In 1916 the Name Vigilance Committee was changed to Better Business Bureau, and Better Business Bureaus have con - tinued to function as a self regulation of business. They are agencies which operate as unbiased, unpredjudiced, fact finding bodies to make a daily check of advertising in their respective communities and to investigate, report and correct misleading, inaccurate and de - ceptive practices. : Gradually Better Business Bureaus expanded their protective activities to include the exposing and prevention of fraud, misrepre - sentation and deception in selling practices and in 1920 developed a program which greatly increased their service to the public "Before you Invest-Investigate" and "Read Before You Sign" became Bureau slogans and proved to be the most effective weapon in protecting the public. . ¦¦ ¦ 'i ¦ ' •' .'•¦ ¦' ¦ - ¦• ¦ The organization and operation of Better Business Bureaus is nationwide. In fact, there are more than 60 Bureaus in the U. S. and Canada and the schemes they expose, the frauds and rackets they fight [are written up in numerous magazines, newspapers and told over the air. As all Bureaus are independently incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located, the Lincoln Bureau is a Ne - braska corporation set up as a non-profit agency in February, 1938. Our funds are obtained from yearly membership subscriptions of Lincoln business institutions and our membership includes a cross section of the business life of the city. Any legitimate business firm is eligible to membership and the varied character of that membership prevents control or domination by any one business group. The broadj general policieB of the Bureau are set by a board of fifteen di - rectors elected by the membership at its annual meeting. These men serve I without compensation as a matter of civic responsibility to their fellow business men and the public and consider this service a part of their contribution to the-business;.welfare, of ..the city. The Board of directors elect officers and hire a manager. The Better Business Bureau was founded'upon and is guided by the principle and belief that successful business is dependent upon that confidence which results only when business is operated in strict fairness both toward the buying public and toward competition. The support of a Better Business Bureau indicates without doubt that business feels that public confidence in advertising can be maintained </seg>
         <seg id="p346">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture only by continued vigilance in correcting errors and publicizing un - fair practices. Advertising has been called "selling in print". Whether the print sells merchandise depends upon the confidence of the reader in the printed word and business is vitally concerned with this fact, How does the Better Business Bureau further truth in advertising? A daily checking of all advertisements is made by the Bureau. We have a group of shoppers, mostly women who neither require nor receive any special training They are sent out to stores to check adver - tised goods we select from the daily ads. If necessary they purchase the merchandise shopped. If we find the merchandise is not truthfully advertised from the reports presented to us, we contact the advertiser and ask his cooperation In correcting future copy. If the advertiser re - fuses, which has happened very rarely in our work here, we present our evidence to the advertising media and seek their cooperation in eliminating the questionable advertisement. It i 3 a fact too little known that advertising media, through their own censorship activities as well as through cooperation with business and other agencies, refuse millions of dollars worth of advertising yearly because the advertising does not meet acceptable standards. Publicizing the advertiser and his method of advertising is also a powerful weapon. It is only in extreme cases and as a last re - sort that the Bureau presents its case to government authorities. Cases of false and misleading advertising may be prosecuted under the False Advertising Law which has been on Nebraska statutes since 1913. That important improvements in retail advertising and selling practices have been made is obvious by a comparison of advertising conditions of few years ago, even a year ago. Descriptions of materials are more accurate—silk is seldom advertised as rayon, although we still call the attention of advertisers to this inaccuracy and have bought materials, and tested them to prove our point. We have also tested merchandise for wool content; have checked ads which ad - vertise merchandise as "Leather" and found the articles to be simulat - ed leather or imitation leather fabric. Misleading trade names have been curbed. Especially is this true in the fur field. Readers are now told by means of a qualifying statement that dyed muskrat which accompanies the term "Hudson Seal" Is the real fur _used in such a garment. Many other trade names of furs carry qualifing statements so the consumer knows the true name of the fur which is being sold to her. We check every fur ad to see that furs are properly qualified. The Bureau also asks consumers who feel they have been misled by advrtising to report this to our office at once. We will investigate and ask for a correction. We want to know </seg>
         <seg id="p347">j Nebraska Home Economics Association {" " ".¦¦¦¦¦ " " ¦ ¦ .."¦ ¦ ' ' " ' ¦ ' whatj you think of advertising as we are an organization to give business consumer reaction to its advertising. Illustrations now more accurately portray the merchandise ad - vertised. Our shoppers check merchandise to see that illustrations are accurate. If the advertiser does not have an exact cut, and in smaller storep this is impossible in many cases because of expense, the Bur - eau recommends that a statement be made such as "not exact illus - tration" or "similar to illustration". In fact, the standards our Bureau has worked out with the electric refrigeration retailers and which they have adopted, contain thia agreement, among other standards designed to give you, the consumer, more accurate and informative advertising in this field We consider advertising misleading which carries, for example the cut of a $290.00 refrigerator when a $150.00 box is advertised. An important function of the Bureau is work with members in the various merchandising fields in the preparation, adoption and enforcement of standards for advertising and selling. In our close contact with consumers who give us their reaction to advertising and bring us their complaints, we learn what, the consumer interprets as fair and honest. From this information and that gleaned from re - presentative advertisers, standards in a particular field such as furs, jewelry, furniture, etc., are drawn up and submitted to each group; for approval. The standards which are adopted represent a voluntary effort on the part of the merchants to provide the con - sumer with more essential facts about the merchandise offered and to give him the kind of fair and accurate advertising which will more fully | merit public confidence. Untruths in advertising today are rare, jbut half-truths, exaggerations, confusing make-up which do appear are being gradually eliminated by voluntary and cooperative action on the part of advertisers and advertising media and Better Business Bureaus provide the agency through which this is being most effectively accomplished. One of the reasons consumers experience so many difficulties in business transactions is because of inability to distinguish between the legitimate concern and the unfair concern or to properly appraise representation made to them. They cannot recognize the earmarks of deception and misrepresentation and the Bureaus have long felt that the best protection for consumers was education in buymanship and in practical everyday money management. In this connection they feel that children in the public school should be taught fact informa - tion about merchandise and financial matters and that the next step should be instruction to aid the individual in handling his earnings and savings. The Bureau's experience in handling complaints and inquiries emphasizes our belief that lack of knowledge on simple and funda - mental facts about business and merchandise, securities and services </seg>
         <seg id="p348">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture are the leading reasons lor consumers being victimized in fraudu - lent promotions, unfair schemes and unwise expenditures of money. So one of our most recent activities in the consumer education field has been the publication and distribution of educational and informa - tive material in the form of "Fact Booklets". These booklets are be - ing used by educational institutions in their consumer class work and are available to the public. Over a half million have been distributed by the Bureaus to date. These Fact Booklets are prepared very carefully Before being distributed the material is submitted to educators, government agencies, consumer organization and trade authorities who have an interest in the particular subject. An example of these booklets Is the one on Furs which, among other things, gives helpful advice on how to buy and take care of furs, listing the various furs with information regarding the serviceability of each. At present we are offering 16 such booklets which may be secured at a cost of 31 each.

These have been published in an 88 page book entitled "A Guide for Retail Advertising and Selling". It contains Federal Trade Commission rulings, legal decisions and laws, but most important It serves as a dictionary ot over 1500 terms frequently used in retail advertising, and includes standards for ad - vertising and selling, which investigations have demonstrated over a period of many years were desirable from the consumer viewpoint. </seg>
         <seg id="p349">¦ i Nebraska Home Economics Association tfhisWide is what we call the Bureau Bible and it is used as a basis for judging the accuracy of advertising. Copies have been placed in the hands of all members of the Bureau who do any amount of ad - vertising and has been distributed to non-members as well. We feel this guide is doing much to raise the standard of advertising all over the country. in an effort to determine what consumers think of advertising and to check the recommendations we make to advertisers from time to^tinie questionaires which are submitted to consumer groups. Many things the law does not consider illegal, are considered unfair by the consumer. So a wide field of conduct must be covered by voluntary standards enforced through the conscience and understanding of business. Because Bureaus represent all phases of business and operate in the interest of the consumer, it is the outside agency set up by business to pass on its advertising and to give the consumer reaction to advertising and selling practices. (Example of one questlonaire) Last June the National Association of Better Business Bureaus an association in which 60 local Better Business Bureaus hold member - ship, sponsored a Business Consumer Relations Conference, the first conference of its kind to be held in this country. To this conference came business leaders, men and women .prominent in the consumer movement, representatives of government bodies dealing with ad - vertising and selling practices and leaders in education. The purpose of the! meeting was to bring together for mutual discussion the four major,groups most interested in consumer education and protection Twenty-nine speakers who were authorities in business, consumer government and educational organizations very frankly expressed their viewpoints and out of this discussion of the respective problems of each group, we hope will come the beginning of a program which will.improve the present economic order. 1 Such a meeting holds out the hopes that consumer and business groups aye gradually approach - ing an understanding of each other's problems. &lt; Intelligent buying was emphasized by many speakers and the suggestion made that Better Business Bureaus who have been work - ing along these lines for years are the logical organization to act as the agency between buyer and seller and to serve as a representative of business in a program to promote consumer education, informative advertising and selling and intelligent buying. Each Bureau in its own community is attempting to broaden its program along these lines. We hope to have another conference this coming summer I should (like now to enlarge on that phase ot Better Business Bureau work which concluded our first Consumer program, that is the pro - tective service which has been greatly publicized through the use of our two slogans, "Before You Invest—lnvestigate" and "Read Before You Sign". Through newspaper articles and advertisements, radio ¦:' ¦ 'f. ¦..•¦¦¦'¦¦..' .. .¦'•¦-.¦' : ¦'-¦. ¦"¦. ..-• ' : ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p350">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture talks and posters, bulletins and speeches, the Better Business Bureau Is constantly emphasizing these slogans. Repetition is teaching the public to investigate before investing and to make use of the fact re - ports furnished by the Better Business Bureau without charge to any inquirer. Four hundred and thirty thousand inquiries were made to the Bureaus in 1938, largely by consumers who desired information before parting with their money. These inquiries saved consumers millions of dollars and also brought to the Bureau immediately the activities of many new promoters. The Bureau is a preventative, rather than a punitive organiza - tion and one of its most effective services is to warn the public against gyps, frauds and unfair schemes and to educate them to recognize such practices. In order to give you a definite picture of Bureau opera - tions, I want to mention a number of cases our Lincoln Bureau has handled, the kind which undoubtedly have operated or may operate in your communities. One scheme which recently operated in Lincoln and one which seemed to strike every community is the "free picture enlargement scheme. About two weeks ago the Bureau learned from the inquiries received that a crew representing a Kansas City Studio were contracting Lincoln housewives offering them a tinted enlargement free if they drew the lucky yellow slip from two envelopes presented to them. Our information revealed that all drew the lucky slips. But here was the catch. After securing the photo or snap shot to be enlarged, the agent mentioned a $1.98 advance payment to covering mailing costs, which in reality was a good price for the enlargement. Within a few hour 3 after the crew started operations, we reported the case to the city attorney's office and the crew was picked up and ordered to leave town, or cease misrepresenting their office and comply with the city ordinance license requirement. They left town. The crew admitted their plan was to require the purchase of a frame when the enlargement was returned, but the prospective purchaser was not told this. A few days ago a woman from a near-by town reported the same crew had been there and she had fallen for the scheme. The enlarge - ment was returned to her only partly finished and the studio would not finish it until she bought a frame for $6.90. As the enlargement was an odd size, 18" in height and was octagonal in shape, she would have to buy this frame or pay a larger price somewhere else. When this woman looked over the receipt she had signed she found it contain - ed a statement, carefully concealed, to the effect that enlargements would not be finished unless a suitable frame was purchased within a reasonable length of time, emphasizing again the wisdom of reading and understanding a contract before signing it. Because Lincoln women investigated before investing, this </seg>
         <seg id="p351">Nebraska Home Economics Association ¦¦i. ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦'"¦¦¦ scheme was stopped before it had operated more than a few hours. Don't fall for the contest representation offered by many solicitors or the beautiful samples of work displayed by them. We have had many complaints that inferior work has been returned and in a num - ber of cases advance payments were made and pictures were never delivered, specially in coupon selling deals. Free book offers also catch the unwary. If the house-to-house canvasser tells you that you have been selected to receive a special "offer", or a "free" set of books, because'the publisher feels your recommendation will be very valuable for advertising purposes, that this jmethod of advertising is being used instead of newspaper or magazine advertising, beware. Cases we have investigated upon com - plaints have proved that these special offers are the price which anyone may purchase the set of books. We find that where "free" offers were made, the salesman cleverly "sold" the victim! a 10 year loose-leaf supplement of current events offered with the set at a very nominal fee per year. When the charge for the supplement is checked, it is found that the purchaser had paid the regular cost of the set of books with supplement included. i Cases we have handled involve the signing of contracts by in - dividuals who were told the paper they signed was only necessary information in case they decided to take the offer. When the set of books arrived a short time after the salesman had called and the victims read the paper they had signed, they found it was a contract for; a: set of books in payments of so much per month. Remember— written contracts are binding and verbal representations made by salesman are not. When a salesman gets you to sign a contract on the statement that if you wish to cancel it later you may, or if he states that you don't have to live up to the payments as stated, remember the| Company will say that you signed this and it's plainly written in the contract. "We're sorry." ¦ .•vj I ¦¦ .'-¦"• ¦:- : ' '•'¦¦" '¦'¦.¦' -•' . ¦¦ ;."; (Perhaps some of you heard the warning on fur peddlers which went out over the radio about a year ago. A notorious group of fur peddlers arrived in Lincoln in large, flashy cars and installed them - selves; in the city tourist camp. Later they moved into apartments. They did not operate in the city of Lincoln but worked the roadhouses outside the city limits and in surrounding towns. This gang has op - erated for a number of years and has had trouble in Better Business Bureau cities which may account for the fact that we could find no one] here who had been solicited by them. In one town they dressed as sailors and said the fur coats they were offering had been smuggled in; therefore they could be sold "dirt cheap". This is to fool the pub - lic. |The coats they offered were made out of odds and ends of the cheapest rabbit fur. We were informed from neighboring towns that the gang sold coats which they represented as Hudson Seal and </seg>
         <seg id="p352">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Mole for as little as $25 and your old coat. A woman came Into our office one day complaining that she had bought a fur coat from an itinerant peddler who said he was sell - ing "bonus merchandise". He stated he traveled for a certain company and had been paid his bonus in merchandise as the close of the sea - son and because the company had given him a very good deal he could 3ell the coats for a song. After the saleman had gone she looked over the coat, the purchaser found three bald spots and the fur came out so badly she couldn't wear it. Thousands of dollars have been thrown away on worthless fur merchandise by individuals who did not deal with reliable, established firms. Our office receives many complaints on rug peddlers—where a saleman offers you an oriental rug for $25 you're buying nothing but a cheap jute rug. We investigated such deals made in Lincoln and have found that comparable merchandise was selling for less in the stores. One woman out of town wrote she had purchased two rugs from a man who said he represented a well known rug company in Lincoln. She complained that the rugs when examined were the wrong size and were very poor quality. A check with the rug company brought information they had no saleman on the road and had never heard of the man. Our office receives many inquiries and complaints on correspon - dence schools. High pressure saleman sell courses to individuals who have neither the background nor the aptitude for the work offered. The opportunities for employment in the field in which in - struction is offered are many times grossly overstressed, and some schools even guarantee employment and others go so far as to offer a tuition refund agreement in the event the student does not get a job. There are various ways of getting around these guarantees and such agreements should be read and analyzed very carefully. This does not mean that there are not many responsible correspondence schools but it always pays to investigate carefully before signing any contract. It is well to secure advice from an educator not connected with any commercial school and if possible, to talk to those who are taking the course or who have taken it, to see if they are satisfied. If the course is taken in a resident school, the prospective student would be wise in visiting the school and examining its equipment. Don't be rushed into sighing a contract before investigating. Thousands of dollars have been lost by individuals who have fal - len for the "Home Work and No Pay" schemes. The depression years have provided a fruitful field for fakers who have devised many schemes to lead persons to believe they could make money at home addressing envelopes, gilding greeting cards, making dresses, raising frogs, etc. These schemes are usually advertised in newspapers, of- </seg>

Our local papers very carefully Investi - gate j anything which looks as if it might be such a fake and have refused any number of ads upon receiving our fact report. In towns where there is no fact reported Service as a Bureau offers. These ads often creep in and we have received many inquiries from out of town individuals for reports on many home work schemes. One scheme which brought many requests for a report was a dress company of New j York City, which operated from a post office box number as many schemes do. Ads were placed in Help Wanted Female columns with copy. J Women Earn $18.00 Dozen Sewing Dresses. ;: Everything furnished. Materials cut, Trimmingsft instructions : Experience unnecessary.

The postofflce solicitation report contained the statement that the promoter of this scheme could not name one person who had earned any money by this work-at-home plan. Often victims have been defrauded of many dollars before the proper authorities can put a stop to the schemes of unscrupulous promoters and that is where Better Business Bureau warnings and fact reports offer protection. • i ¦ ¦ :¦¦'i ¦-' ¦¦¦'.;.-• ¦ ;••.¦¦ ¦:¦ ¦ ;;: . . .'¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ j There are many reputable literary agents and song publishers but there are also many fakers in this field. Before you invest any money in a literary bureau which offers to criticize, revise and mar - ket your story or book', contact some reliable source for information, such, as a Better Business Bureau or an established publishing com - pany for a report. Generally such companies ask for a fee of $25.00 to |$50.00 for their service but their contract when carefully scrutin - ized promises nothing. A music publishing company about which many people out-state inquired, offered to make musical settings for poems and publish the result for a collaboration fee of $45.00, but the amount of this fee was not mentioned until a fee of $5.00 had first been made. Our National Better Business Bureau was asked to assist in investigat - ing this company and a postal fraud order was finally issued against them. This company also advertised in classified newspaper columns in this way got their lead. I quote their copy also to show how cleverly an approach was made. I "WANTED original poems, songs, for immediate consideration. I Send poems to XXX Music Publishers Ltd., Dept.

         <seg id="p354">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture he has never known of any amateur achieving success as a song writer as a result of having his song material serviced by such organizations. I want to close with the statement of the three-point program which Better Business Bureaus all over the country are dedicated to: 1. Prosecution and Prevention of Swindles 2. Promotion and development of fair trade practices in advertising and selling 3. Education of the consumer as a buyer The effectiveness of our program depends on the use that is made of our services. We invite the consumer to contact us if he desires facts about any new, or doubtful enterprise or merchandise offer! if he has been misled by an advertisement; if he has been the victim of the fraudulent transaction or if he has evidence of a scheme to swindle the public. I thank you. MRS. GARD: We appreciate the facts and information you have given us, Mrs. Erickson. It is comforting to know that we are pro - tected by an organization of this kind. I have an announcement to make at this time. Yesterday a peach colored handkerchief was lost and because it has a personal value to the owner, we wish that if it has been found it would be turned in to the desk in the hall. Mrs. Tullis, could you lead us in a song at this time? Mrs. Tullis led in the group singing of "Home on the Range". MRS. GARD: Yesterday we heard a very fine talk by Dr. Smith on the rural home. We appreciate the fact that our home has so many aspects. At this time we are going to look at the home a little dif - ferently Mr. John Ise, professor at the University of Kansas, was formerly a member of the American Economic Review and last year was president of the Mid-west Economic Association. It is with pleasure that I present Dr. Ise. THE ECONOMIST'S VIEW OP THE CHANGING HOME MR. ISE: I am here really twenty years too late to give you a good talk on the American home, because twenty-years ago I knew just how I wanted a home. Of course, very few of those ideas have I ever been able to realize. As far back as my knowledge of history goes, each generation thought the morals of the time were getting sadly worse, the sacred institutions were being changed, the young people were going to </seg>
         <seg id="p355">; Nebraska Home Economics Association the devil, and the general trend -was downward. It is from this per - spective that we must look at many ol the complaints about the changing home, and about the quality of our home life. The home is changing all right, changing at a rate, to quote one of my friends on the farms, "to make the telephone poles look like a tight board fence". We must say that it has been changed less on the farm than anywhere else; jin fact I sometimes think that there is only one place where a sound, healthy home life can be had, and that is on the farm. But it is changing even there. Perhaps the most complete change in the American home has been the rapid change in the number of children. On the frontier, families were pretty large. Iwas born on the frontier in central Kansas, one of a family of twelve children. Our nearest neighbor had fifteen child - ren, |and down across the section lived a family with ten boys and four girls. While a great many families had a dozen or so child - ren in those days, there were also some small families. Today, in that same | neighborhood, on farms as well as in towns, two children is standard equipment, although some have more and some have less. The old school house across my father's pasture, which used to house 42 pupils, has been abandoned because it wasn't worth while to maintain the school for one child. I think that is the story of a great many country schools throughout the mid-west. There are figures to show that the average number of children in some farm j communities in Kansas is lower than that in the towns, which indicates clearly that therejis a limitation of children on the farm as well as in the city. Some regard this as a serious moral and social question, but just as an economist I should say that I think that if there is anything such states as Kansas and Nebraska do not need, it is more children. With steady increase in the use of power in farming, with the in - crease in size of the average farm—and the average-farm is .not yet big enough to provide the most efficient unit—there is less and less need for farmers, and it from an economist's point.of view fortunate if therejis not too great an over-supply of young men and women born and reared on the farms. The state of Kansas and probably Nebraska as wejl, ought to lose people and reduce population if the standard of livingjof the farmers is not to decline. Nebraska is probably in more favorable circumstances than my own state, because Nebraska has handled her semi-arid land much bettter and therefore need not face the necessity to a less intensive use of her land. But everywhere on the farms of the middle west, the amount of power used has been increasing steadily, the farm unit is growing, and there is less use for farmers. My own opinion would be that there are two million sur - plus farmers in the United States today, and the standard of living can never be raised greatly as long as there are too many in the business. '¦ ::J ¦ ' "' ¦¦•¦- : ,;. . '.'¦".;¦ .'¦ .' .';' . '¦ Neither is it an intelligent solution of our over-population for </seg>
         <seg id="p356">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture farmers to rear a great many young men and women on the farm, educate them at the expense of the farm community, and then send them into the cities. That has been our process lor generations—in fact, I think you could say that is is a process that has been going on for centuries. It is from the farms that the city people have generally come, a generation or two or three or four ago. Now a process of that kind inevitably means impoverishment of the farm community. Let us suppose, tor instance, that the farms of Nebraska produces a sur - plus of 10,000 young people a year, rears them, gives them some edu - cation, and then lets them go to the big cities of the East. I don't know how many of you are exporting from this state, I think there are no figures on the subject, but I believe 2,000 would not be an exag - geration. An eminent statistican estimates that it costs something like $5,000 to rear and educate a young man or woman to maturity. If that estimate is correct, your state is spending something like ten million dollars a year to rear and educate children who do not render their really productive service on the farms of Nebraska at all, but go to the city for their productive life. This means a heavy loss to the farmers of Nebraska, from the economist's point of view. Suppose that you were asked to raise ten million dollars worth of cattle and ship them free for use in the cities of the East, or perhaps the cities of the West. Suppose you were asked to give the cities 200,000 cattle' every year, ten thousand carloads, raised at your expense and given as gifts to the great urban centers. Cut the figures down 50% or to 75%, and you still have a tremendous cost borne by the farm popula - tion for the benefit of the cities. Is it any wonder that wealth piles up in the cities, and that the average farm in the mid-west shows a steady deterioration? It is a pity that children are so largely raised in farm communi - ties where the average income is low, while In wealthy urban centers like New York City the average family consists of about one child and a half. I confess that personally I think nothing is finer than a good sized family. I was reared in a family of twelve, which I call a respect - able family. I have two children, standard equipment. But from the broad social point of view, we must face the fact that the farmers are raising more than their share of the children, and that is one of the reasons the farmer's income in down. Many of the changes in the home are the result of this steady march of the machine age. Machinery and ever more machinery is be - ing used everywhere, not only in the factory, but on the farm, in the doctor's office, in the cobbler's shop, and in the home itself. In many ways that is wholly good. I can remember when we used to saw the winter's wood supply by hand with the cross-cut saw, two-week job for all the men in the family. Today a buzz saw does it in a day or so, and it is a far more pleasant job than it used to be. It was my job as a boy to run the washing machine for my mother, and it was a rather </seg>
         <seg id="p357">! Nebraska Home Economics Association steadier job than most boys like. Machines relieved us ot a lot ot drudgery, but on the other hand they have had a devastating effect on farm: finances. The farmer has to buy a lot of machinery which means that he has to be In the market a great deal. He has to produce a lot of stuff in order to exchange it for what he needs; and in the market the farmer is always at a disadvantage because he sells his stuff in a highly competitive market, and he buys in a market which is generally morej or less monopolized. ! The old Roman farmer, Cato, once said that the farmer must always sell and never buy, and we see today the fundamental truth of that precept; for the farmer Is in a treadmill, driven to produce larger and larger supplies of farm stuff in order to buy machines that have |to be replaced* perhaps before he has the money to replace them. The result is seen in the steady loss of farms to mortgage holders some, fifty thousand a year. A steady increase in tenancy is a steady drift toward European conditions of peasantry. The ablest farmer can manage, but many of them are now tenants on the land that they owned when they had less machinery to buy. So the machine age has brought us a home in which there are plenty of machines, conspicious - ly, of course, the automobile and tractor; and yet less security than the farmer enjoyed a generation ago, and less chance of the young farmer earning the price of his own home -' i: ¦'¦ '¦-'Vl ' , -: ¦'¦ ' "'-'¦. '¦¦¦;¦' ' ¦-.'"¦..: ¦;; : '. j With the development of the machine age has come minute specialization which has some unfortunate effects in our homes! We do not do things for ourselves as we once did. It is not the cooperative enterprise it once was. There is always a specialist who can do those things for us, better than we can do them. But it costs more to hire specialists and the financial problems of keeping a home is far more serious than it was a generation ago. For instance, there was a time when we hoys largely made our own toys. A jack knife was about the only capital a boy needed. With it he could make his bows and ar - rows, his javelins, and his shingle darts—about all he had to play with. Today these things can be bought at a Woolwortn store, and so the father is obliged to buy the children's toys. The children don't know jwhat the jack knife is for; they have no idea of its constructive possibilities. When I gave my boys each a good jack knife, they promptly sold them for a dime and bought ice cream cones. And to - day Ijjhave in the attic about four bushels of toys in various stages of disrepair. I paid for them. ¦ i ¦ . ¦ ¦..,.", ¦' ¦ ...'-:¦¦¦... ¦ -I .:¦-.- ' : ¦¦¦;..'-:¦¦•¦¦.¦ There was a time when women could wash their own faces and necks.j decorate their eyebrows with a burnt match, curl their own hair, and trjm their own corns. Perhaps they did not do any of these things so very well, but we had some fair looking women in the old days. To - day we have specialists to do all these things, beauticians and chiropo - dist who reconstruct and streamline our women until we might say </seg>
         <seg id="p358">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that all women are beautiful now. If they are not naturally so, they can be reformed and reconditioned at the beauty shop. And the old man pays the bills. He is a specialist too: he is a specialist in paying bills. But the upkeep on some of our women is high and the strain of pro - viding for this upkeep has helped to bring many a man to hardened arteries, high blood pressure and heart diseases before his allotted three score and ten. You understand, I am not blaming the women. They mu3t keep attractive, and the experts can do the job better than they can do it themselves. It is a part of the machine age, but it has made the home prohibitive for an increasing number of men. And so we have more unmarried men and women, and in the cities an increas - ing number of childless homes—if they can be called homes. Our machine age has brought another problem in the home: the problem of preserving unity within the home itself. More and more it is done outside the home; more and more our people find their work, their recreation, and even their entertainment outside of the home. For some people, the home is not much but a place to sleep. Whereas once there were many things to be done in the home by the parents and the children working together, today these have been taken out of the home into the factory or specialized plant. The re - sult is that that family no longer has the unity and cohesion that it once had. Think there is a serious loss in this, although there is much gain. At one time the whole family would go to church, perhaps in the old lumber wagon, picking up neighbors on the way. I have seen twenty-one people in our lumber wagon by the time we got to church. Today with automobiles and good roads it is sometimes a pretty ser - ious problem to keep track of the children, but I notice that they don't seem to want to go where their parents go and I sometimes won - der if they go to places that are any better. At one time we used to have our spelling schools, our home talent dramatic plays, put on at the local schoolhouse, our singing schools and box suppers. Well, today there are some remnants of that type of common recreation, but more frequently the children will go to the moving picture show, where specialists in entertainment manage to keep them entertained. Here again is specialization, with its tendency to break up the unity that was once in the home. To be sure we have a much better grade ot recreation than we once had. Greta Garbo and Bette Davis and Wal - lace Beery offer better talent than the home boys and girls who used to play "East Lynne" and "Uncle Tom's Cabin"; but we have bought this better entertainment at a cost that cannot be ignored. Perhaps I appear to be idealizing the sort of home which is to be found only on the farm, and greatly altered even there; but there isn't much point to idealizing the good old days. In many respects they look better from a distance. In many respects the home, on the farm and elsewhere, is a finer institution today than it used to he. For instance there is growing democracy in the home. The husband and </seg>
         <seg id="p359">j I ¦; Nebraska Home Economics Association i ¦ .'- - '¦&#132;"¦¦ ¦ '¦ I father used to be also the boss, and that was one reason why the family had an ordered unity that looked good in some ways. When the boss started to wind the clock, the family was supposed to scat - ter for bed, whether they wanted to or not, and in the morning he set the | time and circumstances for breakfast. Children were supposed to obey, to do what they were told to do, without any unnecessary questions or objections; and they were sometimes beaten more or lessj—for their own good of course. No one who has studied pioneer life (carefully can fail to be shocked by thecrueUy of the early days especially cruelty to children. Today there is more democracy in the family, more freedom and independence, more kindness and more genu - ine affection on the part of all. The children have more to say about the jmanagement of affairs, and that is good training. Long years ago my wise old mother used to give us children a little garden of our own] which we could manage ourselves, and we sometimes made a little money on the stuff we raised; but whether we made money or justjjgot lots of exercise, it was good training. The authorities are pretty well agreed on the principle that use of force is a poor way to develop character and initiative that beating never made a bad child really good. jSome people say that these youngsters lack respect for their par - ents, 1 but my own guess is that they respect their parents more than the .children of a generation or two ago. What they lack is fear, andjjfear never made anyone genuinely good. Perhaps we used to overemphasize the matter of respect for parents, and for old folks generally I think children should respect their.parents if their par - ents are respectable, should honor them if they are honorable, should love; them if they are lovable; but there isn't any great reason for honoring people just because they are old. We don't do it with things, generally—with automobiles, for instance,, or clothes, or butter. 'But let us return to that most serious of all threats to the farm home—the shift of land ownership out of the hands of the farm op - erators. Clearly this is bringing a different kind of home on many farms, and one that can hardly be regarded as good. When I was a boy, nearly all our neighbors farmed their own land; today, in that same community, about half of the farms are operated by tenants. On our old farm—where father had homesteaded in 1871—we used to take great pride in keeping everything up in good shape, in painting the buildings in planting treeß—in making it an attractive home, because it was our home. And that Is good tor people, it is something construc - tive., For thirty years now this farm has been in the hands of tenants. They 1 are fine people, but they cannot be building up that farmstead for someone else. They cannot have the interest that we had. That old many gabled house can never mean to them what it meant to us. They can't have the same Interest In the school, or in the church, that we used, to have; for they are there only temporarily. And, where the </seg>
         <seg id="p360">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture neighbors are constantly moving about, there can scarcely be the stable social life that there once was in that neighborhood. I sometimes think that the problem of tenancy is the most serious rural problem that we have. We have somewhat the same drift in the cities, where the percentage of people who own their own homes declines steadily; but it is a less serious matter there. Home has never meant as much to city people as it does to farmers. So, in conclusion, the home that many of us have known is changing greatly, and will no doubt change move. It isn't the simple, stable, self-sufficient, family enterprise that some of ua once knew. With one function after another being shifted out of the home, with the world on wheels and more and more outside attractions to lure us away from our own hearths, the significance of the home is declin - ing. It means less than it once did; yet it is in many respects a finer institution than it used to be. There is clearly no possibility of going back, no way ot checking the drift of the modern age. The machine age has brought these changes, and our only hope is to think through all the implications to try to adjust ourselves as well as we can. There are serious problems to be thought through and solved, with whatever intelligence we can summon, for good home life is essential to the pre - servation of American civilization. MRS GARD: Thank you, Mr. Ise, for your fine discussion. We have, something more to take home with us.

Miss Liston can tell you more about these fine things that are coming on our program Friday morning. MISS LISTON: Sometime ago a college girl in another state went home for a vacation and when she returned she told her friends that she was disappointed in not being able to tell her father and mother more of the things that she had learned at college because they had already learned these things through Extension.

         <seg id="p362">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture THURSDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 14, 1030 i MRS. CLIFFORD ESHELMAN, Presiding MRS. ESHELMAN: We will please come to order. Most women love anniversaries. Today we are celebrating the twenty-lifth anni - versary of Extension. I have known Extension a good many years and it has done a good deal to help me. You see, I wasn't a farm girl and went to live on a farm when I married. I used to ask my husband how he knew the things about farming that he did and he said that a person just did, that was all. I wanted some books to acquaint myself with farming, but he said that he didn't like to think of his wife learning about farming from a book, but he had heard of a man in the Court House who had pamphlets on farming. I went to the Court House and got two pamphlets on poultry work. That was all they had to offer. That was my introduction to Extension. This afternoon we have with us a Custer county homemaker who knows some very interesting things, I am sure, about the early days in Extension here in Nebraska. She was the first Home Demonstra - tion Agent in Nebraska. I refer to Mrs. Esther Kellenbarger. THE EXTENSION SERVICE — PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE MRS. KELLENBARGER: It seems strange to those of us who were interested in Seward county home demonstration work in 1916 to realize we have attained an almost prehistoric importance. Of course the past twenty-three years have brought many changes. We have had staggering growth in numbers from the original members of 200 to 30,000 state membership, and many improvements in handling the work in an effort not only to do things more efficiently, but to give an ever increasing number of women in the stimulating experience of having an active part in club work. Yet in spite of the almost unbelievable development in the me - chanics of home denmonstration work the spirit has changed not at all. Those early Seward clubs were formed for the same reason we form clubs today, to have friendly local groups to study home problems and to have a way of meeting other women interested in the same subjects. The pioneering was done by Mrs. L. H. Diers, the first president, Mrs. W. H. Brokaw, the treasurer, Maude Wilson head of the women's extension work here at the college, and Charles Gunnels, the Seward county agent. The original setup was very simple but meant a lot of work for this group. When they hired the first agent in December, 1916, there were 200 women scattered all over the county who had taken out a </seg>
         <seg id="p363">' Nebraska Home Economics Association year's membership at $2.00 apiece, and who were organized in 16 pre - cincj clubs. These! clubs were free to plan their own meetings and the home agent was to meet with each one once a month throughout the year. She was to take the topics suggested, make out her lesson sheets, and, look up illustrative material and if she and the clubs didn't like the [results they had no one to blame hut themselves. The extension office at Lincoln was willing to help in any way possible,! but at that time no one kneW| what could or should be done. That first group had to experiment and see what would work out. jThe county agent, of course, had a car, but the home agent did not. There was money for neither car nor mileage. Each hostess was responsible for getting me to. and from her own meetings. Sometimes they came to the county seat after me, sometimes I caught a ride, and, sometimes I was met at the nearest railroad station and they hadjme on their hands for a full 24 hours. Since the women had plan - ned jit that way to save transportation costs I refused to worry about the wasted time and have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed those all day visits and came to know and like the individual members better than any [agent in these days of efficiency and speeding cars ha 3 a chance to do. '.¦"-¦.. ¦ ; ¦ .:.¦' : - " ¦.. ; I remember getting into one little town in the early evening and finding no'one there to meet me. I supposed they, would be. in-after the chores were done so I borrowed a Saturday Evening Post of the depqt agent and settled down to wait. It was nearly dark before I realized there must be a mistake somewhere and finally phoned. The voice at the other end of the wire assured me they had had no letter abou,t my coming and had all gone to bed. "Never mind we'll get you in the morning" went on the voice "You just go on over to the barber shop and spend the night". I turned in more or less of a daze to ask the agent the location of this barber shop hotel. He looked at me thbughtfully and asked me to wait a minute. Then he went and brought out the lady of the house who took me in and gave me one ot the happiest visits I ever remember. ¦'• :.' . ¦ ¦¦' .¦¦•¦¦¦•'¦-.-•¦• ¦','¦¦¦¦¦¦ jLesson topics that first year were pretty much what they are today. Meat canning was a fairly new thing* and we did it almost al - together by the waterbath or washboiler method. I did not even take a pressure cooker with me. Few women in the county had them and theyjwere regarded a good deal like a bomb, apt to explode at any minute. Anyway the big idea that first year was to make good use of the things we had rather than. to introduce new equipment. Cer - tain,things I learned through hard experience to take along. We had a lesson on simple dessert. It went very well 'for a meeting or so and then; I put together a plain cake with a tablespoon for measuring but - ter that was a little too big and cup for the flour that was a little too small. The shame of that cake lives with me still. I bought standard </seg>
         <seg id="p364">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture measuring equipment that very night. The women themselves contributed in many ways. Mrs. Greiner made her springerlie for us, Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Cooper demon - strated cheese making, and the kolachies of one bohemian neighbor - hood were something to remember always, though even much trying could not duplicate them. We held evening meetings in the country school houses over the county, not the movies of the present days but colored lantern slides, and the topics have not changed with the passing years as much, as you might think. We had pictures ol attractive and unattractive farm homes and discussed the value of tree planting and proper landscape gardening. County Agent Gunnels used to close his talk on the value of cooperative effort with the lines we still hear used so much "Let me live in the house by the side of the road and be a friend to man". Di - rector Brokaw who was county superintendent was even then laying the groundwork for the later development of 4-H club work as he talk - ed about better schools and better communities for our boys and girls. The annual meetings for the men and women were separate affairs. The officers of the women's precinct groups met in the spring for luncheon and a business session, and then in June all the women met for a program and an election of officers. The first year these meetings were held in private homes and our hostess made them real parties as well as business meetings, not unlike the county council and achievement day of the present. The men's annual meeting came in January, and in 1917 County Agent Chauncey Smith said the men wanted a dinner at their meet - ing. They would sell tickets at ?1.00 a plate and if the women would serve it they could have the proceeds to use for a car for the home demonstration agent. After a good deal of discussion it was agreed that if the men paid in advance we'd do it. If we got ready we did not want any storm keeping folks away and cheating us out of our money. The men paid up to the tune of $500. That looks impossible today when selling tickets for a banquet at 35(S is an up hill job, but the war was on, prices were high and so it was. Maybe you can imagine how we had to work. We borrowed dishes of every church in town and finally a church here in Lincoln let us borrow of them. The chickens were cooked the night before in the huge bakery ovens and the other things in improvised kitchen in the high school. Everyone con - tributed, every one helped. As it happened it did storm but whether because the meeting was important, or promised to be interesting, or because their dinner was paid for, at any rate the crowd was there and the women got them fed. We were some short of a price of a car but good friends made up the difference. It was a snowy January. Chains were put on the first time the car </seg>
         <seg id="p365">Nebraska Home Economics Association went out and stayed on for one reason or another for three solid months, while a scoop in the back seat was standard equipment. There was no starter and a number of times the radiator had to be thawed out .because there'was no such thing as anti-freeze. But it was a staunch little car and I only hope the girl who followed me was as fond of it , as I. , For the first year and a half the woman's work was on a mem - bership basis. Then the war came closer and closer home. Pood con - servation, wheatless breads and meatless meals were showing the homemaker's problems to be a county and national problem and the county board voted the money which made it possible tor every woman in the county to belong free of charge just as we do today. II have always wondered what the future of extension work would have been if it had developed in response to the every day needs of the people, as it began rather than rushed along by the various pro - grams made necessary by the emergencies of war, depression and drouth. Yet in spite of the pressure of circumstances the extension ser - vice ihas kept Its independence. The farm families who use It do so be - cause they want to, and because it can help them with some of their problems. The county agent and the home demonstration agent work only; where they are asked or where they feel sure they are welcome. This'characteristic is the foundation of their value. It makes for a flex - ablejprogram, one adapted to the needs of the locality, weather condi - tions and other emergencies. It is true, more it is a pity, that people as - similate and use to the best advantage the information of which they have' immediate need and as a result the extension service becomes a good deal like a first aid unit. When I went in Seward Co. in "19 the im - portant thing the county agent had to do was to show the farmers how to vaccinate for hog |cholera. If some farmer called him in when there was sickness among the hogs, and they were able to check the spread of the disease, then was fairly sure that the neighborhood would be back of extenso'n work in the future. It was a much more effective argument than any amount of talk, and the same thing is true today. They put in brusli dams where there is gully washing in the hills, sponsor demonstration plots of forage crops when the corn burns up, and then with the attention focused by the emergency measures they keep ( hammering away at what they feel are the basic needs, more and better livestock, community building and,other projects. ¦¦.' i: ¦¦¦'¦'¦'• •' ¦ -¦ ' -¦.'¦'¦¦¦¦' ¦ ¦¦¦ ¦ ' ¦¦ •. .

I </seg>
         <seg id="p366">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture work will take. It is the use we make of its help that determines its success or failure. In our part of the country, for example, we are realizing we must learn to live with adverse conditions. Otherwise we may starve while waiting for a good or even a so-called normal year. That being true we need to know how to balance livestock rations from newly introduced feed crops, to save all available moisture, and meet other practical difficulties. In the house the problem is a little different. By this time any farm housewife knows she must use cheap cut 3 of meat, utilize all the odds and ends, make over coats and hand-me-down clothes. Where we really need help is in keeping alive our enthusiasm for making inex - pensive foods taste good and look attractive, and in providing a variety which will appeal to the family so they will consume their vitamins and other food essentials because they like them and never give a thought to their humble origin. If possible we want the children to wear their made-overs because they are pretty and becoming, not because they are serviceable and cheap. Some way or another, adequately or in part, we do manage to feed and clothe our families. But when hard times come and fi - nances are a Chinese puzzle the place most of us cut down drastically is in recreation. Some of that, of course, is all to the good. Indiscriminate movie going results in seeing a lot of stuff that is to say the least, a waste of time. The habit at jumping in the car and going places two or three times a day can be a silly and expensive perfomance, and a radio that is turned on and runs all day, a noise without point is a nerve wracking strain. But when rural homes forgo the daily papers and their accustomed magazines, when the radio battery runs down and goes uncharged for months ,and gas for the car is rationed for only those necessary trips, then there can be a real danger to wholesome family life. There is danger that we will get ingrown, ignorant of the outside events that will influence our own living. Danger that we will deny ourselves friends and companionship and get so bored 'with, ourselves and oppressed by our woes that life will be a burden not only for us, but for our families is also possible. It is bad enough for grown ups to be worried and down at the mouth, but it is unforgivable if we let our children grow up in such an atmosphere and we do nothing about it. After all they have a legal right to normal social contacts, varied Interests, and an outlet for their energy and enthusiasm. Maybe our neighborhood appreciates the local project club be - cause for so many years we had none and had nothing to take its place. Folk 3 were friendly if they happened to meet which was seldom. Our church interests lay in three or four directions and there were even two threshing runs. Every one went to an occasional funeral but there our </seg>
         <seg id="p367">Nebraska Home Economics Association common: interests ended. Our project club has been meeting now for about eleven years and has made a lot of different reasons—a monthly P. T. A., various 4--H clubs—-and we know and appreciate our neigh - bors, have a good time arid go home refreshed. Garlyle Hodgkins writing in the World Herald speaks of this as - pect of the work.-He says that more valuable than the new ideas the alert farmer gets from the recent pasture forage livestock meetings are the inspiration and enthusiasm he takes home with him. "¦•I • : '•'¦¦¦ : 1 ¦'. ¦'•¦¦ ¦•¦¦•..¦.¦" I am just old fashioned enough to believe that even in these days of overhead planning and subsidized farming the farmer still gets pretty much what he pays for. In one of the children's books at home is this line, "You must have a silver penny to enter fairyland." Maybe if we'are to get the best from organization and neighbors and enter the fairyland of friendliness, help, and inspiration, we will have to pay with'the silver! penny, some of our time, our clearest possible thinking, and all the enthusiasm we can muster. The'finest thing any organization or group of people, can do today is to help this: country face the future with courage and with hope. : f ' ¦ JMRS. ESHELMAN: I am sure we enjoyed this a great deal, giv - ing the farmer and homemaker unbiased information. Farm women ask for lesson material they would like to have.

Ij wouldn't want to forget to mention how we were greeted at one farm where we were to conduct a hog butchering demonstration with two pigs and bo we jwent to work. We did the first and they pitched in and did the next one. If there is anything in Extension work that has impressed me is the attitude of those folks. It was "What have you 'got"?]-If you could prove it to them they were friendly and cooperative as any group you could imagine. I think that will be one of the es - sential features of the Extension program of the future. What I am going to say about the future may be the same old stuff, but just a different way of saying it. It may be like the teacher who was stressing </seg>
         <seg id="p368">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the fact that we could say the same thing but with different words. Little Johnny was asked to say this sentence, but to change the words a little without changing the meaning, "He was bent on seeing her." He said, "The sight of her doubled him up". In one of his Sunday afternoon radio sermons Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick made this statement: "Everyone has, or should have, two gods. One the God that made him —his theological God, the other god that he has made—his psychological god." The consideration of man's theological God, the God that made him, is no part of this discus - sion, but man's psychological god is pertinent to the past and future of Extension work. There are of course many kinds of psychological gods or goals or motives or ambitions that drive men to action. For some of the main purpose is to achieve power or position or wealth or publicity or the respect of his fellows, or the love of a woman or any of the virtues or vices. Our farming program has had a psychological god or goal toward which we have pointed most of our efforts. It has been the yardstick with which we measured new programs and changes in the old program. I think I know what that goal has been. It has been cash income. We have planned our work and then asked most search - ingly, "Will it pay?" There has been a good reason for selecting cash income as the chief aim in farming. Our past being what it has been, it would have been odd if any other goal had been chosen. Dr. Carl Taylor explains it in this way. He says that when our ancestors boiled over the Appalach - ian mountains and spread out into the forests and prairies they found what appeared to be inexhaustible supplies of timber and soil fer - tility. To make a living from this abundance they developed a definite creed. Dr. Taylor says that creed had three points: First, expansion or more. To make more one had only to farm more land or cut more timber. The second point in the creed was exploitation. Resources seemed limitless so there was no thought of replacement. The policy was one of harvest. To expansion and exploitation was added the last point, specu - lation. To make money one had only to own something and retain that ownership. Sooner or later It would be worth more. "Unearned, in - crement" the economist would say. This was particularly true of land. Then came the World War —the first one. Prices soared. There was a market for everything at unheard of prices. Farmers had more money than they had ever dreamed of. Cash Income was the goal and </seg>
         <seg id="p369">Nebraska Home Economics Association expansion, exploitation and speculation were the means by which it could,-be attained. Farmers industrialized their farms. They expanded, mechanized, specialized, speeded up. They began to push corn, wheat, hogs, and milk down the road to market in the same way that auto - mobiles are pushed off the assembly line. - i ¦' Then came the crash. When hard times hit the city, the assem - bly line stops and factories close. Workers are laid off and their fam - ilies must pinch and scrimp and do without until its time for charity. Whenj hard times hit these industrialized farms the roads to market choked and farmers were laid off. They and their families had to pinchjand scrimp and do without until they went on relief. Farmers had adopted the methods of the city and they had inherited the troubles of the city. I think they see now and—lf it isn't wishful thinking— farm folks are beginning to appreciate the falseness of their psychological god—jcash income. They are taking cash income from the throne and replacing it with "Family Welfare" which is the god they'really had in mind all the time anyway. And these farm families are changing the creed too—the creed that tjr. Taylor says had governed their farm planning all through the growing years.' In place of expansion, families, I believe, are putting efficiency. Not more production but more production per acre, per unit of labor, and with this, more quality or value per unit pro - duced. . .-'.V |•' ¦ ¦"¦¦.' / . ' : • - ' ' . . .-' i ' '.'¦¦'.

If it supports us and our son and our son's son, fertility must be maintained not mined. To efficiency and per - manence in the new creed they have edded security in place ol specula - tion.

In the end all broad plans break down into the same 'series of good farming practices.

         <seg id="p370">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Perhaps the only difference between what farm families have been doing and what it appears they are starting to do now is in the point of view. In the past we have been producing for the market—trying to grow things that others want. Now the family's guiding motive will be to produce things that they, the family, want. Instead of budgeting the yearly needs in dollars and cents and setting out to earn that much cash income, the family's requirements are listed and classified by items. Taxes, fences, clothes, vacation, books, coffee, etc., belong to the large group requiring cash. Their pur - chase still depends on the price of corn or hogs or wheat. The other group, including shelter, food and part of the fuel, depends not on world affairs or crop surpluses but on the work of the family itself. Onp of the strategic advantages of living on the farm is the op - portunity for the family to provide itself with mo3t of the essentials through its own efforts. No roof is leak-proof but any kind of a shelter is better than being caught in a blizzard on the open prairie. And farm families can protect themselves by seeking the advantages na - turally inherent in farming and capitalizing on them. What change will such a viewpoint make in your demands on the Extension Service? Quite a bit, I believe. For example: Here in Nebraska you have one of the best extension engineers in the country. You have used Ivan Wood extensively in helping select pumping equipment and laying out fields of corn and potatoes for irri gation. In the future more of you are going to come to Mr. Wood and ask him to estimate the flow of water from your windmill, to provide you with simple tools for selecting and ditching a nearby half-acre for garden. In the fall you are going to put 8 or 12 inches of water into the dry subsoil of that half-acre. When the frost leaves in the spring you are going to soak it again—water soaks mostly down rather than sideways. You are going to ask Hoppert and Hankins in Horticulture when to water growing tomatoes, potatoes and string beans; to find out from them that water is needed before the ground gets very dry and learn—to your delight—how much hot wind truck crops will stand if their roots are in moist ground. Plans for home-made chicken brooders will take up more of Mr. Redditt's time than planning equipment for commercial flocks. If 20 pounds of milk a day is needed to give the family necessary amounts of milk and butter, you will be asking Mr. Lawritson how many and what kind of old cows will serve you best and how can </seg>

"' , If a calf |s to be fattened for canning and freezing and some pigs farrowed and fattened so as to be available for pork chops at different periods of the/, year'more of Mr. Derrick's and Mr. Gross' time will be taken up in planning a feed supply for this "family herd" that can be protected against weather and pests. You are going to Arthur George and say "I have 160 acres, of which the east eighty is good, smooth farm land. If we are to main - tainjthe home, give the children their chance and provide a place for them to raise the grandchildren that east eighty •will have to do the job." Probably are right. You know your farm and your respect for that'more fertile eighty is based, undoubtedly on fact. Yet when Mr. George comes to working out a plan for you, one of your biggest assets will jprove to be that rougher, less appreciated west eighty. It will be needed for periodic use in rotation, for grass, hay, fruit trees, feed lots,| and other ways in which the basic cropping system , needs to be supplemented. I With the family welfare as the goal of the whole plan, cash in - come will be a basic part of its attainment. Yet the direct production of family needs by your own! bands, on your own land will be as important a supplement to income as the rough eighty was to the smooth one. I ¦ : ..: jYou often hear an athlete referred to as a "money player." That means that he plays best when the battle i 3 hottest. He is the type of person who l^nows all his abilities and resources and knows how to use I hem man emergency. Right now the battle is pretty hot out on the larm as it is everywhere else in this topsy-turvy world. There is need for a "money player" on every farm. One who knows all the resources that his: family and community can command and who has the poise and courage to use them to the best advantage. jThe particular character of the resources that can be used effec - tively will differ. I think a home-raised food supply is one of the im - portant ones. For you, greater diversification may be more potent, or irrigation, or more grass or legumes, etc. Probably a combination of several things will be better than any one alone. One resource that all ol us need when we come to bat Js the proper spirit. Walter Johnson of immortal baseball fame, 1b now broad - casting Washington's games in the American League. One day, des - cribing the strike out of a rookie player, Johnson said, "He struck out but he swung at the ball." No body ever got a hit with his bat on his shoulder, but Johnson added, "any batter is dangerous as long as he is in there swinging." Nothing can be added to that. </seg>
         <seg id="p372">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Another resource that we all need Is the proper amount of op - timism. We will have our grouchy pessimistic days, our downs as well as our ups but it we weather through most of the days must be col - ored by the thought that: "I like to farm. Sure It's hard work. Sure it's a gamble with the weather and market but what job doesn't have the same drawbacks. I like to farm and am willing to endure the shackles of farm life in order that I may enjoy its many freedoms." With that spirit and that point of view the initiative for plan - ning future extension programs will stay on the farm. You, through your local groups, will be coming to Director Brokaw and his staff outlining the needs of your community and asking for the extension men best qualified to help you do it. With family welfare as the goal you and the extension workers will not measure these new plans by the yardstick of expansion, exploitation and speculation. You will search them carefully to see if they make use of all the advantages naturally inherent in farming and to see if they are leading toward efficiency, permanence and security. MRS. ESHBLMAN: It has been nice being wih you and I am sure we all enjoyed Mr. Warner's speech from which we will get fine things from in the future.

Maybe we will get thi3 in the future. Mrs. Butts has a few welcome words she would like to give at this time. MRS CLORA BUTTS: Madam Chairman and Friends: When I talked with you I told you I was lost in Paris and that I went out in the street to talk with a traffic policeman. I forgot to tell you how I got back. I couldn't find the two girls. I wandered tor a while and then remembered the slip of paper the policeman had given me. by consult - ing this and turning two corners I found myself right in front of the American Express and found two women of the conference here get - ting their money changed. I started to follow them and later I saw those other two girls I had been with were following me! I would like to tell you about the music boxes from Switzerland. I was so pleased to have the five dollars from Miss Mary-Ellen Brown and the girls from her office which they said was to buy something that I liked. Mrs. Eustsler bought a very lovely bag with her money and as I had gotten a bag in Burwell before I started I didn't want to get a bag. 1 wondered all over Europe until Switzerland just what I should do with my five dollars. In Switzerland the little shops have a bell over the door. In fact, there seems to be musical gadgets on everything. Here is the music box I bought. It plays two Swiss tunes.

'.'¦-¦¦ ¦ .¦'.;. - iMR. ISE: As I look at the world hurrying by, I am more and more puzzled by the fact that few of the people who rush so impatiently from the cradle to the grave seem to have any definite idea as to what , they} hope to get out ot lite, or have any clear idea whether they are getting what they want out of their years of work and stress and hurry. I don't think most Americans are very happy, or that they really live fine or worthwhile lives; in fact I do not think most Americans know what they are after—unless it be the Almighty Dollar—and that therefore they don't even know whether they are getting what they want ornqt. It is true that they all want automobiles, picture shows, enough clgai-ettes to give; them the lift that they need and keep the girls kissable; and if there is money for it they might even want a home and a, few gadgets in the kitchen and bathroom, and perhaps a few sticks of furniture in the rest of the house. But beyond that, most people seem to me to have no plan of life, no definite theory as to what they want to get out of it, or why, no budget of their aims in life and their means of achieving those aims. Like the proverbial sail - or—who needs not, however, to be drunk—they spend their precious' years for this or that bauble or trinket, and finally wonder what to do with all the junk they have collected. -i ¦ ¦:.' ¦ ¦¦'¦ i ¦ . ¦ ¦ .. . ¦ , ¦ - . ¦ k think the building of a good life calls for a philosophy of life, a well! considered theory as to what is most worthwhile, just as the building of a house calls for a consistent architect's plan. Otherwise the structure, will be a piece of patchwork—and no patchwork can be beautiful, or for a long run, satisfying. No outsider can tell anyone what general plan he should follow, what shall be the general plan ot his life, but any outsider can tell whether the life has a plan or not, and whether the plan means anything definite. A man or woman may choose the-pursuit of wealth as the aim of life, and if so, must plan the details to fit the general scheme. Or he may choose the life of a scholar, but such a life has to be planned as a consistent whole. Jane {Adams, the great charity worker of Hull House, built a fine life around her work for the poor; but she knew what her scheme of life was to be, and followed it consistently. Henry Thoreau spent years working out a philosophy for a simple life, and followed it consistently to old age, a happy and even a famous man. </seg>
         <seg id="p374">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I am not here to offer any advice as to the choice of vocation. I assume that, for good reasons, and careful consideration of all ad - vantages and disadvantages, farm life has been chosen. Now, -what phil - osophy seems appropriate to the life of a farmer, or a farmer's wife? First of all, the farmer, like any other worker, should try to con - vince himself that he has the best life in the world, should idealize his work. Anyone who would live a rich life must pursue his work with the enthusiasm of a crusader. Sometimes this is hard for a farmer to do when, for instance, the hot winds are burning the promising corn crop, or when the wheat sprouts and dies in the dust of a dry fall, or when the pastures dry up and the cattle have to be sold—al - ways when prices are low. He has plenty of troubles, as I can well re - member from boyhood days in central Kansas; but those are part of the farm business. The farmer should think of his business a3 the great - est business in the world, just as all workers should. The teacher who doesn't think he is in great and glorious calling should not be teaching, for he not only will not enjoy his work, but he will not do it well. The doctor who can't find great joy in curing the sick and relieving the suffering can scarcely become a great doctor. Any man who fails to honor his work, will fail to do it well. I have a deep suspi - cion of the man who despises his work, and does it only for the sake of monetary reward, for I know few such who do really great work. If I read the pages of history understandingly, all great and enduring con - tributions have been made by men who so loved their work that they followed it for its own sake, and not as a miserable means to a desir - able financial recompense. Shubert loved to write songs, Steinmetz loved to experiment with electricity; Lindbergh loved to fly; and a good farmer must generally love and honor his calling if he would be happy and successful. He should love the soil in which he works, the plants that grow in his fields and the stock that he raises on the farm. Professor Hibbard once said that the reason many southerners couldn't carry on dairying successfully was that they "had no respect for a co-w". I remember a farmer who always hated hogs because "the damn brutes were 30 stubborn". It is easy to imagine what kind of hogs he had. The farmer should love his work, and the things he works with. I often wonder how much joy the average farmer finds in living close to nature. To me, when I was on the farm, it was about the great - est satisfaction in life, to see the sun rise and spread his glory in the eastern sky—farmers really see the sunrise often —to smell the new - mown grass or the blooming alfalfa, to feel the quietness of the farm, when there are no sounds but the restful cackling of the chickens, and perhaps the cawing of crows down along the creek, to be right down close to nature, as primeval man was for thousands of years. I think there is something that satisfies one of the deepest yearnings of </seg>
         <seg id="p375">| Nebraska Home Economics Association the hjuman spirit, for if it were not so why would men so often, on their jvacations, try to get back to it again, away from the trivialities and artificialities of city life? Why would they tramp miles in the cold, jthrough mud and snow and brush, over rocks and hills, on a hunting trip? Farming is a hard life, a rough life in some ways. It means exposure to cold and rain, or perhaps the sizzling heat of sum - mer; but man was designed for that sort of life. I don't think that man was created to sit at a desk all day, or to stand behind a counter; and when he has to do such work, he is only half a man, for the other half, the half that means strength and endurance and ruggedness, atrophies with every passing year. The farmer should take delight in nature, should study nature, for his is the world of nature that God, and njot man, made. I sometimes pity my boys. They are comfortable, it is true, for the thermostat is set at 70, but they were four years old before they could tell a horse from a cow, and my son, graduating from the University this year, I swear I don't believe he knows wheat from oats, ply boys never had to hoe in the garden, but they have never watched things grow. They never saw the first fuzzy melons on the vines,; never lovingly and anxiously watched them grow into the lus - cious fruit of August—as I did. They have had a couple of dogs, but dogs are hard to care for in the city, and the boys never had the fun of watching little ducks and chickens and pigs and colts that served for me as a farm boy the purposes that Woolwortb. toys serve for them.,My boys have missed some hardships that I saw, but they've missed a lot else that I think was good for me. i - ¦ . . ' '¦¦"'." The farmer's philospohy cannot generally include a lot of things —luxuries, trinkets,: geegaws, or even comforts. He must not aim for the trivialities with which many city people litter up their.. lives, for his income does not permit him to buy them. And furthermore, they are not a part of good life. The fullness of life cannot be found in things, but injour own souls. The philosphers are agreed on that. The kingdom of God is within you, if it is anywhere. The farmer must usually live a ratheri simple life, and he should try to find happiness in it, rather than strive to buy more things than he can afford. I often wonder it all the automobiles; that sputter up and down the roads have really added;to the farmer's happiness. The youngsters seem to think the highest joy in life is to be found in driving rapidly from one place to another that looks just like the first one; hut the automobile has played; its tragic part in bankrupting American Farmers, and I am not sure these fast-moving youngsters are any happier than the boys and girls who used to drive horses in my day. At any rate, I see a lot of young people out west in the mountains in August, riding horses while £heir automobiles stand in the yard—perhaps because it costs more to ride horses, or perhaps because they really like it. I once spent several years studying pioneer life in central Kansas, and jail the old folks i taiked with believed that they had just as much fuh as people </seg>
         <seg id="p376">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture do now. It seems that we must have cars, but many people pay heavily for them, in security, solvency and peace ol mind. It seems to me that farmers would live happier lives if they would try to find a Stoic contentment in simple things, instead of scheming and sweating to buy a lot of things because some others have them. As professor Warren once said, a farmer can live cheaply if he lives simply, but if he wants all the modern conveniences and in - conveniences, he must pay more than a man in the city. It Is fine to have a furnace-heated house, and running water and electric lights, if one can afford them, and farmers should demand of congress such a balance between farm and city that more farmers can have such things. They are entitled to them. But until farm incomes rise above the present level, many even of these conveniences are too expensive for many farmers; and I insist that they are less important than they seem. I insist that my mother was just as happy when father bought her a new kitchen range, with a nickel-plated door, as my wife was when I bought her a white enamel electric range. In the old days when I was a boy, my brother was Just as happy with his new bicycle—one of those bicycles with the front wheel higher than the boy—just as happy as my boys would be with a new car. These new gadgets and gimcracks are good in a way, but they don't make the best part of life, and they don't even save as much labor as many people imagine. Last summer my wife wanted me to take the family to the mountains for a month or so, and can you imagine why? To get away from all the work of caring for the house, with all its labor-saving devices! We have about all that are made—gas furnace,electric stove and refrig - erator and sweeper and mixer, motors to about everything, and thermostats to regulate everything; but my wife found that a cabin in the mountains, with a cave for refrigeration, a cute little wood - burning stove, and a broom to sweep with, was much easier to care for. My old mother sometimes longs for the old log cabin that was her first home in central Kansas—because it was so easy to keep in order. I don't mean to say that all the pretty, shining conveniences and decorations of our machine age are of no value, but that they are not the most essential things, and may be bought at too great a cost. The farmer's philosophy must lay heavy emphasis on the value of freedom, for he has more freedom, in some ways, than anyone else in our society. He is bound to his work, to be sure. The crops must be planted, and cultivated on time, the stock must be fed, the cows must be milked; but it is better to be bullied by nature than by man, and the farmer is freer in his intellectual life than anyone else I can think of. The farmer can think what he pleases, and say what he thinks; he can be a Republican or a Democrat or a Populist; he can be a Metho - dist or a Baptist or a free thinker, and it won't hurt his business; he doe 3 not have to be smiling and bowing and kotowing to people whom he would like to kick into the middle of next week. Freedom is a </seg>
         <seg id="p377">Nebraska Home Economics Association /¦'!'. ¦¦¦.:.¦' . :¦ ¦ ¦ ¦¦¦.¦¦¦ " ¦ ..':.• : precious thing. Some of the philosophers say it is the greatest of all goods. Long ago the American colonies fought a long and costly war for freedom, and few of us -will say it was not worth lighting for. Freedom is one of the greatest blessings because only a free man can truly be a man. I believe that if farmers could work in a factory for a while, punch a clock as they come and again as they go, take orders from the straw boss, and wonder all the time whether they would still have their jobs next week, they would appreciate their freedom more, jln fact, I often think what a blessing it would he if all of us could try the other fellow's job a while! Most of us would come back to our own job with fresh appreciation. I'remember well the time that my tenant came in with a world of discouragement in his face, and in his conversation. He was tired of farming. Surely it was the worst business a man could be in! I asked him if he would prefer to teach, and he thought it was a better life, although he didn't think he was quite qualified for my particular job. 1 1 let him sit down at my desk, and showed him my job—which for seyeral days had been that of checking commas and semicolons in the manuscript of a new book. . He said, "Do you have to bother with such things?" "Surely. Every comma and semicolon and period and quotation mark should be correctly placed." ¦"¦JVell, I hadn't thought of that. I guess there are worse things than farming.". '¦':['' ' ¦ i ¦ . -. ¦ ,- I [had cheered him up a lot. He had been thinking that farmers had all the drudgery. The freedom of the farmer means freedom, not only to think his thoughts honestly and to express them freely, but freedom from temptation to most forms of dishonesty. The farmer's philosophy must be that of square dealing, for in his work there is generally no profit in any other sort of dealing. He cannot hoodwink a field into pro - ducing! corn, he cannot misrepresent; to his horses the feed he gives them, he cannot, by any advertising campaign or slick salesmanship, persuade his cows to give more milk. Nothing but intelligent planning and hard work will avail him, for he is dealing with forces that are immune to everything else. . .-.¦•¦.¦¦(: ;¦¦¦•..¦¦.: • .;.¦•¦¦¦.'.. :;: ¦\. .;: V: ¦ •.. ; &#132; . Next to freedom, the farmer's philosophy should include an ap - preciation of the value of security. There is plenty of insecurity in farming, to be sure, but—aside from debts and mortgages, which farmers should always avoid—the insecurity in farming arises from the whims of nature, which are easier to bear than the whims of men. On the whole, farmers who are not harrassed by debts enjoy more </seg>
         <seg id="p378">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture security than most other workers. Perhaps 90 per cent of the retailers fall in business within a few years; ten million laborers are without jobs today, and a few years ago there were fifteen million tramping the streets looking for jobs, with no certainty that they would ever find them; nearly half the banks have failed that were operating ten years ago. Farmers do better than most of these. Most farmers do not make any profit, but if they live simply they can eat. In the world where everything seems topsy-turvy and the wisest men can't tell us what is ahead, this seems important. It is true that farmers have suffered greatly during the past twenty years, perhaps more than many other classes, and the future of agriculture is far from clear, but I can think of no other class that is in a better position to survive the years of turmoil that I believe I can see ahead. Independent merchants are being crowded out by the great chains, laborers cannot be certain of jobs, for it seems likely that we will have several million unemployed for the indefinite future, banks are up against the competition of several kinds of government banks, and seem unable to get loans. In a break - down of our complicated economic system farmers should suffer less than most other classes, because they alone can live largely on their own resources. They may have to scrap some automobiles and other machines, but they can eat. If I were a farmer, I should think it a necessary part of my phil - osophy to cultivate a keen interest in my home and family, for the farmer lives more at home with his family than most other men. I sometimes think that only on the farm is there much left of the real home, as I once knew it. Farming is a family business, in which all must cooperate, for the general good of all. Here on the farm there is something for all to do, some responsibility for even the young children, picking up cobs, bringing in wood, feeding the calves, or later milking the cows. During the day the family may scatter, but at meal times, and at night they are generally at home. The family is together much, and so it is very important that there should be al - fectlon and comradeship among the members. It is different in the city. I don't usually see my boys at all in the morning, for, as in many families in town, each member gets up at a different time, grabs a few morsels of breakfast, and hurries off to his own business. Some - times the children are at home when I return from my work at noon, but usually they have eaten their separate lunches and are ready to go again. So my wife and I eat our lunch alone. At night—well, at night I hope they are not in any mischief, but there are lots of places to go, in town, and our town youngsters don't bother us at home as much as I would like. Since I see so little of my children, I suppose it wouldn't be a tragic matter if I didn't get along beautifully with my boys; but a farmer who hasn't much love in his home has a lot of unhappiness bottled up in \hz small space of four walls. </seg>
         <seg id="p379">f Nebraska Home Economics Association i ' : ¦ ¦ . ¦ /" ¦ ¦ . " . -" ¦"¦¦'. -- ' " In this crazy world of ouva there is a -widespread notion that work of evil, something to be avoided. Among our so-called better classes there is even a common notion that it is not even respectable for women to work. So we have our warnings against dishpan hands, our insistence on long fingernails—l think that fashion must have arisen in an, effort on the part of the women to show that they didn't help with the milking—our habit of wearing dress suits and corsets and high heels—anything that would Indicate that we don't work. Now work I isn't an evil, and men and women don't find moderately hard work but on the contrary like to be busy at something, like to be active and useful The psychologists and philosophers agree pretty well on this; the farmers philosophy should include a re - spectful attitude toward work, a grateful appreciation ol the fact that he has interesting work to do, and plenty of it. Pew men and women have as wide variety of interesting work as the farmer and his wife. Their work isn't generally routine, humdrum; it isn't turning nut number 347 on a Ford car, or skinning the hind leg of a carcass in a packing plant eight hours a day for twelve months in the year, or sewing tongues in shoes, or laying one brick on top of another. The farmer's work changes several times a day, and it changes with the seasons. Every day there are chores as well as the main job in the field, every spring there is planting to be done, and later the culti - vation and harvesting; in the winter there are chores and odd JOO3 and ordinarily some leisure. The housewife's work is rich in its variety and in its amplitude, with pie housekeeping and cooking and washing and ironing and gardening and the raising of chickens and children, with the button - ing and unbuttoning, the coaxing and spanking of man's perennial progeny. If work is a blessing, she is surely blessed. The great economist Alfred; Marshall says that the fullness of life is to be found in the ex - ercise |of as many and as high faculties as possible, and I can think of few ( workers in the world who exercise, more faculties or higher faculties than the farmer's wife. If she allows herself to fall into the habit pf envying the town women, with their greater leisure, their well-manicured nails, their afternoons around the bridge table, she may well be unhappy; but if she looks upon her manifold duties as a challenge to her faculties, as an opportunity for great service, she may live a full and rich life. After all, while some leisure is essential, too much is not good for most people. If leisure were the great good, a hog jwould live the best life, for he has more leisure even than the pampered, powdered and painted parasites that preside over some of our upper-class city homes. My mother raised twelve children on her farm near the dust bowl in central Kansas, and it wasn't exactly a picnic most of the time. Now, at the ripe age of eighty-four, she still works hard, not because she has to, but because she knows the solid satis - faction; of working, of modest achievement in her own field of activi - ¦ ¦ ! .' . ¦''¦¦'¦¦:¦.¦ " V •]¦'"¦ ¦¦¦ '¦¦¦.

Sometimes people venture to sympathize with her for the hard life she led on the farm, but she will have none of their sympathy; and she is right. She has lived a good life, and has the solid satisfac - tion of looking back upon much hard work well done, of having earned the unstinted affection of her children for whom she worked. So, in conclusion, I aay that a philosophy for farmers should emphasize the fundamental value of close contact with nature, the adequacy of a plain and simple life; the priceless privilege of free - dom and honesty, the comfort of reasonable security, the opportunity for a wide range of activities. He and his wife have seen hard times in recent years, for some of them, heart-breaking times; but I beleive that a well thought out philosophy of life may help to make even the hardest life seem richer. MRS ESHELMAN: I know that all of you have missed Miss Mary- Ellen Brown and a good many have asked about her. She was hurt Monday night when a car hit her. One elbow and arm was bruised and she is at the Lincoln General Hospital. We thought it would be nice if different friends would send her cards at the Lincoln General. Hos - pital.

GARD: This will be the last time that we can have Mrs. Tullis sing with us on this year's Organized Agriculture program. I know we have all enjoyed having Mrs. Tullis with us again this year. The group sang "Joy to the World" and "Silent Night". MRS. GARD: Thank you, Mrs. Tullis. I believe the singing of these Christmas songs has made me more conscious of the holiday season. We have another fine treat at this time. Mrs. Nellie May Schlee Vance will tell us about "Taking Pictures to People".

There was a blackboard, soiled ; walls and two pictures that have been unforgettable in my memory. j The first picture was of three'monkeys and carried the thought that j there, was nothing as delicious as ."Arbuckles Coffee". The other pic - | ture stated it was the compliments of a local undertaker and I found j that it covered a rat hole. That was the way I found the small school I house when I was teaching. ! First, let me say that I feel there ia a real need for art in the I everyday life of the American farm. The sort of art in which I am j most Interested is painting; I have discovered a keen and eager ap - j preciition of good paintings in rural America. I Second/there is the problem of getting these pictures to their j apprefciators. Conditions of drouth and depression by reducing farm 1 income have cut off from many farmers any access to books and mag - azines; galleries are Inaccessible to most because of distance. j Third, we have made a plan in Nebraska whereby pictures can j come [to people. The loan of exhibits from the galleries of the, Uni- J verslty of Nebraska to rural communities and small towns/ has been | successfully practiced for three years. These loan exhibits differ from the usual exhibit in that they are accompanied by an interpreter whose business it is to introduce people to the art of enjoying pictures. A | special Rural: Traveling Gallery is available to country schools through I cooperation with school authorities. None of the plans for this work in introducing art into everyday life are complicated or pretentious ; the response has been whole hearted and enthusiastic. -''r.-:¦* ¦: . ; ¦ ¦ ¦ People need something beautiful and stable in their lives. The man who said, "I will look unto the hills, whence cometh my help", expressed not only a religious conviction but a profound psychological truth. jWe who live on the rolling plains cannot look toward the hills; we look at the tremendously varying and unpredictable landscape of the sky. \ : . - ;i- &gt; '•-¦- ¦'¦;¦¦¦:¦ i'^\ ; For enduring, unchanging beauty, the thing that gives us emo - tional j security, -we need pictures. A great picture is a moment of peace and reality in a world of haste and change. I have with me an exhibit such as goes put into the rural schools. Each contains one original, one etching reproduction and several prints for the one room school. I go out to the teacher's institutes In the various counties to instruct the teachers of the way these pictures are to be used. They then procure the pictures for one week from their county superintendent. These mountings have been made by students in classes at the university and the originals have bjeen rented from the artists. I will pas 3 these pictures so that all may see. ..'; , : </seg>

Aaron Douglas was a colored boy who worked his way through the University of Nebraska He now lives in New York City at Sugar Hill which is a famous negro settlement there: He is famous for his murals he has done in the United, States Treasury building at Washington. This picture was bought by the Nebraska Art Association about seven years ago. His work is very much appreciated and especially in New York Today. Some of these pictures are only prints, but we don't have to go a longjway to see things that are really heautiful. They are just near us.

         <seg id="p386">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture old man with white hair and very wrinkled. I saw a janitor look at that picture all the time. He later came in and said that he used to know a man that looked like the one in the picture. He looked again and said, "The painter knew how to make the wrinkles—the old cuss!" There are many stories ot the things that are said when they are exhibited and so much understanding through these pictures. I will, briefly, give the names of the other pictures, but I will be glad to discuss these with you at the close of the meeting. The large picture with the lovely warm colors is "Flemish "Wed - ding". I can tell you an interesting thing about this picture. Once when I had this exhibited for the school children 1 told them what we had thought were the various characters present for the wedding, and how they could see the barn door that had been removed to provide a tray. I mentioned that we didn't know just where the groom was in the picture. A mother who had come to the exhibit with the children came to me and said she was Flemish and that it was the custom in that country for the groom to pour the wine. So, you see we learned that this man in the lower left corner of the picture was the groom. Toilers at Sunset" is a print by Millard Sheets. The portrait by Copley is by an American artist, but like many of his time had to go to England because very few people in America were spending such large sums for portraits. You will notice the drapes used are very similar to the practice used in photography. "Good Coasting" i 3 an original by Dwight Kirsch as is "Mean Day" by Kady B. Faulkner of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. This picture I am sure is a familiar sight to many of us, as it was made as if out of a window near the courthouse. The snow and sleet effect was achieved by running a razor blade over the canvass. Next, is a reproduction by Charles Burchfield, "Promenade". "American Interior" is also a reproduction and is the work of Charles Sheele. The shadows in this are beautiful. Thank you.

Delicious Foods for Dry Years : • i Mr. Willard Waldo and Dr. Rebekah Gibbons DR. GIBBONS: The main emphasis in this demonstration will be placed on the human use of ground grain sorghum: as cooked hot cereal either plain or toasted before cooking, as ready to eat—popped, puffed or as a home prepared ready to eat product; as pancakes, muf - fins, (biscuits, cookie 3, quick ; breads, of yeast bread; as mush; in scrapple—even as a sandwich spread. Mr. Willard Waldo, County Agent from Franklin will tell of his experiences in grinding and using such products. (Green soy beans will also be demonstrated. There are a few varieties of this" vegetable which are especially palatable for human use. Several varieties grown here in Lincoln without irrigation made fair yields when other varieties of beans were complete failures. The soy beans used before they are ripe are very palatable. They taste much like green limas and have the additional advantage that they mature late when there are few other fresh vegetables. The women will be told of the cooperative tests being made by the depart - ments of Horticulture and Home Economics in an,effort to develop strains of potatoes of high culinary quality which are particularly suit - ed tojconditions in Nebraska. They will be surprised at the differences in flavor and texture of different varieties of potatoes) and in the mark - ed influence which the place where the potatoes are grown has on these jfactprs. They will taste a delicious Bliss Triumph grown in the western part of the state and an almost inedible sample of the same variety grown under poor ; horticultural practices 'here in Lincoln.

Some women prefer one and some another, but most women do not realize how different they taste until they have an opportun - ity to sample them all at one time. MR. WALDO: No doubt many of you are as surprised to learn that I am appearing on this program as some of our local Franklin county people were when they came to me and mentioned that they had seen my name listed on the personnel to appear on the Organized Agriculture programs, but could not find the particular division in which I was to appear. Of course those individuals had looked through the program of practically every division except that of Home Economics. The topic which I have been assigned to discuss with you brief ly this morning concerns Delicious Foods for Dry Years, an(J this re - fers to the use of sorghums. No doubt most of you are familiar with the fact that sorghums are a rather drouth resistant crop and they have been increasing in popularity quite rapidly in south central Nebraska, the area in which Franklin county is located, as well as other parts of the state. During the past eight consecutive years rainfall in our county has been below normal. Tests and trials by farmers have shown that in many cases sorghums have yielded fairly well in comparison with corn and other crops. In fact, during several of the seasons corn has been practically a failure. It was in connection with this increased interest in sorghums that a second annual Field Day was scheduled at Frank - lin this past spring. Tests in feeding livestock sorghums were con - ducted in connection with this big meeting as well as the meeting the year previous. It was in connection with the plans for this meeting that we first thought of the use of sorghums for human food. It was Dr. D. L. Gross, our Extension Agronomist here at the College, who first gave me the idea that sorghums might be worked into the menu for the day. A free lunch was to be furnished to some 1000 persons attending the meeting during the noon hour by the Franklin Chamber of Commerce and the Hevner Serum Company, one of our cooperators. Mrs. Waldo and I started doing a little trial and error work with the hope of discovering some way of making the meeting a 100% sorghum meeting by working sorghums into the noon menu. An old dilapitated grist mill, purchased by one of the local farmers back in the World War period for use in grinding flour was borrowed. A sample of good quality Sooner Milo was selected, cleaned and ground as fine as we could grind it. The following morning the sorghum flour was used in making pancakes. Somewhat to our surprise they were found to be quite palatable. We experienced some difficulty, however, in getting our 4-year old son, Arlie, to try the cakes. He remarked "Dad has been feeding sorghum to the hogs, the cattle, the sheep, the chickens, and now he is trying to feed it to us." </seg>

Over 1000 persons were served pancakes as a part of their lunch during the noon hour. iAnticipating that there would be several requests for the flour, 1200 one pound sacks were prepared and distributed, along with the Suggested recipes for preparing pancakes and muffins, at the close of the day's meeting. During the next few days numerous requests from, distant points were received for the flour and information per - taining to its use. Samples went to practically every county in Ne - braska, as well as to the adjoining states and Minnesota. ¦'¦ t.'...'¦ ;'; '¦¦ •'-. - , ; ¦ ,-¦ ¦ ¦ ¦;.- ¦ r jThe Waldo family has tried three different varieties of sorghums and !we have noticed no particular difference between them. They include, in addition to the Sooner which is quite a popular variety in our section, Day Milo, one of the better combine types, and Pink Kafir, a variety fairly resistant to the Chinch Bug, and a good yield - er for southeastern Nebraska. However, as far as definite recom - mendations on varieties is concerned, as well as* methods of prepara - tion jof various food items. Dr. Gibbon is in a much better position to give information than I am. I might say though, that the sorghum flour has been used for pancakes, waffles, muffins, hot cereal, pop corn, hominy, and bread, a product similar to corn bread. Personally I consider the muffins and waffles made of the sorghum flour to be the most delicious. There is one additional food item in which I would like to use sorghum meal and that is scrapple. The next time we butcher our.scrapple will be made of the sorghum meal rather than corn,meal. No doubt many of you recall the dietary adjustments which were [made in respect to National Food Administration demands dur - in 1917 and 1918. We all hope that such a thing will not be necessary either in the immediate or distant future, but in case such an emerg - ency arises, I am" sure that we Would find sorghums an excellent sub - stitute for some of the other cereals. This, at least, is the opinion of the editor of one of our daily papers who reported his experience with the use of one of our samples of flour last spring. I would like at th{s time to mention another use of sorghums which was made by one farm woman in our county the past summer. She used Day Milo, a variety growing two to three feet tall, for planting around the farm jhome. The sorphum was planted around the foundation of the house, along the walks and drives, and also to shut oil unsightly views! such as woodpiles, trash piles, etc. Although sorghum might not serve as the most desirable landscape plantings, I believe we will :":¦'[¦¦-'¦'¦¦¦¦. : - '¦¦'¦¦¦'¦'¦ "::¦ \ :. ¦¦ ¦••:¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p390">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture all agree that a home can be made more attractive by their use than would it be with no plantings of any sort. I might pass on a suggestion or two that we followed in making our flour from sorghum. First I believe one should use good quality, well matured grain. The grain should , of course, be thoroughly clean - ed before grinding. This can be done by using a good fanning mill. If such a machine is not available just as satisfactory results cau be ob - tained by pouring the grain from one container to another, prefer - ably on a windy day. By letting the grain fall through the air for a distance of two or three feet the wind will blow the chaff and light grain to the side, and the good quality, heavy grain can be caught in the container. The grain that is blown out does not need to be wasted, but can be used for the poultry or livestock. There are numerous ways of grinding grain. I mentioned the grist mill, which is available on many farms. Flour mills can be secured at a reasonable cost. I was surprised to find that even an ordinary food chopper with a fine blade could be used. The newer type coffee mill also can be used. In preparing the flour for a meeting last spring where samples were distributed, an ordinary hand mill was used. It required some time to clean the machine before grinding the flour, but it was an easy job after this was done. We used the finest screen available and reground the material. I might say that in using all the machines mentioned, I have usually found it desirable not to get the grain too fine the first time, but to run it through as many times as necessary to obtain the proper fineness and uniformity. A man stopped me on the street of a city outside of our county the other day to tell me that he had just taken 100 pounds of Sooner Milo to the mill to have it ground into flour. Several farmers in our county have been observed this fall in preparing the product for table use. If you have not already tried the product, I would suggest that you do so for I am sure you would find it very delicious. * * * Delicious Poods for Dry Years Ready to Serve Sorghum Breakfast Cereal 2 Cups home ground grain sorg- 1 teaspoon salt bum 1-3 cup molasses or sorghum 1 teaspoon soda syrup 1 % cup buttermilk or sour milk % Cup sugar Combine as for pancakes.

Many questions about wood finishes and cleaning methods were asked. Most of these were discussed and answered by Miss Steele and the women. It was suggested that the floor be darkened by staining and have the rug about the same color value and plain or nearly plain. This will make the floor inconspicuous and harmonize better with the other furnishings. Having the floor darkest gives a substantial feel - ing and serves as a background for furniture. Painted woodwork was suggested where architectural features are not pleasing or well placed. By choosing a color that was as near the color of the walls as possible .would minimize poorly placed win - dows. It is important to select curtains and drapes which would not call attention to windows that do not balance or are poorly spaced. Have the background color of the drape the same as the walls and the other colors not too striking. The subject of making curtains was also dis - cussed. It was suggested that lining drapes makes them more durable thicker and give them a richer look. In a small informal living room this is not necessary. The length of the drape should be according to the height of the ceiling or the width of the windows. For high ceilings and narrow windows the drape may come to the edge of the apron. If the ceiling is low and the window wide or if there is a group of windows, make the drapes escape the floor by one inch. </seg>

At these sessions we try to have something about which both need to know. At this time Mr. Ross Miller is going to talk 'to us on the subject, "Know Your Meats". It is a pleasure to in - troduce Mr. Ross Miller of the Department of Animal Husbandry ••' ;'»:V. '-¦ ;:¦¦'¦; . ¦•'¦; / ...; . ; .: :. . KNOW YOUR MEATS •I ¦ *¦...¦.-;¦' : . ¦ •¦ .¦ ¦ ¦ : ¦ . ¦: MR. MILLER: In discussing the subject, "Know Your Meats" which has been assigned to me it would seem that if the average con - sumer definitely knows a few of the more important points to consider in thje purchase of meat, we would have almost 100 per cent satis - faction, among the consuming public. There are three factors which the average consumer should consider in the selection of meat for the family diet: (1) They should have some knowledge of the kinds of meat)available; (2) Some knowledge of the various cuts of meat; (3) Some'knowledge of quality of meat. There are four different kinds of meat, depending upon the an - imal [from which it originates, namely beef, pork, lamb and mutton, and yeal. The average consumer should have some knowledge of the type of meat each of these animals produces, however, I do not intend to take up your time with a discussion of these various types of meat as no doubt all of you are quite familiar with the differences between these, various meats and their uses. .! To go on with a discussion of cuts, I have here three charts showing yariojis cuts derived from beef, pork, and lamb. Carcasses of each of these, animals are divided much in the same manner. First, the thick muscles are divided from the thin muscles and the tender, or lazy muscles, are divided from the less tender, or working muscles. Let us loifi. at beef for a moment. The muscles from the back and the hindcLUarter of the animal are more tender than the muscles from the foreqjiarter of the animal. For the most part the cuts of beef from </seg>
         <seg id="p394">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the hindquarter of the animal have a smaller percent of bone, which usually appeals to the average consumer. I do not want to imply that because this factor the cut from the hindquarter are the best cuts to purchase in all cases. Professor Loeffel will no doubt have more to say about this later on in the program when he discusses, "Getting the Most for Your Meat Dollar." The hindquarter of beef is divided into three main commercial cu t s _the round, the rump and the loin. In good quality beef nearly all of the rear half of the beef is used in the form of steaks. Round steaks differ from steaks from the loin and can be easily distinguished by the conformation of the muscle and the bone. There are four muscles of the round and there is this small round bone, while the steaks from the sirloin have a much different muscle structure and different bone structure. I have here a round steak and a steak from the sirloin. You will note the difference in the muscle structure and difference in the bone and amount of bone in these two steaks. Also from the loin we get the T-bone steak and club steak. In the T-bone we have this same eye muscle as we do in the club, but we also have the tender loin mus - cle which differs somewhate in size, depending upon just where the steak was taken and we do not have this particular muscle showing up in the club steak. Turning to the forequarter we find there is a larger proportion of bone, especially in the chuck, to the amount of muscle tissue. Most all of you are familiar with the rib roast from the beef. In this roast we have the eye muscle which is one of the more tender muscles in the beef and the rib bone and part of the backbone and vertbrae. Go - ing on to the chuck we find we have two different types of roasts com - ing from this particular commercial cut, namely the crossarm chuck roast and the rib chuck roast. Occasionally from top quality beef, steaks are cut from the region of the chuck that furnishes the cross - arm chuck roast. Besides these cuts I have hurriedly discussed, we al - so have the neck, the brisket, the navel end and the flank. Muscles through this particular region are less tender than the muscles through the cuts I have discussed because they are what we term as the working muscles. My limited time will not permit me to discuss these various cuts. Turning to the pork and lamb we find that much the same type of cuts and meat are obtained from these two animals as from beef. For example, here is the T-bone steak from the beef, the loin chop from the pork, and the loin chop from the lamb. You will note the similarity of one to the other, the main difference being in the size of the animal from which each of these cuts is derived as well as the differences in type of lean and fat we find in these three animals. Rib chops or roasts from pork, rib chops or roasts from the lamb show this </seg>
         <seg id="p395">; Nebraska Home Economics Association same similarity to the rib steak or roast of the beef and so on through - out the entire carcass. (Now let us discuss the quality of these various meats. It is a recognized fact that fat is necessary tor quality meat. A certain amount of fat is very desirable although excessive fat or wastiness is objec - tionable. Sometimes it is very difficult to find just where fat ceases to be a virtue and becomes a waste. A cut of meat should be thinly and uniformly covered with a firm, creamy white fat. Most generally the cut of meat that has a sufficient amount of outside covering also shows a sufficient amount of marbling or intermixture of the fat with the lean. This marbling or intermixture of fat with the lean generally assures the; purchaser more tenderness, juiciness, and better flavor. The meat from the young animals such as yearling cattle and lamb show re - latively little marbling. In properly finished pork we find we have a sufficient amount of fat intermixed with the lean, even in our younger animals. Another factor that helps to determine quality of meat is tex - ture of meat or fineness of the grain. Consumers popularly associate tenderness with fine texture. Within every carcass there are fine-grain - ed muscles and also coarse-grained muscles. The color of the lean is an important factor in determining its commercial value. Beef and lamb should be of a bright cherry red color. Dark lean is generally objectionable to most consumers. Uniformity of coloring is also of some importance. The color of the fat i 3 another factor that should be con - sidered in determining quality of a cut. A creamy white fat is de - sirable. Objection is raised to a yellowish-colored fat. In the selection of beef and lamb a bright cherry red color of lean and creamy white color of fat and a reddish cast in the bone indicate that cut has been taken from a carcass that was fairly young and properly finished. In vjeal and pork more of a pink color is looked for and the fat should be : X .-¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ '' '¦'¦'¦,'--.:'¦¦"':' ¦ -'¦¦'¦¦ ¦¦¦•'¦¦¦'¦ ;¦..•¦ Jl am wondering how many times you have been guilty or have seen some of your friends who have been guilty of going into a market and saying, "Give me 25 cents worth of that."; 11 hope that with these few remarks that possibly'you will have some better knowledge of what to call for and what to look for the next; time you go to your market to purchase your daily meat supply. iMRS. GARD: Thank you Mr. Miller.

Depart - ment of Agriculture in Washington. We are very happy to have him </seg>
         <seg id="p396">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture this afternoon to give a demonstration on "Cutting Meat for Canning". Mr. Warner. MR. WARNER: Ladies and Gentlmen: This is a continued story. There are three local people and one from out of town. Notice which does the work and which does the talking. I want to review the principles as Ross Miller gave them. You are all consumers. There are three classes; one goes into the store and ask 3 for 30&lt;f or 60&lt;J worth, the second group dress their own beef at home and are interested not only in making quality but in us - ing the meat and cutting it up and preserving it. The third group is made up of county agents, home agents and teachers and those who are interested in teaching others to do the job. I will try to carry this part of the story and get ready for Miss Peters and Mr. Loeffel. I will try to summarize this so that all of you have a background. Usually, we find the younger animals are more tender. This ap - plies to hogs, beef and lamb. They must have finish to have tender - ness and to be juicy. Good breeding is also very important. The dif - ference between a beef animal and a dairy animal might well illus - trate this point. Then there is aging, or ripening. Most of our meat stays in the cooler at 32°, or at least it should, for a week or ten days. This is not true of pork. We like to use pork as soon as cool. The last thing to consider is the cut. What kind of muscle do we want? We might be interested in cooking it in a slow oven, quick fire or frying pan. Certain muscles are thin and less tender and are made more tender by slow, moist cooking, such as boiling or stewing. The other muscles can be cooked more quickly. We shop then with the way in which we plan to cook the meat in mind. For the demonstration we are only going to use a forequarter. The topic is "Cutting Meat for Canning" and I want to make this an easy way. I have found it the easiest way to teach someone else, to show the wholesale cuts and the retail cuts. You folks probably won't be doing thi3 but once or twice a year and I believe this will prove practical for you to see how this quarter can be cut and boned. It is an easy job to take bones out of retail cuts to can. Folks say they use glass jars here. If you do use these containers you will have to break the meat into rather small pieces. We are going to take this front cut and break it up as if going to prepare for home use on the basis of the chart and kettle as well as the oven and frying pan. This is the thin sheet and here in the thick lean. We are going to take off the shank behind the elbow. If you cut meat at home I recommend you use this same method. Here is a large piece of the same kind of meat ready to use. There is the thfn plate to cut down across the front of the chuck. Here is the brisket. </seg>
         <seg id="p397">:¦;¦¦¦ Nebraska Home Economics Association i . . -¦ . i. , ¦ ¦ . a pilece of meat you can cook the same way. We have only thick meat left, pot roast, oven roast and if you want steaks. The front quarter is simple. See the five ribs on the chuck. Why? That is about the place where the thick, less tender, switches into the thick, more tender muscles of the rib. That would make good steak and a roast right here by it. Here I will put it all together again. Here we are short of lean. Here is a home raised food supply in a way the average farm family can fight the drouth. One of the beßt ways 1 know of is for a family to raise their own food. They will have a chance to release the money that is spent for food for other necessities. If they do this they are making themselves more independent of other dic - tators like Mr Hitler, Mussolini, and others. Everytime we get someone to make more meals out of a side of beef from a home produced food supply we have made a real bit of progress 'Now all we have to do is get it ready to put in the can. Cut it like jit is to be ready for the retail market. Mrs. Jones wants a small two jib roast. Here it is. Set it up like this in the oven and put a ther - mometer in it and give it a slow cook. It is easy to brown. Slip the spinil processes out and make spare ribs. It is a bonesless cut ready to wprk up any way for the canning you want. You, say, too much meat on the bone? That is right. You can cut those fingers out and grind up or crack the bones and cook the meat off. We can do the same things with the rest of it. Cut into small steak for frying or boiling or bone it like the first piece. You have heard of corned beef and cabbage. Here is where the corned beef comes from, just rough out these ribs. Open it up and keep the knife against the bones. Here is a boneless piece to roll or cut and make.hamburger and here is the other piece to bone. Here is the plate. Remove the diaphram, and then you have left a piece of all one kind of meat. The short ribs you can cook until the meat come^ off the bones and put meat into cans, or you can rib off the meat as you care to. Here is the shank. I am not going to take the tjme to bone it. I will do the easy parp as I don't have time, to do the hard part. See these .bones? It is easy to take out to grind or make pot roast out of it. The chuck is at the end of the rib. I am going to take out three ribs. It will make the chuck rib a little shorter. It makes it nicer to handle in the kitchen. It is a good deal like the plate, a good braising piece. You can slip ribs out as you want to. We have left here a nice, compact little roast, a solid piece of meat.' If you cut closer and closer to the neck that is closer and closer ito the grinder. You can bone this piece I cut just like ribs with very little You don't have to know much about how the skeleton is ma^e all you have to do is to follow to cut out these bones. We do the same |on the other side of the cut. Here is a boneless piece to fry or </seg>
         <seg id="p398">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture roast. The same is true on chuck ribs and cross arm. We cut right here through down to the rib. A cross arm roast is a lovely pot roast. You can take out this straight bone if you care to. Through the chuck you finally get to the neck and here is a great, big mean bone. It can be boned out but I do not recommend it. I will see if I can unjoin it. The easiest way is to unjoin it about here. A real butcher would have a fit, but you do it once or twice a year and you have to do it as easy way so rough it out. You can put it in a pressure cooker. Here is a boneless piece and especially good for mince meat this time of year. You can bone it out in sections. So if you are buying meat over the counter you should have a pretty good idea of meat you have selected. If you people who are work - ing up meat at home you have a fair idea of the muscles and how to cut them up. If you are going to can it go ahead and make retail cuts. You see how simple it has been to get the bones out, so don't let that bother you. If we can get this meat produced and cured right on our own farms and prepared so the family will like it, I don't think I would worry much about the weather man. Thank you. MRS. GARD: Are there any questions? Mr. Warner has watched his time so well we have a little time to spare. The question was asked by one man as to what was the effect of pressure cooking on meat. MISS PETERS: Perhaps I can answer your question in this way, that the less tender pieces are successfully cooked in the pressure cookers, but the less tender pieces often have the connective tissues in this distenegrate in this process of cooking and become stringy and do not hold the meat together. Another question came from the group, "Is it better to bone for freezing?" MR. WARNER: If you bone it, of course, it takes up less room, but it should be tied up so little surface is exposed to the air. MRS. GARD: Mr Warner made it seem very simple to cut up meat. We are always glad to learn more about the home produced food supply. Miss Peters is here to tell us about meat preservation. Miss Peters is Associate Professor in the Poods and Nutrition Di - vision of the Home Economics Department. MEAT PRESERVATION BY CANNING MISS PETERS: I would like to see freezing lockers a possibility for every farm family in Nebraska because they would save so much time and labor and make possible superior products. Several years </seg>
         <seg id="p399">I Nebraska Home Economics Association ago a rural homemaker remarked that she thought she had added nfteeii year to her life when she had eliminated the task of washing meatj jars. ' : l -¦ ' '.'•!.'¦¦¦¦.¦• ..¦.-¦"¦.•.."¦,'•'¦ However, to many families the rental fee for freezing lockers seems high, and also many are situated so far from the locker plant that it is not feasible to avail themselves of this service. Even people whojuse freezing lockers may like to can some meat so it will be convenient for use in case of emergencies. So there probably will continue to be a considerable quantity of meat canned in a large proportion of rural homes. Meat canning involires a good deal of work with an expensive food product so it is important to employ methods which will insure that the product keeps; well and that it will be safe and as palatable as possible. When meat (spoils, the loss of both product and labor is involved. In order to insure the safe keeping of meat, it is necessary to overcook it. Therefore, I would suggest that the choicest and most tender cuts not be canned, since they will be overcooked to a greater extenf; than will the less tender cuts. Last year we had a letter from a rural' homemaker who stated that she had canned some very high quality beef loin and that she was very much disappointed with the results because it was very and would not hold together and also was very dry instead of juicy. She wrote that some of the less desirable cuts had really made better canned meat and she was at a loss to understand the reason. However, her results are just what should be expected. : j In canning meat, it i 3 desirable to aim for as much variety as possible in the canned products. Beef, pork, veal and lamb may all be caimed in various ways (1) The meat may be cut in individual sized servings and packed in the jars raw, Raiting each piece. No wa - ter is j added and a piece of fat or suet is placed in the top of the jar (2) Tjhe meat may be precooked in water before packing in the jars or cans and some of the water added. (3) The meat may be seared or browned either in a pan on top of the stove or in the oven before packing in jars or cans. No flour should be used for dredging the meat and no water should be added, but the pan drippings may be used. |(4) Small pieces of meat may be canned with the idea of using the product of stew or meat or vegetable pie. (s)The widemouth jars are desirable for canning rather large pieces of meat. Cut the meat approximately the size and .shape of the jar and pack either raw or brown- before packing. This meat may be reheated and served as pot-robst or braised meat. (6) the best way of using the beef brisket is to corn it and after it has been in the pickle for ten days or two weeks', it may be canned. This is excellent to use for baked corned beef hash. (7) The bones should be cooked and the broth concen- </seg>
         <seg id="p400">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture trated and canned for soup. Vegetables may be added to the broth and canned with it or may be added when the soup is being prepared for the table. The meat from the bones may be canned with the broth or made into mince meat. (8) Sausage may be made into balls which may be browned in deep fat or may be stuffed into small casings, link sausage fashion and canned. So it is possible to have desirable variety in canned meat particu - larly if alternated with cured meats so that there need not be the monotony that many people complain of. The Eureau of Home Economics, U. S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D. C, recommends that the only method which should be used for processing meats is the pressure cooker. However, the use of the pressure cooker in itself is not absolute insurance that the meat will keep. The pressure cooker must be In good working order,. it must have an accurate gauge and it must be used correctly. Under these circumstances it is possible to secure a temperature sufficiently high to destroy the spores of the B. botulinus in a relatively short time. After the meat has been processed it is important to have the jars or cans perfectly sealed in order to exclude all air. The jars should be cooled by leaving space between them. Tin cans may be cooled by placing them in cold water. The jars should be stored in as cool a place as possible. In canning meat one should be certain that one understands the reason for every step in procedure, because with so much money value and labor involved, every possible precaution should be taken to in - sure the meat against spoilage. MRS. GARD: We appreciate the message Miss Peters presented us. This is one 3ource of food supply that should be more widely used. "Getting the Most for Your Meat Dollar" is another topic to be brought to us this afternoon. Mr. Wm. J. Loeffel, Acting Chairman of the Animal Husbandry Department, will tell us how to stretch our meat dollar to get the most out of it. Mr. Loeffel. GETTING THE MOST FOR YOUR MEAT DOLLAR MR. LOEFFEL: Meat is predominately a protein food. In other words, the average consumer when she purchases meat is interested in meat primarily for the "red meat" or the lean which it contains. This protein is important in the diet of adults for the repair of those tissues in our body which are constantly wearing out In the case of children this protein is important for the growth of muscle, nerves, bone, and connective tissue—not to mention skin and hair. Meat </seg>
         <seg id="p401">j Nebraska Home Economics Association contains from 11 to 20 per cent crude protein and may I say here that it isinot only one of our good sources of protein but it also contains pro - teiniof high quality. Meat also contains mineral salts of various kinds and.it is significant to point out that much of this mineral matter is found in the lean rather than in the fatty portions. iMeat also contains some fat. Pat is a splendid food, providing en - ergy, in fact, a pound of fat will produce two and one-fourth times as much energy as a pound of sugar or of starch. It is undoubtedly trnej that people today are not so much interested in the energy value of meat for the machine age has lightened the' physical labors of mankind and closed' cars and fur coats protect him froni the rigors of the weather. It has always appealed to me that fat a3 a; source of energy is rather costly since this energy can frequently be Secured more cheaply in cereal products than in the shape of fats.] We should keep in mind, however, that a'certain amount of fat in meat is necessary for it improves the eating quality of the meat. Fat jmakes meat more tender, makes it more juicy, and gives it a delightful flavor. : il do not believe that it is possible to lay down any general rules which will apply in all cases. The wife of the office worker might probkbly want an entirely different kind of meat from that desired by the wife of a laborer doing hard physical outdoor exercise. The cooking equipment available in the household also might determine likes; and di3likes. Perhaps equally as important is the amount of money available in the budget for food and particularly for meat items.;- ¦ ¦¦\ ¦ \ . '¦¦ . ¦ :¦¦ ;-., •;•¦.¦,'¦ '&#132;..¦¦.¦¦ Difference Between Species: Pork on the whole will run fatter than will beef, lamb, or veal. It might be'added of course that pork fat l^as perhaps a wider domestic use and therefore ii little surplus fat on roasts might bej saved and used as drippings in other cookery. Pork is the mo3t populat meat in the American diet, making up approximat - ely % of the meat(consumed. I am,wondering to what extent its popu - larity is due to its cheapness and to what extent it is due to its appeal. Doubtless the fact that there are such a wide variety of pork cuts, man£ of them available not only in the fresh but in the cured form, makes it popular meat in the American menu. I think over a period of years pork will average substantially lower in price than beef and this.fact may also account for the larger per capita consumption. Lamb meat is not a particularly popular item oh the American mend. The consumption is particularly small through the Middlewest. In point of cost I think lamb must be considered more or less in the same 1 category as poultry, that cost is frequently higher than that of beef and pork for it has a flavor that some people think they do not like. With lamb it has been my observation that there is no middle </seg>
         <seg id="p402">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ground. It is either liked very thoroughly or it is equally as heartily disliked. Veal is becoming more and more popular with the years. Perhaps the quality of veal is improving and then too it provides a lean meat which is so eagerly sought for by so many consumers today. It is usually tender. Sex in beef: In Great Britain heifer beef is considered fully as good in quality as steer beef, whereas in many parts of the United States heifer beef is discriminated against. Army regulations, for example, permit only for the use of steer beef. It has been our ob - servation that heifer beef is equal to steer beef in every respect. a is true that heifers fatten more readily than steers and that heifer beef would fatten more readily than steers and that heifer beef would be fatter under comparable methods of feeding and management than would steer beef. The answer, of course, is not to feed the heifers as long. I think we are seeing a gradual breaking down of the pre - judice against heifer beef, particularly where the heifer 3 hare not been fattened to the point of wastiness. Grade: Beef grades are determined by shape, finish, and quality. Perhaps the most important factor determining grade is finish, cover - ing, or fatness. For example, in a series of carcasses studied we found choice grade averaging 38 per cent fat in the side, good cattle 27 per cent, medium cattle 21 per cent, and the plainer grades down to 14 per cent. We find the protein content in more or less the reverse order—the choicest side of beef containing 13.7 per cent of protein in the edible matter, the good 16.3 per cent, the medium 17.5, and the plain almost 19 per cent. Our present system of grading therefore cor - relates closely with the percentage of fat. This fat as I have suggested improves the eating quality of the meat and perhaps to that extent we are justified in making fatness one of the important criteria of grade; however for the buyer who wants protein, for the buyer whose family dislikes fat, grade is not a satisfactory basis for buying. Influence of cut: We find a wide range of composition in various cuts of beef carcass. The following table which I have taken from U. S. Department Circular 389 on a carcass of medium fatness will serve to illustrate this point: </seg>

There are times when these so-called cheap cuts are good economy and there are other times when some other cuts, even at a higher price, are a much^ better buy. I think that the best advice which I can give in pur - chasing meat is to buy what the other person is not wanting.

         <seg id="p406">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture LADIES; BE YOUR BEST By Mrs. Altinas Tullis A wonderful world is opened up to those ladies who make a sin - cere effort to always be at their best. The one who is at her best radi - ates happiness—her happiness—to all who come in contact with her. Happiness is a rebound from health so this becomes a No. 1 mat - ter to be given our very diligent attention. For most of us health i 3 not a difficult treasure to attain. It is the reward for repeated little at - tentions to our body's needs. The common cold grips those individuals who eat recklesssly of heavy, starchy foods and pay too little at - tention to adequate rest. So much of the discomfort and unhappiness resulting from the common cold can be avoided by making good health a habit. Morning and night, a gargle in a hot salt solution made from diluting one teaspoon of salt in a pint of good warm water will pro - tect that valuable body of yours. Mental and Spiritual Health Health goes farther than things physical. Of equal importance is mental, and spiritual health. Again health in these fields is a matter of habit —contentment becomes ours through habit. Try a simple little exercise every morning as your feet come out from under the covers and touch the floor. Make that face of yours burst forth with a genuine smile and make your voice resound with a "This is a wonderful day; it is my day. This is the important day of my whole life". Telltale lines will begin to leave your face —your family, friends, neighbors will want to be near you. Your personality becomes a thing of radiant happiness. Spiritual happiness is the result of turning in the invisible world which surrounds us all. Vibrations radiating from our bodies project our thoughts and our very life to all who but tune in this invisible world. In it there is no time and space. Close your eyes and think of a beautiful spot you have visited. Whether it be next door, in Paris or London; it conquers space and is right there with you. Music, too, has vibrations. The love song stirs romance in our soul; the martial march stirs us to stand up and sing. Mixing With Others The meeting and mixing with other human beings is an art. It need not be a lost art in this, our land. Many foreign people notice our ignorance of fundamentals in the art of meeting folk. Mrs. Sims reports the conversation with a lady in Italy who said there were three things the American woman almost universally did on entering a room. One was to make a desperate thru3t to adjust shoulder straps, </seg>
         <seg id="p407">Nebraska Home Economics Association the pther was to drop into a chair and throw one knee over the other - the |hird was to hurriedly dive into the purse/bring forth a vanity and proceed to powder their noses. i ¦ v " ¦ ' ¦'•-.'¦. jA lady knows her slip does not show, that her hair is in order and that her hat is at the right angle before she enters a room to meet her hostess and other ladies. Arriving for the afternoon tea she is not hurried in any movement. She hesitates upon entering the room and in so doing locates her hostess, her various friends, and the chair to which she is going to proceed. She chooses -a chair suited to her kneej length; one that permits her feet to touch the floor. Overstuffed chairs are taboo; it takes a derrick to get out of many of them. When the right chair is found, the lady proceeds with perfect poise straight to that .chair. Her body is carried erect. Her head is up as if supported by a,lovely ribbon from the ceiling. Her chest is square. She does not walk; on her toes, neither does she walk on her heels. The halls of her feet carry her forward with the rhythmic ripple of charm the re - sult of perfect poise. When sitting, the lady insists on her elbows swinging freely so she can accept the tray without a struggle of awkward adjustments. Her back is straight and not against the back of the chair. Her knees are not crossed but straight down so without effort or change she can immediately glide into a standing position. Her pocket-book and gloves are neatly arranged on the lap so the tea tray is supported as by a table. ¦: Jealousy and Gossip Ijluch happiness in the world is sacrificed to two monsters- one fereen and the other black. No one can be at their best who worship at the shrine of gossip and jealousy. The truly lovely people the world remembers are .those who do not only refuse to repeat ugly gossip, but wjho, in addition, refuse to listen to others who indulge in it. Both gossip and jealousy are the result of an unclean mind. Neither serves a useful purpose on earth. They but hurt, injure beyond repair too many r times, and tear down the character of both those who indulge and those whom they maliciously attack. Gossip and jealousy act as a boomerang that in the end swings back to cut down the one who throws out the venom of the Black and the Green. The healthy mind will have nothing to do with these terrible pastimes. Summary briefly summarized, our appeal is to be happy and bring happiness to others. This is best done by cultivating the habit of health—spirit - ually, ;mentally, and physically. Two gargles a day keep old man "cold" iway.,A smile tunes your soul into the glories of "Today". Perfect poise i- '¦¦ ..'.¦'.-."- • ¦ .¦ ¦ ¦&#132;'¦¦-¦¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p408">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and po3ture make for lady-likeness that becomes an inspiration to otherß. Project your personality into the lives of those who come in contact with you as a beautifully trained master, through his voice or piano, projects his soul into the invisible world around us all. And with all, neither listen or repeat the ugly and unhealthy untruths of Green Jealousy and Black Gossip. HOW THE MOO COW PAYS FOR NEW THINGS . By J. C. NISBET Associate Editor, HOARD'S DAIRYMAN American Opportunities for Profitable Agriculture A real success seldom comes to the man who is not imbued with the thought that he has the best job in the world and that he is in the most favorable spot to carry out his chosen field of endeavor. Farming i 3 no exception to the above thought. If we on the land become carried away with the feeling that farming is not a job worthy of us or that we are not in the right country in which to farm, we are never going to get far in solving problems that are very much with us. There is n growing popularity and attention being paid to the speakers and writers who in the bold glib manner proceeds to point out what is wrong with America. These same speakers are not only out to destroy the America our pioneer forefathers have built, but they go so far as to make necessary the adoption in this land of "isms" of all sorts that have swept Europe and other countries in this world in which we are living. Now if these "isms" can prove a millenn - ium beyond which our form of government has been able to bring, they possibly should receive our very careful study. But the very evident result of other systems and "isms" has not been anything that should cause us to proceed with the wrecking of America. The somewhat facetious, but all too true, definitions of a few "i3ms" is presented here as a sort of a review of what the result has been, — SOCIALISM has been defined this, —If you own two cows, you give one to your neighbor. COMMUNISM — ,It you own two cows you give them both to the government and the government gives you back some of the milk. FASCISM—,If you own two cows, you keep the cows but give the milk to the government, who sells some of it back to you. A NEW POLITICALISM in this country—,lf you own two cows you shoot one, milk the other, and then pour the milk down the sink. </seg>

Let'stake a little inventory of what we have in this America of ' ours..- •¦¦'¦¦.'¦.¦./. ¦¦'¦¦.. ¦¦¦•- First let us see just how large a country we have. You may be surprised to learn that America comprises but 6% of the total land area of the world. As for population, we have but 7% ot alljthe people of the entire world living within our borders. iW for a look into what this small group of people in this coun - paiatively small country actually own. So far as railroads are concern - ed, we own 32% of all in the entire world. If its autos, we find 76% of all automobiles are owned in America. There are 33% of the world's radio;broadcasting stations, and A 4% ot all radio sets owned in our country. Sixty per cent of the world's telephones ara in use in America. ¦ ! ¦ - - ¦ ¦ '¦- .- '• . ¦' ¦ .¦'¦¦¦ America Produces ¦ ¦ ¦ .¦¦¦¦..¦ ¦¦-¦ ¦ / . - America leads the world in producing goods; sixty per cent of all oil; forty-eight per cent of all copper; forty-three per cent of all pig iron; forty-seven of all steel; fifty-eight per cent of all corn and fifty-six per cent of all cotton is produced right-here within America's borders. As compared with the most advanced countries of Europe we own tjwice as many homes, per 1,000 population, in America. Further we use four times as much electricity and, finally, we drive seven times as many automobiles. We have something in America. We have things away above and beyond what any other country or any other system has been able to even approach. .: America Consumes When we take inventory of what America consumes, again we are appalled by the tremendous amount of world's goods that get into popu - lation's handß and homes. We consume % of all the rubber manufactur - ed in the world; V* of all sugar; % of all silk (hats off to the ladies) • one third of all coal, and two thirds of all petroleum. In the depression year of 1933, America spent 3 billion dollars for educational purposes. This was more than what the rest of the world (together spent on their schools. In this, our land, we have 30 million children enrolled in public schools. We have invested a total of </seg>
         <seg id="p410">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture seven billion dollars in public and private schools. A total of 4 billion dollars is invested in universities and colleges. Another 4 billion dollars is invested in churches. No place on the face of the globe has prosperity beamed so fully as in America. The inheritance that is ours is far greater than that of any spot on earth. Our forefathers, through the days of hardship, and danger, stuck to the American way to build our homes, schools, churches, roads, and factories. Can we in comparative luxury be so cowardly as to say we cannot run this inheritance the American way? We're in the Right Spot Dismiss from your mind any thought that there is a better place on earth for you to be operating your farm business. Dismiss from your mind the thought that some day a system better than the American Way will drop in on you to solve your problems. Dismiss from your thoughts the further untruth that government can legislate you into being a successful farm operator. You and you alone, cooperating wherever possible with your neighbor, are going to solve 90% of America's farm problem. Before turning the job of improving your farm business to one who would say all we have to do is increase farm prices, look squarely at the fact. The average income of folks in this, the most favored nation of the entire world, is about $500 per capita per year. The average wealth is about $3600, only $59 of which would be in cash. The bal - ance might be a ton of feathers, someone's tractor, a brick from the Woolworth Building, etc., etc. Prices of farm products cannot be raised above the ability of the consumers of America to pay. The only possible result is a lot of I. O. TJ's a tremendous reduction in goods sold, or a shift to substitutes not gen - erally produced on our farms. True, we need salesmanship, marketing, better distribution, and greater attention to quality in getting as high a price as the consumer can pay, but here is no place to stop in solving America's agricultural problem. Efficiency a Necessity Efficiency must become the theme song of the farmer who would receive greater income from his farm business. Here is where the big promise of reward really lies. It may be rather readily illustrated by using dairy cows as an example. Cows are not the only farm enterprises in this great land of ours. They do happen to be the biggest, but what we say about efficiency applying to them is directly comparable to every other type of farm enterprise. </seg>

It takes but four good cows to bring in sufficient money to buy the washing machine. It takes a total of 140 poor cows to do thia same thing, Poor cows, poor crops, poor methods of farming can never sell their produce at sufficient price to make them bring in the money nec - essary to make farming a profitable enterprise. Efficiency in all our various farm interests is the real answer. ... ¦' j ; ¦ ¦ '¦•..-.¦ .' ' '.¦ ' Cooperation and Friendship Of equal importance to material things is the opportunity and necessity of farm folks getting together and learning to cooperate and help each other accomplish things that singly never could be done, rrhe value of the friendship that we have time to form on the farm is another immeasurable but vastly important reason why we stick to our guns out on the soil. Thia side of agricultural life is very well summed up in the poem which depicts the life of two staunch tillers of the, soil from early manhood up through the time where one then the other must move on to better land. i THEBROKENMNK ¦ I called him John—he called me Jim ( Nigh fifty years that I knowed him, -| And he knowed me, And he was square | And honest all that time, and fair; | I'd pass him mornings coming down j As he'd be driving into town, I'd look up in that same old way, j Wave a hand, a smile, and say; .

And when I got froze out one year, He dropped in on me with that queer Big smile, on his road to town, And laid two hundred dollars down, And said: "No interest—you understand, No notes." Then he took my hand, And squeezed it, and drove away. 'Cause there wasn't nothing else to say; 'Cept—"So long John" —"So long Jim." And when John's boy came courtvn my Sue, John Just smiled, and I smiled some too, As though things were acomin' out As if we'd fixed them just about: And when Sue blushed and told me, why I just chuckled on the sly, Sod John.

This year that ambition was realized when our team won in the judging competition at the State Fair. It was very interesting to tour the city, to visit the high lights of Chicago, to see the beautiful Christmas decorations, and to rub elbows with members from every section of the country, even Canada. For me this has been a grand week that I know I shall never forget, and I wish to thank you again for making it possible. Sincerely yours, (Signed) Beatrice Gorham Story of Chicago Trip by a 1939 Representative Janet L. Ebers After the 1939 State Fair I eagerly awaited the day we would leave for the 193 9 4-H Club Congress at Chicago. That long looked for day finally arrived and I left my home and family on Saturday, December 2, 1939, at 7:30 A. M. I arrived in Lincoln at 8:20 A. M. and left for Omaha at 9:00 A. M. When I arrived in Omaha we met some of other Nebraska represent - atives and went to station KOWH in the World Herald building. Here a few of the representatives broadcast. Our first thrill since we left home awaited us when we saw Cab Calloway and hi 3 "Swing Sistah" in person. He gave all of us quite a thrill especially when he rolled those eyes and talked in his jazz language. From KOWH we went to station KFAB where two other champ - ions and I were interviewed by Mr. Prisbie, Nebraska state 4-H Club Leader. Following this we went to station WOW in the Woodmen of the World Building. A few more champions broadcast here while the remainder of the delegation viewed the beautiful studio and the building. One thing that happened to us which I can assure you I will never forget was the fact that there was too heavy a load on the elevator. We stood in the elevator thirteen minutes moving neither up nor down. This is a thrill that comes once in a lifetime. After dinner in a cafeteria, we went to the Union Station where we awaited the arrival of the rest of Nebraska's delegation. At 6:30 P. M. we had a banquet in the Union Station dining room where we be - came acquainted with each other. Immediately following this we boarded the train at 7:15 to leave for Chicago. This was the first ride on a train for a large number of boys and girls and the first ride in a Pullman for a much larger number. The boy 3 and girls had get acquainted games before going to their sleepers. Whether very many slept or not that night, I can not say for sure, but from the sound of </seg>

We had our break - fast lin the Harrison cafeteria. After being assigned to hotel rooms we went to the morning service at the First Methodist Church of Chicago. This was a very inspirational service for beginning our week. After dinner the Nebraska boys and girls were given their symbols or insignias to wear. They; were cornhusks with a red N on them red feathers with a white N on them, shucking mittens with a red N on them and little green and white stocking caps with Nebraska banners on them. We certainly were proud of all these. Every 4-H boy and girl at Club Congress wore these little stocking caps with their own states banner attached. : ¦ r ." ¦ ¦ - .' ;-¦•.¦ ¦.

Monday morning all contests were held and all boys and girls not in contests went to the livestock show. Since I was in the Food Preparation judging contest, I reported at Auditorium Hotel for the contest. There were 34 individuals or 17 teams competing. "We were through at 10:30 A. M. Only ten minutes were given to judge a class. It was a great experience being in a national contest. Monday after - noon we went to the great Medinah Temple to be guests of Thomas E. Wilson. During the afternoon hours we had some wonderful entertain - ment. What seemed most thrilling to me was the famous radio star. Uncle Ezra and his Hoosier Hot Shots. Other high lights of the after - noon's entertainment was the presentation of some world famous people such as the sport 3 editor of the Chicago Times, No. 1 amateur tennis champion, a professional golf player from West Virginia, girl tennis champion, and the best high school football player that ever lived. On Monday evening we were guests at the 22nd anniversary banquet of Thomas E. Wilson in the Medinah Temple. After this we went to the International Livestock Exposition and/ marched in the parade of the 1939 National 4-H Club Congres3. That evening a mes - sage was sent to my room telling me I had placed as high individual in the food preparation judging contest. Tuesday morning all the girls were guests of Montgomery Ward and company and were taken to visit the Adler Planetarium where one may view the heavens by means of a large machine controlled by a scientific apparatus. The Field Museum was also visited. At dinner we were guest 3 of Montgomery Ward and company at Bdgewater Beach Hotel. Don Pedro and his famous radio orchestra entertained us throughout our stay there. Some of the outstanding features of the program were the Eight Singing Marines and the Prairie Sweethearts. Sewing boxes were given to all the girls as souvenirs from Mont - gomery Ward and Company. In the afternoon we all went shopping at Marshall Field and after supper attended the Palace Theatre seeing three shows: The Dead End Kids, Tower of London, and Kay Kyser in That's Right, You're Wrong. On Wednesday we were guests of International Harvester Company going through their plants in the morning. It was very interesting as we saw the way a tractor is built from the very first step until it is sold. Pictures of the entire Club Congress were taken at the Har - vester Company.

Mr. Hottes is not only the associate editor of "Better Homes and Gardens" but also a horticul - turist of renown and it a great pleasure to present at this time, Mr. Hottes. LET'S REMAKE THE HOME GARDEN Mr. Hottes: Madam Chairman, friends in Nebraska. I hare chosen to speak on the subject "Let's Remake the Home Garden". I feel that </seg>
         <seg id="p421">j Nebraska State Horticulture Society some ot my remarks may seem to you sarcastic but this is not my in - tention. In everything that we do lor the first time we make mistakes. We all made mistakes in our first gardens, and I intend to call some of them to your attention. When we see an expert accomplish some task, it looks easy but when we try it, we realize that mistakes are easily made. Can you remember your first day at school? I remember mine well.. The teacher wrote the word 'squirrel' on the blackboard. It didn't look familiar. Now, my mother had taught me 'cat', 'rat', and 'mat' but I had never before encountered 'squirrel. I took up my pencil and wrote it, I thought, exactly as it appeared on the blackboard but when the teacher looked at my copy she told me I had put the 'squiggle' on the'q'in the wrong direction. Thus we do with our home grounds. We attempt to follow out suggestions and directions but so often the 'squiggle' isn't right. We say, '?What if we do make mistakes? We enjoy working at it anyway." but, after we have schooled ourselves in the correct methods, then we enjoy doing it correctly. With our home grounds, we should work toward a goal of having a beautiful picture as a result, a setting for our house, an addition to the architecture of the house, something that makes us feel,. "This is livable! This is my home and the realization of one of my dreams!" I (At this point, Mr. Hottes placed on an easel a dia- J gram of a house and lot and, as he proceeded with '.:-.! his lecture, placed the different plantings on the j diagram.) A newly wedded couple have just moved into this new home and are anxious to get their plantings started for, of course, it looks so bare. [The wife wants flowers, lots of flowers, shrubs, a pool, a rock garden, a pergola, an informal plot and perhaps a small formal garden The husband agrees that all these things are needed but, in addition he would like a small vegetable garden, fruit trees, some berries and small'fruit. In order to save space, the garage is placed at the back of the lot with a long cement drive leading to it. Mrs. X has never learned to back the car so the grass on each side of this long drive suffers con - siderably from wear. This long drive has also used one-fifth or 20% of the space on the lot. At the front of the house, they put in a long curved sidewalk leading to the front door. Of course, no one stops in front of the house to use^his long walk so the grass is worn oft where short cuts are made to save time and where guests and the family leave the car on the drive, f ' : </seg>
         <seg id="p422">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture At the side of the house is a small addition with a gate through which no one ever passes. They just go around the whole projection. A gate should be in a fence or hedge so that there is no possible way for people to go around it or they will persist in avoiding it. Another cement walk leads past this projection with spirea planted at the edge. It is a matter of only a short time until the spirea makes such a growth that it shuts off passage entirely. Mrs. X was very fond of flowers so beds were planted on each side of the curved front walk. This merely emphasized the evil in - stead of hiding it. A gift of a lilac bush which had overgrown Aunt Millie's yard was planted in the front yard a little to one side of the house itself. This was simply a 'weed. A weed is a plant out of place and the lilac bush was indeed sadly out of place. Unless it con - tributes to the beauty of the picture, a planting should be left out entirely. Just back of the lilac bush was placed a fan-shaped trellis with roses climbing over it. After a year or two, when they completely hid the trellis, it looked a little more secure but, standing out alone with no support, it gave one a most insecure feeling. Such a trellis should be against a building or fence, having some visible means of support. A large evergreen (forest variety instead of low growing) was next placed close to the house and in a few years hid $1,800.00 worth of architecture. With no plantings at the side of the back yard, it is open to traf - fic and crosspaths from house to house are made by tradesmen in making deliveries of milk and groceries. Here, walks might have prevented wear on the grass. A vegetable garden was next laid out at the rear of the lot and, for no reason at all, an arch was placed at the edge. Climbing roses were planted on this but the arch was small in the beginning and in only a short time was completely closed by the growth. An arch of this kind should be part of something, a fence or a hedge, not standing out entirely alone. The rock garden came next, placed in front of the vegetable gar - den in an attempt to hide it perhaps. Rocks from Colorado, Florida, petrified wood and bright colored glass collected on various travels made up what they called the rock garden. It was more a collection ot geological formations. A rock garden should be a copy of nature or a work of art. It must have the charm of nature and the simplicity of a great picture. It should have unity, a theme as of music running through it. Without these qualities, any work of art fails. If one had a collection of fine rocks, he could build a rock wall or a terrace in a formal manner. It can be a thing of beauty. </seg>
         <seg id="p423">i Nebraska State Horticulture Society What is the definition of a pool? A pool is a thing that is formed when streams strike lower land. Haven't you seen pools constructed in such a way that they were actually higher than the surrounding land? These may be surrounded with jagged pinnacles of rock or with little ripe biscuits of colored stone, all identically alike. Never was such'a pool seen in nature. jCurrant bushes were planted near the garage at the back of the lot and the clothes line strung above them. The idea was good. It looks thrifty to see a clothes line across a back yard for then we know the occupant of this house does her own laundry but, when the currant bush&amp;s attained their growth, only a very short wash could be hung on tlje line. ¦¦¦'.¦ Both these people liked a pergola, so one was dropped down in the center of the yard. Now a pergola is a corridor of the garden like the hall of ar house, a place to pass through. Unless the garden Is large enough to need such a corridor, it might better be omitted. Make a careful selection of garden furniture. So much of it is made as though prize fighters might use it. It should be restful and constructed so you can sit in 1 it without needing an osteopath treat - ment afterward. Do not place it out in the open but give it security by placing it against a substantial background. It should give a feeling of privacy, a feeling of rest. , Iris, more than any other flower.is passed along as a gift. It re - produces so rapidly that unless you are,very careful, you may accept gifts Jof different varieties of iris until your yard is filled with them. Don'tj plant interior flowers in your yard. Wait until you can afford the kind you really want. ' ,'¦¦.. / frext to the house was placed the formal garden. Now a formal garden must be precise and stiff and is only for those who have every thing formal and a corps of gardeners to take care of it. It has no place on a small city lot. &#132; ' i Every part of the garden should be planned as a view from some particular window or door. You should plan all the time to complete a picture. When plants are put out of place, they become weeds. The greatest charm of gardening is to constantly plan because the moat beautiful gardens are always in the mind and sometimes never get into the soil. . :: - Now, we will take away all this that we have been building up and change the plantings. We will see how you respond to these sugges - tions. I First of all, move the garage either closer to the house or at - tach it to the house. The currant bushes are allowed to form part of a hedge. The little addition or projection on the house with the </seg>
         <seg id="p424">I Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture unused gate la taken off entirely, take out the curved walk, the lilac bush, the trelli3 and the pergola. Just what do we wish to acompllsh? We want a living area, a lawn area where games such as croquet may be played, a place for the children to play, a utility space, garden, sand box for the: children and a clothes line. First of all, we will place the vegetable garden at the end of the lot and put a hedge in front of it to hide it. The space between the garage and the vegetable garden may be used for the children's play space, sand box, etc., and may also be used for the clothes line. The sidewalk in the front of the house is from the driveway to the house, a short length ot walk, saving on concrete and yet in the place where family and guests find it most convenient when driving up in a car. • To get some seclusions, a background of high shrubs and trees is put in at the back of the lot, a fence or shrubs along both sides. Besides giving seclusion, this side treatment prevents tradespeople from crossing from one house to another and destroying the lawn. The fence may also be continued from the side of the lot to the house clos - ing in the area at the back. A planting of evergreens may be placed at one side of the lot at the front, directing attention to the house but not hiding it. It is not necessary to plant completely around the foun - dation of the house because the materials used in the construction of homes today are beautiful and need not be hidden. Now, about the pointed evergreens. Our eye responds to the prom - inent lines in a picture. Great artists use the form of a pyramid to give us a feeling of traveling up, a feeling of exultation. One pointed evergreen, the pyramidal type, pleases, but a succession of them, a series of pyramids in a row, appears jagged, like dragon's teeth. So we will use only one evergreen. We have room for many, many flowers with this arrangement; flowers along the fence and along the hedge. What about trees? We may have either trees or flowers but it is a great mistake to plant several forest trees and expect to raise flowers too. Within a few years you have too much shade, unless you have a very large yard. On the average sized lot, I wouldn't advise either large fruit trees or forest trees, in the back area. Q: How would you keep people from crossing the corner of the front lawn? A.: It's very difficult. You might plant a low shrub along the edge of the drive. </seg>

No one passing sees the flowers growing at the back of the house. Anyway, half of the things folks have in their back yards, they wouldn't walk down the street with unless they, were wrapped. ;Q: Suppose the garage were even with the house. How would you handle that situation? ; ' jA.: By plantings that cause the eye to travel toward the house and,away from the garage. When the garage is in this position, it is a real problem, because so often the doors are left standing open. In ;a] certain community in Kansas City, they are so proud of the ap - pearance of their street that you are called on the telephone if you leave your garage door open. ,Dr. Lynn Yutan says in his book "Business of Living", The Chin - ese they had two white shirts. If they can't have two, they wish for one. While this one is being washed, they can have time at home to think over what to say when they wear it.' Another quotation from the same book, 'The Chinese wish they could see a good play but play witbjtheir children is delightful". We can learn something from the Chinese. The most pathetic people in the world are those who are continually searching for happiness. Wondering just what to do the next day will soon bring on a nervous breakdown. Wondering about your garden and adding to it from time to time, makes for happiness. If you haven't already started a garden, do so next season and spend long hours in it. I thank you. Mrs. Grouseman: Thank you Mr. Hottes. I am sure we all enjoyed your,talk immensely. We now have Dr. Anton Frolik of the University of Nebraska who is going to tell us about "Native Grasses that are Suitable for Lawns." Dr. Frolik: I can fully appreciate the remarks of the preceding speaker because we built a home just two years ago and went through all these trials and tribulations.

         <seg id="p426">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture lem has become especially acute during the past several years. The drouth and excessively high temperatures have made it nearly im - possible to maintain satisfactory stands of the two widely-used species, Kentucky bluegrasa and white clover, unless artilicial watering has been practiced. Since many people have encountered difficulty in maintaining lawnß they have become interested in obtaining some other grass. It should be pointed out, however, that in many cases, lack of success in maintaining a good lawn may be due to improper care rather than not using the best grass available. Kentucky bluegrass is still con - sidered as one of the best lawn grasses in Nebraska, providing that it can be given good care and at least some artificial watering during critical periods. However, there are many -people living in cities as well as a large percentage of the farmers who cannot resort to the work and artificial watering required in maintaining a bluegrass lawn. This is especially true in central and western Nebraska where blue - grass cannot be used for lawns even during years of normal or above normal rainfall unless artificial watering is practiced. Kentucky bluegrass suffers not only from a lack of moi3ture but may also be injured by high temperatures. Some experimental work has been done recently at the Missouri Agricultural Experiment .Sta - tion on this problem. The roots of Kentucky bluegrass attained their maximum growth rate at a soil temperature of GO 0 P. Root growth de - clined sharply at 80° and practically ceased at 90°. The plants were severely injured after being exposed for a prolonged period to a temperature of 100°. The temperature of that part of the soil lying near the surface appears to exert a greater influence on growth than does the temperatures at lower levels. A temperature of 90° near the sur - face layer of the soil and 70° at a great depth exerted the same effect on root growth as a 90° temperature throughout the entire depth of the soil It should be pointed out that under the conditions of this ex - periment that the soil contained an abundance of readily available plant food and moisture. Incidently, it has been thought by most people that Canada blue - grass Is more resistant to summer heat than Kentucky bluegrass. The Missouri data, however, show that high temperatures are more de - structive to Canada bluegrass than Kentucky bluegrass. Bermuda grass an important lawn grass in the southern states, made more growth at a soil temperature of 100" than at any lower temperature. Because bluegrass may be injured by high temperatures and a lack of ample moisture or a combination of the two, it can be easily explained why people interested in lawns often are anxious to try heat and drouth tolerant grasses. Since there are no introduced species </seg>
         <seg id="p427">Nebraska State Horticulture Society kno-Wn at present which are any more satisfactory for lawn purposes under Nebraska conditions than Kentucky bluegrasa, native grasses offer the only other solution. h3S#^' liti , * ' II Ell I ¦ -- mi g§li 111 KHiiil I Buffalo grass lawn on Agriculture College campus at Lincoln being mowed In September of 1937. I- : ' .' • - ' .'-¦¦'• Buffalo grass and blue grama are two hardy, short native grasses which offer considerable promise for lawn purposes. They have been tried| in numerous instances with success during the past three or four years. Buffalo grass especially has been given a lot of attention and main emphasis will be placed on this native species in this dis - cussion. - .¦ ¦ i - ¦ - ¦ . - - ¦ . ¦ Buffalo grass offers certain advantages as well as some disadvan - tages when compared with Kentucky blue gra3s. Buffalo grass is much more drouth and heat resistant. It takes considerably less water and will survive even during a very drouthy year without any artificial watering. Buffalo grass is a summer-growing grass. Whereas blue - grass; greens up early in the spring and remains green during the fall months, buffalo grass resumes growth during the late spring months which is usually about the first of May, and it also ceases growth and dries up with the first frost in the fall, 1.c., during the latter part of September or the early part of October. Accordingly, buffalo grass sod ; is unattractive during the spring and fall months. The foliage of buffalo grass is of light-green color and it is never quite as attractive </seg>
         <seg id="p428">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture as a good bluegrass lawn. Whereaa bluegrass can be established from seed or by sodding, a stand of buffalo grass is difficult to obtain from seed since the seed is difficult to harvest and accordingly it is not as yet obtainable on the commercial market. Starting the buffalo grass lawn shown in picture 1. These plugs were planted about 18 inches apart both ways the first week in May. The space between plugs was hoed free from weeds and watered twice that summer. In central and western Nebraska, except -where artiticial -watering can be practiced, buffalo grass is the best lawn grass available. Its usage is not as practical in eastern Nebraska. It has been particularly attractive during the past several droughty years. As the rainfall returns to normal, bluegrass will again become the most important lawn grass in eastern Nebraska. Therefore, buffalo grass in eastern Nebraska will be best adapted to terraces, parkways, southern exposures, large yards, and on farm lawns where artificial watering is impractical. Buffalo grass is a native grass, occurring abundantly on the graz - ing lands of central and western Nebraska, except that it occurs sparsely in the sandhills since it does not thrive on highly sandy soils. It has increased in abundance in eastern Nebraska pastures, especially during the past few years. It may be found in varying abundance in several pastures around Lincoln. Buffalo grass i 3 a low-growing grass attaining a height of 2 to 8 inches. The vegetative growth has a light-green color; the leaves are fine and mostly basal. It spreads vigorously by creeping stems. Typ - ically, the male and female flowers are borne on separate plants, al - though occasionally both sexes are borne on the same plant. The male </seg>
         <seg id="p429">'¦ Nebraska State Horticulture Society flowers are borne on stalks which usually extend above the foliage, whereas the female flowers and subsequent seed burrs are produced on very short stalks embedded among the leaves. This grass is propogated in two ways, i.e., by seed and by creeping stems. Since the seed is borne close to the ground and it is difficult to harvest, it is riot as yet available commercially to any appreciable extent. Therefore, most buffalo grass lawns are being established by sodding. Since the plants spread rapidly by creeping stems, it is not necessary to completely sod a piece of ground but to plant scatter - ed pieces of sod. Buffalo grass may be propagated by setting out the creeping stems or stolons, but this method is not too successful es - pecially on dry soil. {Buffalo grass sod should be removed to a depth of about 3 inches with either a sod cutter or a spade. If alternate strips of sod are left on a field, the furrow intervals will again sod over. It may be desirable to fill the furrows with dirt in order to keep the field level. An espec - ially convenient method of obtaining small quantities of sod is with the English bulb planting tool. This tool consists of a sharp, steel cir - cular cutter about 2% inches in diameter. It has a handle with which Buffalo grass used on pathways on the rose garden at the Agricultural College. U makes a dense turf which withstands heavS traffic and cafibe edged beautU , i- ¦ ¦ . ... it may be guided when inserted into the ground and again removed. It also has a device attached to it by means of which it may be driven into the soil with the foot. Circular pieces of sod are obtained. </seg>
         <seg id="p430">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The sod should be removed when the soil is moist. If the soil is dry. much of it will fall away from the roots and the plants may be injured. Buffalo grass under natural conditions consists of different strains. Some are more desirable for lawn purposes than others. Plant breeders at experiment stations, including the one at Lincoln, are now attempt - ing to select desirable types for lawn purposes. In some instances, it may be advisable to start a small patch of this grass from desirable plants, selected in the field, in the garden and with proper care al - lowing it to increase for a year or two. A lawn may then be started from the increase plat. This method may also have the additional ad - vantage of saving labor and expense. One may raise his own sod in - stead of buying all of it or going to the expense of bringing it in from a distance. A good seedbed should be prepared for sodding a piece of ground to buffalo grass. The soil should be plowed or spaded, well pulverized, and packed. It should be reasonably free from weeds, moist, and fertile. Buffalo grass will not make a good sod on soil in a low state of fer - tility. One of the most common errors made in establishing lawns of buffalo grass is to disregard the proper time of sodding. While buf - falo grass sod can be moved at almost any time during the growing season, best success will be obtained by moving the sod during the op - timum time. The ideal time of the year to sod buffalo grass is from May 1 to June 15. This period represents the time when buffalo grass resumes growth and develops rapidly. If moved early in the spring, buffalo grass is much slower in resuming growth and consequently slower in spreading. In addition, many weeds germinate prior to May 1 and can be killed before the sodding is done. This greatly re - duces the amount of labor required to control weeds after the sod is planted. If the sodding is done by June 15 and the sod is set at not too great an interval, the ground will ordinarily be covered by fall and the lawn is completely established. Sodding at the same spacing during late summer and early fall will require most of the next season to cover the ground. Weeds will also become a serious factor the following spring if the ground is not completely covered with grass. The pieces of sod should be about 3 inches square. The size of the plug made by the English blub-planting tool is about 2% inches in diameter and it is a satisfactory size. The sods should be set into small holes with the top of the sod piece level with the surface of-the soil. The soil should be tamped around each piece of sod. The sods are usually spaced at a distance from one to three feet. A spacing of 18 inches and with planting at the proper time will usually result in a com - plete coverage of the ground by the end of the first year without ar- </seg>

After sodding, an effort should be made to control weeds either by hand weeding or by using a mechanical device. Precaution should be taken, however, not to disturb the creeping stems. Buffalo grass does not tolerate shade. Accordingly it does poorly under trees and un - der ajweed growth. Since its spread will be greatly curtailed by weeds, precaution should be taken to destroy the weeds. In experimental work done jat the Fort Hays Experimental station in western Kansas, buf-* falo grass spread three times as far during the first season on those plots jwhere weeds were controlled as compared with those'plots in which weeds were not controlled. &#132;¦.... : '¦''.' j ' • .-,'"' :: "..¦'' ¦'•. ¦ '".

It is also a short grass, although it grows somewhat taller than buffalo grass. The foliage is quite dense, fine, and of a medium-green color. This grass has the same season of growth as does buffalo grass and therefore it is unattractive during the spring and fall months. It reproduces only by seed. The most practical and inexpensive method of establishing lawns is from seed. If sodding is practiced, the ground must be completely covered with blue grama grass jsod just as is done with bluegrass. This method is more expensive and difficult with the former than the latter.The seed of the blue grama is available commercially. The optimum time of seeding is be - tween May 1 and May 15. The weeds may be largely controlled by spring tillage and yet the blue grama is planted early enough to make a good sod by fall. ; Blue grama sod requires some mowing to make it attractive.

The disadvantages of these native grasses should also be taken'into consideration before they are utilized.for lawn purposes. </seg>
         <seg id="p432">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture | Mrs. Grouseman: Thank you Dr. Frolik for your contribution to the important subject of lawns. Our next speaker is one whom I have known for a long- time. When first I met him, he wa3 county agricultural agent in Douglas County. He was a good one, too, and people there hated to see him so back to his native Indiana to farm hut in a few years he was back in Nebraska and now he is Extension Forester. He has always been a student of the native trees, shrubs and flowers. Today he is to tell us about the native vines, shrubs, and trees that are attractive to wild-life. Mr. Maxwell. NATIVE VINES, SHRUBS, and TREES ATTRACTIVE TO WILD LIFE By E. G. Maxwell The subject which was given me to discuss is one that has a most important bearing on wild-life conservation and restoration, for with - out an abundance of food and adequate protection, birds and other forms of wild-life cannot exist. There must be not only an abundance of food but there must be variety, because the same food does not attract all wild-life species alike. Some plants provide food only for a short time during the summer. Certain other ones whose fruits are available during the winter are especially desirable because it is then that food is apt to be scarce and difficult to get. These are especially important to our non - migratory species. Food alone is not all that is required to insure suitable environ - ment for wildlife. The different forms of wild-life, birds, and animals, must be able to get away from their enemies and to find protection during severe storms and when snows are heavy. I can look back on my experiences as a boy in Indiana and recall the great number of Bob White quail and can understand why they were able to exist in those days in such large numbers. The food sup - ply was adequate but in addition to that there was an abundance of protection provided by thickets, shrubby fence rows and raspberry brambles in the woods, in the ravines, and in other waste places. There were many rail fences in those days and the fence rows were usually dense with bushes and briars which gave splendid protective cover. Finally, rail fences were replaced with woven wire and to put them up it was necessary to clean out the fence rows and then too the Idea seemed to develop that it was a sign of good farming methods to re - move all underbrush and keep the fence rows clean. Many states where upland game birds were formerly abundant, have seen the birds gradually decrease in numbers as the hedgerows and brushy corners </seg>

It was my privilege as a youngster to go into the woods each summer and pick blackberries and raspberries and I learned to know how important briar patches and thickets are for quail and the cotton-tail rabbit for protection against their enemies. jßecause of the thicket-forming habit of our native wild plum and choktecherry and also the importance of their fruit &amp;s food for birds and for our tables, they deserve a gteat deal of consideration. I place a great amount of value on the protection plants of this kind afford, particularly to upland game birds. Last spring I learned of a farmer in one of our northern counties whjo maintains on his farm a flock of approximately 150 quail that make their home in an old plum thick - et. The bußb.es have all died as a.result of drouth but the birds still find [protection from stray cats, hawks, and coyotes and also from heavy snow which are at times very destructive to upland game birds. This farmer I refer to feeds his birds when snows are deep and when food jis scarce and gets a lot of pleasure out of doing it but he could not do this if the birds did not have good protection for without it they jwould not be there. jThe "Bob White" quail has always been recognized as a friend of the farmer because he lives on insects that prey on farmers crops and on weed seeds. He is also one of the most prized of all game birds and even (though closed seasons have given -him some protection, his number has decreased to an alarming degree.

In this connection also I am thinking of the uprooting of the many| miles of Osage Orange hedges which has occurred in Nebraska in recent years. I wonder if it has been a good thing to remove thenl. From; the standpoint of protection for wild-life it certainly has not. Some; farmers with whom I have talked and who have had their Osage hedges removed said they have found that from a crop protection standpoint it was a mistake to take them out. ¦ The greatest value to wild-life in the things I have mentioned is the protection they afford; now let us consider some of the native plants from the standpoint of source of food. </seg>
         <seg id="p434">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture i The eastern red cedar undoubtedly is one of the best sources of food for both game and non game species of birds. It is quite widely distributed and bears fruit almost every year. The cedar berries are eaten by a good many different species of birds and the fact 1 that the berries hang on the trees throughout £he winter makes them very valuable as a source of food and that during a time when food is less plentiful. Cedars also afford fine protection and nesting 'sites for birds. Those who have plenty of red cedar about their homes have little difficulty in keeping plenty of birds on hand to help control insect pests. In driving through Perkins county last March I passed a farm near Grainton where there are a lot of red cedars. It was quite a warm day and as I neared this place it sounded as if all the birds in that part of the country had congregated there amon? the cedars. They were at this place because there were trees that furnished food and protection. According to William Van Dersal, biologist of the Soil Conserva - tion Service it has been observed that 52 species of birds have taken fruits of the red cedar. Glenn Viehmeyer, Stapleton, who is a student of birds, says that in his opinion red cedar stands at the head of the list in value as a food source to migratory and non-migratory birds of the sandhill region. It is gratifying that so many cedar windbreaks are now being planted. Cedars have withstood drouth conditions remarkably well and except in commercial app\e growing districts they should be planted freely. The fruits of our native Hackberry are relished by many species of birds and its value as a source of bird food is enhanced by the fact that the fruits are held on the trees throughout the winter. It does not, however, fruit regularly. It is one of our most valuable native broadleaf trees. It is drouth resistant, strong and symmetrical, well suited to lawn and street planting, as well as general planting on the f a rm. The robins seem to like the fruits of hackberry especially well and in years when there is a good crop of seed they hold a real picnic in the hackberries before proceeding on their way south. The robins and a few other species of birds do considerable damage in the grape vineyards about Omaha each fall during their migration. Perhaps if there were a great many more hackberry trees in that vicinity less damage would be done to the grape crop, especially in years when the hackberries fruited heavily. This is, of course, only a theory but aside from this it would be well if more hackberry trees were plant - ed. It is native throughout the state and because of its splendid qual - ities should be increased in numbers. </seg>

Its fruits are held on the trees well into the winter and Jthis makes it all the more valuable. The Olive berries are an important food of the pheasant and they are doubtless somewhat responsible for olive trees becoming established in large numbers In the Platte River bottom in the vicinity of North Platte. The Buffalo : berry, another member of the Oleaster family, which occurs to a considerable extent in the western and northern part of the state and sometimes in east Nebraska is an important source" of food [for several species of birds. Its low shrubby habit of growth also makes it valuable for protection. i [ | Some years ago it was not uncommon to find great quantities of the orange and red berries of the bittersweet in the &gt; woods and along the streams throughout the state. The berries are attractive to many kinds of birds and since they hang on the vines throughout the .^inter they are valuable as bird food when food is usually scarce. I ¦, Sprays of bittersweet berries are prized as winter bouquets and I that fact has been responsible for its almost complete disappearance at least so far as its fruiting is concerned. For several years people have ,combed the country, pulling the vines from the trees, breaking them; off .seriously injuring the plants. While many of the plants re - main j alive, this kind of treatment has seriously injured its fruiting Some i have made a business of gathering bittersweet from the timber and selling bunches of it at roadside stands and in the larger towns Because of the careless way in which it is gathered it is bound to be - come less plentiful. If harvested carefully, bittersweet can be relied upon to fruit quite regularly. J. Smith, a resident of Douglas county has harvested regularly bittersweet from plants started along his lawn fence twenty years ago. Since the berries have become so scarce in the wfld, several people have planted bittersweet about their homes. The vfnes are attractive and the berries add a touch of color that is pleasing and they do attract birds. The wild grapes, Virginia! creeper, smilax, and moonseed and other Ivining plants are important sources of food for birds and some wild animals. The grapes often hold their fruit well, into the winter! as do the Virginia creeper and smilax, thus making them an important source of winter food. The Virginia creeper is not usually thought of as a very im - portant plant, but Van Dersal reports that no less than thirty-eight species^ of birds and the skunk are known to have fed on its fruit, and since the fruit are available from August to February, it is quite </seg>
         <seg id="p436">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture an important food plant. It is claimed to remain on fence posts, not following the wires when planted along fences. It has been used as a cover for roadside banks, it resi3ts grazing well, and it might be well if we made more use of it in erosion control and for planting in waste places. Smilax hispida or bristly greenbrier, very common in the woods of the eastern part of the state, bears fruit that is available in Oc - tober and November and often throughout the winter. Let us consider the sumacs of which there are several species that are very common in Nebraska. Smooth sumac, Rhus Glabra, is a thicket forming shrub that furnishes food the year round for wild - life. Van Dersal reports that thirty-two species of birds are known to have taken its fruits and further, it 13 preferred food of the cot - ton-tail rabbit. The shrub has suffered rather severely from drouth and from grasshoppers damage in recent years and also from road crews that would polish the roadsides and keep them almost as clean and bare as the roadbed it3elf. Skunkbrush, Rhus trilobata, is another sumac that is widely dis - tributed in Nebraska, a rather attractive and hardy shrub that has great possibilities for planting in erosion control and for decorative purposes. Its fruits are available the year round and are taken by a rather large number of species of birds. Poison ivy is closely related to the sumac. Some may wonder what good can come from such a plant but it is reported that sixty species of birds are known to have taken its fruit. The native dogwoods are also attractive to wild-life. They pro - vide protection and the fruits are relished by many species of birds. The red osier dogwood, Cornus stolonifera, produces fruit that oc - casionally hangs on throughout the winter. Some twelve different species of birds are known to eat its fruit. This and the other native species are attractive shrubs and should be used more in decorative plantings. Wild roses, buckrush, sand cherry, American elder, wild currants and gooseberries, mulberry, wild black cherry and perhaps others of our native plants are more or less attractive to birds and other forms of wild life. It is very desirable that more attention should be given to con - serving most of our native plants and actually increasing the more desirable ones. The great amount of burning of fence rows and road - sides and also woods fires especially in the south east part of the state that occur each year is very detrimental to wild-life. Drouth, grasshoppers, and careless burning have all helped to decrease many </seg>

However, plants that sprout freely an d produce dense growths such as wild plum, chokecherry, Ameri-' can lelder and buskbrush may be increased easily by transplanting the newj plants that form around the established plantings. There can be found strains of plum and chokecherry which bear fruit of large size and! superior quality and these should be increased. Wild plum and chokecherry planted in erosion control may serve a three-fold pur - pose, preventing soil washing, furnishing food for the table, and pro - viding a habitat, for wild-life.

"OLD-808-WHITE!" kPTKH.\OOX December 13, 1939 MRS. GROUSEMAN: Thank you, Mr. Maxwell. Our next speaker has an unusual subject, "Vitmans for Garden Clubs". We are proud of the fact that our garden clubs are growing and we know vitamins are very important to growth so we will be interested in hearing again from Mr. Hottes, who gave us such an interesting talk on gardens this morn - ing. I am happy to introduce to you, Mr. Hottes, of the "Better Homes and Gardens" magazine. j VITAMINS FOR GARDEN CLUBS MR. HOTTES: Mrs. Grouseman and friends. I spoke to the Nation - al Council of Garden Clubs on this same subject, "Vitmans for Garden Clubs." They asked me if I would not be frank as to what is wrong with the clubs and what might be done to keep up interest from year to year. Sometimes we all need a good woodshed session to tell us exactly how we look to others, so thi3 embarrassing task is going to be done this afternoon. I do not wish to be mean but if we look at this sreat Garden Club movement truthfully and with open eyes, I think we will realize that it won't be long before garden clubs will degenerate if we don't change some of the practices. When we edited the garden club exchange at "Better Homes and Gardens", I sent out questionaires and asked what were some of the </seg>
         <seg id="p439">I. Nebraska State Horticulture Society faults of speakers, programs and clubs. I have appeared before clubs all over the United States and with all groups of people and, egotis - tical as it may sound, I have seen their problems first hand. Please do not take my criticisms personally but, if the shoe fits, wear it If a thing- needs correcting, it should be done and not allowed to dis - appear down some by-way. The object of Garden Clubs is what? To encourage interest in gardens in order that we will be more delighted with gardening and with the people who garden. Much more important than the flowers are the people who raise them. I always think of the relationship be-' tweeri the two. : The Garden Club is made up of whom? People who are supposed to like each other and talk the same language, but if you have cho&gt;eh as your chairman a 'czarina', if you have chosen someone who does not know how to keep you sweet and happy, then you had better find ahother who can preside and handle "your situations adroitly so that the person having a meeting in charge has a pleasant smile" and will radiate love. Wherever I go, I find these 'czarinas'. You know the type I refer to. I find them trying to tell people what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. The whole success of a club is sometimes ruined by the wjrong presiding officer. Conduct your business quickly. Be brief and to the point. Do not tire the members out before the meeting is well under way. Do not bore the members with all the details of every transaction. Do not try toj shame the members into duties. Keep your meetings delightful. Keep,yourmeeting a place where we meet the kind of people who speak-our language and there are so few who are just our kind, af - ter all. Garden clubs are fun by cliques. Let them! Just so long as the members are allowed to do as they please and not constantly im - pressed with the fact that they are loafers. ¦ I • Now, how long should a talk be? When you have a speaker at your Garden Club tell him exactly how long you expect him to talk. If you p^an on one-half hour, tell him fifteen minutes. A speaker always runs over time some. When asking for an article for "Better Homes and Gardens!', we reserve the right to boil it down. We want to rea|d things that we don't already know, so we cut out all prelim - inaries and get right to the subject. A speaker should do the same. In - stead [of fumbling through a long introduction, take a microphone directjy to the person and ask leading questions. The response is usually much better than a long drawn out talk. The right questions will get just what you want without any preliminaries. If you are speaking, don't be hesitant; about having notes. Put them on a large paper where they can be easily read. It is good psychol- </seg>
         <seg id="p440">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture olgy to hold but one page at a time so no one will see a great sheaf of caper and wonder how long it will take you to deliver your address. Don't get up after you have sat down to give something you have forgotten. The best speeches are always made on the way home. Most talks are too lengthy. Don't assign any member a subject in which he is not interested and that will not interest you either. Why do people stammer? Bill Sunday, didn't stammer. He had such a clear view and was so full of his subject 'Hell', that the words wouldn't come fast enough. If your speaker has a clear vision of his subject, then a good talk will be given. A great many people have unpleasant voices. Be careful that these people do work that does not require talking. They generally are sensitive about it themselves and a good chairman will know how to handle such a situation. What about poor English? Do not be too critical of English. Per - haps a practical grower has some knowledge of his subject but is not able to express himself gramatically perfect. Such simple souls some - times make eloquent talks. Al Jolson say 3 there never is a poor audience. If the audience fails to respond, then the speaker is poor but I feel that some audiences are much more receptive than others. The good chairman will find out what her people want and give the members a discussion on the things they want. Be careful that the subject selected for your speaker is not too broad. Take for example, 'Iri3' or Annuals'. Either subject is too big. Ask your speaker to talk only on some phase of it. Instead of the sub - ject 'Winter Protection', ask the speaker to talk on 'Protection of Perennial Borders' and then questions may be asked later which will bring out protection of other plantings. The choice of subjects, of course, will depend upon the kind of people in your club. If you have a great many different types, then you must divide them into groups in order to keep them all interested. I often refer to the "dear old lady gardener". Do you know who she is? She is the ideal type of gardener. She is the person who has 'growing hands'. Anything she plants will grow. "The dear old lady gardener" always wants slips from your choice plants and, if you don't give her slips, you will drive her to carrying an umbrella and getting them for herself. We should cater to this type in our meetings. If everyone were as enthused over gardening, we would hare no trouble with politics or making meetings interesting. In order to enjoy a meeting, we should be relaxed and in a good mood to enjoy everything. Perhaps we could attain this by making the </seg>
         <seg id="p441">j , Nebraska State Horticulture Society meetings informal. Do not arrange the chairs in straight rows. Per - haps Jet the speaker sit down while he talks. Do your best to have every - one at ease. i ¦ ¦ ¦ .'¦.¦¦ . .¦ -¦ ' What does the speaker expect of the Garden Club? Speakers are all egotistical so try to keep them feeling that way. Do not ask your speaker to come until you are ready for him to talk. Do riot expect him {o sit through a long session and then talk to an audience who is already tired and bored. Be honest with him. If you don't intend to have him talk until 2:30, don't ask him to be there at 2:00. When introducing your speaker, don't lay it on too thick but still make him feel important. Make your introduction short. A few well chosen remarks are far better than ten minutes of talking. Too many times, a chairman spends half of the allotted time in building up an ideal that the speaker cannot possibly meet. After the speaker has finished, then he must be congratulated, but, by the time 150 people have passed him, j shook his hand and said the same thing, the meeting is no longer delightful. Instead of simply saying "I enjoyed your talk immensely", repeat to him that part of his lecturje that did appeal to you. That helps him to improve his talk for the next group. Any speaker improves with age, if his audience helps in this way. If he has a good response, a speaker can give a much bet - ter talk. The audience helps him and he gives value received. How el3e should you treat a speaker. Should he be entertained in a home or in a hotel. Sometimes they ars not paid enough to stay at a hotel but everyone expects him to. Perhaps a $7.50 room is re - served for him and he is paid only $15.00. Ut least; he should be al - lpwed|to break even on such a trip. In "a private home, he is expected to neet the requirements of a family and is not given the necessary quiet and relaxation so im - portant before the meeting. If you want the best from your speaker, never (entertain him in a private home. Don't even invite your speak - er to :ja family dinner before he talks. The meal is sure to he of the finest,] both in quality and quantity, and the speaker is then in no con - dition to talk. After he has finished his assignment, a speaker is lonely and loves to be entertained. Keep this in mind.

         <seg id="p442">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture | more than $1.00, give him a book. When you are paying a speaker, you always give publicity to the meeting. This means a better attendance. Try and pay speakers adequately and the more they are paid, the more they are inspired, the more preparation they put into their talk. Remember this. A garden club will thrive only so long as the programs are interesting. That means everyone must have a good time because the officers are well chosen and have selected their talker carefully and have treated him well. Act as though it were a social gathering. If you make it too formal or stiff, it will soon fall down. The members like to be spoken to, not lectured down to or at. Let me repeat the statement about the introduction. Be careful that it is not too sweet. Don't make your speaker feel like a pancake over which maple syrup is being poured. I thank you. MRS. ROUSEMAN: Now, what shall I say? I'm sure we will all try to follow out the suggestions given in order to make our meetings more interesting and keep our clubs thriving. Miss Steele of the Home Economics Department, University of Nebraska, is here to demonstrate the use of foliage, grasses, fruits, and vegetables in artistic arrangements. In making up this program, we felt we should give the garden clubs what they wanted and I am sure the women all wanted this particular talk. THE VSE OF FOLIAGE, GRASSES, FRUITS, AN» VEGF,TABIjES IN ARTISTIC ARRANGEMENTS MISS STEELE: I'm so glad I was given this topic of arranging foliage, grasses, fruits and vegetables in artistic ways for I feel that we have not been doing enough of that sort of thing. Our students are doing a great deal of creative work along this line and we thought you might be interested in seeing actual arrangements. We have sev - eral here and, although they would be improved with a proper back - ground and a spotlight, we hope you will find them interesting. Flowers are beautiful in themselves and can add beauty to our homes if they are treated correctly. We attempt to dress ourselves suitably and flowers need exactly the same treatment. They should be displayed to the very best advantage. What is a beautiful composition? It may be a flower arrangement, a costume, or a room arrangement. Take a specific case, that of the State Capitol building. Its greatest beauty lies particularly in its sil - houette lines. A bouquet has a similar outline and within the bouquet, we note the lines of stems and their relationship to each other. One of our most common, is that which radiates from a center. Another is to have an arrangement the same on each side, symmetrical. </seg>
         <seg id="p443">I Nebraska State Horticulture Society jSome people make a business of arranging flowers. I think we all know that the Japanese are particularly successful In this sort of thing. They have done a great deal toward creating beauty with flow - ers, beauty of contour, proportion, using interesting colors. Colors may!be light and dark, bright and dull, but should be composed as a painter composes to create a picture. A successful arrangement of flowers involves exactly the same thing as the painting of a picture. {We may use things other than flowers in bouquets, such as little figures of various kinds. We select material that might harmonize with line and form. j(To illustrate this, a bouquet was arranged on a table before the group.) Before arranging a bouquet, the flowers should be studied indi - vidually and the composition built up to get color, balance, emphasis and harmony. The Japanese speak of rhythm created or that there is music in a bouquet. ( (At this point, bouquets were brought out one at a time and dis - cussed and placed on the rostrum in view of the audience.) (1) Pine boughs and cane heads.

The Jap - anese sometimes find a large stone with many crevices and build up a landscape. One last suggestion I want to leave with you. Use your imagin - ation in composing a bouquet and make each one individual. MRS. GROUSEMAN: Thank you, Miss Steele. This is a fitting fin - ish to a very interesting meeting. Since there Is nothing more to come up, our meeting Is adjourned. VEGETABLE GARDENING PROGRAM Thursday, December 14th MR. HOPPERT: I guess vegetable men are no different from any - one el3e. The weather is fine and they are probably at work in the field which would account for a small attendance today. Our first speaker's subject today may be quite new to eastern Nebraska growers but the western growers have had plenty of ac - quaintance with it. It has some danger for us in eastern Nebraska. I take pleasure in introducing Dr. J. H. Jensen who will talk to you about "Ring Rot, a new and Dangerous Disease of Potatoes". RING ROT, A NEW AND DESTRUCTIVE POTATO DISEASE IN NEBRASKA By James H. Jensen The potato disease, ring rot, is comparatively new to the United States, having been reported first in this country from Maine in 1932. The disease has been known for a number of years in other countries, however, having been found in Germany as early as 1908. As far as Nebraska is concerned, the first positive evidence of its occurrence here was obtained in November, 1938, when the bacterium was isolated from some diseased potatoes from western Nebraska. Up to the present time the disease has been reported from some twenty-tour states scat - tered in all parts of the nation. Following the discovery of the disease in Nebraska, an attempt was made to determine the prevalence and distribution of ring rot in Nebraska potatoes. Some ring rot -was lound present in several lots </seg>
         <seg id="p445">Nebraska State Horticulture Society being held for planting for certification. These lots were discarded for seed purposes. Ring rot was also found present in several cellars of commercial table-stock potatoes in western Nebraska. In several : instances excessive rot and breakdown caused the grower to send in samples and ask for information regarding the trouble. In addition to these records of the disease in western Nebraska, several samples of potatoes received from various parts of the state were found to be in - fected with ring rot and were traced to out-of-state origin. Growers had purchased the potatoes, intending to use them for seed, only to find some of them showing rot and breakdown. Last summer additional instances of ring rot infection were seen in the central Nebraska sec - tion where potatoes are raised for the early market. AH infected lots in that area, that came to our attention, were planted with seed from out-of-state origin. Some of the growers suffered considerable loss due to rot and spoilage at harvest time. We know from these reports and from our year's observation that the disease has found its way into many sections of Nebraska and while no large scale losses have occurred, we do know from isolated instances that the disease can causejhea.vy losses in thi3 area. ' ¦ "i . .'¦ ' • ¦. ¦.- .' ':. .'' •¦. ; ¦ ¦ The symptoms of bacterial wilt and ring rot in the field con - sist of a yellowing, wilting, and rolling of the lower leaves of infected plants. Frequently there is also a stunting of one or more stems in an infectpd hill. These symptoms do not show up until 60 to 80 days after planting and resemble, in a general way, the effects produced by dry weather and drought. You can understand from this last remark that tte symptoms might easily be confused with those of other dis - eases jin Nebraska. I have some pictures that I will present in a few minutes which will bring out these symptoms more clearly. Tuber symptoms consist of a ring of soft, cheesy rot, lemon-yel - low to whitish in color. Gentle pressure on an infected tuber usually causes a separation of the tissues at the vascular cylinder. Sometimes the rpt is confined to small, inconspicuous pockets in various parts of tlM} outer portion of infected tubers. In more advanced Instances this rot may appear throughout the vascular cylinder of the tuber, which|when cut in cross section shows the typical ring rot formation' In the early stages of tuber infection there is no disagreeable odor. Later,-when other rot-producing organisms come in, odors are pro - duced.; Tubers may also be infected without showing symptoms. Symp - toms develop slowly in storage at low temperatures. The rot develops rapidly at higher temperatures, however. There are instances on record where I cars, destined for distant points, were loaded and passed in - spection only to break down in transit and show severe rotting at destination several days later. Ring rot is transmitted chiefly through infected seed, contamin - ated cutting knives, and by contact with infected seed or infected </seg>
         <seg id="p446">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture tubers In storage. There is some evidence to indicate that the disease is spread by irrigation water but much more investigation is necessary along this line before we know much about it. Now a few words about the control of bacterial wilt and ring rot. A study of the means of spread readily shows that if only healthy seed is planted and all possible contamination is eliminated, the stock will remain healthy. It should be emphasized here again that sometimes tubers are infected without showing symtoms and for that reason it traces of infection are found, the entire lot should be dis - posed of for purposes other than planting. If careful attention is paid to the seed stock used in planting, we believe ring rot can be suc - cessfully controlled. 1 would like to show some slides that show symtoms of these plants in the field. These pictures will show you better than I can des - cribe it. They were taken this past summer in Nebraska. At the pres - ent time, this disease has been reported from 25 states. (Showing of Slides) Q: Is there danger of carrying this disease over in the storage cellar? A: Yes. The cellar should be fumigated with formaldehyde or sprayed with copper sulphate. Q: Do the plants sometimes die before they develop tubers? A: Yes, very often. Q: What about a variety that is resistant to the disease? A: We know of no variety at the present time but, no doubt, one will be developed. Q: If diseased tubers are used for table use, what disposition should be made of the parings? Is there a chance of spreading the disease through these? DR JENSEN: Perhaps they should be buried in a garbage pit or fed to hogs or chickens. MR. HOPPERT: Is there any assurance of getting disease free seed from some of these other states? DR. JENSEN: That is difficult to say, Mr. Hoppert. Most ot our seed potatoes come from northern states. Buying ordinary seed po - tatoes doesn't guarantee that they are free from disease. We found that lots of the disease last year came from out-of-state seed. Q: Can seed be treated? </seg>
         <seg id="p447">Nebraska State Horticulture Society A: So far we know, it cannot. Experiments are being made with this but we have no definite evidence as yet. It is highly important that disease free seed be secured.* MR. HOPPBRT: Thank you, Dr. Jensen for your contribution to our pj-ogram. There are insects too that bother us. We have asked Mr Bare ,to talk on "The Tuber Moth." We haven't found many here yet but i^ our climate is changing as some people think, perhaps we are going! to be subjected to a different type of insects from regions of warmer temperatures. Of course, any questions you may have pertain - ing toj other insects may be brought up at thiß time too. Mr. Bare. POTATO TUBER MOTH ... •.; . By O. S. Bare ¦¦¦'.'. . ¦ ¦ 7 ¦ Tjhe potato tuber moth, or tuber worm, as it is sometimes called, is a serious pest of potatoes in the southern half of the United States and has been particularly destructive in parts of the southeastern coastal area. Until the summer of 1939, it had not been found in Nebraska, but in September of that year It was reported to be ruining the crop of potatoes on a farm in Cass County. Evidently, it had been in - troduced in seed secured from an out-of-state seedman '' I . '' .'¦ ...-¦.. - .." - This insect is a serious pest only on potatoes, although it will work on tobacco, tomatoes, and related crops and weeds. The adult is a small moth having a wing spread of about one-half inch. The front Wings are gray, somewhat spotted or mottled, while the hind wings jare buff colored and rather narrow. The moth is nocturnal in .habit, I most of its activity occuring7 at night or during the evening or earjy morning. On cool, dark days or in dark places such as potato bins, it may be active throughout the day, but it avoids sunlight or other bright lights. Its flight is short and jerky in character. Greatest damage is done on early potatoes. The first generation of moths lays the small white eggs on the plants. These hatch in from five days to fivd weeks, depending upon temperature. The young worms feed by mining the interior of the ieaves, but later burrow into the leaf petiplej3 and plant stems. The larvae mature in from two to tour weeks.f and when fully grown are nearly a half-inch long and of a pal© greenish-white color. They pupate in curled leaves, under rubbish or trash, 'and often in silky cocoons that protrude from their burrows in the stems. The second generation behaves much the same as the first, and develops on and in the green potato plants. However, the moths of the thii-d generation enter cracks in the soil and lay their eggs directly on the|potatoes. They apparently prefer to lay the eggs in the potatd eyes if | possible. They also lay their eggs on potatoes that are exposed </seg>
         <seg id="p448">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture at digging time. Later generations may work on the crop in the field, or on the potatoes after they have been placed in storage. The young worms hatching from these eggs burrow throughout, and utterly ruin the potatoes. Five or six generations per year are produced. Damage is greatest in hot, dry seasons, which appear to favor the moths, and also are likely to produce cracking of the soil and expose the potatoes to the moths' egg-laying activities. Cool summers and late summer rains are distinctly unfavorable to this pest. In storage the potato tuber moth usually pupates in one of the following places: (1) In potato eyes. (2) Between touching potatoes in the bin. (3) In folds of sacks. (4) In cracks of bin walls and floors. (5) In old burrows under dry potato skins. (6) In silky cocoons protruding from burrows. Control of this pest requires a combination of measures, none of which is effective if used singly. They may be listed as follows: : (1) Plant clean, uninfested seed. (2) Plant at least four or five inches deep. (3) Cultivate well and hill or ridge the rows. (4) Avoid exposing potatoes at digging time. Sack ati once, close sacks, and remove from fields as soon as possible. (5) Collect and burn all potato tops after digging, preferably every day. (6) Destroy host weeds, such as nightshade and other plants of the potato or tomato family. (7) Destroy or use all culls as soon as possible. Whether this pest can become established in Nebraska is an open question. Heretofore it has not been able to survive winters of the type that usually prevail here. However, it is possible that it might survive in our potato cellars or other storage places. Growers are advised to be on the watch for it, and if it appears, report its presence at once to the Department of Entomology or the Department of Horti - culture at the State Agricultural College. </seg>
         <seg id="p449">Nebraska State Horticulture Society MR. HOPPERT: Thank you, Mr. Bare. Your discussion was both interesting and timely. It is better to be prepared for this insect before it gets a start. The next subject has been giving some of the market gardeners trouble in years gone by. Most of you have had experience with the weevil that ruins carrots and dill, I am sure not much has been done in this state regarding its control until Mr. Darlington started working on it. I want him to take it up with you now as to what the situation is and what to do about it. Mr. Darlington. j A NEW PEST OF CARROTS, DttL, AND PARSLEY I W. W. Darlington, Lincoln The insect now referred to as the Carrot Weevil (Listronotus la - tiusculus) has been known for about a century. It was originally re - ported as Infesting the stalks and seed heads of the broad-leaved ar - rowhead (Sagittaria latifolia), although there is apparently some question with regard to the relationship of the carrot weevil to this original specimen. In 1902 this insect was found to infest parsley and w|as accordingly referred to as the parsley stalk weevil. Since that time it has been reported as a pest of carrots, celery, dill, and other closely related plants. While the carrot weevil has probably been in Nebraska for a number of years, it is only fairly recently that it has been brought to the attention of entomologists in the state. A small field of parsley belonging to a truck gardener near Omaha that was visited! in June of this year was almost wholly infested with the larvae of the! weevil. Several local calls about the pest have been received, and carrots growing in Plots formerly cared for by horticultural stu - dents yere found to be heavily infested during the summer. Li&gt;e most other insect pests, it is in the larval or worm-like stage that the carrot weevil is most destructive. The insect passes the winter jas an adult, being protected either by entering the soil or by hid - ing under leaveß, along fence rows, or under the remains of plants in the field. The adults begin egg-laying probably not before the latter part pf| May. The development of the first generation is probably com - pleted July. Two more broods apparently develop in normal years, the adults of the third generation appearing in October. While the life cycle of the carrot weevil has not been definitely followed in Ne - braska- Harris reports the probability of three generations in lowa, with continuous breeding during the summer .. ¦ " - ' ' ¦ ¦¦.¦*¦'¦" "¦'' ' • *¦ Tl c eggs of the weevil are deposited in little cavities eaten in the stalk "by the adult female; usually from five to twelve eggs will be found in a single cavity. The opening is sealed over with a black exudation from the abdomen after deposition is complete. The eggs, </seg>
         <seg id="p450">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture which, though small, can be seen -with the unaided eye, are white or cream-colored when first laid but soon turn dark. The newly hatched larvae or grubs may burrow through the stalk to the crown of the plant or crawl down on the outside of the stalk, or they may drop to the ground and enter the carrot below the surface of the soil. Here they burrow into the carrot and increase rapidly in size. Carrots thus Infested have irregular, sometimes large, cavities eaten into them and while the carrots may not be wholly destroyed, they are of little commercial value. As many as eight or a dozen grubs have been found in a single infested carot. When mature, the grubs works their way in - to the soil a short distance from the carrot, construct a small earthen cell, and change to the pupal, or "resting" stage. The adult weevil is then formed, and digs its way to the surface of the soil. The adults of the weevil are inconspicuous. Not only do they tend to conceal themselves when actually on the plant, but they apparently often rest on or in the soil, and are thus protected by their uniform brownish coloration. When disturbed, the weevil drop to the ground and feign death, remaining absolutely still for some time. Although they have well-developed wings, the weevils have seldom, if ever, been observed to fly. The adults live for several weeks and each female may lay a considerable number of eggs. Several methods of control have been suggested. Crop rotation has been reported as being a satisfactory check. Boyce, of Cornell University, describes a case in which the main crop of carrots was planted across a road from an area previously infested with the weevils. A small plot replanted in this original area later revealed an infestation of 70%, while little damage occurred in the new area. Since the carrot weevil may attack any members of the family Umbel - liferae, it is important, of course, that none of these are used in the rotation in place of carrots. Where crop rotation is impractical, applications of insecticides may be resorted to. The amount of work that has been reported on in connection with insecticidal treatments for the carrot weevil is very limited in quantity, and the data presented herein is taken entirely from a report of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, where the carrot weevil is a pest of celery. Of a considerable number of ma - terials with which experiments were conducted, four or five showed possible value. These, together with figures representing results ob - tained from their uses, are as follows: </seg>

         <seg id="p452">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture i A spray of sulphur on young dill plants was reported by Mr. John Liebentritt to protect the plants from attack by the carrot weevil, which had infested an adjoining area severely. There may be some question as to the credit that should be given the spray in this cae°. however, since the applications were made in mid-summer, and ob - servations seem to indicate that normal Infestations of the second and third broods of weevils are much lighter than that of the first brood. Q: I have a great deal of trouble with a 200-foot stretch of low, flat ground The upper or drier ground does not seem to be bothered. Following an early crop of onions, carrots were planted the middle of June. Only a little infestation, 1% or 2%, occurred as compared to 15% when they were planted earlier. It proved to me that the eggs laid in early June did not affect this later planting. Am I right? MR. DARLINGTON: Yes, that is right, the first infestation is always much greater. It would be well to follow all control measures, first and most practical, rotation of crops. Poison early, plant late if possible and destroy all remains of plants in the fields for in these places the beetle hibernates. MR. ROBERTS (Lincoln): Rotating for just one year won't help. I have tried it and after three years, still have trouble. I plant in 50 foot plots and aim to skip a plot when I rotate. MR. BARE: Don't you think that it is simply that the new plots are too close to the old ones? The weevil may travel from the old plot to the new. We have a lot to learn about this particular insect, of course. Q: What time was the poison apple bait put out? A: It killed the second generation of beetles, late June or early July perhaps. Q: Is this the same worm that infests radishes? A: No, I don't think it would be the same. Your radish trouble may be a root maggot which is an entirely different kind of insect. That is the larvae of a fly and this is a hard shelled beetle. MR. HOPPBRT: This completes our program for the morning and, after the general meeting in the Activities Building, we will meet here again and hear about fertilizers, waxing for root crops and a discus - sion of tomato varieties. We will adjourn until then. </seg>
         <seg id="p453">j Nebraska State Horticulture Society • AFTERNOON i December 14, 1030 MR. HOPPERT: Our afternoon meeting has to do with a number of different things, the first being the use of fertilizers on vegetable crops^ So often salesmen try to sell us things we do not need and I won - der if fertilizers are somtimes in this class. Mr. Weldon has had a lot of experience along this line. Our institution has no axes to grind and nothing to sell so his statements need not be taken with a grain of salt. If you have any questions about fertilizers, don't hesitate to ask themJ He will be glad to have you do so. I will let Mr. Weldon take over. r ¦¦¦..¦'¦ .1 .¦ . ¦ :'¦"• ¦'. ''&#132;-¦ ¦ RELATIVE MERITS OF FERTILIZERS AND PSEUDO-FERTILIZERS J FOR VEGETABLES MR. WELDON: This subject "Relative Merits of Fertilizers and Pseudo-Fertilizers for Vegetables" is a whale of a subject. We could discuss ittrom mow on and Btill not doit Justice. I thought it would be well to review the fundamentals of the things that make plants grow as briefly as we can. There is nothing mysterious about this. There are things we do not know but when we do find out, they are not mysterious. ¦I ¦¦•¦- ¦¦" ¦ ' - ; '.-¦ ¦ ¦¦¦'.¦'¦¦¦¦'.'¦¦•¦ ¦'¦ ' The first thing that influences the growth of crops is the kind of seed and the kind of cuttings, then conditions under which plant growth takes place (climatic conditions being extremely important) rainfall, temperature, length of growing season, amount of wind, humidity, light, cloudiness, and length of day. Then soil conditions are another/ part of the surrounding of a plant that determines its course of growth. Then there is .another 1 set of conditions we refer to as soil fertility. By this we mean the ability of thesoil to supply to plants the thingB that they need for best growth. Substances that are needed for growth. Of Course, there are sub - stance^ that are not supplied by the soil at all. The most important single'element in the plants is carbon. It doesn't come from the soil but from the air as carbon dioxide. Hydrogen and oxygen are also ¦necessary. These three elements in general come from air and water rather than from the soil. Tjuere are three other elements, nitrogen, phosphorus and po - tassium that {plants take from the soil. These are the three that are commdnly found in commercial fertilizers. One or two, or maybe all three may be] present. Then there are calcium and magnesium. These elements I think of as being supplied by liming materials. Others are sujphur and iron. There is a list of ten elements which are abso- </seg>
         <seg id="p454">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture lutely needed for the normal growth of all green plants. There are others that have come to be recognized as being needed, boron copper, manganese, and zinc. That practically completes the list. If we have all of these elements present in the soil in the right form and somewhere near the right amounts, then, provided other conditions are favorable, we can get an excellent growth of plants. Not all plants need these things in the same proportions. One plant takes more of some than of others. Besides all these different conditions and elements that I have mentioned, there are such elements as growth promoting substances that may be needed by plants and most of them are produced by the plant itself. Some may be present in the organic part of the soil. Now, a little about fertilizers. They must contain any one or all three of the elements mentioned. A3 to nitrogen fertilizers, the most familiar are sodium nitrate and ammonium sulphate and they may be purchased under these names. The organic forms of nitrogen fertil - izers are tankage and dried blood. They work a little slower but might be more desirable in some cases. They cost a little more because they can also be used as animal feed. As far as the farmer is concerned, farmyard manure is largely a nitrogen manure. It contains other ele - ments too, but is valuable chiefly for its nitrogen content. The legume plants, clovers and alfalfa, are considered nitrogen fertilizers. That is the story as far as nitrogen is concerned. MR. HOPPERT: In western states when alfalfa is cheap, I have known them to use it as a fertilizer. MR. WELDON: Yes, a ton of alfalfa is worth as much as three tons of moist barnyard manure. Q: Is chicken manure better? .MR. WE7LDON: It is stronger than barnyard manure for three reasons. In the first place, it is usually drier; second, it usually has les3 litter in it; third, chickens are fed on concentrates which have high nitrogen and phosphate content. You should be very careful not to use too much of it. Phosphate fertilizers. The most valuable are superphosphates They will vary in the amount of phosphate they contain from 16% to 45%. Their actual value is directly proportional to the amount they contain. The one we find most on the market in Nebraska is the ,45% type. This is far ahead of all other phosphates in its effect. On ordin - ary crops like wheat and alfalfa, we do not recommend any other. Bone meal is pretty largely a phosphate fertilizer, although it does contain some nitrogen. It is much slower acting than auperphos- </seg>

There may be places, such as a greenhouse, whetfe you want a slow acting phosphate and bone meal may be worth more here. ? ¦ . • ¦..¦¦ ¦.¦¦-¦ : .. . IRock phosphate. This is a thing you want to stay away from in Nebraska. Further east, where soils are acid, it has its place. It has never shown any real effect on crops here. There are other forms ontne market which may be become useful. ' jPostash fertilizers (potassium). In general, the potash fertilizers are high grade and quickly available. We do not need to pay much attention to potash fertilizers here in Nebraska because most of our soilsjshow no need of them. In a few places, with a few crops, they are needed. . 'All farm animals are not fed the same kind of feed. So it is with crops. Different crops have different requirements. Now, what does each different element do for the plant? We'll takejnitrogen first. That element tells you right away through the appearance of the plant what it is doing. Plants with the right amount and with other conditions right have the dark green appear - ance i that we like to see. They grow rapidly and are vigorous. Plants that Jack it are generally spindly and yellow. This is especially notice - able in grain fields. However, a plant can get too much nitrogen. With an over supply, the plant produces an excessive vegetative growth but is unfruitful. You have noticed it with your tomatoes, big vines and often no fruit. Plant growth may be too succulent and soft for stor - ing o)- shipping. Maturity of the plant is often delayed. Phosphorus, what does it do? A supply of this hastens maturity, promotes development of the reproductive parts of the plant, (seed, in case of grains) and makes the plant more vigorous. Lack of phos - phorus is not obvious to the inexperienced eye. It doesn't produce any striking symptoms. An excessive supply of phosphrus is not likely to be found in greenhouses or anywhere that the crop is getting plenty of watet. Where we are growing crops under ordinary rainfall, we may havejtoo much phosphorus for the most productive growth of the plant! Over-stimulation by an excessive supply of phosphorus may occur!. Heavy, rank growth during a part of the season may occur and then this growth uses water fast when a dry spell comes. Under rain - fall, without irrigation, we have to keep our soil fertility balanced properly with the weather we may reasonably expect. Where we have an abundance of water, we need not worry. ¦'¦-."• I ':-( ¦•¦'.:•:'¦.¦' ' ¦¦¦'.:.''

I f you wonder whether it will help your tomatoes, try it on six plants and compare them with six other plants that did not have fertilizer. Q: How much time would you give it? ' MR. WELDON: You would have to wait until the end of the season. Q: Could a person make a chemical test and find out if these things were needed? A: Yes, but such a test does not tell the whole story. You must have other information too. You must know how this soil has been treated in previous years, whether other fertilizers have been added before, etc. The chemical test gives you just one bit of information about the way plants are going to grow but there are many other things that influence the growth of the crop every year. It may tell you tour times out of five, then again, only one-half the time. The fi - nal story is told only when you try the fertilizer and measure the results by the crop harvested. COMMENT: I have heard of using milk as a fertilizer on house plants. MR. WELDON: Milk is a good fertilizer. It is high in protein and is a source of nitrogen, an organic fertilizer, although it contains the othev elements too. It is a strong fertilizer, so don't ovevdo it. Q: I have read that dairymen in the east use superphosphates in their stable, so many pounds per day. Why don't we do this? .MR. WELDON; Their soils need this element and that 13 an easy way 10 spread it. The superphosphates tend to conserve the nitrogen in the manure and prevent its loss into the air. We don't do it here liecause. in general, our soils need little if any phosphates. Q: Does lime in the stable make the manure less valuable? A: Yes, especially if it is quick lime. It drives off ammonia. \ Q: How about sludge from sewage disposal plants as a fertilizer? Is it safe to use for commercial gardening? MR. WELDON; it is about the same type as barnyard manure ex - cept about twice as strong. Yes, bacteriologists say it safe to use. A process is used which destroys all germs. Q: Where lime is put on the soil, does it stay or does it leach out? A: It tends to stay. It is seldom necessary to put it on more than </seg>

DUNMAN: We have been experimenting with, various treat - ments to correct the yellowing of pin oaks. We got some satisfactory results in some cases and in others we did not. We supplied a mixture of sulphur and iron sulphate to the root system in holes bored in the soil a,round the trees. We applied about 5 or 6 pounds of each mater - ial tp each tree. Care must; be used not to apply too much iron sul - phate or burning of the leaves may result. MR.. WELDON: (Continuing). No deficiency of boron, copper, manganese or zinc has been reported in Nebraska except one case at the Halsey nursery. Magnesium and sulphur are, so far as I know, never lacking in Nebraska soils. Iron may be lacking in some western Nebraska soils where there is an excess of lime. I think I have never seen iron deficiency east of Shelton. Q: What about peat moss from a,brooder house as a fertilizer? MR. WELDON: I look on peat moss as a soil conditioner and, afterJ being used in the brooder house, would be considered a good fertilizer. Again, I caution you, be careful not to use too much. MR. ROBERTS: What about mineral colloids and other commer - cial fertilizers? Manufacturers claim lettuce is ten days earlier when they are used. A commercial gardner-wants to know these things. Jtfß. WELDON: You can only try them out, as I said before, wait until the end of the season for results. My father knows a chemist in Florida who is using superphosphates and mixing them with plants dredged out of the lakes!* He claims fine results. </seg>
         <seg id="p458">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. WELDON: That soil is almost pure sand and any organic matter will improve it. Q: What about artificial manure? A: It i 3 made by piling up straw and mixing with it superphos - phates, ammonium sulphate and limestone. Wet down and allow to rot. This produces a material that is equal to farmyard manure, if properly made. MR. HOPPERT: This has been an interesting discussion and from the questions that were asked I believe it has brought out some things you folks wanted to know. The next subject may be of interest if you have been reading the papers about waxing of fruits and vegetables. Mr. J. O. Dutt, Assistant Extension Horticulturist, will tell us about this and show us some samples. Mr. Dutt. WAXIXG TOMATOES AND ROOT CROPS TO PROLONG THEIR STORAGE PERIOD J. O. Dutt i MR. DUTT: Thi3 subject may not be practical here in Nebraska but a great deal of work has been done and is being accomplished in the east along these lines and also in California. - ( The shrivelling or shrinkage of fruits and vegetables in transit and in storage has always been a factor of great importance in, de - creasing their storage life and impairing their appearance. This shrinkage is more pronounced when it becomes necessary to wash such vegetables as tomatoes, carrots, and squashes for the purpose of' re - moving adherent soil, thus causing a loss of some of their naturally occurring waxy coating, with an attendant increase in shrivelling. As a means of reducing thi3 shrinkage several commercial processes have been developed by which protective wax films are deposited on the surface of fruits and vegetables after harvest. Rutabagas from Canada now found in our markets are common - ly waxed with paraffin as a means of keeping them firm and of a superior appearance. However, preliminary tests have shown that ordinary paraffin wax, although suitable for waxing nursery stock and rutabagas, is too heavy for more perishable fruits and vegetables. For, the latter, wax emulsions of various concentrations are necessary to avoid physiological breakdown while conserving moisture. The method which appears to be most promising for the waxing of vegetables at the present time is the dipping process, using a cold- </seg>
         <seg id="p459">¦I ' Nebraska State Horticulture Society wax emulson. A slightly modified method consists in spraying the emulsion directly onto the vegetable, although, this type of appli - cation is still very much in the experimental stage. Perhaps the great - est amount of research work done relative to the dipping process is the jwork of Dr. Hans Platenius of the New York State Agricultural College, Cornell University, Ithica, N. Y. He recently published a bul - letiri in which he studied the practical aspects in waxing at least fif - teenf different vegetables. The experiments described in this bulletin were carried out to investigate many of the basic principles involved in tlie waxing of vegetables by means of wax emulsions. ''Before describing this dipping- process, let us discuss the but - standing properties which a wax emulsion should have in order to be U3e4 successfully for treating vegetables. (1) They should be non tox - ic and edible and must not affect the flavor of the produce. (2) They should leave no residual odor, or cause discoloration of the produce. (3)' They must have good moisture retaining qualities and have a high, covering power. (4) They should be economical to apply, easily applied, and they should be non-inflammable. jit is important to remember that the advantage of applying wax emulsions to vegetables lies almost solely in the fact that on drying, the emulsion leaves an almost invisibly thin film of wax which greatly reduces the loss of water from the produce. Research work indicates that ijthese wax films have very [little or no effect on the spread of disease organisms nor do they prevent the gradual loss of sugar and other constituents'which are associated with the quality of the fresh produce.:. - ' ' ¦ ¦ '; ¦[-¦ : ';: I \' ; .

         <seg id="p460">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture green stage should aid in maintaining the fruits in a firm condition. In sections of the country where growers are forced to pick tomatoes in the mature green stage in the late fall or lose them through freez - ing, the waxing of tomatoes may be of great importance in lengthen - ing the storage life of these fruits. Often an increase of only one or two weeks in the period for which tomatoes can be stored will help the grower obtain a much better return for the late crop than he re - ceives at present. Platenius state 3 that in his experiments with to - matoes, the waxing of pink or red-ripe fruits never was of any value because the fruits became overmature before they showed any signs of shriveling. Tomatoes may be waxed in the following manner: They should be picked when they become mature-green or have reached the turn - ing stage. Only sound fruits, without open crack 3, and from which all dirt has been removed, should be waxed. A certain amount of the concentrated wax, depending upon the dilution recommended by the manufacturer, is slowly poured into the drum or tub containing the proper amount of clean water and the mixture is stirred until homo - geneous. The tomatoes are placed in the wire basket and submerged in the wax. lifted out, and allowed to drain for one minute. Then they are taken out of the basket and permitted to dry on a clean grading table. The drying time required may vary from 5 to 20 minutes, de - pending on the temperature and humidity in the drying room. After the fruits have dried, they may be packed and stored for ripening. The temperature should be from 50° to 70° F. Tempera - tures above and below this range produce an undesireable yellow color of the fruits and cause them to become soft. If it is desireable to hold tomatoes for more than four weeks, a ripening temperature of 50° to 60° F. is recommended . At 70° F. most of the fruit will ripen in ten days. No light is required for ripening. If the air in the ripen - ing room is excessively dry, moist sawdust or moist bag 3 on the floor will help to raise the humidity. The fruits should not be stacked more than 6 inches deep. When some of the fruits become ripe, they should be sorted over every three or five days. The total storage period for tomatoes, including the ripening period, is from six to eight weeks, provided temperature and humidity are suitable. There will always be some fruits in each lot which may break down during this period. Tomatoes which have been stored for five weeks or longer will break down within a few days when held at room temperature, therefore, they should reach the ultimate consumer as quickly as possible after they leave the storage. To give you some idea as to the results which one can expect in waxing tomatoes I shall describe one of Platenius' experiments. In this test, mature green tomatoes were divided into two lots of 42 </seg>

One group was waxed and the, other one was held as a control, with both lots being stored at a temperature of 60° P., for 38 days. At the end of the experiment each lot was sorted for market - able fruits and culls.] It was found the percentage of marketable fruits was 73 per cent In the waxed lot, as compared with 47 per cent in the unwaxed one. Similar results were obtained when this experi - ment was repeated. These results lead us to believe that the waxing "of mature green tomatoes is practical. ! j* ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ / ¦ [The waxing of ryot crops such as beets, carrots, and turnips is beinfe carried out to some extent in certain'sections of the vegetable producing areas of oyr country. Research workers hare carried out experiments with bunched carrots, beets, and radishes by dipping the entire bunches into the emulsion and comparing this to treating only the Jroots of these vegetables. Waxing the entire bunches presented an insurmountable drying problem. On the other hand the benefit derived from the waxing the root part only ot certain vegetables was too small to warrant;its commercial use. In many instances growers do consider it worth while to wax the root part of bunched carrots mainly because the color and appearance of the roots themselves ¦•are improved. ; ; IPlatenius states that there is good reason to believe that the wax - ing of topped carrots will be adopted fairly generally within the next fewlyears. The results obtained in waxing this root crop were out - standing. As compared with carrots, the protection derived from wax- Ing beets was comparatively small. [In calculating the total cost involved in the waxing operation, ex - penses for equipment jand labor must be taken into consideration, to - gether with the cost of the wax emulsion. The actual quantity of wax deposited on the vegetables is exceedingly small and from data ob - tained in various experiments on the thickness of the wax film, it has been calculated that one gallon of the concentrated wax emulsion is sufficient to cover 250 to 300 bushels. Experience has shown, how - ever, that in commercial practice the actual quantity of emulsion used per bushel is about three times higher than that consumed under ex - perimental conditions. At an average cost of ?2.50 per gallon for the concentrated emulsion, the cost for waxing will vary between 3 and 4 cents per bushel. Waxing by means of hand equipment on a small scale! reduces this cost somewhat because the losses from dripping and spoilage are smaller. jln order that you may see for yourselves the effect of waxing up - on certain fruits and vegetables I have here before me specimens which I waxed at different intervals during the past twenty days.

The main idea 13 it may keep the product In a more attractive style in the stores. It is not new so far as rutabagas are concerned. We have had them waxed for years. Mr. Werner has an interesting subject to present now, "New Varieties of Tomatoes that have Produced Well in Hot Weather". TOMATOES THAT PRODUCE IN HOT WEATHER H. O. Werner The tomato is one ot the most popular vegetables grown in com - mercial and in home gardens. In the recent dry hot seasons many people have complained about their vines not setting fruit. Some folks have the mistaken notion that insects like blister beetles and grass - hoppers have eaten off the flowers, but the most plausible explana - tion for this situation is that the flowers failed to pollinate during such hot periods and then they fell off. Plant breeders like Dr. A. F. Yeager formerly of North. Dakota and now at Michigan State College recognized the difficulty for what it was and tried to do something about it. There are some types of tomatoes that will set fruit in hot weather, but most of these were of little value. The small cherry and pear tomatoes are of this type Dr. Yeager used these as one parent and various desirable commer - cial varieties as the other parent in order to secure hybrids that have the size and quality of such varieties as Break 0' Day, Earlianna, etc., and the fruiting ability of the cherry tomatoes. After several years of hybridizing and testing, a number of promising varieties were re - leased for general distribution. Others are being developed and no doubt additional valuable contributions will be made to our variety lists. During the last four seasons over a hundred varieties of tomatoes have been tested at Lincoln, North Platte, Scottsbluff and Alliance to determine which varieties will do best in the various regions of the state. Five of the highest yielding sorts belonged to the group of new hybrids. The reason, apparently, why these can set fruit in hot weather is that the pistils of each of them are short and the stamens extend out beyond the pistil giving protection to it as well as assuring pollination in as short a time as possible yields of 20 to 30 pounds </seg>

', Ajnother factor that makes for more consistent bearing is the fact that even in rich soil under irrigation these new varieties will produce small to medium sized vines and lots of flowers. Under simi - lar conditions most of the old standard sorts will produce huge vines but scarcely a flower. .J ¦ ¦. ¦.'*¦'¦ * &#132;/ The varieties Bison, All Red and Ruby were developed by Dr. A. F. JYeager while at the North Dakota station. Victor was released by him after additional work at Michigan State College. Firesteel was developed by Clare Barber of Watertown, South Dakota from ;a cross between Bison and Pritchard. Further details ,on each of these vari - eties follow. &#132;¦•"",• ' '¦.: ¦¦ . f : . : ¦¦.¦¦¦'.-..: / :. \ .;' ¦ • Bison. The earliest large fruit tomato sets fruit well in hot years. Vines [are small, seldom spreading more than three feet. When prop - erly grown, fruit is large, red, and of good quality! though frequently some fruits will be rough. If the soil is constantly supplied with an adequate amount of moisture vines will continue to grow and set ad - ditional clusters of fruit so that the total yield for the season will be very good. As soon as soil moisture becomes deficient vine growth is checked and developing fruits will remain small. If the soil lacks fer - tility vines will be small and production low. Sometimes the portions of frujt near the stem end remain green after the balance of the fruit i 3 red j but eventually all portions ripen to a good red color. Under ad - verse .conditions leaves may die off leaving fruit exposed so that some sun scald occurs. In spite of some of these shortcomings, this is the be3t variety now available for growing early tomatoes, and for cer - tainty! of production in hot years. It will be most useful to home gar - deners, has merit for canning and juice but is of less interest to mar - ket gardeners because of variability in shape and size of fruit. Ail Red produces fruit almost as early as Bison. As the name im - plies, the fruit ripens to a uniform red color over the entire fruit. This.Has been the most consistently high yielding variety at all place 3 in thej four jears it has been tested. Vines are small but somewhat largerjthan Bison. Like the Bison it should have an adequate amount of moisture and a rich soil. The fruit turns to a very light or white green jcolor before changing to red, and even where exposed to direct 3unshine, green or partly ripe fruits seldom scald in the sun as do fruits!that are dark green before ripening. Some years or at some places!the fruit has been very rough though sometimes a high persent - age ofj smooth fruit is produced. For home use or for canning or juice makinjg this variety may be more generally useful than Bison. Ruby produces very large meaty fruits with a pink skin. Vines </seg>
         <seg id="p464">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture are small but slightly larger than either Bison or All Red but growth requirements are about the same. Like the All Red the fruit turns to a uniform white green color before ripening uniformly and does not sun scald easily. Of all early varieties the fruits of this variety are the largest and most suitable for slicing. This variety should be very useful in many places and may have possibilities for market gardeners. Victor is a new variety developed from a cross of All Red and Break-O'-Day partly by the North Dakota and partly by the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Stations. It was tested in 1939 under the number Michigan 4137. This variety produces relatively uniform me - dium sized red fruits at about the same time as Ruby. Fruits turn white green before ripening, hence sun scald rarely occurs. The leave 3 are dark green and stay in good condition for a long time. This variety set fruit under very adverse conditions in 1939. Firosteel. This variety was developed by Clare Barber of Water - town. South Dakota out of a cross between Bison and Pritchard. In the 1939 tests it was an outstanding variety because of the large yield of relatively smooth, uniform and very meaty red fruit, because of its ability to set fruit in hot weather, and because the vines remain in good condition for a long time. It is later than the previously described four varieties, but is still almost as early as the Earlianna. On soils of limited fertility or somewhat restricted moisture supply it may do better than the other varieties. Q: What about sour tomatoes? Do you suppose watering has any - thing to do with this? A: There are differences in varieties. I haven't noticed that a3 a result of irrigation. The 'Red Heart' was in bad favor for a few years at the Experiment Station. They said it was bitter but this year they couldn't find any fault with it. Q: Will fruit set on with temperatures at 95°? DR. WERNER: Yes, it the temperature drops down at night or drops down for a few days, fruit will set. Q: Did the moderate weather in August this year make good tomatoes? DR. WERNER: Unfavorable weather for fruit setting in July and favorable weather in August did no good for there was no fruit to ripen in August. Q: Are all tomatoes self fertilized? A: Yes, practically all of them. Q: Is the 'Firesteel' a large plant or small? </seg>

I re - alize, however, that your problem i 3 different from ours in Missouri You have fewer orchards and have a better local market. For several years apple growers throughout the country have felt keenly the financial effects of the prevailing low prices. All are sure that there is something wrong with the apple business. Entirely too few, however, fully appreciate the principal factors and funda - mental changes which have brought about these conditionsi It is generally agreed, however, by those best informed on apple prices that the chief factors affecting sales and returns are: (1) pro - duction, (2) citrus competition, and (3) buying power or business activity.

The export trade has varied from 7 to 14 million bushels and has greatly assisted markets. It seems to be a necessary outlet for crops of average sizes. C. The 1939 crop apparently approximates the 1935 crop in size. Present export conditions would not indicate the 12 million bushels export experienced in 1935. Apparently there are approximately 20 millibn bushels of commercial apples this season in excess of the de - sirable quantity of 70 to 80 million bushels. { Orange and Grapefruit Competition Jn the 1938-1939 season, the domestic supply of these fruit ex - ceedejd that of apples for the first time. The present citrus crop will probably be as large as last year's record crop with a reduction of grapefruit but an increase of oranges. It will be larger than the citrus crop marketed with the 1935 and 1937 large apple crops. This season will be the first year that a large citrus crop and a large apple crop are on the markets at the same time. Apples apparently lost their placej as the largest fruit crop of the United States. ¦ ,¦¦}•'-' ¦'¦¦¦¦¦--' .'¦.-. } -Principal Factors that Affect Apple Prices 1.

Citrus Competition—The supply ofdtrus fruit also has had in the past a very definite effect on the price received by apples; the larger the citrus crop the lower the price of apples. 3. Buying power or business activity is the third condition that affects apple prices. Apple prices tend to follow increases or decreases in non-agricultural income. The foregoing statements have been proven by statistical meth - ods using past data on production of apples and citrus and past data on non-agricultural income, according to the U. S. Department ot Agi - culture. :V'l- - ¦ ¦ ' ¦• - :' ' ¦ An illustration would be aa follows: /^ith an average supply of oranges and average demand condi - tion, a commercial apple crop of 103 million bushels should return the growers an average of about 93c per bushel (supply and demand). If, however, the orange crop is not an average crop of 48 million boxes but a crop of 83 million boxes (the 1938 crop) the influence </seg>
         <seg id="p468">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of these additional oranges on the market would be to reduce the price of apples about 32c per bushel or apples in such a year with av - erage non-agricultural Income would return not 93c but 61c per bushel. If, however, In the above illustration, the non-agricultural income was not average (89) but 95, the effect would be to increase the price of apples from 61c per bushel to about 70c per bushel. All fruits now compete more effectively and extensively with the apple than ever before. For example, canned fruit juices and vege - table juices increased from 1,000,000 cases in 1929, to 34,500,000 in 193 7. Furthermore, the domestic consumption of apples has been reduced by 14 per cent in 15 years. When we consider also that other fruits, particularly citrus, have increased about 50 per cent, the re - duction in the consumption of apples of 14 per cent in 15 years is not so discouraging. When prices of citrus fruits are low and comparable to those of the apple, the consumer is as likely to buy oranges, bananas, or grape - fruit as apples. In either case, under present conditions the consumer may be satisfied but the producers make no money and even lose money. Changes in Consumer Purchasing Power Changes in consumer purchasing power have occurred, but even after adjustments have been made, it is found that larger crops not only bring low prices but also give the producers the smallest net re - turns. The income of industrial workers dropped during the period 1924-29 about 80 per cent, while fruit prices were reduced nearly 60 per cent. Without a doubt consumer buying power has entered into the problem and should be considered as one of the principal causes for low prices of apples, yet such factors as large production and citrus competition undoubtedly are the chief causes for depress - ed apple returns. Apple Crop of 1939 The apple crop for 1939 has been a large one. All of the chief apple producing regions except the Western States produced big crops. The Western commercial crop is considerably below the average for the past 10 years, due to losses from heat, drought, and insect ravages. For the Central States the crop is about double the yield tor 1938. It is also a third larger than the average o{ the last ten yearß. Further - more, the commercial apple crop in the East is considerably greater than the majority of the crops in recent years. </seg>
         <seg id="p469">; Nebraska State Horticulture Society ¦ .Summaries, Fruit Outlook Report [Summaries taken from the Fruit Outlook Report of the U. S De - partment of Agriculture for 1938 are significant. They show that the total production of apples, pears, peaches, and citrus fruits on a per capita basis in the six-year period, 1919 to 1924, amounted to 130 pounds/During the following six-year period, 1925 to 1930, produc - tion [is given as 129 pounds per capita. The next period of six years, 1931 to 1936, the per capita production was 135 pounds. From these figures, it is clear that the total production of these fruits on a per capita basis has not changed niaterially. ilf we consider some of the fruits separately on a per capita basis, it is j found that rather marked changes have occurred. For example, over;the same three six-year periods mentioned above, the production of apples follows: 71 pounds, 61 pounds, and 57 pounds per capita. Thisjrepresents a marked decrease in consumption for the 18-year peri - od. For this same period, however, citrus has shown a large increase, giving 30 pounds, 39 pounds, and 49 pounds. In addition to the competition with citrus fruits of our own country, reports indicate that apple production is on the increase in othei countries. From 1920 to 1930, apple exports accounted for a - bout}ls to 20 per cent of our commercial production. With the evi - dent increase in production beyond our borders, it is fairly certain that we cannot expect anything like as large export trade as we have en - joyed in the past. jt is clear to most producers that the quantity of apples which can be sold for satisfactory prices depends on consumer demand and completition from other fruits, as well of course as the supply of apples itself j It must also be remembered that all of these factors should be considered in determining the supply necessary to return fair prices /: to producers in any given year. These figures also show that during the past twenty years com - mercial apple production in the Central States has averaged 18 million bushes as-compared to 38 million bushels In the Eastern States and 39 million bushels for the Western States. It will be noted that the commercial production in the Central States averages less than % that in other areas, yet the average from year to year in actual number of bushels produced is greater than in the Western States, and as great [as that in the Atlantic States. • -¦'.¦.-; I.

To improve the sale of apples, one of the most important points for growers to recognize is that of selling only the best apples and placing the less desirable apples in consumption through apple by- </seg>
         <seg id="p470">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture products, such as apple juice, dried apples, apple sauce, etc. With growers generally adhering to this plan even during big crop years, it is believed that not more than approximately 70 to 80 million bushels of fresh fruit would go into consumption, and from past experience sales no larger than this should bring the producers fair returns. Fur - thermore, it should also be thoroughly understood that there is a de - finite limit to the quantity of fruit which can be sold at satisfactory prices in any one season. This, of course, implies that the market should never be flooded to a point where ruinous prices result. The ideal toward which we should strive would be an orderly program of marketing all the better grades, and in keeping the supply within the bounds of consumptive requirements in order to maintain fair prices to producers. Influence of Legislation Legislative enactment may be advisable, providing it is sponsor - ed and secured by the growers. This might be particularly true if it required the adoption of the best grades and packs, and the elimination of inferior apples from fresh fruit markets. Such legislative acts may encourage the growth of by-product plants, which would use more of the so-called "off-grade" apples, as apple juice, syrup, concentrate, dried apples, etc. Production of Citrus Fruits The production of citrus fruits is given as follows: Oranges and grapefruits averaged 40 million boxes annually from 1920 to 1924, rose to an average of 74 million boxes from 1932 to 1936, reached 106 million boxes in 1937, and 119 million boxes in 1938. It is now stated that the volume of citrus fruit in bushels is about a3 large as the -average apple crop. It cannot, therefore, be truthfully said any more that the apple is produced in largest amounts of all tree fruits. Bearing Apple Trees The Outlook Report of the U. S. Department of Agriculture gives figures regarding the number of bearing trees at various dates since 1910, with the estimated numbers for 1940 and 1945. They are signi - ficant in that they seem to indicate that apple production may in the future be a smaller part of the total fruit industry. Moreover, with the marked decrease predicted in production, better prices should prevail. </seg>

The records show that the average yield per tree in 1910 was about 1.25 bushels. By 193J5 the yield had increased to nearly 2 bushels per bearing tree. In spitp of this increased production per tree, however, total produc - tion for the country has decreased during the past 25 years. Moreover, there Is every indication that the decrease will continue somewhat duringfthe next ten years. Furthermore, we may not expect any great - er production per tree during the next ten years. Apple census figures indicate that apple trees have not been planted in sufficient numbers during the past few years to keep pace with the number of old apple trees going out of production. It is gen - erally Juiown that apple trees throughout the do not. have a profitable bearing life of more than 30 to 40 years. Perhaps for the Central States area we cannot plan on apple orchards being profitable for moj-e than 30 to 35 years. Since this is true, it seems probable that about 25 per cent of our orchards which are now in the 30 years of age group will pass out of [production within the next ten years. Orchards which are now 25 to &amp;0 years of age will also pass their period of good production duringi.the next 10 years. : Furthermore, it appears that the Rocky Mountain States and the Pacific Coast has passed its peak in apple production, and that yields jn the future will drop moderately. Consequently, from a long range view, possibly 10 to 15 .years hence the apple crop may be ma - terially; less than it is at present. This prediction assumes that grow - ers continue to plant and replace as few apples trees as in recent years. ; Summary of the 1030 Apple Condition There apparently is a crop of 103 million bushed of apples that have been and will be offered for sale as fresh fruit. The export trade may take some, perhaps six million bushels as a minimum. The maxi - mum of twelve million would be too optimistic. This would leave 91 to 91 njillion bushels to be disposed of in the domestic fresh fruit mar- </seg>
         <seg id="p472">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ket. This amount of apples was sold in both 1935 and 1937, but the price received was disasterous to most producers. Also there will be more citrus competition in 1939 than in either 1935 or 1937. On the other hand, the public buying power is better than in 1935 and may be better than in 1937. Apparently there i 3 a surplus of about 20 million bushels over the quantity that would sell at a price growers would consider a rea - sonable return. Possible Solutions of the Surplus 1. Increased export. 2. Increased prices because of "war food prices". 3. Increased consumption. 4. Diversion of large quantities to by-products. 5. Large purchases by the Federal Surplus Commodity Corpora - tion. 6. United effort of growers to divert low grades. Apple Publicity To make apple production pay in the future, most fruit growers are agreed that better publicity should be given the fruit. An abund - ance of evidence regarding the value of publicity has been secured from the rapid development and sale of citrus fruits throughout the country. Various ways and means of bringing the wholesome and valuable qualities of the apple before the consuming public may be de - veloped. In the consideration of effective methods of better apple publicity, economy of necessity must be emphasized, because growers generally are not in a position financially that would even warrant fairly heavy expenditures. In our own state, Missouri, a campaign of publicity for the apple was launched chiefly through the Agricultural Extension Service of the College of Agriculture, and the Farm Security Service. The Miss - ouri State Horticultural Society was largely instrumental for the movement with both agencies. The Home Economics Extension Staff has carried during the fall and winter Information regarding the various ways in which the apple may be used, and its value for health, to the Home Demonstration Agents of both the Agricultural Ex. Service and the Farm Security Ser - vice. As a result, both groups have held meetings in practically every county and township of Missouri. It is believed that no other type of </seg>

ENGSTROM: During the past years of unusual moisture de - ficiency, particularly of the northern Great Plains region and extend - ing as far east as western Minnesota and lowa, farmers have been searching for supplemental water supplies for both domestic and livestock use and crop production. As a result of each successive year of drouth, an increasing number of farmers are considering some type of irrigation development. Nebraska has excellent soils for agriculture, but climatically it is unfortunately situated as to the moisture laden winds which re - lease nolsture during crop growing periods. We can feel sure that the </seg>
         <seg id="p474">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture physiographic features of the state are such that practically all of the moisture that is received and a great deal of supplemental water from adjacent states can be used economically for crop production. • An inadequate supply of good quality water for domestic and livestock use has presented a problem in some parts of Nebraska. Even in years of sufficient rainfall, it has not been possible to realize bumper crops in the eastern one-half of Nebraska. I believe I will dis - cuss some of these charts which I have obtained through the courtesy of Dr. Condra, with reference to the water conditions in eastern Neb - raska. Since this is a meeting of fruit growers, we will discuss only those counties lying south of the Platte and ea3t of Lincoln where fruit Is grown. The predominating soil type is glacial drift capped in some sections by a thin mantle of Loess. What about the ground water in this region? These soils are underlain with heavy layers of shale. What !Bi W ff fliTii ¦ifvtvMßl Ball A tiWlflM »M I FiM vi The commercial apple exhibit of the Kimmel orchard took the blue ribbon to this class. about a well under these conditions? A fair supply of water Is avail - able in some of these gravels overlying the shale. On stream beds, a supply may be obtained in average years but, in dry years this is scarce. Usually no difficulty is encountered in obtaining a water sup - ply from the alluvial deposits in the valleys. (A detailed discussion of maps and charts shown.) From these charts, we can see then that the ground water situ - ation in this region ot Nebraska does present rather a serious prob- </seg>
         <seg id="p475">j Nebraska State Horticulture Society Jem and that even if supplemental water is obtained for crop use for irrigation, it is quite out of the question to do so economically. Many farmers are having difficulty in getting sufficient water for domestic and livestock use in eastern Nebraska. j What are some of the other sources which might Ibe considered for developing supplemental water supplies? One important consider - ation jhas been rather generally overlooked, the surplus water that we receive from rains and melting snow, in other words, run-off wa - ter. On the steep slopes in this section of Nebraska, it is of great con - sequence. The times when we receive rainfall from 2" to 6" within a short jperiod of time, we lose through run-off a very substantial a - mountj. How may we conserve this run-off water? ¦Vjarious practices, are employed to catch this rainfall where it falls. Wehave different types of soils and they have definite rates of waterlabsorption; sand, rapid absorption and rapid percolation; heavy clay and silt soils, percolation slower and after it is saturated, the re - lease is also slow. 1" '.:. -¦' .-' ¦ ;-; .-' ' ¦ ¦ ¦".

Other mechanical measures which might be employed are small ponds or reservoirs. They might be lo - cated so they could be utilized to pump from during long periods of dry weather. Of course, the water shed that is supplying the reser - voir should be protected in order to prevent silting. Reservoir sites are, in some instances, not very common but there are depressional areas that are capable of catching and storing con - siderable amounts of run-off water which can either be pumped out of them when needed or, through properly constructed gates, let out on the land adjoining through contours. That would be expensive, of course, for ordinary crops. For specialized crops, such as fruit grow - ing, it would probably be well worth while. Pumping from streams has been employed to some extent. The matter of pumping from streams to the high land is quite, out of the question because of the cost of raising the water. I believe there is some possibility of developing supplemental water supplies from cer- IW I 'HI IE This rock garden setting by Haggerty Nursery Co. of Lincoln won a blue ribbon at the 1939 State Fair. tain sections of this area from the catchment of rainfall. Even though we could catch and hold all of the rainfall, would this be sufficient? That question needs more study and investigation. I don't believe it can be answered now. What we could conserve certainly would go a long way toward extending the life of our trees in eastern Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p477">.!.- Nebraska State Horticulture Society Ijhave been asked questions recently about Water Facilities Pro - gram as administered through the 11. iS. Department of Agriculture through three of its bureaus, Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Soil Conservation Service, and Farm Security Administration. The pro - gram jwas designed primarily to assist needy farm families in devel - oping a. small water supply to assist them to become self-sufficient. On small plots, to permit them to grow additional feed supplies for stock and food for the family table. The program benefits several classes of people. The first class which receives the greatest benefit is that farm family who is eligible for a Farm Security Administration loan, whose j resources have been practically exhausted and it is necessary for him to ask federal assistance in order to live. That individual is eligible to make a loan to the maximum amount of $2,000 to develop any practical or feasible water facility on. the land which he operates, a pond, reservoir, retention dams, well, pump, windmill or the repair of windmills, developing springs or other ground water supplies. Wa - ter seems to be the greatest need of the farmer at the present time. The second class that benefits, that farmer or rancher who can't qualify as a standard rehabilitation client, in other words, he has some resources but not enough to invest in a water facility. He, too, is en - titled jo a loan from the Farm Security Administration. The third class, the individual who is financially able but could use th| water facility in increasing his income by better use of the land he is operating.

         <seg id="p478">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture This program is operating in the seventeen arid and semiarid western states, Nebraska being the farthest east state. So far, most of the work has been done in the western part of this state, the south Repiit&gt;!ic-an river valley, an area on the Niobrara, and Hat Creek Basin in Sioux county. Operations this year must be restricted to these small areas. It is essential that economic planning precede all oper - ations. In addition, there are ten counties outside of these areas where water facilities to the maximum number of four can be established. De - monstrations have been established in the Republican river. Lodgepole Creek, and Niobrara drainage areas. Tenants as well as owner operators can take advantage of this help. There are certain restrictions, of course. Requests are coming in from other drainage areas for the development of pump irrigation. 1 think we are resigned to the idea that development of pump irriga - tion in eastern Nebraska is quite out of the question because of the around water supplies, as I have pointed out.

I believe that a great deal more remains to be done in eastern Nebraska toward conserving the rainfall that we get. Ojur rainfall of the past 30 or 40 years created havoc to the soils themselves. Much of the good top layer of the soil, humus laden, has been lpst through the action of the run-off water. That layer is what holds the moisture when the rain comes and we are observing that much is now being lost because the subsoil left is not capable of absorbing it. .1 realize the picture I have painted is not very rosy because of grounc. water conditions 1 and topographic features but a number of fruit growers have taken pains to erect dikes around their trees to catch j-un-off and found that it has paid. With trees, as with other farm crops, we may be able to develop a drouth resistant variety. AH of these things together may solve our situation. MR.

         <seg id="p480">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture COMMENT: There is plenty of water in creeks but when they are dammed, they silt up right away. What could be done about that? MR. ENGSTROM: If the land that Is drained is intensively culti - vated, this loose soil is easily carried away. If a dam is being contem - plated, protect the area drained from rapid run-off by contouring and terracing. This slows the water down and it will carry less silt. Of course, different owners on the water shed makes this difficult. i MR. MARSHALL (Arlington): Dick Kimmel has had a lot of ex - perience with irrigating his orchard. I would like to hear from him. RICHARD KIMMEL (Nebraska City): There is a lot of my ex - perience, Mr. Marshall, that I don't like to talk about. I agree that silting is perhaps my biggest problem. We tried dams such as Frank mentioned and high waters took out the dams or else silted them up un - til they were useless. Finally, we put a tank in the bottom of the creek and drove shiplap on end, to raise the water level about six inches. That has worked so far but, of course, -we haven't had any big rains since we tried it. FRANK SIM: Is there an engineer who could give us the infor - mation about cost of pumping this water? Could someone from your office he\p us? MR. ENGSTROM: Yes, I think an engineer might be assigned for such a project. MR. RABEX: Surely some good will come from this discussion of conserving our water supply. Thank you, Mr. Engstrom, for the suggestions you have given us although they are not as encouraging as we might wish. Our next topic is "Feed Value of Apples and Apple Pomace". I can think of no one who, is better qualified to handle such a subject than Win. Loeffel of the Animal Husbandry Department here at the College of Agriculture. We will hear from him now. MR. LOEFFEL: The topic assigned to me was apples for feed. Most of the program this morning has been rather gloomy and I am afraid my paper will be right along the same line. FEEDING VALUE OF APPLES AND APPLE POMACE Wm. J. Loeffel In reviewing the literature on the feeding of apples and apple pomace, there seems to be two benefits in the minds of those who have worked on this subject. In the first place there is the benefit due to the feeding value of the products themselves. Secondly, It is </seg>
         <seg id="p481">j Nebraska State Horticulture Society ¦ I ':' .

It is my purpose here to consider only the feeding value of apples and apple by-pro - ducts.,' . ' ; ¦'.¦¦ ¦• ¦-. ¦ ¦ ¦-¦¦.• ¦ •¦; ¦¦ ' • '¦.. . . AJpples and apple by-products are quite bulky. They may be compared with such feeds as the root crops and silage as will be not - ed from the following table, which is based upon analysis given in Morrison's Feeds and Feeding: Percentage Composition Dry Crude Mineral Matter Protein- Fat .Fibre N.F.E.

The bulky nature of apples make it imperative to U3e them for animals with large digestive capacity such as cattle and lambs. In some yermont tests carried on in 1901 apples were found to be 40 per cent as valuable as corn silage for dairy cattle. More recent work conducted by the Oregon station showed cull Newton apples to be 76 per cent as valuable as corn silage. A Virginia grower re - ports that he always feeds cull apples to his cattle and horses and that they stay in excellent condition. He begins with the Transparents which Jare available about July 1 in his section, adding a few apples morning and evening to the other feed. The quantity of appleg is increased gradually: until his cattle consume from three-fourth to one bushelj of apples night and morning. Other feeds are reduced in amount as the proportion of apples is increased. He states that by extensive apple feeding he is able to reduce the hay consumption one - half toj two thirds. This man reports that apples stimulate milk flow and w|ien his cull apples have been utilized and it necessary to re - turn to the standard ration that a drop in production is noted ¦• ' I : . ¦ •.¦¦' .; ' ' ; •' ' .-¦.'¦ ¦¦¦¦¦'. Apples have long been recognized as a conditioner for horses and are frequently used as an appetizer in their rations. </seg>
         <seg id="p482">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Lambs Can Utilize Apples Too Perhaps more extensive work has been done in feeding cull apples to lambs than any other class of livestock. In a Washington test l\i pounds of apples per head daily along with corn and alfalfa hay fed to fattening lambs produced as good results as the same amount of corn silage. Larger amounts of apple 3 produced less satisfactory re - sults. In fact, increasing the daily allowance of apples to 2 pounds per head daily showed a marked reduction in the appetites and gains of the lambs.

' "«« ••:"'- "¦¦ '¦¦ I Because of the limited digestive capacity of pigs, these animals cannot utilize apples as effectively as the ruminants. In a Utah bulletin (101) Clark reports that apples were used to replace part of the grain in pig rations. Nine to 15 pounds of apples were required to replace i pound of grain. In a communication received from Professor Howard Hackedorn of Washington State College he reported some work done at his station recently in feeding some big thin hogs weighing 175 pounds. One lot received a full feed of 12 parts barley andj'l part tankage. They made an average daily gain of 2.3 pounds and 1 required 348 pounds of grain for each 100 pounds of gain. A similar lot of pigs received three-fifths of the daily grain ration fed to . j ¦ '-.'•"- ¦¦.¦'¦ .;¦¦ : ¦'.¦¦¦; ¦'I ¦ ' • ¦' ¦¦¦¦¦:. ' ¦ • </seg>
         <seg id="p484">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the preceding lot and in addition also was given all the apples they would consume. This lot gained 1.88 pounds per day and required 259 pounds of grain plus 255 pounds of apples for every 100 pounds ot gain. This test was only o£ 28 days' duration. In another test cull apples were led to pigs weighing approximately 75 pounds and Professor Hackedorn states that slow gains were secured and the degree of finish of the apple-fed pigs was decidedly inferior. Apple Pomace Wet pomace contains approximately 21 per cent dry matter as compared with 28 per cent for corn silage. It contains one-third as much digestible protein as corn silage and is slightly lower than corn silage in total digestible nutrients. Apple pomace may be fed fresh, ensiled, or dry. Although the chemical analysis ot this feed -would in - dicate a lower feeding value than corn silage, nevertheless feeding tests show it is approximately equal, pound for pound, to corn silage. It is suggested that where pomace is fed to dairy cattle that it be fed after milking !o avoid flavoring the milk. Preserving Cull Apples Cull apples are best stored in trenches or cellars. Attempts to store them in silos, either alone or in straw, have not been en - tirely satisfactory. I was particularly interested in some recent accounts from the eastern part of the United States where apples have been successfully ensiled in grass silage. About two-thirds grass and one-third apples are fed into the silage cutter. The resultant silage was almost equal to corn silage in feeding value and proved more palatable. In conclusion, we should regard cull apples as a feed comparable to silage and the root crops. They are high in water and their dry matter consists chiefly of sugar. They are low in protein and some good source of protein should be included in the ration. They can probably be used most effectively in rations for cattle and sheep. Q: Did you find in any of the reports any trouble with animals losing their teeth or dropping off in milk as a result of feeding apples? MR. BANNING: We fed all our culls and old apples to sheep and had no trouble with falling teeth. MR. LOEFFEL: Evidence shows in some instances in these re - ports from Virginia that apples increased milk production. MR. HOPPERT: Of course, one would have to start slowly and accustom them to the apples. </seg>

AXXUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY FOR 1939 J The activities of the Horticultural Society for the fiscal year 1939 began with the annual meetings held in conjunction with Organized Agr|culture at Lincoln Dec. 6, 7, 8. On December 6th were held the meetings pertaining to ornamental phases of Horticulture. On Dec. 7th |: camje the vegetable growing program and on Dec. Bth the fruit, grov - !. ing j program.

         <seg id="p486">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Agricultural Trade Relations Incorporated attended the meeting and presented some ideas that his organization had in mind to stimulate apples sales and apple consumption. The plan included advertising throughout the season, special apple weeks in October, December, and February. An apple stabilization committee was appointed consist- Ing of Dearie Baker. W. B. Banning,, Loy Franklin, Everett Good, Cas - seius Kennedy, Val Keyset R. C. Kimmel, Grove Porter, Harvey Raben. Wm. Porter, J. L. Steivers with E. H. Hoppert chairman. This committee was to help local ss.les by calling on the local stores to ad - vertise apples. They were to contact the local newspapers to publish stories about apples. (One paper, the Peru Pointer, got a special edition on apples, which was sent all over the state, particularly to outstate editors.) The Agricultural Extension Service was to cooperate locally by sending out the names and locations of orchards to outstate county asents with varieties listed and the time of their harvest. The state office were to assist by broadcasting stories about apple harvest and recipes for apples. The Horticultural Society also agreed to help advertise with fea - ture apple displays at the State Fair and at Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show. Unfortunately the fall season was very hot and dry. On Sep - tember Ist began a series of hot windy days that continued for two weeks with temperatures above 100° on several days. The drop re - sulting from these conditions was terrific. Naturally the loss of fruit was too. The carefully laid plans could not cope with the disaster be - cause the apples just wouldn't stand up under such conditions. By-pro - duct factories couldn't begin to use the great quantities of drops and culls that growers accumulated in the grading operations and many hundreds of bushels rotted or were dumped In ravines and other out of the way places. The better grades went into storage.of course, but there weren't many of these in the case of the Jonathans.; Thereafter, the marketing became more orderly and the season finished up without further disaster. The summer tour usually held in early August failed to ma - terialize in 1939 primarily because of drought and heat. It seems that when it is hot and dusty fruit growers, like most other folks, just don't care to run around in orchards. EXHIBITS. The Society again helped the State Fair Board with its annual fair by taking charge of the fruit and flower display. Some of the displays are shown in pictures accompanying the report. The displays of flowers were good this year but the hot- weather that persisted throughout the week soon wilted them. By Thursday very few of the garden flowers were left on the tables.

Mr. Talbert of the University ot Missouri will talk to you' on "Diversified Fruit Growing". • 1 POSSIBILITIES IX FRUIT GROWING I I By T. J. Talbert—University of Missouri .Fruit growing has tremendous possibilities. This is particularly true II we take into account all of the factors that should be consid - ered. Like any other vocation, trade, profession, or calling in which we are engaged, fruit growing must be studied from many points of view. Otherwise, a distorted or erroneous notion may be the outcome. It appears that some of the problems that should be discussed under this] topic are as follows: , 1. Interest and happiness in fruit growing. (2. Diversification in fruit growing; ¦3. Opportunity to serve others..: i 4. Income or living from fruit growing. ) Interest in Fruit Growing ;,The very nature of fruit growing lends Interest, enthusiasm, and '•¦[.-.¦ ¦ ¦¦ ¦ ' • '¦ '."'"'¦¦ ¦ ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p488">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture permanancy to the undertaking. It is interesting because it represents the highest type of agriculture. No other kind of crop production re - quires such exactness in every detail and procedure as successful fruit growing. Good illustrations of this may be called to mind by .mentioning such practices as spraying, pruning, and fertilizing. Furthermore, the technical, painstaking, and thoughtfulness of fruit growing challenges the individual to put forth his greatest ef - forts. In so doing, the very best of which the grower is capable may be brought out and developed. Without question, therefore, good fruit growers should be better general farmers, livestock and grain pro - ducers, because they have learned to do things thoroughly, properly, and on time. An illustration of another type of production compared to fruit growing is of interest. A farmer might without great to the corn crop postpone cultivation for 2 or 3 days. To delay spraying for an equal period early in the spring with apple scab threatening would likely prove disasterous to the forthcoming apple crop. Fruit growers take pride in harvesting, using and selling the produce from gardens, vineyards, and orchards. Pleasures and profits derived from fruit crops have marked the high tide of educational and social development, and antedate recorded history. Fruit growing is closely related to other types of crop production. In fact, the relationships are so close that the fruit farmer can well afford to give livestock, poultry, and grain crop production careful consideration. It is also profitable, where there is a market, for him to take an interest in vegetable gardening and truck crop growing. Some dairy interests may also prove worth while. These other agricultural interests tie in closely with fruit grow - ing. One may actually help the other. This may be particularly true in the matter of keeping labor profitably employed for most of the year. The most important reason, however, is the fact that this inter - relationship of these different farm operations tends to make the business of agriculture not only more successful but more permanent in character. Diversification in Fruit Growing A diversified policy in farm operations makes for success in the production of fruit crops. Such diversification does not imean that the grower shall have a dozen irons in the fire at once and none ot them hot enough to weld. It does mean, however, that he should interest him - self in several side-lines like small fruit and vegetables where a mar - ket is available; and also in some case 3, poultry, dairy, and hog pro - duction may be undertaken on a small scale. In so dping, the grower </seg>
         <seg id="p489">, Nebraska State Horticulture Society must not lose sight of his major project of orcharding, strawberry growing, potato production, or Whatever the major effort may be. j These other interests have many times tided the grower over dur - ing lean fruit crop years. In regions where orchards have been neg - lectedvand abandoned, we generally find that the farmer has not di - versified. It is also true that when the orchard is made a side-line it ]is generally a failure. The grower who depends for his living solely upon his fruit crop may be forced out of the orchard business it the orchards or prices fail for one or two years. Perhaps there is no other factor more important th|an the matter of judicious diversifications if we expect to stabilize, and maintain fruit growing over a period of yeJEirs. The major crop may not pay every year, but over a series of yeai's it should, and if properly caved for it will usually be profitable. ¦;; j V Opportunity to Serve t j No type of agricultural production gives the producer a greater opportunity to serve others than does fruit growing. When the pro - ducer raises fine apples, peaches, strawberries, plums, and other fruit crops, he is being of the greatest service to consumers. He can fur - ther this assistance, however, by striving all the while to grow fruit crops of higher quality, to grade them closer, and pack them in more attractive packages. This same efficient service is also more profitable. Fruit growers generally, it is believed, must learn the lesson of catering more to the consumer than they have in the past. It is not thfe particular strawberry, apple, plum, or peach that the fruit grower likes best, but it is the one that the consumers buy in largest quanti - ties and for which there is the greatest demand on the market, that he should strive to produce in largest quantities. It is also well for the producer to study the types and kinds of packages which seem to have th^ greatest appeal. Moreover, the size of the packages is important, and essential work of value to both the consumer and the producer is i yet to be done regarding packing and packages. A little pioneering, however, by producers as they go along will not only usually pay good returns but help to build a good business and to serve more efficient - *•[¦ — -;;-;;¦ .;0:. ¦-¦I-:,-- \ . ' ¦ : : Income from Fruit Growing • An income or living from fruit growing is, of course, of paramount importance. During the depression days of the past and present, moat of jus have sometimes hesitated to say very much about profits or re - turns from any kind of agricultural production. Of course, no one who is fair-minded expects these conditions to last forever. It is be - lived, therefore, that better times are ahead, and that there will be fair returns for honest, conscientious, and industrious producers of </seg>
         <seg id="p490">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture all agricultural crops, and particularly for fruit crops. We may say, therefore, with as much assurance as can be said for any kind of agri - cultural production, that when wheat crops, livestock, dairy products, poultry products, and others sell at profitable prices, then fruit crops will tiring satisfactory returns. High Acre Yields Pay Careful studies by many agricultural colleges throughout the country have shown that, in general, the farmer who maintains the balance on the right side of the ledger is the one who produces high acre yields. It has been definitely proven that high acre yields are associated with success in fruit growing. This matter may be illustrated by giving a concrete example. We will presume that a fruit grower has a bearing orchard of sixty acres. He makes up his mind at the beginning of the year that he will not have the time, funds, or available labor to care for the whole sixty - acre orchard in a thorough manner. He decides, therefore, to do but little or no pruning, discontinue fertilization and cultivation, and to apply one or two less sprays than are generally required. In deciding to handle his orchard in this manner, it is the belief of the orchavdist that this program will greatly reduce the expense of operation and at the same time produce almost as much fruit and perhaps a salable fruit as could have been produced by more thorough and intensive orchard practices. Many fruit growers have adopted }u3t such a policy with reference to the handling of their orchards as that outlined above, and in every case which has been investigated, the business has been a failure. The best orchard men have found that if it is desirable to reduce produc - tion for any reason, it would be much wiser to eliminate a portion or all of the less profitable acres and devote one's time and energy in the best possible practices on the acres which are to be maintained for production. It is always wisest to reduce the acreage under culti - vation rather than to cut down the acre yield by neglect or by adopting slipshod and haphazard methods of fruit production., Such practices will always mean failure. Helps in Fruit Growins The best teachers of fruit growing are the agricultural experi - ment stations at one end of the problems, and the active, live, -willing, and progressive growers at the other end. Teamwork is required if either is successful. Horses that pull by jerks are an aggravation and may cause those in charge to lose their religion for a time. The horse which will go right along without fretting or getting excited and pull the load is the one desired. </seg>
         <seg id="p491">.-•¦ ! Nebraska State Horticulture Society '¦'.-¦ '''¦¦ ' ¦'. •¦' ¦ '•• ' •'!¦ ¦ . Spasmodic fruit or vegetable growing was never profitable, and ilj never will be. Tie grower with zeal is the one who will win. The word "zeal" is a good one, because it means "to boil". It is a good term, tyhen the kettle boils, something happens. When the fire under the bpiler causes the water to boil, action is started—something is done. If, the horticulturist is full of zeal, he is boiling over tor his task. He likes his job. He preaches it. He is an apostle of fruit and vegetable growing. If we are 1 to work up enthusiasm and interest in the business of fruit growing, we are not expected to do it at home alone. We aije expected to get together and talk matters over, to cooperate. This is the chief reason for meetings such as we have here. j What of the Future for Fruit Growing j The business of apple production, for example, has gradually changed during the past few years. One of the most notable changes isjthat production from home orchards each year has less and less to do with the commercial crop. In some sections already the supply of frui* chines entirely from commercial orchards. The product from the home orchard is fast becoming of minor importance. The fruit grower of to - ddy, and more so of tomorrow, must compete with other commercial fruit growers. t - ¦ - .'•¦¦'. ¦ . ¦ ; • This means that he must place his business upon a firm and well founded financial basis. He must put into practice the most up-to - drite methods known in orcharding and small fruit culture. He must study closely the cost of production of every acre in cultivation. It is also true, if he sells his product in a satisfactory way, he must co - opterate. The fruit growers of western New York and the Shenahdoah- Cumberland region, as well as other producing sections, will certain - ly ¦ perfect and utilize better organization. Whether the Kansas, Ne - braska, lowa and Missouri growers like it or not, they will have to cooperate and employ team work if they expect to market their pro - dujcts successfully. Fruit growers do not undertake worthwile things lik;e cooperative oranizations, advertising, and better packs, unless there is a great necessity for them. They usually do these things be - cause they are forced upon them. . j We must grow our product in a satisfactory way, standardize it, an^i then push it upon the market or advertise. The fact that we be - lieve our apples, peaches, raspberries, pears, strawberries, and grajpes are more beautiful and more highly colored, and better flavor - ed jthan those from other parts of the country will not make the busi - ness of fruit growing profitable. This matter has been summarized in a very effective way by a man down in Virginia, and we quote him as ifollows: "Any superiority we may claim for the flavor of our applies which is wrapped up under a skin disfigured with scab, bitter - ¦(;¦¦¦¦ &#132;•¦. ¦ ": ¦ '. :•¦¦ ',"¦ 'v.¦-. ¦¦ : ¦-.¦¦ ¦ f ¦. •. • ¦¦...' - ¦:¦¦• '•. !••:'¦¦¦ </seg>

God Almighty put the flavor in your baskets of apples, and you have been putting in the scab, bitter-rot, and worm holes." For the fruit grower, therefore, who is willing to give to fruit, vegetable, and flower production the best there is in him, there is an ample reward. No other field can offer at this time greater induce - ments, and there is no location more promising than that of the Cen - tral States area, which of course, includes Nebraska. MR RABEN: This discussion has given us something to think about. The apple growers of Nebraska are beginning to think they need diversification or something. 0. S. Bare, Extension Entomologist, will talk to us now about the peach borer. MR. BARE: A year ago, Mr. Hoppert and I became interested in the control of the peach borer. We prepared a treatment of ethylene dichloride emulsion and made some experiments with it. He sug - gested that I prepare a paper giving a results we obtained from our work along this line. ETHYLEXE DICHLORIDE EMULSION FOB CONTROL OF THE PEACH BORER By O. S. Bare —Extension Entomologist, College of Agriculture, Lincoln The common peach borer is, without question, the most destruc - tive pest of peaches in Nebraska. Those familiar with its work feel certain that the number of peach trees killed by it is much greater than is realized by most growers, while the number weakened by its attacks where prompt and effective control measures are not taken is so great as to render profitable peach production as impossibility. The adult of the peach borer is a day-flying, clear winged moth that may easily be mistaken for a wasp. In color it is bluish with a wide orange or several narrow yellowish bands across the body, depend - ing on sex. It has a wing spread of one to one and a quarter inches. The moth appears during the summer and lays its small reddish - brown eggs on the lower part of the tree trunk or in the soil and trash around the base of the tree. A few may be laid on the limbs or foliage. The eggs hatch in about ten days and the tiny larvae or borers travel to or near the base of the tree and bore into the hark, Some - times entering through a wound or crack. They feed on the soft inner bark, or cambium and, if present in any great numbers, may soon badly weaken or even kill the tree. All damage is done by the borers or </seg>
         <seg id="p493">I Nebraska State Horticulture Society i ¦"¦¦/.¦ - ''.•'¦..'¦ ¦ ¦ -¦ /, ¦¦. ¦ ¦ i ¦ ¦ ~ ¦ ¦ . larvae through destroying the inner bark near the base of the tree or tunnelling along the larger roots. The borers feed until cold weath - er jcomes, and then lie inactive through the winter. Feeding is continu - ed 1 in the spring and lasts until the borer is fully grown. The'full grown borer is about an inch long, yellowish-white in color, and has a dark reddish-brown head. ! When fully grown the borer encloses itself in a tough, brownish, capsule-like, silkj-lined cocoon which may be just inside the mouth of;its burrow or just outside of it. Borers that develop in the roots may make their cocoons at the surface of the soil. When the cocoon is jcompleted, the borer changes to the inactive pupa and remains as'such for three or four weeks. It then transforms to the adult stage and emerges as a moth. i Early growers of peaches were forced to depend on hand-worming of (infested trees as the only effective means of peach borer control. While this, if carefully done, was reasonably effective, it was decidedly laborious, and, if carelessly done, it might damage a. young tree almost a3 badly as the work of the borer. j Then in 1915 the discovery was made that a ring of paradichloro - bertzine crystals, placed around the base of the tree and mounded over with a few inches of earth would, if used at the right time, control the peach borer quite effectively. This material was convenient to use, and was relatively cheap. Consequently it soon came into general use. It had, however, certain weaknesses. It was found that it could not be used safely on trees less than three or four years old, and if used in too large amounts, or without proper care, trees of any size or age might be injured or killed by it It was found also that the time for effective use of this material covered only a limited period during the fall , The weakness in use of paradichlorobenzine crystals led Snapp of tjhe U. S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, and Flint and Chandler of Illinois to try dissolving the crystals in cottonseed oil and applying them in this liquid form. Flint and Chandler also tried dis - solving them in miscible spray oils. These solutions proved to be fully as pffective as the crystals, and much less dangerous to the trees, but they were quite expensive, and were effective only when used during a limited period in the fall: Consequently, Snapp, Flint, and, Chandler continued their experiments, and eventually developed the ethyline dichloride-potash fish oil soap emulsion that is coming into general use very rapidly, and bids fair to replace paradichlorobenzine in peach bor - er control on a large scale. This emulsion seems to be fully as eifectlve as paradichlorobenzine crystals, while its cost and the labor of apply- Ingj.it are no greater. It can be used safely on one and two year old trees, and is effective at much lower temperatures. This greatly lengthens the period for effective fall treatment, and it has been ! ; ¦ ¦' ' '¦ ¦ ;¦' '"¦' :;; ]' ¦¦ ¦•¦ ¦¦•. : .-¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p494">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture found also that it may be used lor spring treatment -with reasonably successful results. Inquiries to entomologists of eight important peach growing states in November, 1939, brought replies from all, stating that the emulsion was being used successfully in all of them, and was being recommended particularly where young trees were to be treat - ed. The emulsion is made by stirring nine parts by volume of ethy - lene dichloride into one part by volume of a good grade of potash fish - oil soap in a container and all slowly at intervals at 9 parts of ethylene dichloride, stirring constantly. When the materials are completely emul - sified, add water slowly, stirring constantly, until the volume of the emulsion is twice as great as the original volume of ethylene dichlor - ide. It then contains 50% of ethylene dichloride. This stock emulsion must be further diluted with water before using; the amount of di - lution being governed by the age and size of the tree and the size of the dose needed. Sometimes the stock emulsion breaks down and glo - bules of ethylene dichloride appear. If this occurs the material should be re-emulsified by pumping it back and forth from one container to another until it is thoroughly emulsified. While the fumes of ethylene dichloride are not considered dan - gerous when inhaled in moderate amounts, they have an anaesthetic effect when inhaled in large quantities. Consequently the emulsion should be prepared out of doors or in a well ventilated room. A tem - perature of 50° F. toBo° F. i 3 preferrable, and the liquid should he kept away from fire and open-flame lights. Since the stock solution contains 50% of ethylene dichloride, and the strength to be used varies with the age or size of the trees, the following table of dilution and dosage will be of aid in preparing and using the diluted emulsion in the correct strengths and dosages: Proportions of water and stock solution to use Age and size Parts stock Strength of Dose for of trees Parts water emulsion diluted emulsion each tree by volume by volume Six years or older, (Average size or larger) 1 1 25% % Pint Four or five years (or small six year) S 4 20% % Pint Three years 7 3 15% % Pint Two years 7 3 15% % Pint One year 8% 1% 7%% %pint </seg>
         <seg id="p495">':.-¦¦ Nebraska State Horticulture Society ¦¦ A halt-pint tin measuring cup, with marks lor one-fourth and one-eighth pint will be found very handy for measuring the emulsion and applying it around the trees. The emulsion may be poured evenly on the soil immediately around the tree base, and the lower part of the trunk also should receive some of the emulsion. It may also be applied with a sprayer. No preparation of the soil is needed if the ground is loose and level. If hard or not level, the soil should be cupped slightly toward the tree to ( avoid run-off, and loosened to permit easy absorption. After the emulsion is applied, several shovelfuls of dirt should be placed against the trunk to prevent surface loss of fumes. No later attention is re - quired, but it is advisable to scrape away, the mounded earth during Jujie so that the next generation of moth eggs will not be laid higher on, the trunk where chemical treatment is impractical. i. . ¦ ' '. .. / .;• ¦¦¦ ¦;•.¦• . .../¦¦ .

If the ground is cracked around the root of the tree, there might be danger or injury to the roots of the tree. That is why It is recommended that the ground be leveled. Q: You are the grasshopper specialist. What is the situation this fall in Otoe county? A: Not so bad. Some ot our southeastern counties are not going to have much trouble next season. Here in Lincoln, we are in very much the same position as a year ago. Western Nebraska is not nearly as threatening as it was. On the whole, there is an improvment. Q: How do you explain this improvement? A: There are diseases of Grasshoppers that kill them by the mil - lions. That is what happened a year ago last August. We had several good soaking rains and warm muggy weather for about ten days af - terward. The number ot grasshoppers decreased fully two-thirds inside of two weeks. We had that same disease appearing down in that territory last spring. MR. RABEN: Thank you Mr. Bare. If there are no further ques - tions, we will hear from Ernie at this time. MR. HOPPBRT: I want to mention that the same arrangement is in force again this year. You can get "The American Fruit Grower" along with your membership in the Society. You are entitled to this publication and I just had a letter from the editor saying the arrange - ment would be continued. We expect to cooperate by sending in news items from time to time. We didn't say much about soil moisture. Perhaps that subject has been overdone. That is a thing we can't do much about. We are all conscious of water conservation in this state. Mr. Raben has a waffle arrangement in his orchard that will save water if any ever falls. At least, it is an indication that he is interested in saving moisture. Basins around trees serve the same purpose. A mulch also helps to conserve moisture. The job of pruning could be discussed. A lot of the fellows feel like the one Mr. Talbert told of, "What's the use?" In this state, our growers are aware of the fact that trees can over-produce and they thin off heavy producing trees, taking off part of the apples. At this time, during these mild days, I think we should be pruning quite heavily on such varieties as winesap. Then, too, I am looking for quite a lot of buds to form on the </seg>

The minutes of the last annual meeting were read and approved. Secretary Derrick read the Treausurer's report and explained in de - tail the expenditures incurred. Mr. Walker asked for criticisms or suggestions on the report. Mr. R. C. Johnson said he thought the money appropriated to the association had been very well spent and that they had done remarkably well to carry on all the various activities with the funds they had. It was moved and seconded that the treasurer's report be approved. The next item of business for consideration was the election of officers for the coming year. Mr." Derrick read the names of the pres - ent officers and directors of the association and President Walker called for nominations. Mr. W. B. Banning stated that he thought the officers had been well selected, that they had done their work well, and made a motion to retain the present officers to carry on for an - other year. The motion was seconded by Herman Hanke and carried. On behalf of the officers of the association President Walker expressed their appreciation for the vote of confidence that was given.

Loeffel, Agricultural College Twenty-five years ago takes us back to the beginning of the World War. I recall at that time most of the hogs were of rather thick con - formation, low set, and had good hams. We heard a little about big types. It is claimed that the term "big type" made its first appearance in hog advertising in the year 1908. Nineteeen eleven was supposed to have been the first big type 3how, which was held incidentally at the Nebraska State Fair, in which the first three aged Poland China boars to be placed weighed in excess of 1000 lbs. each. I well recall my first so-called big type hog. One Sunday I journeyed to the farm of a good friend who was interested in purebred hogs. As a matter of fact this man was a director in a Record Association. I saw there a boar pig which surprised and shocked me. He was upstanding with a high-arched back and in general had everything that the ideal was not supposed to have. Gradually through the persuasion of my ac - quaintances I became reconciled to the big type. The chief argument was that the old medium and small types were not sufficiently prolific </seg>
         <seg id="p503">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association to: be a practical farmer's hog and after all the packer paid for his hogs over the scale so the more size, the better. It seemed that there was no letup in getting hog 3 longer, taller, narrower, and later ma - turing. Now and then one heard some murmurings that bacon type j hogs had been used to accentuate some of these then desirable qualities. Some years ago I was asked by Superintendent W. P. Snyder of th&amp; North Platte Substation to aid them in locating a;herd boar. I told him about a boar that I had heard about and Mr. Snyder visited the owner and observed the hoar. In due course I received a letter from Mr.j Snyder in his characteristic style. He went on to say that if the boar had a little shorter, broader head; a little shorter neck; was a little smoother over the top of the shoulders and better filled behind the, shoulders and showed a little more depth and ; fullness through the; chest;, a little more width throughout; to say nothing of deeper , and fuller hams; he would be quite a boar. i i The reaction set in in some of our breed 3 about 1930, when some of our breeders at least began to realize that they have gone too far a-: field. Since that time more and more attention has been paid to feed- ( ing-quality, depth, thickness of fleshing, plumpness of hams and early ' maturity. This leads me to believe that with hogs as with styles in clothing and furniture that everything comes in style again if you just hold on long enough. As a usual thing the pendulum keeps swing - ingjfrom one extreme to the other and no doubt in our present trend thep is great likelihood that we may go too far Jn selecting our hogs. Wejmay insist upon their being too short, too thick, and prolificacy | may again suffer. t Type, as I see it, is more or les3 of a compromise. By type, of course, we mean an ideal towards which we are striving. The ideal of tjhe consumer, the ideal of the packer, the ideal of the feeder, and the (ideal of the breeder are all different. To illustrate, the housewife does not want any bone in her meat. It Is inedible and therefore waste Thej packer takes more or less the same point of view, although per - hapß not to quite so marked a degree. The feeder and the breeder, on the | other hand, realize that bone is essential in order to have the framework on which to "build" the meat; Therefore, the ideal which we finally decide upon Will probably be more or less intermediate be - tween what the consumer and the packer want on one hand and what the J producer and feeder want on the other. ! f It may be possible to secure a type which meets all requirements from the standpoint of the feeder and perhaps the packer and con - sumer, yet if that type is unprolific and does not produce sizable lit - ter^ it is impractical from the producer's standpoint. i Producers today, I believe, well, appreciate j that quality of pro - duction is important in obtaining the high dollar. The gross proceeds, </seg>
         <seg id="p504">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture however, are determined not only by the quality of the product but equally as important is the amount which we have to sell. WHAT THE MARKET BUYER LOOKS FOR (DEMONSTRATION) W. T. Reneker, Swift &amp; Co., Chicago, Illinois Through the years no meat animal has been able to adapt itself to current emergency needs any better than has the live hog. Years ago when transportation and refrigeration were poor, hogs that would pro - duce heavy cuts that could be tierced and cured or handled as dry salt meat were the desirable kinds. This resulted in the breeding and pro - ducing of very heavy cuts. As time went on and the movement of product did not have to de - pend on river boats and ox carts to move the products, the demand for fresh cuts increased, the producer finding more ready outlet for ligh - ter hogs to furnish this market. The breeders and producers turned from raising the extremely heavy hogs and developed a more quickly maturing type that would finish at lighter weight. With the advent of refrigeration, demands for cuts from different weight and type hogs increased. This difference in demand persists today. The New England States require cuts from mostly 220-280 lb. hogs. New York demands cuts from 180-220 lb. hogs. New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland uses cuts from 120-180 lb. hogs and have a limited outlet for dressed pigs 120 lbs. down. The Central States prefer cuts from 180-250 lb. hogs. The South likes cuts from light hogs for fresh meat and are the largest' users of heavy dry salt bellies for their poorer trade. The West Coast likes cuts from 190-240 lb. hogs. You can readily see that no one standard type or weight fits all demands. The types of hogs that were produced in the U. S. varied in the different locations according to the demand with little or no change from about 1890 until 1914 or 1915. (Some explanation on type of hog produced in Demark, Ireland and Canada for the highly specialized Wiltshire trade will he made.) As the European War continued and increased the demand for cuts that would suit the BrltUh market became heavier. In the U. S. A., a number of firms were making Cumberlands and Wiltshires. (Ex - plain these cuts.) As the demand increased, the producers and breed - ers turned their production to a longer type of hog. This trend in production continued in the one direction for about 15 years. By 1930 a very large percentage of our hogs had become long, rangy, high-standing hogs that in some case 3 looked more like a greyhound dog than swine. </seg>
         <seg id="p505">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association About this time a move was made by all concerned to try to get our jhog types back to something that would best suit our domestic trade. Proposals for grades by joint meetings between producers, pack - ers, and U. S. Dept. of Agriculture men tentatively agreed on certain proppsed standards and divisions of weight for classes. Choice, Good, Medium, and Cull were the principal grades. An effort was made to re - tain a grade that was to be known-as a meat type hog. This was a type that .would carry a higher proportion of lean cuts than a more moder - ate or intermediate type would carry. Time has shown us that the propagating of this type did not carry out so good. During the drought years 1934 and 1936, and with the resulting shortage of feed there were a very large percentage of this type of hog that [was sent to market in a poor, thin, unfinished condition. Account of their low cutout values they; were sharply discounted and proved to be a poor type for the producer to handle. |The producer needs a type with the maximum flexibility in feed - ing operations. They must have a type that will finish fast and become goodto choice at 180 to 220 lbs. when feed is scarce and high. Then when feed is plentiful and cheap he must utilize all he can in the pro - duction of meat. . "."¦;..;. : ¦ ; -;!¦•¦ JThere is a type that seems to best suit the producer, packer, and consumer that has this flexible range. The conformation of such a hog might be described about this way. iThey should have trim jowls, short necks, shoulders no wider thanjthe balance of the side or body; strong, full backs with a good spring to the rib to insure a good full loin; the rump should be carried out full to the tail. The hams should be well rounded and plump over the cushion and carry well down to the nock without any coarseness* or looseness. The sides or bellies should be deep and smooth showing!' no wrinkles and should carry well down in the flank. They should be^ firmly finished to insure good firm cuts. j ' With such a type the producer can have, a wide range of flexibil - ity, marketing at 180, to 220 lbs. when feeds are (high and still being! able [to carry this same hog along to heavier weights when it is to his advantage.

         <seg id="p506">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture talk and I believe we can all go home with a better understanding of the type of hogs the packers can use to the best advantage. It has been some time since I've talked to an audience in this building. About 10 years ago I used to meet a fre3hman class in this particular room and it was my job to entertain them for the hour on the subject of livestock judging. Those boys were rather new at the business and it wasn't a hard job td convince them on any particular point I wanted to drive home. Today I see in my audience men who have long been schooled in the business of swine production. My ideas and youi-3 may differ regarding the type of breeding stock that should be found on our farms today. I was glad that Mr. Derrick mentioned that I was a Hampshire breeder. Now I have the satisfaction of knowing that no one will in - terrupt my talk and ask if I ever raised a hog. I know this type busi - ness is a rather ticklish subject. Professor Loeffel has discussed the trend in type from the cob-roller type to the extreme long-legged kind. Mr. Reneker has shown you the type of barrow the packer can use to best advantage and is willing to pay premium for. Now it would seem that the whole thing is simple enough. All we need to do is to get the kind of breeding stock that will produce that kind of barrow. While it is not impossible at all to produce the kind the packer wants, it may be possible that the type of breeding stock that it takes to produce the present premium barrow is not the most profitable for us to keep. We know that type of barrow is the most profitable for the packer and he can therefore pay us a premium when we take that kind to the market. But what about the cost on the farm? I'm of the opinion that the type of breeding stock required to produce those barrows is not the most profitable for the producei-3. And here is wny _ we must have breeding stock that are reasonably large and rugged. They must have plenty of length of body and be capable of producing large litters, and raise from 8 to 10 pigs. These sows must have six or more well developed udders on either side and be able to produce a large quantity of milk. I know that these reasonably big rugged sows will wean 8 to 10 pigs or even 12 that will reach an aver - age weight of around 40 pounds at weaning time or 56 days. I know also that those shorter-bodied, finer-boned sows won't on the average produce as large litters as our more rugged sowa and their pigs will weigh less pounds at weaning time and again at 6 months. I believe it is up to the producers to decide on the type that is most prof - itable for us to raise. There is no doubt that we can raise the type that exactly fits the packers' needs but does this same type prove to be the best for us. Our aim is to satisfy both ourselves and the packer. In my opinion if we will keep breeding stock of the more rugged, roomier kind we will raise large litters of the faster growing kind that will </seg>
         <seg id="p507">. ¦ !• .' . , ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ -¦¦ ¦¦¦•¦• | Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association I ; ¦ ¦ ..-...'¦ . ¦ . ¦ !¦¦ ¦ " ' ¦¦' ¦ • ' prove more profitable, because fewer sows will be needed to produce the i wanted number of pigs. Again if we don't keep some ruggednes3 and possibly a little up - standingness bred into our breeding stock they will, before we are a - ware, become a smaller type that I believe is of a slower growing kind. It seems they become more or less of a pony type. They lack depth, be - come round-bodied and are less efficient in producing pork. I" . .'¦ ' : ' '.' '¦ ¦' ¦:.¦'¦¦"'...:¦ . ¦ ' . {Another point—we want large, rugged built sows that are cap - able- of going out into the fields and pastures and rustling a good part of their living. It is surprising the amount of roughage, such as alfalfa hay, our brood sows will eat during the winter. And here is something elsei—when we go to this thicker-shorter kind of hog I believe we are getting one that will yield a higher percentage of lard and less lean meat. It seems to me this lean meat business is something we produc - ers phould think about. Professor Loeffel tells me that his customers over at the Sales Room are becoming more and more particular about their cuts having too much fat. Last week I was in Chicago and I spent a couple of hours just sticking around the meat counters in some of the large grocery stores. You can get an education there by just watch - ing the customers choose their meat. I honestly believe that the one thing that would increase the consumption of pork more than any - thing else would be for us to produce a hog that was more inclined to - wards lean rather than fat. I Now I'm going to find just a little fault with the average pork producer over the country. It seems that about every man that has bought a boar in the past two years is out to find the shortest-legged, widejst backed one he can find. I don't think any harm has come from thatjpractice as yet because that kind was needed and too many of the kind that was in demand were not available. However, if the practice continues and it is likely to, we are going to find all our breeds too much on the lard type. "We Hampshire breeders are a little worried about our breed go - ing too much to the lard type. Other breeds should be worried: Last Mayjthe Hampshire Swine Registry held the first type conference ever put an in this country. We invited in the packers—Mr. Keneker was kind enough to spend a couple of days with us, and he did a real job of picking out the ideal type barrows for us just as he has here today. We nvited the College professors and the judges who were slated to judge the state fairs, last fall, also all breeders and commercial men were invited. We held a judging school, we worked on a number of clashes of various ages and everybody had a chance to give his opinion. The Idea, of course, was to choose a type which; we thought most de - sirable for the present day. Now here are the main points which we felt should be emphasized most in our future breeding program: i ¦•¦-,"•¦ ..¦¦¦"• </seg>
         <seg id="p508">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 1. Increase ham development. More depth and more width when out in cross section through the center. 2. Maintain straight deep sides and a lower and fuller flank. 3. Uniformity of medium width of back, assuring a full strong loin and a well sprung rib. 4. Development of feeding quality. In other words breed a type that will finish at accepted mavket weights. 5. Medium length of leg. Avoid either extreme. 6. Superior prolificacy. Sows should show 6 or more well devel - oped udders on either side, and carry body capacity for large litters. 7. Breed an alert hog that is a good forager. S. We want to maintain our firm-fleshed meat type animal by avoiding too much tendency towards lardiness, as well as any flabbiness and coarseness in the jowl and flank. HOG OUTLOOK FOR 1040 Dr. L. F. Garey, Lincoln In considering the hog outlook for 1940 there are at least three important factors that need to be considered. One of these is the de - mand situation both from the standpoint of the domestic and foreign outlook. Another is the possible supply of hogs in 1940, and the third is the feed situation. So far as the demand outlook is concerned the domestic outlook appears better than last year. The improved outlook is a result of in - creased industrial activity in which the employment situation is some - what better than in 1935. Most of the increased employment has occur - ed in the fields of aircraft equipment and other war defense materials, farm machinery, a few minor durable goods, and certain textiles. While the rales of pay in these various manufacturing industries has not increased, more people have been put to work which is an indica - tion of the better domestic outlook for the demand for meat. The foreign demand situation appears better than a year ago for two specific reasons. The war situation has cut off the source of pork supplies to England from European countries which means that she will have to look to other sources to meet her needs. Poland and the other Baltic states which formerly supplied England with a large a - mount of pork are now out of the picture. Last year England imported S9 million pounds of pork, a large part of -which came from these states. Exports from Denmark and the Netherlands in 1940 will be </seg>
         <seg id="p509">1 Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association ¦¦;! ¦ ' ¦¦;¦ " ' -&#132; :: ; :.,.:.." - •¦ &#132; : greatly reduced because of the war effect on feed in those countries. The' second condition which favors the foreign outlook for pork is the fav&amp;rable trade agreement -with England which favors importation of pork from the United States into that country. Ordinarily we have exported about one-third of our lard and about 5 per cent of our pork. Indications are that this year we will export about 19 per cent of our lardj and about 3 per cent of our pork. This is the largest percentage of our lard exported since 1935 and of pork since 1930. "¦¦ !¦. : ; ' ¦¦,¦•¦. '¦¦¦¦/; ¦¦;¦'.. '-.¦ v¦. : : ¦ ' i So far as the supply of hogs in 1940 is concerned, it appears as thoiigh it will be larger than that of this year. The pig crop in 1939 amdunted to S3 million head whiclyis equal to the average of the five - year period ending in 1933 and with the large corn [crop of this year indications point to a larger production in 1940. If the four states of thejcorn belt lying west of the Missouri river should have a good corn crop in 1940 there will be a continued increase in the 1941 pig crop. The states east of the Missouri river this year* have a large pig crop. j The feed situation up. to this time has been favorable for hog pro - duction. There has been a sufficient quantity of grain in both the Unit - ed: States and in Nebraska for producing more hogs than will be put ont&lt;j tie market this year. In both the United States and Nebraska the 'quantity of feed in relation to the livestock is greater than it was previous to the beginning of the drouth period in 1933. The corn-hog ratib has been favorable in Nebraska and in the United States for feed - ing jhogs since 1936. Last year the corn-hog ratio was approximately 16 which is an unusually favorable record for hog production. Until September of this year the ratio was not lower than 12 which is also a favorable ratio. At the present time the ratio has dropped approxi - mately 9.5 which means that farmers will receive approximately mar - ket price for corn by feeding it to hogs as long as the price remains where it is. ... It appears then that so far as the demand situation is concerned that we may expect an improved condition in 1940 over that of this yeari-both at home and abroad. This increased improvement, however, mayi'very likely be offset by an increase in the supply of hogs pro - duced in 1940 because of the large corn crop and other small grain feedjs available for feeding purposes. Under these conditions it would not appear advisable for the producers who are not already in the hog producing business to enter this field of production unless something unfdrseen in the picture develops to increase hog prices beyond that anticipated. For the farmers who are already in the hog producing business and have been established for sometime, it would be reason - able j to continue to the point of feeding a considerable part of the home grown grain. ¦'..'¦- *¦".'¦ , </seg>
         <seg id="p510">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture THE ORIGIN OF THE WESTERN EWE M. A. Alexander, Agricultural College The principal sheep producing areas of the United States rely upon the western ewe for wool and lamb production. She has resulted from crossing long wool types of sheep with fine wool types of sheep. The breeds crossed most often were Lincolns and Merinos, now called the Rambouillet. This cross was made in Australia and New Zealand and is now given the name of Corriedale breed of sheep. Such a ewe produces a good commercial fleece and a very good market lamb when crossed with a rugged mutton ram. In the West the Hampshire and. Suffolk ram are generally used. The western ewe is white-faced and may be put into three grades according to her skin folds or wrinkles. Such grades are referred to as heavy type, medium type, and light type western ewes. The latter with plenty of size is usually preferred. Ewe lamb 3 from mating the western ewe with the mutton rams are never retained in the breeding flock for the western sheep and wool producer. The fleece is not good enough. Such a ewe could be kept in farm flocks where the fat lamb is more important than the wool. For Nebraska farm flocks the western ewe makes a very good foundation ewe. She should be crossed with a good mutton ram. The smooth type ewe is best. The old western ewe is causing too much trouble in the state. The young western ewe has always been an asset to the farm. She will produce four or five crops of lambs and still have a good saleable carcass. The chances of making her pay for herself are much better than when the old western ewe is purchased. SELECTING BREEDING EWES Walter Tolinaii, Lincoln White-faced western ewes when mated to deep-bodied, thick, early-maturing rams, Mr. Janike has described, produce excellent mar - ket lambs. White-faced western ewes are better rustlers and usually milk better than native black-faced ewes. With these attributes as mothers and in addition the fact that they will out-shear black-faced ewes makes them ideally suited as a basis for a farm flock. Growthy, rugged ewes with heavy bone and deep bodies should be selected. Nar - row-backed, angular ewes with extremely wrinkled necks will pro - duce less satisfactory lambs. More attention should be given to selecting ewes for their shear - ing ability than is common. It is not difficult to select ewes which will shear as much as 2 to 3 pounds of wool more per ewe than the average </seg>

Such a ewe would easily bring in $ 2 to $ 3 more return dur - ing j her lifetime than a poorer-fleeced sort of ewe. Sheep witb.com - pant, dense fleeces are the heavy shearing ones. A long-fibered fleece is also desirable. Excessively oily, short wool is discounted in price although fleeces of this type are usually heavy and may bring as much per I head as the longer, looser, more open fleeces. Young active ewes shear heavier than old ewes and produce more lambs. The three-year old ewes I am using in this demonstration are be - ing maintained in excellent condition on sorghum silage, the range of a sorghum field which has been harvested and one-sixth pound of cottjon cake per day. Aged range ewes of the short-toothed or broken - mouthed order would not keep in satisfactory flesh on such a ration. The! addition of ground grain would be necessary. Of course even these young ewes will need some grain for a month or 6 weeks before lamb - ing jand during the time they are suckling their lambs until good pas - ture' is available. '.-'¦ f One of the possibilties in securing young ewes i 3 to select ewe lambs from western feeders. We have here representative ewe lambs which have been selected from the feeder lambs bought for experimen - tal purposes here at the College. The more growthy, rugged lambs with compact fleece and deeper bodies than the average were selected. They are being maintained on a ration of Atla3 silage, all they will eat, 1 pound of bone meal for. every 30 head per day, one-fifth pound cottonseed cake per lamb each day, one-fourth pound of corn per lamb each day. It is expected that the wool clip next spring will pay the win - ter |eed cost. If this proves to be the case we will have available some excellent yearling ewes ready for early breeding which will have a lower net cost than these young ewes can ordinarily be bought. . ' ¦';: SELECTING RAMS TO HEAD 1 THE FLOCK : Ed W. Janike, Lincoln A well selected bunch of ewes for your farm flock is a good start halftone. The other half of the job depends on the sire chosen to head the iflock. An off type ewe or a j poor fleeced'one can't do a great deal of damage to the market flock through the one or two lambs she pro - duces but a poor ram leaves his mark throughout! the entire flock, (When you buy a bunch of western ewe 3 like ithose discussed by Mr. JTolman and Mr. Alexander you are trying to get .something that will j give you the most return for your money. You are interested in producing market lambs that are: I "¦ J ¦¦ .-'"¦•¦ " "•' •'""¦¦ -¦¦ "' '¦-¦¦ •¦' -; :. i' . ¦&gt; - list—A desirable market type—being blocky, thick, compact, well - covered lambs. " ' </seg>
         <seg id="p512">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 2nd You want them uniform because it will help their appear - ance and sale. 3rd You want them to be economical feeders and a type that will gain fast and finish at about 70 lbs. if.they are Easter lambs and 90 lbs. for regular market. It's not ea3y to get a bunch of ewes that will have all these char - acteristics so it's a matter of selecting a ram that will reproduce these characteristics and make up for the weaknesses or faults that the ewes may have. Just like the cattle breeder selects his bull—il his cow herd is upstanding he tries to get a low-set bull or if they're weak in the heart girth he picks an individual especially strong in that point. From a market standpoint you want a ram low set, deep-bodied, thick and compact throughout. He wants to be deep and 'wide through the che3t showing plenty of thrift. For those who are interested in raising their own replacements for the breeding flock, these charac - teristics should be kept in mind and in addition fleece. Then, of course, the purebred breeder is interested in maintaining breed characteristics. Buying a ram is like buying a suit of clothes. You like to get some - thing with quality and a reputation back of it. Generally you get just about what you pay for. Last August, the rams sold at the State Ram Sale averaged ?33 per head. Quite a number of those rams went out to head up small farm flocks for early market lamb production. A good, typy, compact, dense-fleeced ram can easily increase the market value of his lambs by 50c per head and when you consider that he is capable of siring 35 to 40 lambs each year for 3 or 4 years it doesn't take long to see hi 3 investment value. In other words he'll more than pay for himself. A good purebred ram will be more likely to maintain uniformity among the lambs and transmit his characteristics to them. Hampshire, Shropshire and Southdown rams have proved most popular and are more plentiful and readily available to the breeder. For strictly market production they are probably our best bet. If a person is interested in replacement of his breeding flock he should pay more attention to fleece. A Corriedale ram might improve the fleece and if he's a good typed ram he won't hurt the market qualities. If a man were running 100 head of ewes and wanted to replace his breeding stock, 1 heavy-wooled type of ram might be a good invest - ment. The better-typed ewe lambs sired by him could be U3ed for re - placements in the breeding flock where wool goes a long way towards making the difference between profit and loss in a farm flock. I doubt that we're giving enough attention to not only the selec - tion of a good ram but the time we ought to be looking for him. Too </seg>

ABSTRACT OF "SHEEP PESTS AND PARASITES" :. Dr. S. W. Alford, Agricultural College 1 Farmers ol Nebraska who have been engaged more or less intense - ly in the sheep growing or feeding business have by this time be - cpm'e thoroughly familiar with the common parasites that infest sheep and their disastrous effects. Many others who have become interested in owning a small flock and are having their first experience in sheep management must re - allz that good sheep husbandry requires more than just feed and water. It is true that farms not previously having had sheep on them are Relatively free of sheep parasites but in the purchase of the original stock almost invariably some of them are infested with parasites of a nature that supply the eggs for soil contamination which, if not pro - perly managed, permits the contamination to increase so that within a fejw years becomes a real menace to sheep health. Farmers starting into the sheep business in a small way, having a clean farm so far as sheep parasites are concerned, should imme - diately get all the information available on the management of the lots land pastures as means of prevention and endeavor to maintain a parasite-free farm instead of adopting haphazard methods which are sure to lead to either continuous medication or disaster. J Sheep are very liable to attack by parasites and probably suffer more severely from this cause than any other el »ss of livestock. The importance of parasites and parasitic diseases of sheep is the more evi - dent because of the fact that sheep are but little sibject to serious bac - terial plagues or virus diseases. T*r.W. : ..;,;:-.f.:: </seg>
         <seg id="p514">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture j The damage from parasites is greatest as a rule among lambs and young animals. The young tissues seem les3 resistant and more in - tolerant of injury and the more sensitive nervous system breaks down move ciuickly under the influence of parasitic injury and poisoning from the excretions and secretions of the parasites. Special attention should be given to the handling of lambs and yearlings in order to prevent infestation. One of the most important preventive measures in keeping flocks free from parasites is based on the fact that many of the sheep para - sites live in the digestive tract of the sheep or in organs in communi - cation with the digestive tract, so that the eggs or young worms pass out in manure and infect the pastures. This common method of dis - tribution of the infective material is the basis for such preventive measures as pasture rotation, rotation of different kinds of stock on the same pasture, feeding from racks on board floors, and the use of bare lots for nursing lambs. Another important preventive measure is based on the fact that many parasites which do not get back to the sheep from a pasture in - fected with sheep manure are carried back to the sheep by dogs. The fact that the dog which feeds on uncooked sheep meat or viscera may become infested with worms that produce eggs which pass out on to the pastures and may then infect the sheep, is the reason for keeping sheep dogs and other dogs on the farm free from worms and related parasites and for insisting that stray dogs must not wander over pas - tures and fields occupied by sheep. External parasitic diseases such as scab are transmitted by contact with diseased animals jor places therefore clean flocks must be protected from unsafe contacts. i The external parasites more or less common to sheep jare three kinds of lice, three kinds of scab mites, the sheep tick, sci;ew worm fly, and the grub fly. The internal parasites are numerous and infect practically every part of the body. They include the tape worms, flukes and round worms; most of which require a different method of management de - pending upon their life history and their method of attacking the ani - mal body. i Treating sheep for parasitism is a complicated undertaking. The first step is to determine the exact specie of parasite with, which you are dealing. That requires, in most instances, a veterinarian who has had considerable experience with sheep and laboratory procedure. The next step is to select the medicinal agent that has proven most effective against that particular parasite. The last step is Ijhe proper administration of the medicine in the correct dose and the nfter care. Most of the worm medicines are poisonous. Sheep are very sus- </seg>
         <seg id="p515">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association cejtible to such drugs, therefore the dose and directions for their ad - ministration must be followed | closely. There is no known treatment forj some of the internal parasites. That which may work wonders in destroying one parasite might have no effect upon another specie: The haphazard) hit and: miss treatment of sheep for parasites is not only worthless but mayi even prove to he disastrous. The old adage "an 'ounce of prevention is. worth'a pound of cure" certainly is true in the management of a flock of sheep. ..'¦¦- ¦ ' . ¦ - I ¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ . * ¦ ¦ ¦ . i . ¦ . ¦ ... . * ' WORKING WITH 4-H MEMBERS ' ' ¦¦¦¦¦.-..¦ .| -..,¦¦¦ .¦;¦ !• ;, Joe Watson, West Point j Nineteen twenty marked the start in 4-H club work.

From 4-H club training in baby beef club work Nebraska boys ana girls learn to pick feeder types, the right weights to buy, develop ability in selection through livestock judging work, help themselves and their community through demonstration work, learn show ring etiquette and develop an acquaintanceship with the breeders, feeders, shcwmen and producers of feeder cattle.

Moxley, Kansas State College, Manhattan, Kansas The purebred breeder should be a leader in livestock improve - ment^as commercial cattle improve no faster than the pace set by this leader. The breeder of purebred stock himself needs to be a severe cri ie of his own stock if he makes advancement. The historic feeling thst registration insures quality i 3 still a handicap to some breeders. To standardize ideas qt perfection requires a gathering of best minds for consultation and a gathering of the best animals at live - stock shows for a rehearsal of these ideas/Livestock 3hows have come down through the centuries as educational institutions for a comparis - on) of the breeders' product, for a standardization of type, for a con - centration of effort toward ideals and has long served as the spark and inspiration that kept alive the desire for betterment. Take them aw^y—and we would go backward in complacency. </seg>
         <seg id="p516">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The livestock industry of the middlewest is indebted to the pure - bred industry. Unknowingly it may have benefited by the efforts of the breed improvers, sometimes at the expense of the purebred] breed - er who has had to sell at a sacrifice. To maintain the onward progress means that the purebred im - prover of today must be at least as financially successful as other men. The States of Nebraska and of Kansas wants above everything to know that when one million or more cattle cross the river to market that they will not fall short $1.00 cwt. because of their ancestry but will be a quality product and bring the highest dollar. The possibility of a five or seven million dollar loss, or that much gain, just because of the i kinds of bulls that roam Nebraska and Kansas pastures should be of some concern to the state. i We may not be able to do anything about the weather |and its ¦ effect upon the quality of our crops, but we can about the quality of our livestock. In justice to the many purebred breeders, past and pres - ent, we must pay tribute to their fine work. They have lifted the quali - ty from that of the longhorn to that of the choice cattle today—but visit any of our markets and observe the job yet unfinished. &gt; What may we do about it? From our Kansas experience let! me off - er a few suggestions. First, stimulate the purebred breeder to aggress - ive improvement —and to a standardized type. Second, since it is one thing to raise good cattle and another thing to sell them, he must get publicity. The good breeders must get recognition for. producing cattle of merit. Properly handled livestock shows, field days, tours and con - signment sales will do thi3. , For many years our Kansas State Fairs had about twelvj or fif - teen show herds from the country's leading herds, about half of them were from Kansas. Only a few ringside spectators were present. What was the trouble; the greatest cattle in the United States and no one to appreciate them? They did not reach some 1200 purebred beet breeders nor the 32,000 commercial beef producers. They were ap - parently not doing what they should. ! To remedy that we called our purebred breeders of the state to - gether and explained a plan for county show herd work, in order to help not the dozen large breeders (though they are helped indirectly) but to get the other 1200 breeders interested and the commercial pro - ducers interested. After four years of effort we have this year had 120 Kansas breeders exhibiting at the State Fair, more than twice that many at the county and district shows. The ringside at our Kan- State Fair has been crowded and we have had the owners of t^ro-thirds of the commercial cattle in Kansas participate in tours and showß. To - day there is a mild scramble for every good show prospectj and the </seg>

'*¦-. ¦..'.-¦ • . , | The plan for this program is to organize a county Hereford, Slorthorn or Angus breeders group.

Thejfifth bull and female is selected from aiy one of these ages: The group must be composed of animals from at least four herds and no exhibitor can have more than four animals within the group. ; The animals within the group are shown individually under their ovner's name at our state fair and then as a group against other coun - ty groups.

The combined results of the county show herds, tour and field days stimulate the breeder, bring him publicity: and buyers and interest the commercial man in obtaining better cattle. ; • ¦i'l. ''•:"¦ ¦. ¦ :i. ¦ ¦ : : •.- ' PEDIGREE PROBLEMS, FAMILY NAMES AND ABERDEEN-ANGUS j. .T-'., . -¦¦" ¦' ;;' '. ' .¦-¦• .BREEDING j j h Prof. R. R. Thalman, Agricultural College I i It is not uncommon to hear the remark made that good blood tells, that it is in the pedigree, or that ah animal is good because he is bred that way. This leads one to ask, "what is a good pedigree", a question that may be answered in two'ways. (1) Is it good because it traces through long lines of ancestry to a popular and fashionable cow fam - ily; or (2) is it good because it is backed by a long line of ancestors that are individually good animals? In my acquaintance in the cattle breeding business I can name many breeders of Shorthorns, Here - fords, and Angus, especially the latter, who will answer both ways. </seg>
         <seg id="p518">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture j It is this division of opinion that has, I believe, led this group of breeders, principally Angus, to request that the topic of pedigrees and family names be discussed. I admit at the start that my knowledge of the subject is limited, very much so, and after studying all (avail - able writings on the subject there are many phases of this pedigree business that are still a "fog" to me. Should I present material not to your liking or in line with your knowledge of the subject, please bear in mind that the subject is large, very large. Furthermore, the writings of men who are considered authorities on the subject lack considerable of being in agreement. Some are even contradictory in their own writings. In presenting this subject, I have also thrown in opinions of my own regarding significance of pedigree breeding but not upon the origin or history of the various families. In the breeding of Aberdeen Angus cattle, much attention has been given to cow families. One need only visit a purebred sale of An - gus and be will see that the attention to cow families still has consid - erable significance among the rank and file of breeders Why this should be true in the light of our present day stage of development has always been a mystery to me and though I have had it explained by successful and respected breeders, the arguments do not hold water" I have suspected also that some of the greatest exponents of family names among present-day breeders under the surface are not 100 per cent sold themselves. Desirable or not, the fact remains that family names of Angus cattle hold significance in the minds of many buyers. It is that a pedigree not adorned with "so-called" popular and fashionable family names is classed in the plain group and the stamp of approval withheld Most unfortunate, there seems to be little chance for change in the immediate future so the new breeder or the older breeder pur - chasing females should of course give consideration to good cattle of ¦•acceptable families", else he will have to swim upstream. It behooves him therefore, to have a working knowledge of the history of fam - ily names and their acceptability to the Angus breeding public. A family may be defined as a group of animals tracing to one cow. The family name given that group is carried on or P«"P&lt;*U^ only through the female line. In many families there are branches carrying similar or different names from the parent family. _ Occas - ionally they are designated by more than one name, one, o dicates the branch and the other the parent family. These branches are called Tribes. It is also not uncommon for a Tribe to subdivide into other branches and these are called Strains. We there ore have first the parent family, then the trfbe and finally the strain Tribes usually originate from different daughters of one cow and^they_ may or may not be by different bulls. Strains, like tribes, branch ott </seg>
         <seg id="p519">.!.¦¦¦•" . ¦ ¦ ¦' .'¦'¦¦ ¦ j; Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association through different daughters of the tribe cow and may or may not be by| different bulls. I probably no other thing in family idenity is more confusing to the beginner, yes even the older breeder than the various tribes and strains, some of which are popular and others are not. It sometimes seems that the deeper one goes into the business of family nomenclature the move!lnvolved it becomes and the less significance it has. The breed - er of Angus cattle, however, has no one upon whom to place the blame but himself. There is no doubt but that in the early development of th^ breed animals originating from ' known producers of great off - spring were superior breeders themselves. These, however, were but one, two, or at the most three generations removed from that great cow and naturally her 'blood was fairly well represented in the veins of her daughter, granddaughter, or great-granddaughter. Today, how - ever, we are 10, 15, or 20 generations removed from that cow. If it were but 10 generations the calf would carry but 1-312 of that great cojw's blood and if it were 20 generations it would be but 1 part in 38,3,888. The question, why ca-ry it on? Of further significance, some of] the-great foundation cows cf the breed, though great as they were in j their day, would not do so well in the show rings of our time. j To list and discuss even briefly all the families of Angus cattle would be a man-sized job and require a great deal of research. The recognized authority upon Angus pedigrees, Mr. M. A. Judy, of West Lebanon, Indiana! wrote in the 1937 August, September, and October issues of the Angus Journal an excellent article upon popular and fashionable Angus families. He listed a number, not complete, but including I believe most air bit the best families, some of which are by: no means popular, and I shall for convenience list the same group. Discussion, however, will be limited to a few, those most commonly found in this area and upon which many of the others are founded., ERICA FAMILY (All originated at Balltndalloch) Descends from cow j Erica bought in 1861 by Sir George Macpheraon Grant—by Cup - ;•¦-[¦" bearer, a Grandson of old Jock-—dam also by Old Jock.

Black Meg original cow—dropped Queen of Adrovie, she Queen Mother, she Charlotte, she Lola Montes, she Pride of Aberdeen. From Charlotte came the great bull Black Prince of Tillyfour. Angus cattle of today are said to carry more of Black Prince of Tillyfour blood than of any other bull ot the breed. It is estimated that present-day Angus cattle carry 15% of the blood of this bull. From Pride of Aberdeen came the great bull Trojan and the Pride of Aberdeen Family and from the latter came the X Prides, the Mulben Prides and the Kindness of Ballin - dalloch. From the Queen Mother cow comes 9 families or branches but not regarded as any but one family in America. McCombie considered Queen Mothers his greatest faijaily of cattle. He sold many to the Ballindalloch herd, especially bulls. The Queen Mother family is equally famous for both sexes. Judy says, "very salt and pepper of the breed". Onje of good, old standbys. This family is, however, not considered fashionable In America, yet other families, especially the Prides and the Ericas, owe much of their popularity to this family.

The Blackbird family also owes much to the Queen Mother family through the great Queen Mother bulls used in the development of the family. Jilt Family Cow bought from Grant of Ballindalloch.

From the pedigrees of the leading American sires and show animals examined it 1 also appears that family names and preferences do not mean a great deal at this stage of Aberdeen Angus breeding. Some of the greatest 'bulls the breed has known have not been decorated with a popular and fashionable family. Further, some families once popular </seg>
         <seg id="p524">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture are no longer so regarded depending to a large extent upon the ability of the breeder and promoter of that family to select sires and females that would improve the excellence of his cattle. In other cases of great show ring winners and breeding animals graced with a "so - called" good family have been sired by bulls of less popular families, tribes, and strains for several generations back. An arithmetical study of some pedigrees showing an approved family name shows an infinitesimal percentage of the blood of that family. As an example, a young bull now in the University herd carries the family name of Queen Mother. In this calf's pedigree there are Pride of Aberdeens, McHenry Blackcaps, Rosemere Barbaras, Ballin - dalloch Miss Burgess, Esia Trojan Ericas and probably several others, but no Queen Mothers for at least seven generations back. If the sev - enth great granddam of this calf were 100 per cent Queen Mother, which it isn't, then the calf in question would carry but one sixty - fourth the breeding of that family. Surely the 7th great granddam does not have more influence on the calf than the G3 other ancestors in that calf's pedigree. Some Angus breeders who have stock tracing to "short pedigrees" will probably run into Shorthorn blood before they go back that far. It is recognized that some such breed mixing was at one time carried on by the Scotchmen in the early days of American importation to meet the demand. Every breeder knows that each herd has its bulls and females that can be counted upon to produce better offspring than others in the same herd though closely related. Some individuals are great breeders and it often happens that their daughters and granddaughters carry on. While the blood of that great producer is reasonably close up, some influence is exerted on the offspring. However, that blood cannot be diluted too many times or it loses its potency. During the formative stages of the breed animals tracing to one great cow one or two generations removed no doubt was a great factor in the se - lection of seed stock. We are too far removed from those animals now, however, to place much stock in the fact that our cow springs from 3ome great cow 5, 10, or 15 generations back. Rather than helping I have seen many instances when a fancy family name resulted in a hindrance to breed progress by the purchaser buying more pedigree than cow. This is but a personal opinion but I believe that the greatest single thing that could be done toward breed progress is for the An - gus Association to discard completely family names. Breeding cattle would then be selected upon individuality and excellence of the im - mediate ancestors. After all in the business of breeding beef cattle we produce them to convert concentrates and roughages into meat that we might use the produce of the soil to better advantage and reap larger rewards </seg>
         <seg id="p525">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association in the agricultural industry. The man who produces meat is in the last analyais the purchaser of the output of purebred herds. He gives not a damn about the name of the bull or his family tree so long as h^i sires good calves. No name yet invented ever gave a bull the power to improve his offspring. Every family of Angus cattle has had its gifeat bulls and cows and it has also had its "dogs". i | ¦¦¦-. ¦¦ ;¦ -; •¦; v . j :¦;¦•¦-.¦.;.; - Haigler, Nebraska ! .•¦.-.'.¦¦¦•¦",'..¦ December 11, 1939 |Mt.

After a com - paratively short ride we arrived in Chicago Thursday morning. j ; I was greatly impressed during the short ride to the hotel. Every - body seemed to be in a hurry. The streets were full of motor cars, buses, and street cars. They would rush ahead when given the signal to! go. The sidewalk was filled with a surging mass of people. The ele - vated trains rushing around overhead also added much to the din of the city. We walked around the rest of the day looking at the Lake and marveling at the tall buildings. I </seg>
         <seg id="p526">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Friday was the judging contest. It was the smoothest conducted contest I was ever in. However, we were disappointed at the banquet that night when we learned our placement. We spent Saturday at the Livestock Show. The display of live - stock was wonderful and the judging of 4-H calves very interesting. Early Sunday morning we went to meet the Nebraska delegation. We attended church in the forenoon and went on a forty-five mile tour of the city in the afternoon. At night we were entertained by the Sunday evening Club. On Monday morning we took an elevated train for the Show. We spent part of the day watching the judging of livestock and get - ting autographs. Forty-six states were represented by '4-H boys and girls. It was very interesting to talk to them. In the afternoon -we were entertained by Wilson and Company I can truthfully say that it was the best show I ever attended. After the show we were given a dinner. That night we were in the parade of the entire delegation in the arena of the International Livestock Exposition. Tuesday morning we left on a special train to the Swift and Company plants. We were given a fine breakfast and then taken on a tour of the plant. We were gue3ts of the National Livestock Market - ing Association at the Morrison Hotel for dinner. A tour was made through the Art Institute in the afternoon. It was very interesting. The Palace Theatre was the source of entertainment for the evening. Wednesday was the outstanding day. We went through the In - ternational Harvester Company and the McCormick Twine Mill dur - ing the morning. We were given a very good lunch. The Matinee Horse Show was very spectacular. However, we had to leave early and get ready for the annual banquet. To me this was the outstanding event. We made a tour to the Museum of Science and Industry Thursday morning. Some wonderful things were demon - strated to us. We also visited the Adler Planetarium before noon. We were luncheon guests of Seara Roebuck and Company. In the after - noon we went to the Field Museum of Natural History. We were sorry that we could not stay for the farewell party. "We had to catch a train for home at 6:30 P. M. I was very glad to get home where life goes on at a slower pace. However, I will always look on thi3 trip as one of the high, lights in my life. /s/ Richard Wall </seg>

HELD IN CHICAGO ! This trip was awarded to me by the Nebraska Livestock Breeders and Feeders Association .upon having won the state livestock judging contest held at the State \ Fair in September. f We, the judging, team, along with our sponsor, Mr. J. R. Batie, whjo helped us.get around the city a lot easier we would have by oufselves, took the Zepher from Lincoln Wednesday night and arrived in (the "Windy City" of j Chicago at 8:35 o'clock Thursday morning. Since we were the only group there from Nebraska until Sunday, we did not do anything that: day but sort of get a view of some parts of Chicago and get ouv room at the Hotel Harrison. The next morning being Friday and our part of the program, we went out to the International Exposition where the classes of livestock were placed before us and it was then! that we tried to place them coijrectly.; When it was all over that day our team was ranked as the 14th best team out of the twenty-three teams there representing twenty-three states of the United States. Even though we didn't place ve«y high, I'm sure that ail of us boys gained lots of experience from the contest as it showed the types of livestock that should be picked for making the beat profits, j </seg>
         <seg id="p528">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Saturday was a day to ourselves so we went out to the Livestock Exposition where the Junior Feeding Baby Beeves were being judged and I am sure the boys who hadn't seen many calves fitted and showed learned a lot in that part of a livestock show. That evening I went out to my cousin's for dinner, who took me to the 124 th Field Armory building where there is much entertain - ment for the people of Chicago to go to, such as basketball, polo, and midget auto racing. The rest of the Nebraska delegation consisting of 52 members ar - rived Sunday morning at 7:45, when we went down to meet them at the Union Station. The whole delegation had their picture taken. The rest of the morning was spent registering at the hotel and attending special churches for morning worship. In the afternoon all delegates assembled at the Auditorium Ho - tel to take part in the 45-mile tour over town. On the tour we saw : many parks which were built in order to give the grownups and small - er children a place to spend their leisure time. This city has more small parks and playgrounds than any other city in the world. We also visited the University of Chicago chapel which is for the students of the university and other people to go to Sunday services. We were driven through the negro district, which is second in- size, next to Harlem in New York City. This part of the city was at one' time one of the best parts of the city of Chicago. We were also taken through Chinatown, where it was very queer to note that nearly all of their busi - ness is done in the basement part of the buildings. The next most interesting point to me was on Maxwell Street where the open air markets are. It was there that we found all the stores open and doing business—they close on Saturday instead of Sunday. That night all 4-H Club members were guests of the Sunday Evening Club for Sunday evening services. Monday was International Live Stock Show Day tor all those except those members in clothing, canning, and poultry judging con - test. This was also the demonstration teams' day at the program. At 1:45 we were taken to the Medinah Temple building where we were royally entertained with a three-hour stage program. This program was put on by Thomas E. Wilson. Mr. Wilson also gave us a dinner that evening. All delegates paraded in the arena at the the Interna - tional Live Stock Exposition Monday night before the main show. Tuesday was divided into a boys' program and a girls' program, the boys in my group were breakfast guests of Swift and Company. From there we went on an educational tour through the Swift pack - ing plant, seeing how the livestock is killed and prepared lor shipping </seg>
         <seg id="p529">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association to distant points where it is used for food. Also we saw some of the by-products made from the bones and'hides of animals which showß th&amp;t there is very little wasted in disposing of livestock. It was there that I learned that the average distance that the meat travels before it is used Is a little over a thousand miles. &gt; ; That noon we had a luncheon and some fine entertainment given us-toy the National Livestock Marketing Association, which shows that the people are all ready: to show the 4-H members a good time whi}e in the city of Chicago during the Stock Show and Club Congress. I In the afternoon we visited the Art Institute where we saw many statues and paintings, many of .which were the original paintings, and made a person appreciate the real art of the paintings. Having a little extra time, our sponsor, Mr. Davis, took us through Marshall Field's store and also Woolworth's Variety Store. We were guests of the International Harvester Company on Wed - nesday where we went through the tractor works where we saw how different parts are made; and finished so that it would be of the exact size to fit a certain part of a motor or other parts of'a tractor. .

The boys then went through the twine mill where we saw it start from the sisal fiber until it came out in balls of twine in 50-pound sacks. It starts in large bales of sisal fiber and is run through many machines until it is brought down to a string which is spun into balls of twine. -'• . ' .-.¦ :" -•¦¦¦ .' ¦'. : . ¦ ' ¦ ¦ j The company being interested in 4-H club work gave a luncheon anil a souvenir to all the delegates. That evening was the annual ban - quet at the Grand Ballroom of the Stevens Hotel where the champions were presented. | Thursday, our last day, was spent at the Museum, of Science and Industry where'a demonstration was given on the use of electricity, showing that in the future most of the heating, lighting of homes, etc., will be mostly done with electricity. From there we went to the Adler Plantetarium where a demonstration was given on the planets, sun, stars, and the moon. I i: I Our last luncheon and entertainment was given us by Sears, Roe - buck and Company. From there the boys were taken to the Field.Mu - seum of Natural History where* they Baw the Stone Age men and from this we could realize how. much more we the people of today are civil - ized than they were then.

         <seg id="p536">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture THE POTATO AND TOMATO PSYLLID R. L. Wallis, Assistant Entomologist, V. S. D. A. I am glad to have this opportunity to tell you something of the work of the United States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine on the potato psyllid situation. Psyllid yellows, a disease of potatoes, tomatoes and related crops, caused by the feeding of the potato psyllid is considered one of the most serious problems affecting these crops in the Western States. Heavy losses have been occasioned over a period of 30 or more years, and, while it is difficult to put a monetary value on this loss, It is defi - nitely known that it runs into several million dollars in years of the most severe damage. Total crop failures in badly infested fields are not uncommon. The psyllid is not a new pest. It is undoubtedly a native of the Rocky Mountain Area, and began feeding on cultivated crops soon af - ter these crops were introduced. It has been recorded as early as 1898 as a pest of tomatoes and more recently as a serious pest on potatoes. The symptons of the disease had been recognized for several years previous to 1927, but were then being referred to as "blight" or "pur - ple top". In 1927, B. L. Richards, of the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, announced that the potato psyllid was the cause of the condi - tion, now known as psyllid yellows. It is not unlikely that the losses to potatoes in Colorado as early as 1911 and 1912 were due to this di - sease. More recently, the years of 1931, 1935, and 1936 Btand out as years of severe psyllid damage. Certain mountainous sections of the West suffer annually from serious outbreaks of psyllid yellows. In April, 1939, the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, cooperating with the Bureau of Plant Industry, and the State Experi - ment stations of Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, and New Mexico took up the task of working out certain ecological phases of the psyllid problem with a view to correlating these with, and im - proving control measures. In this connection, we are attempting to de - termine the cause of the variations in abundance of psyllids from year to year. The abundance of psyllids and behavior of the insect are ap - parently affected by temperature, and possibly winter hibernating con - ditions. By studying these factors, we hope to arrive at some conclu - sions as to the cause of psyllid outbreaks, and, if possible, to determine in what years these outbreaks will occur, the time of the year that the insects appear in the field, and the proper time to make applications of Insecticides to control these pests. The psyllid has a wide distribution. It has been reported in North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, and it un - doubtedly occurs in all the states west of these where its host plants </seg>

It may; also, by this time, have spread to some of the states east, and it is not definitely known how far ft may eventually spread, and the limiting factors of its spread. i... j The size and habits ol the insects make it difficult for the layman to observe them in the field.

Their -flat, scale-like bodies are held close to the jleat surface. Throughout this stage of the insect's life they are sticking juices and introducing into the plant a.secretion which is ap - parently toxic. The fact] that plants"show a definite recovery after the insects are removed, shows that the condition is not caused by a virus. Their mouthparts are about 2-3 the length of the body, and consist of four needle-like stylets (which have three main functions: puncturing the leaf, forming one tube through which the sap is withdrawn, and a second through which the secretion is injected during feeding. The in - troduction of this secretion has a more serious effect on the plant than* the iloss of the plant juices. i j I • " '¦¦:¦¦ --¦¦'¦ -I"' ¦ ¦''') .-¦ ' ¦"¦' - ¦ ¦¦'¦¦ ¦.-., '". ¦- j I The psyllld has been found feeding on a wide variety of plants be - longing to the nightshade family. Among: the more important native host plants are the prairie, longleaf, and purple ground cherries, and the'spiny buffalo bur. In the southern states, certain species of the Ly - cium are important as breeding Jplants. These native host plants may be important as breeding grounds for psyllld infestation which later intelst our cultivated fields. The principal cultivated plants attacked are potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, Jerusalem cherries, culti - vated ground cherries, and matrimony vines. The greatest losses are caused to potatoes and tomatoes due to the importance of these crops.

The nature of this secretion is not definitely known, but the physiological balance of the plant is upset.

There is also a decided slowing up of the plant growth. In the advanc- </seg>

A high infestation of psyllids may develop within two or three weeks after they first appear. Plants may be in a serious! con - dition in two weeks after the psyllid yellows symptoms first appear, if measures for its control have not been applied. . , !

As maximum daily temperatures reach 95°F and abojve the first part of July, populations begin to drop and as maxi - mum daily temperatures reach above 100°F the population is reduced to dbout one per 25 square-foot {samples.

Further, if a heavier initial infestation of; psyllids should be received In'-title fields in the spring, the build-up in population may be suffici - ently rapid as to permit some damage in June and such a large popula - tion may have its subsequent effect throughout the season. .

There are two theor - ies as to where the psyllid overwinters. The first, and the one gener - ally accepted by everyone, is that they hibernate on red cedar and oth - or evergreen trees. However, in a large series of experiments we have met with complete failure to hibernate the psyllid in these materials. Further, we have been unable to collect the potato psyllid on these ma - terials under natural conditions. The second thnory Is that they mi - grate to native host plants in southern Texas, New Mexico, and Art - zona, and return again in the spring to reinfest the northern fields. PLANS FOR POTATO INSECT EVVESTIGATIOffAL WORK IN WESTERN NEBRASKA H. Douglas Tate, Department of Entomology, Uni. of Nebr. As a result of requests from potato growers and growers' organi - zations, the Department of Entomology of the University of Nebraska has made plans for conducting potato insect control investigations in western Nebraska. The object of this project is to develop more satis - factory control measures for the potato flea beetle, the potato psyllid, blister beetles, grasshoppers, and certain other insect pests of this crop. This work is being coordinated with that of Mr. R. L. Wallis of the U. S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, who is making a study of the biology and habits of the potato psyllid, in such a manner that there will be no conflict or duplication of effort. The work of one agen - cy will serve as a supplement to that of the other. Although such general crop pests as grasshoppers and blister beetles frequently are of great importance on potatoes in Nebraska, the potato flea beetle and the potato psyllid are the two major typical potato pests, particularly in the commercial potato growing section of the western part of the state. Because of the desirability of producing high quality standardized grades of potatoes, the need of thorough and efficient insect control is becoming increasingly important. A liquid lime-sulphur spray, applied at a strength of one gallon of the concentrate to 40 gallons of water, is giving fairly satisfactory control of the potato psyllid at the present time, provided it is correctly timed and properly applied. A more complete knowledge of the biology and habits of this Insect, however, is essential for the development of the most effective control program. Evidence shows that the present flea beetle control recommenda - tion, viz., a zinc arsenite spray, applied at the rate of two pounds of zinc arsenite to 40 gallons of water, is not proving to be satisfactory </seg>
         <seg id="p541">Nebraska Potato Improvement Assocation uncier Nebraska conditions. In view of this fact, our major efforts dur - ing the coming year will be concerned with the flea beetle problem. At the same time advantage will be taken of any opportunity to obtain information on other potato pests, and it is anticipated that experi - ments on the control of psyllids, grasshoppers and blister beetles will be conducted. | y " ¦.!¦¦--.: -^. ,•:. I ¦¦¦ •¦¦¦¦¦ ¦ : :- - i The potato flea beetle is widely distributed in the 1 United States. In i iome sections of the country, particularly the eastern states, where injury to the foliage by the adult is of primary consideration, fairly satisfactory control measures have been developed. The same proced - ure: however, has proven ineffective in Nebraska as well as some of the • ¦ surrounding states. Here foliage injury does not seem to be an impor - tant factor. The principal damage is caused by the larvae which feed : on the tubers, producing injuries known as "worm track" and "pim - ¦l plea" or "slivers".

         <seg id="p542">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture seed for the Alabama grower. This is accomplished by testing v repre - sentative sample of at least 300 tubers taken from the Northern seed producer and is conducted in cooperation with the certification, agen - cies of the states where the seed is produced. The samples are usually collected under the supervision of the agency concerned iv the fall of the year and sent to Alabama during the month of January. Plantings are made in early February, and three disease readings are usually made during the growing season. Yield records are then taken at har - vest in May. Inasmuch as the Alabama disease requirements in no case exceed the tolerances of any seed producing state, a grower's seed within the tolerances of his state will meet the Alabama requirements. Therefore, if a grower's seed is within the tolerances, he knows quite accurately before he plants what the disease content of his potatoes is. If the disease is too high and he wants to certify, he is advised by his certification agency before he plants that he should obtain seed with less diseases. However, many factors are involved between the time the seed is grown in the North and the time it reaches the South as seed. A study of the data obtained during the four years the trials have been in progress illustrates this point. In 1936 and 1937 two samples yielded as low as 75 bushels per acre, while two yielded as high as 325 bushels. In 1938 one sample yielded 30 bushels per acre while one yielded 230 bushels. Of the 457 samples tested in 1939, 152 were re - jected because of disease beyond the tolerance limits, 22 because of low yield, and 78 for both disease and low yield. This amounts to over 50% of the samples tested being rejected. Variation in disease is as great between one year and another as it is in any one year—the variation being from a trace to as high as 80%. It is also clear that many of the samples with high disease con - tent are responsible for many of the low yields. While the variation in disease and in yield is great, it is significant that the high yielding strains remain as such from season to season provided they have been properly cared for. For example, four strains of foundation seed stock that were planted by the tuber unit method in the North and that were rogued several times during the season have had practically no disease plants and have always been uniform and vigorous. They have also outyielded samples of the same strain that have been submitted by growers whether one, two, three, or even four years removed from this identical source. There have been no exceptions to the above statement during the four years this data has been collected. One particular strain was represented by 36 samples in 1939. It is also significant that wherever high yields are obtained, the seed has originated direct - ly or even up to two years removed from similarly well handled seed plots. These seed plots are usually isolated as to location and variety. They are planted on a tuber unit basis and are rogued for off type plants and disease several times during the growing season.

POTATO STORAGE IN HIGH PLAINS AREA ¦':¦ (Nebraska, Wyoming &amp; Colorado) Alfred D. Edgar, Agricultural Engineer, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture INTRODUCTION During the pasu few years, the United States Department of Agri - cul ure, with the cjoperation of State Agricultural Experiment Sta - tions, has been doing experimental work to determine the best way to build storages for late-crop Irish potatoes. The plan of the storage investigation is to study storages and methods in use in each area growing late-crop potatoes, and from this stuly to develop improved storages and practices. Each area has unique problems and has often' developed unusual storage features. Bui good features are frequently found with poor ones so the merit of the good is lost. In the study, various storages are tested under corn - par ible conditions, and the better ideas are built into new storage ¦ '•¦¦ :¦ ,::: ".¦ ' - -¦' I': '- ¦ /.' ¦'. ¦¦'..'.' ¦ NEW STORAGES MEET REQUIREMENTS ¦ Handling: Any grower, who has seen his Blue Tag or No. 1 pota - toes made into the Red Tag or! Unclassified potatoes, because of me - chanical injury, is anxious to do what he can to reduce such injuries. A common method of reducing mechanical injury is to fire a careless crew and hire a new crew, but more certain results are likely through the] development of improved handling methods. For example, 'sack picking', developed in this area, | makes it easy for a crew to do a good job! In a similar waly the new storage was developed to improve potato handling methods. With the two work-alley levels for one storage </seg>
         <seg id="p544">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture floor, shown in the model, the lower half or third of the bin may be filled from trucks driven into the lower alley, and the upper half or two-thirds may be filled from the upper level. From the upper-level alley sacks of potatoes may be slid down a slide to workmen who are on movable planks just above the potatoes. These men take the sacked potatoes from the lower end of the slide and distribute them uniformly over the entire width and length of the bin, the top of the pile being kept level as the bin is filled. Curing or Healing: With disease-free potatoes and a sterile stor - age there would be no rot losses, and with potatoes having an unbrok - en skin there would be little spread of disease from infected to sound potatoes. But in practice there are both diseased and injured potatoes, and infection will spread unless the injured potatoes are healed or cur - ed by the protective action of the potato itself forming layers of corky cells over the cuts and bruises. Best conditions for healing injured po - tatoes are provided by keeping the storage at a temperature of about SO 0 F. and at a relative humidity of about 90% for the first 10 days of storage. This condition is easily obtained by restricting the ventila - tion just enough to maintain the required temperature. Wound healing will take place at lower temperatures and humidities, but the curing action is slower, making the spread of infection more probable. Temperature: The regulation of storage temperature is the chief consideration of most storage men, because they know that potatoes freeze at 28° F. and that they sprout in a few months If kept above 40° F. But fewer growers know the effect of storage temperatures upon table quality and germination rate ol seed potatoes. Results from storage temperatures commonly used are as follows: (1) Storage-tem - peratures of 30-34° F. result in low shrinkage rate, poorest cooking quality, and slowest germination rate, and in storages kept at such low temperatures there is little reserve heat in the potatoes to prevent freezing during cold spells. (2) Storage at 36-40° F. results in aver - age shrinkage rate, good cooking quality, low sprout loss for long per - iod storage, but excellent germination rate following storage. (3) Temperatures around 50" F. result in high shrinkage rate, best cook - ing quality, high sprouting los 3 after 3 months' storage, and good ger - mination rate when planted. Many ot the potatoes stored In the High Plains area may be kept at temperatures of 40-50° F. with good results, as shipping is practi - cally completed by the middle of February. These temperatures result in less injury at sorting time and better table quality, which many growers think over-balance the disadvantage of .earlier sprouting. Other growers think it more desirable to carry the storage temperature below 40° F., even for the potatoes sold early, for many storages have from 5-25% of their bins filled with local seed stock, and at the low </seg>

These two temperature ranges point to the need for a storage in which two lots of potatoes may be kept at different tempera - tures. Although work is being done on the problem, a satisfactory stor - age .j of this type haß not been developed. New storages are designed with provision for adequate ventila - tion, to permit lowering the storage temperature to 40° P. by Decem - ber jlst. In these storages little winter ventilation is required 83 the storage has been so designed and insulated that under average winter conditions the total heat available from the ground and from 'the-pota - toes, will be balanced by the heat losses from the storage through upper waifs and ceiling. . !

The new storage by being partly above and partly below ground level, utilizes the heat from the earth for regulating temperature upward, and uses the exposed concrete wall for regulating the temperature downward. The exposed concrete wall would not be adequate insulation if potatoes were stored against the bare concrete; but in the new storage there is an air circulation space, 2 or 4 inches wide, between the con - crete wall and the stored potatoes. This air circulation space is open at the top to the air in the storage house above the level of the potatoes.'

Air circula - tion spaces assist in carrying heat from the storage in the fall, and in winter the air currents in these spaces carry heat between the -walls and potatoes and equalize potato temperatures. ! Humidity: Sprinkling of the storage floor before the potatoes are storjed in the fall is good practice in the High Plains area, as the added moisture raises the storage humidity and decreases potato shrinkage; butlthe sprinkling should be continued or some other method of adding moisture to the storage air should be used if the storage is to be kept at a high humidity. Cooling by ventilation reduces the storage humid - ity.) A successful method of maintaining storage humidity, which was tried in two deep dirt covered storages near Scottsbluff this year, is to ventilate by introducing the cold air through a wet curtain stretched acros3 one driveway door, the warm air being exhausted through ceil - ing ventilators. As previously mentioned in this paper, less ventilation is i ceded in the new storages ior temperature control in the winter, and'with less ventilation less attention need be given to the regulation of f torage humidity. ¦!, Old storage practice hat jeen to use insulation as a moisture ab - sor ling medium; this practice is quite effective in preventing ceiling drip, but the insulation becomes ineffective when wet and it quickly decays, often requiring the replacement of storage roofs. In the new storage the insulation is separated from the storage air by a vapor - probf lining.l This results in long life and continuous high efficiency of .{he insulation and the ceiling 1.

         <seg id="p548">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ers must be prefixed with a dollar mark. Until it is possible to show them the practical application from a dollars and cents standpoint they will never become seriously concerned as a group. Washing of potatoes in Nebraska this year has conclusively dem - onstrated the practicability of such operations and has shown the en - tire industry the possibilities for a standardized potato deal in Western Nebraska. Not only has it increased the price paid for potatoes but has given a much wider distribution to Nebraska potatoes than they have ever before enjoyed. Nebraska potatoes have sold this year in such markets as Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Cleveland and New York City. It is questionable if buyers in these markets knew Nebraska grew pota - toes prior to this season. We might ask why did these markets buy Nebraska potatoes this year for the first time? Surely It was not for the simple reason they were washed. It is true some other sections had a crop of inferior po - tatoes this year but the consumers were not paying premium prices for a common run of Nebraska potatoes with the dirt washed off. Alter starting washing operations it soon became evident that all potatoes were not suitable to wash, or acceptable to the consumer even though washed. The next observation was that the buyers were becoming more discriminating and competition for better grades of higher class pota - toes had pushed the price differential, from the 5 or 10 cents we have always known here, to 25 cents and then even as much as 50 cents per hundred for potatoes out of which a fancy pack of No. l's could be made. Some growers feel that washing has been a detriment to the po - tato industry and is making them sell their low grade potatoes at a discount. This is not the case. Low grade potatoes have been selling on their merits for a long time and if they are number two grade the prac - tice of quoting them as an 85% U. S. one has not changed the quality of the potatoes. It has, however, lowered the buyer's estimation of a Nebraska eighty-five percent grade, and he has bought them all accord - ing to what he expected to get. We had no standardization or means of preventing shipment of uninspected potatoes on orders sold to be 85%. For years we have sold our entire crop on a Number 2 grade market with a range ot 5 to 10 cents between good and poor potatoes. The premium was inadequate to cause the growers to show much in - terest or concern about improving handling and production methods so as to produce better potatoes. For example, Nebraska Triumphs as compared to Idaho No. 2's for the following years during second week In January which Is usually about our best market, shows the price bracket in which we were sell - ing our crop. </seg>

We cannot give washing all the credit for this unprecedented premium for Nebraska Potatoes.' We must also take into consideration the standardization that accompanied the washing. And by standardi - zation I mean that the shippers have almost entirely gone to a U. S.. No.jl grade, because anything else is discounted so heavily it is more profitable to ship on that grade, and ship the sort outs on the No. 2 market. " . "•¦¦¦."-¦ ¦ . .¦; ¦ '¦ &#132;!.-¦ [It now becomes apparent why buyers have concentrated on the better lots of potatoes and paid substantial premiums for better grades and quality.

Mechanical, injury can be materially reduced by improved and more careful handling methods. Some growers hare 5 to 10% or less mechanical injury, year after year, and what some can do others should be able to follow. Two other very important factors tha£ have not been given much consideration in our past potato produc - tion have been color and size.

Contrary to common opinion the big potatoes do not com - mand the premium in the markets where we are selling our washed potatoes. They want a medium, uniform sized potato and are willing to pay for it. It is evident to both the growers and the dealers who are washing potatoes that quality is essential In making a No. 1 pack and the better grade of potatoes a grower is able to put into storage the more money he will realize from his potato crop. The practice of paying for ones and twos at the end of the grader will undoubtedly increase, and with it will Increase the premium paid for good potatoes. This should and will increase the interest of growers in improved harvesting and handling methods from the field and into storage. After potatoes are in storage we have not finished the chapter on production of quality. More satisfactory storage methods are being devised, more Intelligent recommendations are being worked out for handling and ventilating of storage houses so as to reduce rotting, shrivelling, sweat - ing, and particularly sprouting. When the time to do so comes, we can harvest and store a high grade potato until the middle of May, take it from storage to the wash - er and make a No. 1 without undue sorting. We will then have increas - ed our marketing period by approximately 2 months, and should there - by provide orderly marketing for an additional increase of 30% more potatoes. We will have converted the portion of our crop from a No. 2 to a No. 1 grade that has made potato production marginal jfor a good many growers and we can then look forward to Nebraska becoming one of the leading states in production of as well as supplying of a po - tato of quality second to none. This can be done and washing has pro - vided the financial stimulus necessary to put it across. SIGNIFICANCE OF PRESENT MARKET TRENDS WITH NEBRASKA TABLE POTATOES TO THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY H. O. Werner, Nebraska College of Agriculture. Nebraska certified seed potatoes have brought top prices and have been in an advantageous position economically for a number of years. This position has been attained by constant vigilant attention to the maintenance of high quality and by intelligent marketing. This winter, for the first time in the history of the Nebraska potato industry, Ne - braska Triumph table stock potatoes commanded the top prices on a number of the large markets and they were constantly In demand. In his speech Mr. McLean has given us some information about the mar - ket situation. In that connection the figures concerning car lots of po- </seg>

At the same time it does appear that jwhen'Nebraska put up a good; quality pack of potatoes, the potatoes were in demand without any advertising having been done. ...'.'..¦ ¦.¦! j The main factors that contributed to this favorable situation of Nebraska potatoes were the following: I¦¦ " ¦ ¦'¦' "' '¦ -; ¦¦¦ "i' ¦'•'¦¦ • ¦ ! First. There appeared to be a scarcity of really good potatoes in the states supplying the central and southern markets. i j Second.

The freezing weather in Florida cut off much of the mar - ket supply of early Triumph potatoes in January and February. | This situation presents a unique opportunity to the potato grow - ers and dealers of western Nebraska. With the present friendly attitude oft the buyers to Nebraska Triumph potatoes we have a distinct ad - vantage. However, keen competition will result.' Undoubtedly growers and dealers of Triumph potatoes and of McClure potatoes will be stimu- </seg>
         <seg id="p552">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture lated to greater efforts. They will make a great effort to produce bet - ter potatoes that will also be washed and graded. Consequently Nebras - ka growers and dealers will need to exert thei^ efforts to continue to supply the market with an even larger quantity of high quality table potatoes. Both Nebraska growers and dealers have a very important part in this program. In order to maintain an advantageous market position continuously, a sufficiently large supply of good potatoes must be on hand to supply customers throughout the entire season with potatoes of high grade. High priced table stock potatoes cannot be marketed advantag - eously out of stock requiring a large amount of sorting. If the dealer is to receive pay for his service or a slight profit for his initiative, he cannot offer the grower very high prices for such potatoes. He must also consider the labor costs in sorting and also the low price that he will inevitably receive for the large quantity of potatoes that he must sort out. He must also consider the effect that the large quantity of these cheap potatoes will have on the market price of his best potatoes. Consequently if growers hope to realize greater returns from his grad - ing and washing program, their obligation will be to produce potatoes that require the minimum amount of sorting. In other word 3, produce more and more good potatoes and less and less of the inferior grades. For years very many western Nebraska potato growers have had crops of beautiful Triumph potatoes that contained a high percen - tage of U. S. #1 grade potatoes before they were harvested. Unfortunat - ly however, by the time their crops got into the bin, the percentage of U. S. #1 potatoes was very greatly reduced because of cuts, cracks and bruises. Most of the mechanical injury that has been done to potatoes at harvest time could have been avoided. For a number of seasons a number of growers of certified seed potatoes have been getting po - tatoes into the cellar with less than 15% damage and quite a few con - sistently do less than 5 % damage. Some of the most extensive operators have established the best records in handling potatoes. The accomplish - ments of the "Nebraska 400 Bushel Potato Club Members" along this line are very significant. Methods for accomplishing this reduction in damage have been discussed at every potato meeting during the last eight or ten years, they were demonstrated in pick - ing contests and in exhibits on the U. P. and Agricultural College Po - tato Exhibit Train and a bulletin on the subject can be procured from the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station at Lincoln (Exp. Sta - tion Bulletin 260), or from the county agricultural agents. All that is necessary is to watch all harvesting operations critically at all times and to then use intelligent and common sense in correcting any prac - tices that are causing damage. </seg>
         <seg id="p553">i Nebraska Potato Improvement Association ¦1 If a grower really wants to get his potatoes into the cellar with very little damage, he can do it even though he may have a crop of very tender potatoes. It has been done under a great variety of condi - tions for a number of years by quite a few Nebraska growers. The only growers who can hope to share in some of the good returns from the sale of high priced table potatoes will be those who handle their pota - toes carefully. The sale of a large quantity of very good Triumph table potatoes will in the end result in greater returns to those producing them than if only a few growers* produce potatoes of high quality. I In order to establish a good market for high priced potatoes a large supply must be available. This has been very clearly demonstrat - ed in the case of Nebraska Certified Seed Potatoes. Thus this is a mat - ter of great concern to all potato growers and potato growing com - munities. ' i .

Werner, ; University of Nebraska. | The potato industry of the San Luis Valley, in Colorado was jmbstly developed with the Brown Beauty variety. During the last dec-' jade the acreage has been shifting to the Red McClure so that now it is the dominant variety. With the development of the Red McClure industry this Valley has come directly into competition with the western Ne - braska Triumph table stock industry. Therefore comments concerning the present status of the San Luis Valley potato industry as viewed by ithe author, largely as the result of a four-day trip into that Valley in February, will be of very direct and timely interest to western Nebras - ka potato growers. ¦-.;!¦ The San Luis Valley is located in south central Colorado at an al - titude of more than 7000 feet. It has a very cool summer climate and an abundance of irrigation water, available. From the standpoint of climate, soil and water supply, it is one of the most favored potato re - gions ol the country. Yields of 500 to 700 bushels per acre are not un - jusual. Potatoes are the main crop in four counties. Planting is done in ;May and the crop is harvested between September 20 and October 10. are generally colder than in western Nebraska. ¦ The situation in the San Luis Valley of Colorado has a direct bear-!

The situation that existed in the San Luis Valley with the 1939 crop is not typical of the experience of the valley. In past yeai-3 this valley ha 3 shipped a high percentage of U. S. #1 potatoes. In 1939 a series of adverse circumstances occurred. All potatoes were frozen to the ground on June 18th (planting having been in mid May). This de - layed the crop which together with a very late frost (October G instead of September 15) forced many growers to dig the crop while vines were still green. The Red McClure is the major variety. The type of these potatoes is generally better than with the Triumph but the color last year fre - quently was a dull pale red instead of a dark or bright red and was often very variable both within potatoes from the same field and even on different parts of the same tuber. The color situation can be improv - ed by the slow process of breeding or by some cultural methods that may result in immature tubers. Bacterial ring rot and black leg have been giving some trouble. Probably the most serious situation is the manner in which pota - toes are harvested. The universal system is to pick into wire baskets (generally unpadded), then to dump the potatoes onto the old type shaker sorter for the purpose of getting rid of some of the dirt and sorting out what they call their "seed potatoes". These potatoes are put into 100-pound sewed sacks and are stored in the sacks. A very large percentage of the potatoes suffer more or less serious damage as they go over this sorter and drop several feet into the sack 3. More care might also be used in hauling and storing these filled sacks. A serious market situation results because of having the sacks on hand in which potatoes were stored. The growers or dealers hesitate to buy new sacks for shipping the potatoes, so they are commonly shipped in the sacks in which they were stored. These sacks have he -ome more or less dirty and are dull instead of bright looking and many of them have been weakened so that they tear when handled. As a consequence the sale of potatoes packed in such sacks is damaged. Consequently the industry suffers a financial loss due either to a lower price or more claims against potatoes sold in old sacks or because of the necessity of buying two sets of sacks for handling one crop. The San Lui3 Valley people are aware of the fact that the prestige of their potatoes has suffered severely. They are not going to stand idly by and see the industry suffer any more. Potatoes are the main crop in the valley and because of the high altitude (7000-7500 feet) they are limited as to the choice of crops. Individually and collectively some distinct improvements will be made. Growers, dealers and towns- </seg>
         <seg id="p555">i Nebraska Potato Improvement Assocation ¦ ¦¦ . . . -. - . people have organized under the name "San Lui3 Valley Potatoes, In - corporation" . for the purpose of bringing about some improvements and to advertise San Luis Valley potatoes. County Agents and Potato Inspectors are very vigilant. The Colorado Potato Growers Exchange with several locals in the Valley has set forth on a constructive pro - gram designed to revolutionize the methods of handling potatoes out of! the! field and to improve seed stocks and storing, grading and pack - aging methods. Their members are keenly interested and will exert themselves considerable to attain success with this program. The Col - orado Agricultural Extension Service and Experiment Station this year are establishing a farm in the Valley for the purpose of solving some of the potato problems. Mr. Frank McGee, who haa had a number of years of experience in the Valley as High School teacher and" County Agent, will be the superintendent of the farm. ;•¦¦ Some serious difficulties will need to be overcome by them in ord - er to accomplish {the necessary changes in methods. The first difficulty will be the aversion of farmers and potato pickers to change complete - ly from a method which all have used for almost 40 yeara to an entire - ly different method of handling and storing:, especially since they have hot had an opportunity to see this new method (new to them) in prac - tice. The next difficulty is that their potato cellars are not now as suit - able for bulk storage as they might be. The potato cellars are practi - cally all built above ground with thick adobe walls and almost flat ro3fs. These cellar walls are seldom as high as eight feet, consequently together with flatness of the roof, it' will be difficult to fill them close the top of the piles when storing in bulk. They also need to bring at out a very radical change in the manner of using irrigation water. It may be difficult within a few years to interest and educate most growers and laborers to the extent that will be necessary to bring about the extensive improvement in handling methods that will be necessary. if Undoubtedly the necessary improvement will be made in the San Luis Valley. In the meantime, it seems that the wise thing for the wes - tern Nebraska potato industry to do is not only to preserve all of the present advantageous features of the Triumph seed and table market, bit also to get busy and produce a much higher percentage of high qiality potatoes on a much greater number of farms. It would seem flesirable for these two regions that produce fine red potatoes to work together instead of considering each other merely competitors. The two valleys have many : assets in common and their major competitors are located in other states.^ ! ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF FEDERAL-STATE &lt; SHIPPING POINT INSPECTION I Neal A. fianborn, Supervising Inspector. i Much of the history of the beginning and development of the Fed- </seg>
         <seg id="p556">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture eral Fruit and Vegetable Inspection Service cannot be covered without going into considerable detail, but at least a brief summary is neces - sary, to show the fundamental value of this service as a definite factor in the marketing and distribution of perishable farm products. In this area, the potato crop is the commodity of particular importance. EARLY BEGINNING Many people take for granted the various official marketing ser - vices that are available today. That is natural, for it is almost as diffi - cult to think of our homes without electricity, or our roads without automobiles and trucks as it is to picture the fruit and vegetable in - dustry functioning without some of these services. But it has not been so many years ago that we had no official market reports, no national grades, no official shipping point or terminal market inspection, and no Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. The services came into exist - ence largely at the insistance of, and for the primary benefit of grow - ers and shippers who found it impossible to provide themselves with certain types of marketing assistance. This work was first begun under the Office of Markets in 1913, later becoming the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, and has now evoluted to the Agricultural Marketing Service of the U. S. Depart - ment of Agriculture. GRADES AND STANDARDS The original outline of the organization was for the rendering of effective aid in marketing, by undertaking the study and subsequent promolgation of market grades and standards. The idea of a grade or standard was to furnish a common language for both producer and con - sumer as the first essential to a satisfactory contract between them. It might be further defined as a nationally! understood yard-stick for the definition of quality and condition of colmmodities in sale transactions and in the settlement of disputes. | Grades provide distinctive terms wiiich can be accurately under - stood as applying to a given quantity land quality of produce. The terms should be based on present trade practice in the handling of the various commodities, and on the requirements of modern consumers. This concept of standards and grading is materially the same as we have today. TERMINAL MARKET INSPECTION Most people think of grades in conjunction with inspection. This i 3 natural, for one complements the other. Inspection stripped of all technical language, is simply the matching of quality of farm ,pro- </seg>
         <seg id="p557">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association ducts with specifications of the official grades or other contract speci - fications. | Inspection work was first begun in 1917, and was limited to a lew of the important central markets. This was extended, until now termi - nal market inspection is available in 47 important central markets designated by the Secretary of Agriculture, or at any point near a des - ignated market. I SHIPPING POINT INSPECTION &lt; Terminal market inspection fitted a definite need, and it was widely used, but it did not meet the requirements of growers and ship - pers far from the markets who wanted inspection at point of origin as a basis for FOB sales. Growers argued that certificates issued in east - ern markets on products from 1 far away western states were, of little use. Some shippers referred to the certificates as "post mortems". This situation favored the development of a nation-wide inspection program for use at shipping points. A bill providing for a shipping point in - spection service was passed by Congress in 1922. The work was start - ed almost at once in 22 states, and during the first year, nore than twice as many inspections were made at point of origin, as at all of the terminal markets combined. For the fiscal year 1938-39, shipping point inspections totaled about 456,000 cars, or about 40 to 50% ofjthe total annual rail movement of all fruits and vegetables, as compared with only about 49,000 cars inspected in receiving markets. However, in the case of potatoes, nearly 90% of all car lot shipments were inspect - ed] at point of origin. This indicates the rapid development and accept - ed! value of the service, and contradicts any assertion to the contrary. COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS | Federal-State shipping point inspection is now conducted in 44 states, in cooperation with State Departments of Agriculture, or other state agencies. Agreements provide for the conducting of the inspec - tion work under the authority of some state law furnishing the legal basis for the collection and disbursement of fees to be used in operat - ing the service, including the paying of inspectors, who are licensed by the Federal Supervisor upon showing proper qualifications. The U. S. Department of Agriculture is reimbursed for the supervision which is necessary and required, in orcjer fo insure uniformity in the applica - tion of the grades in the different states. i J •;...•¦ ¦•. ¦.•¦¦'-: ; ¦¦•'¦- -.¦'.'¦ .¦¦ .- "" v ¦••. ¦ - ¦ '¦-¦- .'.-:' ] '¦•; The. cooperative agreements under which the inspection work Is carried on in the. various states, while possibly largely basic in princi - pal, would necessarily vary considerably in detail, depending on the nature of the state law and coijtribjuting local factors. Some state laws, seemingly adequate when placed on the statute books, may later be </seg>
         <seg id="p558">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture found, in actual application, to be basicly wrong and fail in the intent of providing for an efficient and satisfactory inspection service. Or, it may be that the state's administration has not been in the interest of the efficient and impartial operation of the service. In such cases, fur - ther cooperation by the Federal Government can be denied, until the unsatisfactory features have been corrected. However, there is always the possibility that there may some time be situations that are not, or cannot be satisfactorily cleared up, thus leaving the trade in that area without the service, unless it can be provided on some other basis. As previously stated, under the present form of cooperative agree - ments, the State Agency is responsible for the collection and disburse - ment of all fees. This is all right, provided the state law has some safe - guard against the fees collected being used for any other purpose than the inspection work. The service should also be kept entirely out of politics, in order to avoid the usual accompanying disorders and in - efficiencies. POSSIBLE CHANGE IN AGREEMENTS Recently, the idea has been advanced of an optional straight Fed - eral Shipping Point Inspection Service, to replace that in operation under some state agreement where the situation has become decidedly unsatisfactory. Under this plan, if it should be perfected and :put into operation, all fees collected would be deposited in a separate trust fund, under the direction of the Federal Government. These fees would be used entirely for the conducting of the inspection service. All dis - bursements would be by voucher, drawn against the account, and hand - led through the field disbursing offices of the U. S. Department of Agri - culture. Under this plan, any remaining portion of the funds not ex - pended would be held in this trust fund for use the following season. The income would have to match expenditures and the service be self - supporting, as is now the case, as there would be no appropriated funds. Some individuals might have the objection of its being too much Fed - eral, while others would approve, as long as it improved the service. The advantages however, would be the availability of an impartial per - political, more efficient service, with better trained and qualified per - sonnel, and the assurance that all funds collected would be used in the interest of the inspection work. At the present time, this plan is still in the future. I do not know definitely that it has yet reached that stage of development where it could be put into operation. It may also be the intent to have it avail - able as an emergency or alternate plan for providing the inspection service, should some state or local situation become so unsatisfactory as to render inadvisable the continuation of the service under the existing agreement. </seg>

'.'.¦ :•'¦¦¦• ¦¦¦;; ;'.v¦ •' : i i It is always our aim, from the supervisory end, to strengthen the weak spots, and to maintain accurate and uniform application of the grades. In other words, we want the inspection to be on an equal basis in all parts of the district, so that on 3 operator, or the growers in any one 1 area will not feel that an inspector doing the work in one place, is doing it any differently than inspectcrs at other points. j We also do not want the interpretation of the grades to be any more strict than is required, but do insist on the work being accurate - ly ilone. We feel that the work must be done right, to be of any value to :he trade, and so that they will hare enough confidence in the value of the certificate to rely upon it in tlieir sales transactions. ".[ ' I believe there have been a number of instances this past season whsre the inspection has enabled ths shipper to make his sales stick by depending upon the accuracy of the inspection, where he might otherwise have felt it advisable to make some sales allowance, under pressure from the receiver. . ; I feel also-that there has been considerable improvement in this ar«a in the support which*the growers and shippers are giving to the inspection work, and that they are more and more recognizing the val - ue of the service to the potato indus ry. I feel, without doubt, that we have had much closer cooperation on the part of the shippers and grow - ers' this season, and though some mistakes have been made, prompt attention has been given to correcting them. I The sup &gt;ort and cooperation t lat the Certified Potato Growers and its management have given the service have been especially noted and apprecia;ed. There have also jeen marked improved relations demonstrated on the part of a number of other shippers, as well as independent growers. i, ¦ I *' . - ¦ • ¦ ! I believe we owe Mr. McLean of the Certified Potato Growers a decided vote of thanks for his helpf 11 cooperation. I also feel that Mr. To'urtelot, who has acted in the capacity of Inspector in Charge, is en - titled to much credit for any improvement in the operation or the ad - ministration of the service this seascn. : It is quite apparent that the wtole western Nebraska and eastern Wyoming potato industry has made 1 he greatest progress in one season ofjany area for some time past in tl c marketing of table stock. ' This </seg>
         <seg id="p560">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture , has been reflected in the broader demand and greater outlet for your, product, and for the much better prices which have been received, in comparison with prices for potatoes from competing areas.! It might not be far out of line to state that this area has made close to ten years' progress in one season, in the marketing of table stock, and has stepp - ed from the rear ranks of the potato parade to a leading position in the industry. This could not have been done, without considerable im - provement In the pack and grade of the product furnished to the trade. The extent to which this area may stay in the lead will depend consid - erably upon to what degree you continue to maintain, or to further im - prove your marketing practices. To us, in the Inspection Service, this has been a very interesting and highly gratifying season, and we are looking forward to po3slbly still further developments in the future. ENLARGING .MARKETS AND NEW USES FOR NEBRASKA POTATOES By Earle G. Reed. In 1909 the per capita consumption of potatoes in the United States was about 4.2 bushels. The total production of potatoes was about the same as it was last year—3so to 375 million bushels. Today the average potato use per capita is about 2.3 bushels. In 1909-1910 potato production per acre averaged less than 100 bushels for the U - nited States. After 30 years of work with potatoes the average produc - tion per acre has increased to 112 or 115 bushels per acre. Our per capita consumption has decreased nearly 50% while our average yield has increased from 12% to 15%. Something else has happened to the potato industry. In 1909 most of the potatoes were shoveled from the ground into a wagon. If they were put in a cellar or a pit they were shoveled from the wagon into the pit or bin. Every farmer who grew potatoes had a potato fork which was as much a part of his equipment as a grader is today. Then the potatoes were shoveled from bin to wagon and from wagon into the car—bulk loading was the rule. Good sacks were the exception. Sacks—old grain sacks of all kinds and mixed kinds and sizes ol sacks when any were used, were not at all uncommon for potatoes. Sorting, grading and sacking of potatoes was "just another unnecessary ex - pense" and "a lot of buncum". The consumer would eat potatoes any - way—weren't they one of the mainstays of life? Now we put them on cushions, handle with the utmost care, sort, grade, wash, polish, nothing but new branded bags, cotton sacks, card - board cartons, fancy boxes, open mesh, 10 and 15-pound bags, special </seg>

And with all this prtgress, all this increased expense and dolling the potato up like a pantry queen, advertising and extoll - ing the merits of the spud, all we have accomplished has been to see the use of potatoes reduced from 4.2 bushels per person down to 2.3 bushels in 30 years. ' , What's the matter? What's the answer? Where are we going with potatoes? Why aren't we increasing the volume of ' potatoes used? What kind of a potato prophet do we need to put the profit back in the crop and spuds on every table at eveiy meal? ; If the 130 million people would average again 3 bushels per per - son that would require 390 million bushels. Another 65,000,000 bush - els Of culls and off grades could and should be used for industrial pur - poses and manufactured foods. That vould make a tota^ot 455 million bushels. 450 million bushelß should be grown on 3 million acres in - stead of taking 3 IA million acres to grow 375 million bushels. Potatoes are) still the cheapest per dollar of food value. There are still too many poor potato growers. )' I In order to get greater, wider potato use, and greater volume of sales, we have got to make the potatoes better and cheaper than they have ever been before. We have got to put quality and volume produc - tion together and keep them there. Then we have got to put eye appeal and taste appeal into the potatoes anil sax appeal into the bag or pack - age and keep those things there. Thai, means better potatoes, no waste, no rot and no dirt. You need the soil it home. Why pay freight on dirt. It means an attractive package, be it sack, carton, box or bag. There are so many fresh, canned and frozen vegetables that are today com - peting for the consumer's dollar ant a place in his stomach that the; offjcolor, off-type, rough, dirty, bady packaged potato has no morel chance in a modern store than the old fashioned open barrel of crackers. - 1. I •.-'.-.-. •;¦"'- ¦' ' •¦• • ' . ' ' ¦ ¦ j- The modern housewife buys 7f % of her food products on eye appeal with price secondary according to a recent survey made of cus - tomers of one of the large chain sto :es. Some of you potato growers ( arid shippers in Nebraska have hesitated about washing. Washing is^ ie^e to stay. Those who adopted it eiirly in the season literally washed Nebraska potatoes into the eastern markets. Smaller bags, branded bags with the producer's or shipper' 3 name helped put Nebraska Tri-j limphs in the eater's favor. Better an i more strict grading widened the distribution—more markets reachec with more potatoes. Whoever majkes something better and cheaper, be it automobiles or potatoes has performed a service to mankind and reward is generally proportionate to Ithe service rendered. </seg>
         <seg id="p562">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We have need for widening and enlarging our market outlets and areas for potatoes. This idea of sending 100 carloads of potatoes a day to Chicago when only 50 are needed is economically unsound. It costs money and the cost bounces back to the producer. A great deal has been said and written about more economical marketing, of cutting the cost of distribution, of getting more of the consumer's dollar back to j the producer, of cutting out middle men, and other schemes, but so fai it has been mostly conversation. Further reductions in freight rates is not the answer. No reduction in freight rates made in the last 20 years has benefltted the grower one 5-cent nickel. It has benefitted the con - sumer a Uttle, but in every case it has resulted in added handling costs, of putting more people and organizations into the business of handling potatoes, or rendering more services paid for out of the freight saving. ; Last reduction of 20% effective last October Ist has not benefltted the ; grower one cent. People are not eating more potatoes because of any ; rate reductions and you are not selling any more potatoes because of • rate reductions—you are selling more in competition with your neigh- ;. bor farmers because you are producing better potatoes that are desired \ by the consumer. Reduction in rates has brought more dealers, ship- ; pers and handlers. We have got to devise new ways and means of gett- • ing Nebraska potatoes into more small cities and towns, in more stores j and on more tables. It can be done. ; Now for the possibilities of advertising and sales promotion. It \ helps to advertise—no question. Tell the world what you have and '¦' then have what you tell the world you have got. Don't be mistaken, ! the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product very long. ' And the consumer reaction to doing that is terrific and disasterou3. Advertise to create a desire for your product, but consumer realization \ that you are offering a product that is even better than you advertise j completes and increases successful sales. i j New use 3 for potatoes—yes. There are many possibilities. Starch, j flour, glue, sizing, alcohol, plastics, lucite, livestock feed, fertilizer, ! cellulose, lignin, and drugs are all possibilities with the realm of eco- ', nomic and chemical reason. We haven't really started to work on the chemical and industrial possibilities of potatoes. Only recently have } chemists and mechanical engineers really succeeded in producing val- ! uable potato food products such as flour, meal, dehydrated mashed po- i tatoes (Shreds) that will keep indefinitely. The possibility of success- • fully producing a dehydrated livestock feed and a valuable humus— ; lignin fertilizer is just on the threshold of successful accomplishment. Medical science and research has recently discovered that potatoes con - tain considerable amounts of the substance known as thiamin, a B vit - amin that encourages and increases growth and muscular development in man and animals. A few drops of extracted potato thiamin per day in water given to animals has produced amazing results. The same vit- </seg>

We need more potato research-^both on growing the crop at less cost per bushel and in making use of the culls and off grades. New uses lor these off grades will be found, but someone; some group, some organization has got to work on these potato research problems. Why shouldn't all the potato interests of Nebraska grower, shipper, trans - portation and business join hands in establishing a potato research laboratory in Nebraska—at Gering for instance. Doesn't that sound reasonable? New uses for potatoes will be found and new industrial and chemical methods and processes will foe developed whenever we want to do the job bad enough and have the will to do it. We have the brains, the science and power to do it—so far we have lacked.only the will. Whenever the potato growers of America, you and I, make up our minds that we are going to do these things, then the day of achieve - ment is not far off. . I I In the meantime those who are going to stay in toe potato produc - tion business are the ones who can and will produce a quality volume per acre that will make it possible to sell more potatoes to more people at less cost. The consumer still holds the power and the answer— whether to buy more, less or no potatoes. In America no one ha 3 to buy or eat potatoes, the freedom of choice is still in the consumers' hands. The freedom of: choice as to whether you will grow potatoes is atijl in the farmers' hands.

Potato growers operating with irrigation systems were notified of the contest by the county agricultural agents. The pur - pose of this project was not only to see how many bushels of potatoes can be grown per acre, but also to find out the most efficient methods of producing potatoes, to improve the quality of Nebraska potatoes and to give a certain amount of publicity to the enterprise for the encour - agement o! other growers.

         <seg id="p568">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture imately a little over one fourth of the total sortout was due to scab injury. (3) The remainder was due to off-type and undersized potatoes. &lt; In order to see if any one type of soil predominated In producing these yields of 400 bushels of V. S. No. 1 potatoes per acre we checked the location of the club members' farms with regards to soil type. We do not have complete information on this matter because of incomplete records regarding the location of the farm. In checking over the loca - tion of the farms of the twelve club members, who reported fully, we found the following: Six of these club members produced the potatoes on Mitchell very fine sandy loam; three on Valentine loamy fine sand; one on Valentine very fine sandy loam; one on Mitchell silt loam; and one on Tripp fine sandy loam. In determining the time of the first irrigation following planting it was found that the earliest date of application in Scottsbluff County was July 15. In Kimball County it was June 28. The date of the last application was approximately the same in both counties, being Sep - tember 15. The average date of the first application of water following planting by the 1939 club member was between July 15 and 20. The seven club members who used commercial fertilizer applied from 100 to 250 pounds per acre. In all cases superphosphate was U3ed. The average application was approximately 140 pounds per acre. The following table gives the range and average of total yield per acre, the range and average of U. S. No. 1 potatoes per acre, and the range and average of the percent of the U. S. No. 1 potatoes by groups of five of twenty-five growers, who were in the contest, including the 1939 "400 Club Members". YIELD U. S. PER CENT Total Yield Per Acre No. 1 Potatoes No. l's Range Aver.

The per cent of number one potatoes varied from 94.5% in one of the fields.to 31% in the poorest field. This large difference was mainly due to mechanical injury at harvest time.

To grow a 500 bushel croi, or a 400 bushel one, every operation must be done at the right time and it must be done right. This, I believe, is where the human element comes in, which is as important as the actual practice. It is easy to tell a man what to do, but much of the ,'when" and the "how" must depend upon the good judgment of the individual. | THE 1939 NEBRASKA POTATO SEASON ¦j; ' &#132;. ; ;: " :¦"¦¦¦¦ ..: ¦ ¦¦•.¦¦ ¦ :•¦. ¦;.¦¦¦¦¦¦ i H. O. Werner : The outstanding events of the 1939 potato year in Nebraska were the I widespread adoption of the practices .of washing potatoes and of graking them into strictly U. S. #2 grades. For the first time in history, Nebraska table stock Triumph potatoes consistently topped the large markets in the middle west and south. (See pages 19 to 22). </seg>
         <seg id="p570">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture In April 1939, the directors and the managerial staff of the Ne - braska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative made a trip to Louisiana and Alabama to inspect fields planted with Nebraska seed potatoes and to study the extensive trial plat of Nebraska Certified seed potatoes. They were much impressed with what they saw. They came back quite thoroughly convinced that some other regions producing certified Tri - umph seed potatoes are developing some very good stocks of seed and that Nebraska growers must be alert if they wish to retain the leading position their certified seed stocks have enjoyed in the gulf coast coun T try. The frequent but unpredictable occurence of hay-wire in Nebraska seed stocks in southern plantings caused them real concern. After re - turning from this trip they ruled that every certified seed grower would have to plant a tuber-unit seed plot in 1939 and they voted to appropriate $400 to pay a fellowship at the University of Nebraska for the purpose of investigating the causes of the "haywire" disease. Mr. Arden Sherf, a graduate of the University of Minnesota was appointed to this position in the Department of Plant Pathology. The discovery of bacterial ring-rot in some western Nebraska po - tato lots caused a real scare. A fairly widespread survey resulted in the discovery of the disease in lots of seed potatoes in western Nebraska. Some seriously infected lots of potatoes from other states were dis - covered to have been planted in commercial districts in central Nebras - ka and some serious shipping losses were encountered with the early crops. All growers were urged not to plant any lot of potatoes in which any infected tubers were discovered. The disease was found in about 30 of the 900 fields up for certification, all of which were rejected. In most cases only a few infected plants or tubei-3 were found. It is hoped that the disease is now well in hand as there are many available seed stocks in Nebraska free of this disease. The early potato crop in eastern Nebraska was started late be - cause of cold weather in early April. Most of the spring and early sum - mer was very favorable for the early crop. Psyllids were serious in gar - den potatoes in central Nebraska but were of no consequence in com - mercial fields. In central Nebraska quite a few acres of Warba and Tri - umph potatoes were planted in addition to the Irish Cobblers. A high percentage of these early potato fields were sprayed with lime sulphur and many of the potatoes were precooled before shipping. Several new irrigation potato districts got into commercial production in 1939. In late May and early June regional meetings were held in western Nebraska among certified seed potato growers to consider waya and means of planting tuber unit seed plots. Growers took to the plan with enthusiasm and became convinced concerning the desirability and ef - ficiency of the method. Unfortunately many growers overlooked one little detail that caused a lot of trouble. When cutting knives were not </seg>
         <seg id="p571">:,! i '.. Nebraska Potato Improvement Assocation disinfected between tubers there was considerable spread of spindle - tuber. This disinfection of cutting knives is also especially important because of the constant possibility of bacterial ring-rot being present. The tuber unit seed plot will be a permanent institution hereafter with Nebraska certified seed potato growers. j On June 15, T. H. Hankins resigned from the Extension Service of the Nebraska Agricultural .College and joined the staff of the Ne - braska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative. In September, James 0. Dutt was employed to fill the vacancy on the Extension staff. The temperature was unusually high when potato planting began in western Nebraska in early June. There were some good rains in mid- June so the crop started off well. The early part of the summer was ex - tremely hot. On July 11, the temperature was 109 degrees at Alliance and'loB at Scottsbluff, these were the highest temperatures as yet re - corded at these two places. These high temperatures were probably too much for the psyllids. They were numerous in western Nebraska in early July but their number declined very rapidly during and after the hot period and they were very scarce all of the summer. However, grasshoppers and blister beetles were worse than ever before and com - pletely destroyed many dry land potato fields as the plants were emerg - ing. ¦', ' ¦'¦... : :'¦¦' , ¦ V ; : . ' . ¦ "¦; There;were several.very chilly periods in western Nebraska during the summer. It was therefore possible for seed growers and inspectors to detect mosaic symptoms quite readily in late August. A chilly period in mid-August caused old timers to remember with some concern the severe freeze on Aug. 24,1908 when according to a report to the writer by Peter Janssen, the ground froze to a depth of 2 inches in potato fields in the vicinity of Morrill. : In mid-August the 4th annual conference of the High Plains Po - tatOj Workers was held at the Scottsbluff Field Station. This was at - tended by potato specialists, or workers with special interests in pota - toes'^ who came from Montana, North Dakota, -Utah, Texas, Wyoming, Colorado, Alabama and Washington,: D. C, in addition to a large dele - gation of Nebraskans. Ring-rot, psyllids, potato certification and breed - ing problems were the subjects of major interest. | jln September, Alfred D. Edgar, U. S. D. A. Agricultural Engineer and specialist in potato storage structure investigations was transferr - ed from Michigan to western Nebraska. In cooperation with the Horti - culture and Agricultural Engineering departments of the Agricultural College experimental work on potato storage structures was initiated. Several cellars under construction in September were modified accord - ing to recommendations of Mr. Edgar. This work promises to result in a big change in type of storage structure and methods of storing. ii..-¦ ¦ ¦ - ¦ ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p572">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture An epidemic ot early blight was feared because of two days of high humidity on Sept. 7 and 8. However, this epidemic did not devel - op. The weather conditions in late September caused a lot of trouble when early dug Triumphs cracked'badly. After a killing frost and a hot windy weekend, there was much.less difficulty. A large number of growers got their crops into the cellar with very little damage to the tubers. An inter-state and inter-town picking contest staged near ScoUsbluft* attracted a lot of attention and served us a .means of point - ing out methods of handling potatoes more carefully. In October the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative initiated a very ambitious plan to index thousands of potatoes selected from seed plots of growers. These potatoes were planted near Home - stead, Florida by T. H. Hankins and Hugh Beal. In view of all the de - tails involved it was a big undertaking. Unfortunately two disasters that rarely happen at that far southern point struck this plot. One was a 10 to 12 inch rain that flooded much of the plot, the other was a se - vere freeze when plants were quite far along. The idea i 3 a fine one and we all hope it will encounter fewer discouraging events next time. Seventeen growers qualified for the "Nebraska 400 Bushel Potato Club" in 1939. The practices followed are discussed on pages 33 to 38. About ten more entraants in this contest could have qualified if they had kept the percentage of mechanical damage below 10 or 15%. In October several selling agencies began to wash Triumph pota - toes. When they were sorted to a good U. S. §1 grade they sold very readily and soon, at top prices, they were in constant demand on the Chicago and other distant markets where Nebraska potatoes had not been used to an appreciable extent in previous years. Other dealers soon installed washing machines and washing of potatoes was soon "here to stay". A young man, Lockwood, the son of a Kimball po - tato grower, has been very energetic in building washing and grading machines. The other big midwinter event was the Special Potato Train oper - ated on the Union Pacific Railroad in cooperation with the College of Agriculture, the U. S. D. A., this Association, the Certification Division of the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative and numerous local agencies. The train was in Nebraska from February 4 to 11, ex - cept for one and one-half days spent in Wyoming. Almost -6000 people passed through the train while in Nebraska. Undoubtedly 1200 to 1500 of these people were actual potato growers. The train contained five cars of exhibits and three audience cars. Best practices in connection with practically every phase of potato production from seed selection and land selection, through all the intricacies of growing to harvesting, grading, loading and preparation for food for man and beast were </seg>

It was the second and by far the most ambitious event of this kind to be op - erated in Nebraska. The first potato exhibit car was operated in 1920. Both Earle G. Heed, who was responsible for the railroad aspect, and H. 6. "Werner, who was leader of the College groups for both of these events, may be participants in similar events in the future but they are making no promises if another interval of twenty years is permitted to elapse before the next attempt is made. As this Association year closed Geo. Schmid resigned from the po - sition of supervisor of the Box Butte Experimental Farm, where he served so well during six trying years. He is being succeeded on April 1 by Robert Pahl who grew up in Kimball County and who graduated from the Agricultural College in January 1940. Geo.

The 1940 Nebraska State Poultry Show was held in the City Auditorium at Hastings, Nebraska; January 2 to sth inclusive. This is the first time the show has moved out to the central part of the state for a good many years. The show was a real show when ft came to Quality. There was about 800 birds in the show. Not a poor bird was on exhibit. As usual the Red Class was the largest, then came the Orphington Class which was a show by itself. Fine, well-matured birds with lots of Quality and Size. The White and Barred Rocks a real class of Quality that really showed well-bred birds. The White Wyandottes and Leghorns had good size classes and the odd breeds filled up three classes. The Bantam class was also a large class showing several varieties. The Duck and Geese exhibit was about as usual, but a good class of Turkeys. The Hatchery Class showed plenty of Quality—nearly as much Quality as there was in the open class, with some 30 pens in this class. The show was judged by Fred Lipps of Columbus, Nebraska and Dent Holcomb of Grand Island. The show was very well attended. The show for 1940 was awarded to Beatrice.
