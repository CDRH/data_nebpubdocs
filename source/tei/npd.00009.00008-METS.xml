SECRETARY 

The legislature of 1901 failed to make an appropriation for 

the salary of the secretary in the wardens' office, as provided 

for by law, and it was found that it would be impossible to 

properly conduct the affairs of the office without such help, as 

much of the writer's time was consumed on the road investi- 

gating reported violations of the game and fish law, a secretary 

was employed and paid one half of salary out of the necessary 

labor and office expense funds, so long as there was money in 

these funds. This deficiency is unavoidable. 

ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS 

From the number of prosecutions it will be observed the 

wardens have been vigilant in the discharge of their duties, 

and although the amount of fines in the aggregate are large, 

yet your commission has endeavored to use discretion in its en- 

forcement of the laws, and we do not hesitate to say that not </seg>


            <seg id="p009">
in a single instance, has any one been fined or imprisoned, 
who did not richly deserve it. We regret to say that in a few 
mces some that should have been punished, were liberated 
by friendly courts, in fact there seems to be a disposition on 
the part of a number of judges and justices in rendering dens, 
to mix politics with jutsice. However I am pleas* 
¦ here are many justices before whom cases have I 
•l who have rendered decisions strictly according to the 
law and evidence. 

PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATIONS 

The oragnization of game and fish protective associations, 
rod and gun clubs, etc. , has been encouraged at all times, and 
much along this line has been accomplished by the friends of 
protection through the state. These associations render invaluable 
aid to the department where they are active and sin 
. which is almost usually the case. Every county in the 
should have several of these organizations within its 
limits to aid in moulding sentiment for the better observance 
of our protective laws. Every true sportsman and lover of 
nature should put forth his best efforts for the organization of 
the important aids to protection. 

Valuable assistance is rendered the department in many 
localities in the selection of special deputies by these organizations. 
Too much cannot be said of the good that would 
accrue to the people of the state by a united effort in every 
county to organize local associations of this character, who 
would in turn send representatives to the State Sportsmen 
Association tournament, which meets every year, not only to 
attend the tournament, but for tbe discussion of the necessary 
changes on our protective laws, and the best methods for their 
enforcement. However I have not lost sight of the fact that 
much valuable aid to your commission has come from the State 
Horticulture Society, the State Board of Agriculture and the 
department of entomology and ornithology of the University of 
Nebraska. 

CASES PENDING 

Ke number of cases reported as still pending are of the 
important ones we have had, and when finished will 
t in my judgment in a large donation to the state school </seg>



            <seg id="p011">

funds. Among them is the one against the American express 
company, and should we get a conviction in all counts that 
may be filed, the fine will run up into the thousands. While I 
have not been ubl" to ascertain the exact amount of compensation 
received by the special deputies in every 
8 not reported in every instance, yet the amount no doubt is 
quite large, and the special deputies have proven a valuable 
aid in furnishing evidence to this department in cases where 
they did not care to institute proceedings personally for 
busin&gt; -ons. 

PUBLICATIONS OF THE LAW 

The interest which has been awakened in the state in the prom 
of game and fish is evidenced by the demand for a 
of the law sufficed for all demands. The past eighteen months 
your commission has had printed 15,000 copies, of this number 
12,000 have been distributed, and the demand is still exten- 
Iu addition to the knowledge of the law dessemanated. The 
newspapers generally throughout the state published the 
laws at the time of their passage by the legislature, and when 
the law became effective July 1, 1901 under such circumstances, 
ignorance of the law can no longer be urged as an excuse for 
violation of the same. 

GAME BIRDS 

Our game birds show a marked increase as the result of 
judicious laws and practical protection. Prairie chicken in the 
eastern and lower counties have increased to a considerable 
extent the past two years, while in the middle west and 
northern counties, they show a marked increase. Quail also 
show a remarkable increase in the eastern and lower counties 
of the state, and have extended their habitat to the most 
northern and western counties of the state, they have become 
quite plentiful. The noble bird may be truly called the 
farmers' friend, as its progress must always be proceeded by 
the husbandman, it is not a lover of forest cover, but on the 
contrary takes up its abode in the cleared fields and hedge 
rows, where it feeds almost entirely upon the cultivated weed 
seeds, and insect life so injurious to_the farmer. It is a pleasure 
indeed to report this most valuable game, as well as insectiverous 
birds are gradually but surely ircreasing in </seg>

            <seg id="p012">
10 


number in our state. In my judgment if we would replenish 
and retain our wild waterfowl, prompt action must be taken 
ongress in framing wholesome laws for their protection. 
I believe no better method can be envolved as a sure protective 
and repletive measure, than the adoption of a uniform open 
season. Nothing has done more in my judgment to deplete 
our stock of wild water-fowl, than spring shooting. To disturb, 
annoy and slaughter these birds, while on their way to their 
ling grounds, ignoring the unerring law of nature, which 
provides that the species shall be permitted to reproduce 
selves, wontonly slaughtering them for none other than 
purely mercinary or selfish motives, and this at a time when 
their flesh is wholly unfit and unwholesome as food, is surely 
and quickly doing its work, and I would therefore recommend 
as a step in the right direction, the adoption of resolutions by 
our legislature, requesting the introduction of a bill by some 
Nebraska congressman for a unform closed season for all wild 
water-fowl, from the 1st day of January to the 1st day of September 
next followiner thereafter. </seg>

BIRDS THAT XEST IN NEBRASKA 

BY PROF. LAWKENCE BRUNER. 

The place where a bird builds its nest and rears its young 
is just as surely home to it as is the place of our childhood to 
This being true Nebraska is the home of a relatively 
hrga number of distinct species of varied habits. Up to the 
present time we have definite records of the nesting of 
species, and a list of 40 others that are very probable nes' 
while there- are 60 others which possibly occassionally breed 
within the state. 

i discussion of the reasons for so large a list of birds i 
within the state would be interesting here, but would ree 
a little more space and time than can be given for such 
lucidation. The high altitude of western and northwestern 
raaka will partially explain the subject. It will be seen 
, on account of its central location, the elevated nature of 
western portion, and the varied surface configuration of 
state as a whole that what is affirmed above must be true. 

The nesting of so many distinct kinds of birds within a prescribed 
region is very significent since it is during the growth 
of the youna birds that a large amount of very highly nutritious 
food is required. From the standpoint of the farmer and 
fruit-grower this fact is of the utmost importance, since most 
youne birds are fed almost entirely on an insect diet during 
the time spent in the nest and for a short time afterwards. The 
same can also be said of many of the birds that leave the nest 
as soon as hatched. Therefore, during the growth of the 
young birds the quantity of such food which is gathered by 
the parent birds over the entire state must be relatively enormous. 
Taking as a basis for our estimations the figures given 
in my leaflet entitled "A Plea for the Protection of Our Birds" 
we would have about 75,000,000 birds or approximately 35,000,-000 
to 40,000,000 pairs that nest here. Should each pair of 
this large number rear four young there would be required a </seg>

            <seg id="p014">
12 


sufficient food supply for from 140,000,000 to 160,000,000 young 
birds. If, as we suggested in that paper, a single bird require 
on an av insects per day, the enormous number of 4, 
000,000,000of insects or 35,000 bushels of 12,000, insects, would 
be required during each day to feed the young birds alone 
But young birds need much more food than do old ones and w 
should at least double this quantity for the young bird. Then 
to this must be added that required by the parent birds them 
¦elves while taking care of the young, making a grand total o 
"I bushels or 107 car loads of twenty tons each, provide( 
pounds as the weight of a bushel. Some of Umm 
birds are exceedingly numerous in individuals, while others 
are comparitively rare. Some exhibit greater* while others 
show less engenuity in the building of their nests. Some are 
naturally protected by coloration, while others pruposely take 
great precaution in hiding their homes. Taking all in all 
the assignment to their particular places among those tha 
are occupied by different birds while rearing their young 
depends greatly on their food habits and bodily structure. </seg>



            <seg id="p016">
Eat deer and antelope be protected. There are about 100 
ope and 50 deer in this state and should be protected for 
iod of five years. 

That the open season for prairie chickens and grouse be^in 
September 1, and close November 30th next ensuing. 

That the open season on jack snipe, wilson snipe and yellow 
legs be extended to May 1. 

That the open season for wild pigeons, doves and plover 
begin July 15. 

That the open season for trout begin April 1, as all other fish. 

That beaver be protected perpetually, as they are very 
scarce. 

Iaat fox, gray, red and black squirrels be protected from 
lary 1, to September 30, and limited to ten per day to the 
. Beaver and squirrels have no protection whatever under 
present laws. 

Would also recommend that the force of three regular deputy 
wardens as provided for by law be cut to two and that the 
salary of the first traveling deputy be increased to $100. per 
month with $500. per year traveling expense, and that the 
salary of the assistant traveling deputy remain as it now is 
$75., with $500. per year traveling expense, also that the department 
has an appropriation of $500. per year to be used in 
cases of emergency for special deputies. This would not 
change the amount of appropriation asked for by the department, 
but would enable the department to do more efficient 
work. I concur with Supt. O'Brien as to the licensing of hoop 
or fyke nets as recommended in his report. 

In concluding this report I wish to say that the arrests made, 
convictions secured, and confiscation reported only cover a 
small part of our work for the past eighteen months. In many 
cases complaints have been made to this office based on hearsay, 
which upon investigation were found to have no found- 

CONCLUSION </seg>

            <seg id="p017">
14 


ation yet this class of complaints have entailed a large amount 
of expense and work on this department which could not be 
avoided. The confiscation of illegal devices for fishing and 
the number ot convictions for violations of the game and tish 
law&gt; have been greater during the past eighteen months than 
during the entire twenty years' existence of the former Fish 
mission, and I believe the people in general have more 
.rd for the law at this time than ever before. 

Kr&gt; press throughout the state has lent us valuable i 
in pointing out localities where the law was being disre¦d, 
and commending the prosecution of offenders in every 
nee. 

K officials of the railroads have also materially contributed 
success of this department by extending many courtesies 
r commission. 

It has certainly been a pleasure to work on this commission 
with your efficient and agreeable Superintendent uf the State 
Hatcheries, Mr. W. J. O'Brien of South Bend. His work 
been such that not a single complaint has reached this 
office, but instead many words of praise for his efficient work 
and equal distribution of fish to all parts of the state. It is 
impossible for our citizens who did not see the condition of 
State Hatchery and grounds when Mr. O'Brien took charee 
July 1, 1901 to appreciate them now. If be is retained in his 
• nt position which he should be by all moans that he may 
conclude the improvements he has planned. It can be said in 
all candor that the grounds of the State Fisheries is the most 
beautiful spot in the state of Nebraska. 

K. O'Brien is one of the leading fish cuiturists in the United 
s and Nebraska is favored to have him at the head of 
State Fish Hatcheries. 

tlso wish to commend the work of Deputy Geo. L. Carter, 
has proven especially fitted for the position of traveling 
ty. Much of the work has devolved upon him in proseig 
violators of the law, and he has acquitted himself 
itably in every respect. 

I also wish to commend the efficient and interested services 
of the secretary of your commission, Rhoda H. Stewart, who 
has at all times been diligent and painstaking in the performofduty.

general principals sympathize with the unfortunate aud pity 
their ill choice and consequent chagrin and disappointment, 
yet right over against right and the very threshold of possibility 
of all our good, stands clean handed justice, and only 
insists upon a rightful vindication of the truth and the right, 
the law and the testimony. 

Eerefore, we have a great volume of gratitude to express 
e chief deputy and his co-l&lt;*borers for their vigilent,

BLACK BASS 

There were distributed 28,590 of these desirable game 
fish during the period covered by this report, 19,590 fingerlings 
and 9,000 frv. This is the first season we have planted any 
of the bass as fry, but the Michigan and Wisconsin Commissions 
claim it to be a success in their waters, and I have 
deemed it worthy a trial here. The demand for bass has 
always exceeded the supply ; this is not only the case here, but 
in every state maintaining fish hatcheries. I have increased 
our breeding stock of bass the past summer and expect a 
corresponding increase of bass next year. It is also my intention 
to secure, if possible, a small number of adult small-mouth 
bas9 next spring for breeders, all stock of this variety having 
disappeared during the administration of my predecessor. 

ROCK BASS 

Ibere were planted 3,350 during October and November 1901. 
thousand of this number being allotted to our commission 
he United States Fish Commission. An additional supply of 
It fish will have tu be procured before we can extend this 
k as the old Commission lost practically all the breeding 
k of this fish, while endeavoring to make a fish exhibit at 
State Fair in 1900. 

CRAPPIES 

There were planted 15,225 crappies, during the biennial term, 
2,100 being procured from a slough near Peru, Nemaha county, 
the balance being hatched at the ponds at South Bend. All application 
for this fish have been filled, though in some cases the 
allotment was not as large as applied for. The introduction of 
the crappies into the waters of this state has been very successful 
and should be extended. 

STRIPED PERCH 

Owing to the fact that the old Board of Fish Commisioners 
lost practically all the adult stock of perch at the State Fair 
in 1900, only 200 fish of this variety were available for distribution 
in 1901 In April of the present year I secured a fresh 
stock cf breeders from Seymour lake, and as a result was enabled 
to distribute 5,000 fry and 12,800 six months old perch 
a total of 17,800. This is more than twice the number planted 
in any previous year. </seg>

CHANNEL CATFISH 

There were planted 23,2*5 catfish tho past eighteen months 
the major portion of these being taken in trap nets from the 
Platte River near the Hatcheries, and transplanted over the 
The artificial propagation of the channel catfish in 
la at the Hatcheries has been a partial failure, as -we have 
not been able to meet the demand for them from this source, 
but the ease with which the young fish can be collected in the 
autumn, when they are migrating to the Missouri and Ifi 
sippi rivers, makes their distribution a matter of slight exse, 
and this branch of our work is meeting with much favor. 

WALL-EYED PIKE 

A^ a result of the fact that I did not assume charge of the 
Hatchery until July 1, 1!H&gt;1, and the old Commission had no 
one in their empioy who was competent to collect pike &lt;: 
n&lt;&gt; pike were hatched in 1900 and 1901. In April of the pr. 
with the assistance of one man I succeeded in collecting 
about 12.&lt;kki,(h hi eggs at the spawning grounds at Bav City, 
Michigan. Of this number [ estimate we planted 11,104 
fry. Pike culture in small ponds has proven a failure, and I 
discouraged the planting of them in such places, owing 
to their cannabalistic habits. The bulk of the hatch the 
spring were planted in Cut off lake and the Elkhorn, Loup, 
and Blue Rivers, where natural food is abundant. 

BROOK TROUT 

The stock of adult brook trout in the ponds had become decimated 
to such an extent by disease, and other causes when I 
lued charge of the Hatcheries that I was only able to coll.'i.ooo 
eggs during the 1901 spawning season but by the 
purchase of 60,000 eggs from a commercial Trout Hatchery and 
the allotment to our Commission by the United States Fish 
Commission of another 50,(&gt;00 eyed eggs, we were enabled to 
plant 93,000 fry the past spring. We have collected B 1,1 0 » 
eggs from the stock of breeders this fall mostly from the two 
year olds and expect to collect as many more and will likely 
receive an allotment of 50,000 from the National Commission. 
The stocking of the trout streams in the northwest part of the 
state was sadly neglected by the old Commission during the 
last two years of its existence, and should now receive the at- </seg>

            <seg id="p045">

Kn they deserve. In addition to those planted I reserved 
three thousand fry at the Hatcheries to increase our 
breeding stock. 

rainbow trout 

241,000 fry and l,&lt;&gt;2i&gt; fingerlings of this variety were planted 
during the present year, and we still have several hundred 
tingerlings on hand for distribution next spring: ."&gt;&lt;&gt;. &lt; * » ' of 
(hut eggs were bought from a commercial Trout Hatchery, 
¦ i were donated by the United States Fish Commission, 
and the balance colletced from our stock of breeders in the 
Hatchery ponds. The adult stock is now in fine condition and 
I expect to collect 150,&lt;hk) eggs during Februray and March 
1903. The rainbow trout have made if anything a better showing 
than the brook trout in the streams in the northwest part 
of the state, and the demand for the stocking of streams with 
this fish is extensive and insistent. 

BROWN TROUT 

From about 40 brown trout in the ponds, we collected about 
0 eggs during the 1901 spawning season, and about the 
same number the past fall. Small plants of these trout have 
been made several times along with the brook and rainbow 
trout, but their introduction into the waters of this state has 
not been attended with the same success, as has the brook and 
rainbow trout, those planted last spring were put in with the 
rainbow trout and counted as such. Were it not for the fact 
that we have a few breeders on hand I would favor dispensing 
with their culture. We have abundant evidence that the 
brook and rainbow trout are best adapted to the waters of 
this state, and the propagation of other trout has been largely 
a waste of time and money. 

GERMAN CAKP 

I he output of carp during the present biennial period was 
0. Owing to the strenous objection of anglers and sports. 
no application for carp to stock public streams or lakes have 
i considered. We have filled all applications made for carp 
bock private ponds the present season and have fed several 
isand of them to the adult bass and trout. Were it not for 
fact that the carp are the only fish that will live in many 
[low ponds on farms and ranches, I would favor the disconlance 
of their culture'entirely. " </seg>

GOLDFISH 

The distribution of goldfish during the period covered by 
this report was 2,664, about one .third of the number being disposed 
of during the State ' Fair. There has been a marked 
falling off in the number of requests for goldfish, since the new 
law went into effect imposing a charge for them. I have delivered 
some to the State Institutions, for which no charge has 
been made. As a result of the excessive amount of rain and 
cool weather the past summer, the goldfish did not color well, 
and we still have the greater part of this season's hatch in the 

SUNFISH 

2,000 blue-gill suntish, secured by seining some of the 
sloughs along the Platte river when about to dry up in the 
summer of 1901, have been planted, 1,500 in 1901 and 500 the 
present year. There is a growing demand for sunfish. and I 
shall devote a small pond to their culture the coming year. 

YELLOW BULL-HEADS 

From a few pairs of these fish secured from the Santee 
Lakes, and placed in the pond with the catfish, we hatched and 
reared about 5,000 bull-heads. 1,000 of this numoer were 
planted in Oak Creek near Valparaiso, by request of citizens, 
the balance were distributed along with public plants of catfish, 
of which no accurate record was kept. 

RESCUING FISH FROM RECEDING WATERS 

Owing to the excessive dry spell in June, July, and August 
1901, many streams, lakes and ponds, that in an ordinary year 
contained sufficient water to sustain fish life partially or entirely, 
dried up. This was notably so of the Platte river, 
which became practically dry from North Platte to Columbus. 
July 19, 1901, in compliance with instructions from the Commissioner, 
I proceeded to Grand Island with the fish car, to 
seine the shallow ponds left by the receding waters and remove 
the fish, but upon investiagtion found we had arrived on 
the ground, too late, as all the fish of any value had been taken 
out by persons living along the stream. We spent two days 
there and succeeded in collecting about 2,000 small fish, mostly 
chubs, pike, catfish and carp. These were taken to the Hatcheries, 
the chub utilized for food for other ash, and the pike, 
catfish and carp formed part of our State Fair exhibit on Sep- </seg>

tember 3n. 1901. I received instructions from the Chief 
DeDuty to proceed to Peru, Nemaha county and examine a 
slough said to be drying up near there. Upon investigation I 
found there was tons of fish in the slough although the water 
was nearly gone and it had been seined almost daily for weeks. 
The majority of fish were bull-heads, buffalo, quillbacks and 
hybrids, but with the assistance of two men in two days, I 
succeeded in collecting 8,000 bass and crappio. These were 
placed on the fish car and planted in the Blue river atDeweese, 
Humboldt lake. Frenchmen river. Wauneta and Curtis lake 
near Curtis. One trip of this kind was made the present year 
to the ponds in the vicinity of La Platte, but owing to the high 
water little could be learned as to the contents of the ponds. 
There are numerous ponds and sloughs along the Platte and 
Missouri rivers in which thousands of fish perish every dry 
season, and I know of no way in which the energies of the 
Commission can be used to better advantage than in saving 
these fish. This work is prosecuted extensively alone the 
Mississippi river by the Illinois and Wisconsin Commissions, 
and the National Fish Commission, and I think we ought to 
carry on this work so far as our means will allow. 

FISH CAR 

Iur fish car is a valuable aid in carrying on our work, withwhich, 
it would be impossible to stock streams and lakes 
he remote portions of the state. During the past eighteen 
iths the mileage covered by the car, not including switchand 
transfers, was 3,997 miles on the B. &amp; M. R. R. . 3,458 
&gt;8 on the F. E. &amp; M. V. R. R. and 1.824 miles on the U. P. 
L a total of 9,279 miles. Like most other state property, 
n turned over by the old Board of Commissioners, the car 
badly in need of repairs. The repairs were made at the 
on Pacific shops at Omaha during the past winter, and the 
in appearance is now a credit to the Commisison. 

AQUARIAL EXHIBITS 

The Game and Fish Commission exhibits at the State Fair 
in 1901 and 1902, surpassed all previous displays, both in 
number of fish and the excellent condition of the specimens 
shown, which called forth the admiration of the visitors and 
evoked many favorable comments from the press. The main 
exhibit was shown in twenty plate glass aquariums eight feet </seg>

            <seg id="p049">
42 


ong, divided in three compartments. A large tank in the 
enter of the building also contained a large number of fish, 
nd imported ornamental fish was shown in twenty irktss &lt;rlobes. 
'he total number of live fish on display was about 12,000, rangiir 
in size from brook minnows half an inch loag to the ponerous 
Mississippi river catfish, weighing 121 pounds. A 
jii'cial feature of the display was the specimens of mounted 
ame birds and animals placed in the center of the building 
nd alonsr the side walls, which, added much to the embellishment 
of the exhibit. 

Considerable credit i&gt; due Chief Deputy. Geo. B. Simpkins 
nd traveling Deputy, Geo. L. Carter, who assisted materially 
n making these exhibits. The State Board of Agriculture, 
ealizing what an attraction the fish exhibits have proven, 
lave decided to erect a permanent aquarium on the Fair 
grounds for the use of the Fish and Game Commission, and it 
s my intention next year to show not only live fish from the 
latcheries, but to collect fish from every section of the state. 
and place them on display properly labeled as an object lesson 
of what fish culture has accomplished in Nebraska. 

STOCKING PRIVATE PONDS 

Section 13, of article 1, of the new game and fish laws, which 
requires that a charge be imposed for fish planted in private 
waters, is a step in the right direction. Some fault has justly 
&gt;een found with this provision of the new law by persons who 
lave had applications on file for fish for one or two yaers, bu 
generally the new order of things is being accepted without 
complaint. Nearly all the states, which operate fish hatcheries 
lave lone since done away with the free distribution of fish to 
&gt;rivate ponds, and have practically turned this branch of the 
&gt;usiness over to private enterprises. It has been a manifes 
njustice in the past that the taxpayers of the whole state 
should pay for stocking the'private ponds of a limited number 
The charere imposed for ;fish for stocking private waters is 
merely nominal, being as follows : 

Wall-eyed pike (6 ms. old) $3.00 per 100. Fry $1.00 per 1,000 
Brook trout " 5.00 " " 2.00

The term fry means fish from two to six weeks old, and the 
term Underlings mean fish from six to twelvemonths old. Fry 
is delivered to applicants during March, April and May. 
fingerlings principally in October and November. *291.7o was 
derived from sales of fish in 1901, and 1485.55 in 190:2, a total 
of *7:.'7.-!r&gt;. While this amount may appear insignificant, it 
t about cover the expenditure of necessary labor at thf 
heries for the period covered by this report. In addition 
s cut off that class of citizens who have anplied for fish in 
&gt;ast, whether they had a suitable place to plant them or 
just because the state was conducting a sort of free fish 
'usury. The legislature, no doubt, intended to crt 
cash fund at the Hatcheries from the sale of these fish to be 
used in case of emergency, the same as other state institutions, 
have, but as the law does not specify any disposition of the 
money, on the adviec of the Attorney General, it has been 
turned over to the State Treasurer, and I hold his receipts for 
the amount. 

FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

I make no detailed financial statement, as all bills are audited 

Eie Chief Deputy, and his report will cover in detail all exitures 
of the Hatcheries, as well as the Warden's office, 
e total amount appropriated by the last legislature for the 

support of the Commission, £7,700.00 was for the maintain' 

of the Fish Hatcheries as follows: 

Salary of Deputy Pish Commissioner, 24 months.. . . g-J.4' " 

Traveling expense of Deputy Commissioner 1,000 00

Of the amount appropriated the old Board of Fish Com- 

missioners from April 1, to June 30. 1901, expended as follows 

Leaving a balance of $6,683. H to conduct the Hatcheries for 

21 months. There will be a deficiency of about $300.l&gt;0 in the 
labor fund, and about the same amount in the fish food and re- 

pair funds. This is entirely unavoidable as the !jW41.00 left in 
the labor fund by the old Commission, was not sufficient to pay 
one man for 21 months. The small deficit in the fish food 
fund is c a used by the increased cost of beef livers, corn meal 
etc., and the deficit in the repair fund, on account of rebuilding 
the two large nursery tanks in the hatching bouse, and the 
purchase of coal for heating the Hatchery, for which no prorision 
was made in the appropriation. To offset this deficit of 
1000,00 there will be a surplus of at least $200.00 in the amount 
allowed the Deputy Commissioner for traveling expense, and an 
additional $727.25 derived from the sales of fish to owners of 

private ponds and lakes. 

NUMBER AND VALUE OF FISH IN HATCHERY PONDS 

I do not attempt to give a correct report of the number and 
ages of the fish in the state ponds, as this would practically be 
impossible. At the time the ponds were drawn off in September 
of the present year, we had about 50,000 fish of all kinds 
propagated at the Hathceries on hand. This was at the commencement 
of the fall distribution, and we have since distributed 
about 40,000, which would leave at the present time 
about 10,000 fish of all kinds and various ages on hand, on 
which I have placed a value of $1,000. This is a conservative 
estimate. As all kinds of game fish are cannibals, a count of 
the fish in September would be nothing more than an estimate

now, for this reason I do not endeavor to give the number in 
detail, and claim it is accurate. 

RESULTS OF FISH CULTURE IN NEBRASKA 

The question is often asked, what has the Hatcheries accomplished, 
and has the work been profitable to the taxpayers? 
As a whole, I have no hesitancy in answering this question in 
the affirmative, though it must be admitted in the early history 
of the Commission, little was accomplished, the work being 
¦ly experimental. The thousands of land-locked salmon 
and white fish planted, were a total failure, and the same is 
aUo a fact in regard to the lake trout. I have never seen but 
three lake trout taken from the pu Dlic waters, these were taken 
in ponds on spring streams near Glen, Sioux County, and were 
not thrifty specimens. There may be some lake trout in the 
spring fed lakes in the sand hills, as the result of plants made, 
but it is my belief that we have little to show for the hundnrda 
of thousands of lake trout planted. The brook trout have 
made a better showing and as a result of their introduction, 
practically all the tributaries of theNiobrara river contain this 
species. During the past summer I have had an opportunity 
famine some of these streams, and have seen many tine 
trout taken. It is no uncommon sight during the summer 
months to see strings of from a dozen to fifty trout brought in 
to Neligh, Ewing, O'Neill. Atkinson, Stuart. Long Pine, 
H i-^sett, Johnstown, Valentine. Chadron, Crawford and Harrison. 
The principal streams in which they are found is the Verdiin 
Antelope county, the Bazile in Knox county, the Eagle, 
Red Bird and Big Sandy in Holt county, Pine and Plum in 
Brown county, Evergreen, Minnechaduza, Boardman, Gordon, 
and Schlegel, in Cherry county, Chadron, and Bordeaux, in 
Dawes county, Hat, Sowbell creeks, and White river in Sioux 
county. Limited numbers are also taken in the headwaters of 
the Niobrara in Sioux county, they are also found in a few 
streams in Cuoter, Keith and Kimball counties; Like the 
brook trout, the rainbow trout have also proven very successful. 
They are found in practically all the streams that contain 
brook trout, and specimens weighing as high as seven 
pounds have been taken from Pine Creek, Brown county. I 
personally caught ten in a small tributary of the White river 
in Sioux county in 1898 that weighed in the aggregate nearly </seg>

            <seg id="p053">
46 


forcy pounds. As no trout were found in the state previous to 
I ¦*¦*:!, I think no one will question the success of this branch 
of the Commissioner's work. Hundreds of people go out from 
&lt; iiaaha, Lincoln and other towns to fish in these clear sparkling 
ins for trout, and the money spent in this way is considerable. 
It is said that- the first plant of black bass made in 
iska waters was the result of a wreck of a United States 
Gar on the Union Pacific, while crossing a bridge over 
the Elkhorn river in 1875, and from this accidental plant the 
I became scattered along this stream from its mouth to the 
headwaters in a few years, certain it is that there was bass in 
before the State Commission bejran its work, but the 
Ita of the Commission's work in planting bass is every 
where apparent. This is especially so of the lakes in the sand 
hills of Cherry county, where owing to the sparse settlement 
have had an opportunity to multiply and increase. 
Whether the pike are more numerous in our streams now than 
before, the commission began their propagation is a question 
that is debatable. The increase in the number of mill tlains 
on our streams, has prevented them from ascending some 
iins. as they did when the state was first settled, the Inge 
in population and the consequent increase of manure 
and sewerage that washes and is damped in many streams, has 
rendered them unfit for the pike, and there is no question but 
what in some of our shallow streams the pike are misrratory, 
ascend the stream in the spring and go down in the fall. 
This may be so to a lesser extent on the larger streams as the 
tishing for pike is during the months of May and October. 
,ts of pike made in Seymour lake near Omaha in 1h9.", a 
lake fed by an artesian well, weished over two pounds in 1898, 
and while the deputies were removing carp from Cut-off lake 
near Omaha and Crystal lake near Dakota City, the past summer, 
some tine specimens of pike were taken, showing the plants 
made in those lakes were successful Crappie and perch were 
only found in a few lakes bordering the Missouri river in this 
prior to 1892, today they are to be found in the streams, 
lakes and ponds in over half the counties in the state. The 
summer I found many of them in the illegal fyke nets 
d on the Elkhorn river, and fine strings of them are now 
taught almost daily during the open season. At Ewin ? </seg>

            <seg id="p054">
47 


Neligh and many other points. West Lake near the Hatcheries 
which eigbt yean airo, contained no crappies, now contains 
thousands and tho same is true of Seymour Lake near Omaha- 
The fomu carp which were brought into the state in ' 
and have subjected the Commission to much criticism, have 
increased to such an extent as to be a nuisance and hund 
of requests were tiled with the Chief Deputv in the last 
eighteen months for permits to seine out the carp. As for the 
channel cattish, no one will question the wisdom of their distribution.as 
they arc native to our streams and the Commission's 
work in transplanting thousands of tb&lt;"m from the Platte river 
ie- numerous streams and lakes throughout the state, cannot 
prove otherwise than beneficial. 

Fish culture in private ponds of limited area has not I 
attended with the same degree of success, as has been the • 
in public waters, and I will admit that more monev baa been 
spent ir private fish culture in Nebraska than baa ever 
derived from it. The main castes of this are as follows: lack 
of knowledge in constructing the ponds, the alluvial char 
of the soil, which causes the ponds to till up with mud in a few 
s if th" surface water is not perfectly excluded. The deto 
raise trout and bass where the water supply la only 
sufficient for carp, catfish, or suntish, and often an attempt to 
rear -i dozen kinds of tish in a small pond, are all contrubuttuses 
to the many failures I have noticed. 

DOES IT PAY TO OPERATE THE HATCHKHItS 

This question is not propounded now as often as in the early 
u-y of the institution. It is my candid opinion if the laws 
were so framed that we could show up the goods, that it would 
be an easy matter to prove, not only from an angling stand 
point, but in a commercial way the Hatcheries are a good inuent. 
If licensed fishing was allowed on the Missouri and 
Platte rivers, the value of the carp alone that could be takeu, 
say in a period of live years, would more than equal the 
amount expended on the Hatcheries. 

the man who is able to buy black bass, pike, or catfish for 
table will say the carp are not fit to eat, and my assertion

taken by licensed fisherman on the Illinois river, in the state of 
Illinois, amounted to 6,332,999 pounds, and sold for*l w . 
Those figures were furnished by the Illinois River Fishermen's 
uiution and are authentic. The carp catch for the pn 
will amount to over 8200,000 and will more than equal in 
value the catch of all otb.er kinds of fish in that State, and I 
onfident from the hauls of carp made in the Platte ;md 
Missouri rivers, while collecting specimens for the Fair exhibit 
the past summer, that the carp alone in these str&gt; 
would produce a considerable revenue if properly handled. 
Some pessimists opposed to artificial propagation, will say 
thar all the fish planted by the Commission in Jones lake, are 
seined out by law breakers, and sold. This may be the case, 
but it is no vali i argument against our work. Another critic 
of the same stripe will say that as a result of the drouth in 
1901, Smith creek dried up and all fish planted therein by the 
Fisli Commission, as well as the native fish perished, therefore 
fish culture in Nebraska is useless. As well might say. that 
, use we have an occasional crop failure, the farms should 
be abandoned. The breaking up of lands around many lakes 
in eastern Nebraska, and the consequent washing in of soil 
illed up many lakes, and the dumping of manure refuse, 
and sewerage has driven out all fish except carp, catfish and 
bullheads. From some small streams, these causes cannot be 
interfered with, and the only thing to be done is to adapt our 
work to the new conditions. During the past summer a cloudburst 
near Harrison, Sioux county, swept down the White 
river valley and carried everything before it. After the storm 
hundreds of trout were found that had been carried out of the 
an by the flood. It will likely take five or ten years restocking 
to replace the fish destroyed by this storm, it also 
damaged the Elkhorn railroad and carried out their dam at 
Andrews, but the railroad company did not abandon the damaged 
piece of track because of the disaster, and the Fish Com- 
i on will not abandon this beautiful trout stream because 
of this misfortune. In numerous instances drouth and flood 
have annulled the work of the Hatcheries, both in this and 
other states, but this is no reason why fish cultural work 
should be abandoned. </seg>

Indiana 4,800.00 

Vermont 4,000.00 

Nebraska 3,850.00 

New Jersey 3,250.00 

The states of Indiana and New Jersey do not own Hatcheries 

but purchase fish from other states with the money appropri- 

ated. Vermont and Wyoming hatch trout only. This is not 

a full list of the states engaged in fish culture, but some of the 

principal ones. 

The amount appropriated for the support of the United 

States Fish Commission averages about $500,000.00 annually, 

about $200,000.00 of this amount is for salaries, $150,000. for 

fish propagation, the balance is expended for collection of 

statistics relating to the fisheries and scientic research. 
According to the United States survey, Nebraska has 6,485 

miles of streams, and 11,160 acres of lakes, all public water. 

Certainly no more laudable work can be fostered by our legis 

lature than the stocking of these waters with food fish, now 

that the feasibility of the work cannct be questioned. </seg>

            <seg id="p058">

If the great state of New York, one of the pioneers in fish 
culture, can afford to spend $56,000.00 annually in this work, 
surely Nebraska, one of the foremost states in the union can 
afford at least $5,000 annually for this work. 

DONATIONS FROM THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION 

During this biennial term the Unite i States Pish Commission, 
have allotted our commission 50,000 brook and 50.000 rainbow 
trout eggs. 1,000 rock bass, 500 black bass, and 400 cfappies 
six monhs old. 

NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS 

A new cement floor is needed in the hatching house, new 
sills, roof reshingled and exterior painted, additional trout 
hatching troughs and trays, a number of shipping cans, seines, 
etc., should be added to the Hatchery equipment. The barn 
should be raised, reshingled and painted, the ice house needs 
ingling. likewise the spring house. The Superintendent's 
residence should have a new veranda, and requires papering 
and painting inside and out. As the wagon bridge is impassable, 
it will be necessary to move the fish car shed either to 
Louisville or the new station south of Gretna. New wheels, 
heavier fulcrim and bottom rods, and air signals should be put 
on the car and the interior of car painted and varnished. 

About 2&lt;K) rods of fence inclosing the Fishery grounds will 
have to be rebuilt, the large stone dam will have to be widened 
and newly cemented, some new supply and drain pipes will 
be required for the ponds, and a considerable quantity of mud 
removed from twenty two ponds. Owing to the small amount 
appropriated for labor the past two years, this work has been 
-sarily somewhat neglected. A new work team, harness 
and lumber wagon will have to be purchased, the present team 
having outlived their usefulness, and the wagon being beyond 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

I would recommend that the proceeds derived from the sales 
of fish for stocking private waters etc., be used solely for the 
improvement of the Hatchery grounds, leveling the pond 
banks, sodding, planting trees, shrubbery flowers, constructing 

Koubt if there is a citizen of our state who saw our display

            <seg id="p059">

by our Commission, the judicious expenditure of a few hundred 
dollars would make the Hatcheries just as attractive. 

I my judgment that section of the law prohibiting the 
ng of fish in the Missouri river on the eastern boundary 
ir state, should be repealed and licensed fishing allowed, 
state of Iowa allows unrestricted fishing in any manner in 
stream at all seasons of the year, and the same privilege 
Id be extended to our citizens. 

That a systematic examination with nets should be made in 
the next two years of all streams and lakes in the state if possible, 
to determine to a certainty what success has attended 
the stocking of many of these waters in the past, and what 
kinds of fish to plant there in the future. There are many tine 
lakes and spring streams in the sand hills, that have never 
been stocked or inspected by the Commissioners or deputies. 

That a committee from the Senate and House of Representatives 
be invited to visit the Hatcheries during the legislative 
session, and learn something of the work being done, and the 
needs of the institution. 

That a stated appropriation of at least $ 10, 000. 00 for the 
biennial period be provided for the maintainence of the Hatcheries, 
thus doing away with the necessity of asking a special 
appropriation each biennial term. This is the plan followed 
in most eastern states, and enables the superintendent to figure 
ahead on work to be done and improvements, which cannot be 
done under the present makeshift method of operating the 
Hatcheries. \ 

' I assumed the management of the Hatcheries under adverse 
conditions, and I believe a fair comparison of the condition of 
the buildings and grounds now and when I was appointed will 
prove that I have done well with the limited means at my disposl. 
The number of fish uroduced will compare favorably 
with the distribution of any Hatchery in the United States, 
considering the amount expended in their production. The 
Commission is deeply indebted to the B &amp; M. the F. E. &lt;fe M. 
V. . and U. P. railroads for free transoortation of fish car and employees. 
Requests made to the officials of these companies for 
tranportation have alwaye been promptly honored. I am also 
under obligations to Chief Deputy Simpkins and traveling

SUGGESTIONS AS TO CHANGES IN OUR 
Tj* r c tt r a W G 
r ion j_~jXi. ii o 

There is a growing disposition among the people that if the 
sportsmen and anglers are to dictate our fish and game laws, 
they also should bear the greater part of the burden of propagating 
and protecting fish and game. This is evidenced by 
the passage of laws in several states imposing a license on 
those who go afield with rod or gun. Some states divide the 
responsibility for fish propagation between the angler and 
commercial fisherman by making both cough up a little to the 
general fund. In the way of licenses, while the license imposed 
is merely nominal, yet in the aggregate they produce 
considerable sums. In Michigan and Wisconsin, the proceeds 
derived from these licenses provide enough money to pay a 
thoroughly organized and well paid svstem of wardens. Ohio 
collects about $1,000 annually from her commercial fishermen 
in the way of licenses. California $7,500 from the same source, 
and Washington about $25,000 annually. In the latter state 
the revenue is principally from the salmon fishermen. I 
merely .cite these as examples. 

tie last legislature in our state in its wisdom, passed the 
fish and game bill, with ics license features, and imposed 
arge for fish delivered for stocking private ponds or lakes 
l the Hatcheries, or public waters. The operation of this 
in the past eighteen months has been satisfactory, as it 
produced enough revenue to pay two thirds the cost of 
itaining the commission, and there has been no complaint 
it is burdensome. 

(relieve the law should now be amended so as to advance a 
steps further un the common sense lines laid down by the 
ter of the present law, and instead of impoisng a license of 
) for going, beyond the boundary of your home county to 
I and fish, cut the price in two and make it 50 cents a year 
very resident of our state who goes afield with rod or gun. 
i amount would be so small that none could object to it, yet </seg>

            <seg id="p096">

it would result in .yielding thousands of dollars each year and 
would put the cost of propagating and protecting fish and game 
where it belongs on those who enjoy the sport. Those who do 
not indulge in such pastime, would not be taxed for something 
from which they received no benefit. I would also favor the 
licensing fyke or hoop nets on the Missouri, Platte, Elknorn, 
Loup, and Blue rivers. On the three latter streams from the 
mouth of the stream to the first mill-dam only, nets to be not 
less than two and a half inch mesh stretch measure, and to be 
used without leads or wings. A license fee of at least two 
dollars each to be imposed for each net same to be revoked 
in case the law was not strictly complied with. A license of 
this kind, in my judgment, would be a source of considerable 
revenue, and would meet the approval of a large majority of 
the people living along these streams. Few pike, bass or 
crappie enter this kind of net. even in waters where they are 
numerous, and a mesh of the size indicated, would retain 
nothing but the mature fish. Fully ninety per cent of all the 
catfish'caught or taken in our streams with rod and line weigh 
less than a pound. I know in making this suggestion 1 will 
call down on my head the criticism of many well meaning 
anglers, who will argue that if these fyke nets are permitted 
by law, the fish would fail to reach their spawning grounds in 
the smaller streams, but any one posted on the conditions on 
the streams mentioned, will bear me out in the statement, 
that during the spring rise when the fish are ascending the 
streams mentined, there is so much mud. silt, leaves, and other 
trash in the water, that a stationary net cannot be maintained 
in working order, hence they would offer no obstacle to the 
fish during the reproductive period. 

I the past eighteen months hundreds of requests have been 
for permits to seine out the carp, buffalo, quillbacks, and 
• coarse fish, owing to the wide spread impression that they 
destroying the game fish, a conclusion in which I only parconcur. 
In many cases these requests were made by perwho 
had a sincere desire to endeavor to better the conns 
for the game fish, in other instances it was simply a 
e to obtain a cloak under which to violate the law. After 
en years study of this question on our streams, I have come 
e conclusion that it is not the rapid increase of the german </seg>




            <seg id="p098">
REPORT OF FISH COMMISSION. 

carp, buffalo, quillback, gars, and other coarse fish, but rather 
from the fact that the increase in the number of anglers, has 
resulted in many cases in the depletion of the game fish. While 
our laws have thrown an effective mantle of protection around 
the coarser varieties, especially those of the carp family, thus 
permitting them to increase. If a member of the coming legislature 
was to introduce a bill to absolutely prohibit the killing 
of geese, ducks and other migratory birds, except with clubs 
or sling-shots, just because a nimrod in pursuing them with 
firearms, occasionally killed other game, said legislator would 
probably be characterized as having "bats in his belfry", yet 
a bill of the kind in reference to the birds mentioned, would be 
just as reasonable as our present law in reference to our 
migratory fishes, and it cannot be denied that on the steams 
I have mentioned, the catfish, buffalo, quill-backs and also the 
pike are migratory, and in their annual migrations have to run 
the gauntlet through several states where they are afforded no 
protection whatever. Let it not be understood that I favor 
letting down the bars for the indiscriminate slaughter of even 
our coarse fish, but rather that I am endeavoring to point out 
a way to save what is now practically going to waste. 

I far as fishing in our lakes, ponds, or small streams on 
h there are milldams, I would favor the law be made even 
¦ stringent than at present, and if it becomes necessary to 
; out some of the coarse fish to benefit their game cousins, it 
Id be done under direct supervision of some member of the 
e and Fish Commisison or not at all, but in the streams 
sioned in my judgment, a change in the law somewhat as I 
outlined, I think would result in placing on the market 
sands of pounds of fish each year, that under our present 
is a dead loss to the state. 

A FEW FACTS REGARDING FISH AND FISH EGGS 

Esh are cold blooded animals. The first attempt to hatch 
artifically in the United States was by Dr. Garlick in 
eland, Ohio. The first attempt to batch fish anywhere is 
to have been in the fifteenth century in Prance. 

§1 fish like any other creature become barren. A fish in 
vity becomes barren much earlier than those who have 
freedom. The size of fish dees not depend on its scales. </seg>

            <seg id="p099">
Bfl 


greater size, has scales that are almost microscopic. 

The young of sturgeon are protected with armor, but this 
practically all disappears before maturity. The slime on a tish 
is as necessary to its health as perspiration is to a man. Little 
is known of the diseases that attack mature fish, the fungoid 
ise being the most common. Bathing the diseased fish in 
salt water is beneficial. The eggs of fish are not impregnated 
in the ovaries, but after being deposited by the female. 
Partially incubated eggs can be transported thousands of miles 
when properly packed without injury. Some fishes deposit 
thoir eggs on stones, brush, or acquatic plants, the eggs 
adhering by a glutinous substance that surrounds them, these 
fish build no nests. The body of a fish is in four parts, head, 
trunk, tail and fins. The head of a fish ends at the back of the 
gills, the trunk just back of the vent. The chief propulsive 
power of a fish is not by means of the fins, but by the sinuous 
motions of the body, giving it the motion of a snake. All 
fish do not Dossess the same number of fins, the number depends 
on the species. The chief function of the fins is for 
balancing and steering, the spine-like parts are called rays. 
The names of the principal fins are dorsal, caudal, ainal, and 
pectoral. The mouth is the only organ of attack fish possess, 
other weapons are for defensive purposes only. 

The purpose of gills in fishes is to separate the air used by 
them in breathing, the water is taken through the mouth and 
expelled through the gills, thus if the gills are injured death 
usually follows. The majority offish swallow their food without 
mastication, but some perform this function. It is 
generally believed that the organ of taste in fishes is not ken. 
Some fish of the carnivorous type, even after they have satisfied 
their appetite, go on killing other fishes. Black bass are 
a conspicuous example of this habit. Many fish have a distendable 
gullent and can swallow a tish of their own size. In 
all fish the teeth are shed and renewed during the course of 
their life. 

Some fish require a much larger amount of oxygen to sustain 
life than others. 

Kme kinds of fish build nests and deposit the eggs therin. 
sunfish is a nest builder. Fish that do not build nests 
rfc their eggs as soon as deposited. </seg>

            <seg id="p100">
-: 


The catfish and bass guard their eggs, and the young for 
some time after they are hatched. About one per cent of the 
eggs that are deposited or spawned in the natural way are 
hatched. About 95 per cent of the eggs collected by the artificial 
method produce young fish. It is estimated that if all 
the eggs of fish deposited naturally should hatch and reach 
maturity, the rivers and lakes would be so full of fish they 
could not be navigated. At the spawning time the males of 
some species are pugnacious, and the battles often end fatally. 
Fish eggs swell about one third in size after being deposited 
by the fish. The young fish emerges tail first from the egg, if 
it emerged head first the outer membrane might become 
fastened about the gills causing it to smother. 

Isr a certain period the young fish are called fry and live on 
contents of the sac, the same as a young plant lives on the 
1 leaves the sac is gradually absorbed and disappears. As 
i as the sac is absorbed the young fry begins to feed on 
«ts in the water which nature indicates as food. The fry 
11 game fish are cannibals. Fry of the trout, bass and pike 
* or four weeks old will attack and devour their younger 
weaker companions. Carp in this state require no feeding 
ng the winter months, as they hibernate or sleep from Deber 
to April. 

Carp, crappie, sunfish and catfish spawn during May and 
June. Brook trout spawn in November and December, rainbow 
trout in February and March. Trout thrive best in 
water of an even temperature of 60 degrees Fah. Bass, 
crappie and sunfish eggs L hatch in from seven to nine days 
according to the temperature of the water. Wall eyed pike 
eggs require from fifteen to twenty 'days, trout eggs from six 
to ten weeks, white fish eggs five months. </seg>

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF 

AGRICULTURE 

awl Importation of Birds Under Act of Congress Ap/mtved 
Man ~~&gt;, 1900. 

U. S. Department of Agriculture, 

Office of the Secretary, 

Wcuhington, h. C. July 18, 1900. 

The Act of May 25, 1900, commonly known as the Lacey Act 
(1) places the presrevation, distribution, introduction, and restoration 
of game and other birds under the Department of Agriculture: 
(2) regulates the importation of foreign birds and 
animals, prohibiting absolutely the introduction of certain injurious 
species: and (3) prohibits interstate traffic in birds or 
game killed in violation of State laws. The Act reads as 
follows : 

An Act to enlarge the powers of the Department of Agriculture, prohibit the 
transportation by interstate commerce of game killed in violation 

of local laws, and for other purposes. 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Reiyrexentatives of the 
¦I states of America in Congress assembled. That the duties 
and powers of the Department of Agriculture are hereby enlarged 
so as to include the preservation, distribution, introduction, 
and restoration of game birds and other wild birds. The 
Secretary of Agriculture is hereby authorized to adopt such 
measures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of 
this Act and to purchase such game birds and other wild birds 
as may be required therefor, subject, however, to the laws of 
the various States and Territories. The object and purpose 
of this Act is to aid in the restoration of such birds in those 
parts of the United States adapted thereto where the same 
have become scarce or extinct, and also to regulate the introduction 
of American or foreign birds or animals in localities 
where they have not heretofore existed. </seg>

            <seg id="p128">
111 


Si Secretary of Agriculture shall from time to time collect 
ublisb useful information as to the propagation, uses, and 
rvation of such birds. 

I id the Secretary of Agriculture shall make and publish all 
ful rules and regulations for carrying out the purposes of 
Act, and shall expend for said purposes such sums a s 
lgress may appropriate therefor. 

Ic. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any person or persona 
iport into the United States any foreign wild animal or 
except under special permit from the United States Denent 
of Agriculture : Provided, That nothing in this section 
restrict the importation of natural history specimens for 
sums or scientific collections, or the importation of certain 
birds, such as domesticated canaries, parrots, or such 
r species as the Secretary of Agriculture may designate. 

Ie importation of the mongoose, the so-called "flying 
;" or fruit bats, the English sparrows the starling, or 
other birds or animals as the Secretary of Agriculture 
from time to time declare injurious to the interest of agrire 
or horticulture is hereby prohibited, and such species 
arrival at any of the ports of the United States shall be 
oyed or returned at the expense of the owner. The Secy 
of the Treasury is hereby authorized to make reguqs 
for carrying into effect the provisions of this section. 

Sec. 3. That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons 
to deliver to any common carrier, or for t»ny common carrier to 
transport from one State or Territory to another State or 
Territory, or from the District of Columbia or Alaska to any 
State or Territory, or from any State or Territory to 
the District of Columbia or Alaska, any foreign animals or 
birds the importation of which is prohibited, or the dead 
bodies or parts thereof of any wild animals or birds, where 
such animals or birds have been killed in violation of the laws 
of the State. Territory, or District in which the same were 
killed : Pmrideil, That nothing herein shall prevent the transportation 
of any dead birds or animals killed during the season 
when the same may be lawfully captured, and the export of 
which is not prohibited by law in the State, Territory, or 
District in which the same are killed. </seg>

            <seg id="p129">
112 


Sec. 4. That alJ packages containing such dead animals, 
birds or parts thereof, when shipped by interstate commerce, 
as provided in section one of this Act, shall be plainly and 
clearly marked, so that the name and address of the shipper 
and the nature of the contents may be readily ascertained on 
inspection of the outside of such packages. For each evasion 
or violation of this Act the shipper shall, upon conviction, pay 
a fine of not exceeding two hundred dollars: and the consignee 
knowingly receiving such articles so shipped and transported 
in violation of this Act shall, upon conviction, pay a fine of 
not exceeding two hundred dollars : and the carrier knowingly 
carrying or transporting the same shall, upon conviction, pay 
a fine of not exceeding two hundred dollars. 

Sec. 5. That all dead bodies, or parts thereof, of any foreign 
game animals, or game or song birds, the importation of which 
is prohibitjd, or the dead bodies, or parts thereof, of any wild 
game animals, or game or song birds transported into any 
State or Teritory, or remaining therein for use, consumption, 
sale, or storage therein, shall upon arrival in such State or 
Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of 
such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police 
powers, to the same extent and the same manner as though 
such animals and birds had been produced in such State or 
Territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being 
introduced therein in original packages or otherwise. 
This Act shall not prevent the importation or transportation, 
or sale of birds or bird plumage manufactured from the feathers 
of barnyard fowl. 

Approved, May 25, 1900. 

The object of placing this work in charge of an Executive 
Department of the Federal Government was merely to supplement 
and not to hamper or replace the work hitherto done Dy 
State commissions and organizations: in other words, to coordinate 
and direct individual efforts, and thus insure more uniform 
and more satisfactory results than could otherwise be 
obtained. Greater uniformity in State legislation and better 
enforcement of existing laws can be secured only by the most 
complete cooperation between the various forces now at work 
in the cause of bird protection. </seg>

PROPAGATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF GAME BIRDS 

§jir&lt;&gt;risioit for distribution of birds. — The Act authorizes, but 
not provide an appropriation for, the purchase and distrin 
of birds. The Department of Agriculture, therefore, 
o quail, pheasants, or other game birds for distribution. 

The Departmnet issues no permits for shipping birds from 
-•¦iitr to (mother. In some States, as in California, the Board 
of Fish and Game Commissioners is authorized to issue permits 
for shipping birds for propagating purposes, and a few States, 
such as Michigan and New Jersey, make exceptions in their 
game laws in the case of birds captured for breeding purposes : 
but when a State forbids the exportation of birds without exception, 
interstate commerce in birds from that State is in 
violation of the Lacey Act, whether the birds are captured 
during open seasons or whether they are intended for propagation 
or not. 

IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN ANIMALS AND BIRDS 

Persons contemplating the importation of live animals or 
birds from abroad must obtain a special permit from the Secretary 
of Agriculture, as required by sections 2 of the Act. 
The law is mandatory and makes no exceptions besides those 
noted"below. It applies to single mammals, birds, or reptiles, 
kept in cages as pets, as well as to large consignments intended 
for propagation in captivity or otherwise. But in order to 
aviod unnecessary' hardship and annoyance the list of species 
which may be admitted without permits will be extended at an 
early date. 

Ij)])iir(itii)ii far permits. — Importers are advised to make apation 
for permits in advance, in order to avoid annoyance 
delay when shipments reach the custom-house. Applion 
blanks may be obtained from the Department. Requests 
permits may be made in the following form : 


To the Secretary of Agriculture, 

Washington, D. C. 

Sir. I respectfully request that a permit Be issued for the importation of 

which will probably arrive at the port of. 

from on or about 190. ., 

destined for These animals or birds will be 

[state whether the animals or birds are to be liberated or kept in captivity. 

«p#] vhptHpr i m iiortt^fi f &lt; &gt;r iiroim^Ation t*xhitntion or o t ri t* r nurnoAMl 
Very respectfully, </seg>

            <seg id="p131">
114 


E&gt;plications may also be made by telegraph, in which case 
message should contain (1) the number and species of 
i and animals for which a permit is desired, (2) the port of 
r, (3) the country from which imported, and (4) the owner's 

IwpMoM. — Permits are not required for domesticated birds 
as chickens, ducks, geese, euinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, 
naries: for parrots (including cockatoos, lovebirds, macand 
parrakeets) ; or for natural history specimens for 
urns or scientific collections. Permits must be obtained 
11 wild spejies of pigeons and ducks, and when domestias 
well as wild birds are included in the same shipment 
e spceies should be mentioned in the letter of application, 
der to avoid any misunderstanding as to the term 
lesticated." 

ILiuiiumts. — In the case of ruminants (including deer, elk, 
ise, antelopes, and also camels and llamas), permits will be 
ed, as heretofore, in the form prescribed for importation 
omesticated animals. Such animals will be subject to in:tion 
and quarantine, as required under Order No. 50 of the 
eau of Animal Industry, dated December 28, 1899, entitled 
igulations for the inspection and quarantine of horses, neat 
le, sheep, and other ruminants, and swine imported into 
United States." 

• ota jirohioited. — The introduction of the English or European 
house sparrow, the starling, the fruit bat or flying fox, 
and the mongoose, known also as the ichneumon or Pharaoh's 
rat, is absolutely prohibited, and permits for their importation 
will not b° issued under any circumstances. Importers are 
cautioned against placing any of these species in cages with 
other birds or animals. Such action will render the shipment 
liable to detention at the custom-house, as the species named 
must be exported or destroyed at the expense of the owner or 
agent. 

irinitx. — Permits will be issued free of charge upon receipt 
approval of applications. They will be made out in dupli, 
one copy to be attached to the bill of lading, and the 
r forwarded by mail or delivered to the collector of customs 
le port of entry for use in case the original is lost. Perwill 
be made out in the name of the owner or agent, will </seg>

Esepted only at the port and for the shipment named thered 
will be void 30 days after the date set for the arrival of 
lipment at the port of entry. 

Cui&lt;toiii&gt;i regulations. — Under the regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under date of June 28, 1900 (Department 
Circular No. 101, Division of Customs), persons who have 
not already secured permits will be allowed 10 days in which 
to secure them after the arrival of the shipment at the port of 
entry. In such cases an examination will be made at once: 
duties, if any, estimated and deposited : and a stipulation filed 
with the collector within 24 hours after arrival to produce the 
necessary permit within 10 days. Upon tiling a voluntary 
bond with approved sureties in double the invoice value (but 
not less than $10), the importer may secure the delivery of the 
property upon condition that, in the event of failure to secure 
the necesary permit, it shall be redelivered to the collector 
within 10 days after date of entry. Property remaining in the 
custody of the officers of customs pending issue of the permit 
will be retained wholly at the expense of the importer. 

In case of doubt as to whether animals or birds belong to 
prohibited species, or snspicion on the part of the collector 
that such species are being entered under other names, the 
shipment will be held at the risk and expense of the importer 
pending the receipt of special instructions from the Department 
of Agriculture, or until examined at the expense of the 
importer by a special inspector designated by the Secretary 
of Agrculture and the identity established to the satisfaction 
of the collector. 

rh,i imtpetiori. — For the convenience of importers special 
inspectors will be designated at the ports of New York, Boston, 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, and 
San Francisco, who will examine shipments at the request of 
the owner or agent or who may be consulted in case of misunderstanding 
between owner and officers of the customs. The 
inspector will be entitled to a fee for such service (in ordinary 
cases not exceeding $5 for each shipment), which shall be 
paid by the importer before delivery of the property. These 
inspectors are designated merely for the convenience of importers, 
and owners or agents are under no obliagtions to employ 
them. But the identity of species must be established to </seg>

            <seg id="p133">
116 


the satisfaction of collectors and in case of refusal or neglect 
on the part of the owner or agent, or failure to obtain the 
permit within the specified time, delivery of the property will 
be refused and immediate exportation required. As representatives 
of this Department, special inspectors will be authorized 
to settle all questions involving the identity of species, as to 
whether permits are necessary, or whether species are prohibited 
from introduction: and their decisions shall be ac¦d 
as final by officers of the customs. 

TRANSPORTATION OF PROHIBITED SPECIES 

Attention is called to the clause in section 3 which makes it 
unlawful for any person or persons to deliver to any common 
carrier or for any common carrier to transport any foreign 
animals or birds the importation of which is prohibited by section 
2. Of the species prohibited, the mongoose and flying fox 
have not yet gained a foothold in the United States. The 
Euroean starling (Htvmui vulgaria) has been introduced at 
several points and is now present in the lower Hudson River 
Valley, N. Y. : at Pittsburg, Pa. : and at Portland, Oreg. The 
English sparrow (Amer domtetticm) has spread to most of the 
¦sand Territories, but is present at comparatively few 
points in Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, 
and Wyoming, and apparently has not yet reached Arizona or 
tda. The deliberate shipment of starlings or English 
rows from one State to another is now a violation of law 
and renders the shipper and carrier liable to the penalties 
provided in section 4. It may be possible, therefore, to prevent 
the spread of the English sparrow to States where the 
bird is now absent, while those States in which it has gained 
only a slight toothold have an opportunity to rid themselves 
of the pest by adopting vigorous measures for the destruction 
of the few sparrows within their limits. 

INTERSTATE TRAFFIC IN ANIMALS OR BIRDS KILLED OR 

SHIPPED IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAWS 

Iie attention of sportsmen, commission merchants, shippers, 
express agents is especially called to sections 3, 4, and o, 
:h make it unlawful to ship from one State to another 
lals or birds which have been killed or captured in violation 
ocal laws, and which require all packages containing 
ials or birds to be plainly marked so that the name and 
'ess of the shipper and the nature of the contents may be </seg>

            <seg id="p134">
117 


Irtained by inspection of the outside of such packages, 
imon carriers are cautioned to notify their agents to insist 
all packages supposed to contain game or other animals 
irds must be marked with the shipper's name and the cons. 
Shipment in any form that'tends to conceal or obscure 
nature of the contents or the shipper's name and address 
lainly an evasion of the Act, and the penalty applies to 
dons as well as to violations of the law. The Act also prots 
interstate commerce in game, though killed in open 
ions, if the law of the State in which such game is killed 
ribits its export. 

In referring to these sections, the House Committee on Interstate 
Commerce reported as follows: "The killing or carryinp 
of game within the limits of a State is a matter wholly 
within the jurisdiction of the State, but when the fruits of the 
violation of State law are carried beyond the State, the nation 
alone has the power to forbid the transit and to punish those 
engaged in the traffic. This bill will give the game wardens 
the very power that they now lack and which will be the most 
effective to the purpose of breaking up this commerce. • • * 
In some of the States the sale of certain game is forbidden at 
all seasons without regard to the place where the same was 
killed. The purpose of these laws is to prevent the sale of 
game shipped into the State from being used as a cloak for the 
sale of game killed within the State in violation of local laws.'' 
Section 5 of the Act is intended to meet this difficulty by subjecting 
imported animals, birds, game, whether introduced in 
original packages or otherwise, to the laws of the State in 
which imported. 

PRESERVATION AND IMPORTATION OF BIRDS IN CHARGE OF 
THE BIOLOGICAL SURVEY 

The Division of Biological Survey is hereby placed in charge 
of all matters relating to the preservation and importation of 
animals or birds under this Act, and until further notice the 
stant Chief of that Division will have immediate charge of 
the issue of permits for the importation of animals and birds 
from foreign countries. All inquiries regarding bird protection 
and all requests for publications on the uses or preservation of 
birds should _be addressed to the Chief of the Biological 
Survey. James Wilson, Secretary. </seg>
