            <seg id="p009">THE FOREWORD. Education promotes material prosperity. It quickens the moral and intellectual life of the people and it leads to higher ideals of liv - ing. Nebraska has taken this view of education from the earliest days to the present time. Our people have never lost sight of the value of the public schools in laying the foundation for and in de - veloping a great commonwealth. Hence, while the hostile Indians were being driven back, while the raw prairies were being broken up and being put into a state of cultivation, and while the onslaught of grasshoppers in the summer and the ravages of the coyotes in the winter were being contended with, this ideal of a free education was the beacon light to the early pioneers of this state, enabling them to pee a future citizenship not only rich and powerful, but enlightened, high minded and true hearted. These early settlers laid the foundations. They fought the first and hardest battles. But their sons and daughters, who two or more decades ago took their places in the foremost ranks, retain the same ideals as to education and the same zeal for human betterment and happiness. They attach the same high value to the work of the public schools. Though bountiful harvests and high prices for grain and stock have brought to these citizens of the younger generation immense wealth, they do not forget the beautiful, the good and the true in life, and they continue to believe that the public schools will enhance further and further mental vigor, health, joy, efficiency and all that Eains to social happiness and welfare. There is every indica - that the men of today have inherited the sturdy manhood qual - and the high ideals of their fathers. The early settlers gave Nebraska the lowest per cent of illiteracy. The present generation is striving to give the state the highest degree of educational efficiency. The early settlers provided a common school education for every boy and girl. The present generation is making it possible for every boy and girl to secure in addition a high school and college education. The schools of the pioneers taught boye and girls tread, write, and solve problems. The schools of today are begin - g to prepare young people for whatever vocations and professions y are to enter on leaving school. P Nebraska is full of the kind of enterprise which not only facili - s material prosperity, but which also develops men, just as large ncial and business interests throughout the world know of Nebraska talent along these lines, so the educational institutions and the boards of education throughout the United States rate many who had their training and first experience in Nebraska among the foremost educators of the nation. The men and women who by their teaching and super - vising have raised the efficiency of the rural and other schools many per cent above the average in other states, have grown in proportion </seg>
            <seg id="p010">IV as they have developed their schools. The more I have known of the schools and the teachers in other states, the more honest pride I feel in having been connected with the educational development of Ne - braska during the past twenty-nve years. Such then is the high estimate I place on Nebraska, her institu - tions, including the schools, and her men and women, including teach - ers. It is both an honor and an opportunity to serve as state superin - tendent of public instruction in such a state as Nebraska. It is an honor because of the enterprise, attainment and efficiency of the teach - ing service in all grades of work. It is an opportunity in that it is possible in Nebraska, under present conditions, to actually put into practice in a very short time the best in way of organization and methods known to the educational world. Some state superintendents are limited in their duties, to what is specifically stated in the law. They largely devote their time and attention to gathering statistics and to rendering official opinions. But not so in Nebraska. Here the state superintendent is expected to be a leader and his leadership is recog - nized and appreciated. He is expected to do constructive work of a very positive nature. He is permitted to put into practice any educa - tional theory or plan not specifically prohibited by law. We point with pride to the administrations of State Superintendents W. K. Fowler, J. L. McBrien, and E. C. Bishop, yet there would be little of value in the work done by these men if we were to eliminate that which was not specifically authorized by the statute. In order to do the larger things each of these superintendents found it neet ssary not to ask whether the law authorized the thing to be done, but "does the law prevent my doing it?" Nebraska has excellent school laws so long as that construction is placed upon them, but were superintend - ent and teachers held to the other construction, educational progress would be much slower in the state. My own experience as state superintendent covered only a very short space of time. The pieces of work of that period which I con - sider most important are: (1) The new rules and regulations for certification of teachers, and (2) the amended provision for normal train-Ing in high schools favoring the sparsely settlerl regions of the state. The new set of rules for the certification of teachers was the work of several committees on state certificates, put in definite and final form by Superintendent A. L. Caviness of Fairbury. Chairman of the Compiittee. Fortunately, as I believe, Hon. J. K. Delzell became state superintendent at the time the new rules were put into effect. These rules were far in advance of former regulations in the state and mperior to the rules of any other state. It was a big step to take all ■it once. There was grave danger of friction. Only one man in a hundred could handle the situation as Superintendent Delzell handled it and it could only be done where the educators of the state are in the habit of doing team work. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">V These rules are of such a nature us to require as a minimum in tscholarship for the lowest certificates, essentially four years of high school training, and they require teachers holding any grade of cer - tificate to show growth in the profession by making certain grades each year towards the next higher form of certificate. The six classes of certificates, kindergarten, primary, grammar, high school, super - visor and superintendent, represented another new and striking feature of the regulations. Other states have wanted such certification require - ments, but no other has yet risked going as far as Nebraska went in this one step. It requires a level head, a big heart, and a lot of diplomacy to put into effect rules that will certainly eliminate from the profession in the near future many who are now teaching and rules which many easily see will stand in the iw &lt;f all mediocre talent. Elt is highly complimentary to the state superintendent and also he teachers of Nebraska that this law was put into effect without tion and that the superintendent was re-elected by the largest ority of any of the state officers on his ticket. Eperintendent Delzell is not only gathering up the loose ends tiovements started by his predecessors, but he shows himself to urceful in finding other ways of increasing the efficiency of the schools and of promoting the welfare of the youth of Nebraska. He has the fullest confidence of all the school people of the state and, as we believe, of the citizens of the state. He has a most efficient office force. His heads of departments are educational experts of recognized nbility and experience. The ground work for his administration has been laid. It is certain that these two bienniums will show remarkable progress in school efficiency in Nebraska. This biennial report contains much of value to superintei. and teachers. Let us hope that it will be read and studied and used by them. The reports of Nebraska for each biennium begin - ning with 1900-1902 are used extensively by those giving instruction in state normal schools and teachers' colleges throughout the country. This report will also be extensively used by these institutions. It will also be used widely by city and county superintendents anj by teach - ers of Nebraska in case they know of the amount of useful inforn. and the usable matter it contains for them: JAMES W. (-RARTKKK. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jan. to ()■ </seg>
            <seg id="p012">STATE OF NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION LINCOLN January 9, 1913. In submitting to you the joint report of James W. Crabtree and .lames E. Delzell for the biennium ending January 9, 1913, I desire your most careful consideration of the questions considered herein. Your recommendation to the legislature of the needs of the schools as discussed in these pages will be of great aid in securing legislation that will be of value to the progress of the schools of the state. h During the past biennium, from the rural schools to our state uni - ty, there has been a decided unanimity on the part of each of the ' school interests of this great commonwealth. City certificates. — Superintendent James W. Crabtree inaugurated a special plan of certification which gives the progressive teacher an opportunity to keep moving forward and to become a power for good in the schools of the state. The law governing city certificates and the rules and regulations under which the law was to become operative were submitted to many of the leading school men of the state before adoption. As it now stands, it is said to be one of the most workable certification plans yet devised. The state committee on city certificate* will revise the rules and regulations as the progressive spirit of the teaching force demands. Assistant State Superintendent Anna V. Day submits elsewhere in this report a special statement on city certifica - tion of much value to teachers in city schools organized under sub - division 14 of the school laws. L Normal training. — Normal training in 150 high schools of the te has proven one of the most popular educational movements of the state. No one law enacted by any legislature has done so much to prepare a trained teaching force for our country schools. We sub - mit the report of Inspector G. A. Gregory and Normal Training Bulletin No. 6, which explain in detail the working of the law, the plans of pro - cedure, and outlines for the presentation of the various normal training subjects. State aid for weak districts. — The appropriation for state aid to weak districts has done much to alleviate the crying demand for longer terms of school in the weak districts. In another place we submit a report by Assistant State Superintendent Anna V. Day on the rural schools and her visits in tbe western part of the state. We also sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p013">VII mit reports by Examiner Penney, Superintendent Caviness, Dr. Clark, and Deputy Delzell to Superintendent Crabtree on conditions existing in western Nebraska. The present law seeks to enable these weak rural districts to hold at least five months of school, but it should be amended so as to provide at least seven months. Rural schools. — The rural schools are as well supervised as can be done under present conditions. The county superintendents have been diligent and earnest in their efforts to make the schools under their supervision as efficient as possible. The majority of the county super - intendents are handicapped because no office help is furnished. It seems that when a county pays a large salary for an efficient supervisor, such person's time should not be spent in an office, looking after clerical work which could be as well cared for by a competent assistant at one-half the salary. I Commissioner of Education Philander P. Claxton and his depart - recommend county organization as doing the most practical work y system for the management of schools in the United States, makes a unit large enough to secure a more equitable distribu - if school funds, and thereby forms a partial solution of the rural I problem. Course of study. — I urge a revision of the course of study so that a more practical outline may be given. The present course requires too great a quantity of work to be completed in the eight grades at the ex - pense of quality. The plan of Superintendent Alderman of Oregon for giving school credit for home work should be used by all teachers. It will insure co-operation on the part of parents and school. This plan for giving school credit for home work will be discussed more fully under special reports. Eonsolidation of schools. — The completion of the eighth grade at the age of twelve or thirteen leads the parent to hesitate as it to do for the future education of the child. Children between ;es of twelve and fifteen should be under the supervision of the and mother as much as possible. ■If die county plan of organization were to become a law, the ques - of consolidation of schools and the rural high school would be to answer. S Approval of schools under the free high school law. — The small schools approved for collecting tuition under the free high school are rapidly moving to the front. Deputy State Superintendent irt I. Elliott, who has had direct charge of this work, submits a rt of these schools, with recommendations for improvement. Foreign language. — In case the parents or guardians of twenty - flve or more pupils (or fifty pupils in city districts) shall sign a peti - tion asking that a modern foreign language be taught in the public </seg>
            <seg id="p014">VIII Eool, the wishes of such patrons should be acceded to by arranging ! period per day for the study of the modern foreign language pe - oned for. F Junior normal schools. — The junior normal schools have been -eat help to the state in preparing teachers for the rural schools, suggest a careful consideration of this department of summer school work, which has been the means of so much earnest advance - ment among the young men and women of the state. The state nor - mals and private summer schools have been overcrowded for the past few years, and by abandoning all the junior normal schools there would be a larger attendance than could be cared for by the state and private schools. Hence, 1 would recommend a liberal appropriation for those tior normals that are still needed to carry on summer schools for preparation of rural school teachers. County certificates. — The law and regulations governing county certificates are satisfactory in the extreme. The report given else - where by Deputy Superintendent Elliott will be of interest to all con - cerned. Eneral life certificates. — A report of the general life certificates by this department during the past biennium is made by the •y, Jennie B. Adams. Kucation directory. — A brief history of the education directory by Miss Adams, who has compiled the same for several years. Eree text book law. — The free text book law continues to meet with among Nebraska school patrons, pupils, and teachers. It is ered one of the best free text book laws in the country. We le law in full in the body of this report. Resolutions of state teachers' association. — We are pleased to endorse the resolutions adopted at the 1912 session of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association, including, in addition to items already mentioned, legislation looking toward the proper censorship' of the moving picture show, changes in the school law which will remove the offices of county and state superintendent from politics, and state aid for standard rural schools. Report*. — The reports of the several heads of departments will give a brief resume of the workings of the state superintendent's office and the needs for the further development of the schools of the state. Reports of county and city superintendents will be of much interest to all concerned. Some special reports will also be found of interest and value. Letters and reports of Superintendent J. W. Crabtree will </seg>
            <seg id="p015">IX NEW AND REVISED LEGISLATION NEEDED 1. School library law. — A workable school library law is needed. — one that will give the county superintendent power to supervise the •election, purchase, and payment for school library books. 2. Rural school inspector.- — Provision should be made for a rural school inspector, who shall advise with and assist county superintend - ents in their supervision of the rural schools. 3. Sanitary school buildings. — A law should be passed governing the construction of school buildings, so that the plans and specifications shall insure proper heating, lighting, and ventilation, and the erection of buildings beautiful in design as well as properly built. 4. County superintendent's office help and traveling expenses. — The county superintendent should be allowed office help and traveling expenses so that his entire time may be devoted to the upbuilding of the schools in his county. LI, Consolidation of rural sihools. — The law governing the con - lidating of rural schools should be amended so that transportation is compulsory, or school privileges furnished so that no pupil in the grades is compelled to walk more than two and one-half miles. 6. Maximum tax levy. — The law should be amended to permit a. maximum levy of thirty-five mills. 7. State aid for weak districts. — The law governing state aid should be amended so as to provide for a term of seven months of school each year. 8. Free high school attendance law. — Pupils residing in districts, receiving state aid and in other districts unable to hold nine months of school should be entitled to attend high school under the provisions of the free high school law. This will fulfill the spirit of the law in. guaranteeing to each child the right to a chance of a university educa - tion. 9. S&lt;h(Mils in sparsely settled districts. — School districts in the sparsely settled portions of the state should be placed in the hands of the county superintendent, county clerk, and state superintendent, and power given them to adjudicate all cases, so that no child will be deprived of a chance for a common school education. 10. Districts more than four miles square. — In districts more than four miles square, where pupils are compelled to walk more than two and one-half miles to school, a minimum traveling fee should be granted to bring them within the two and one-half mile limit. The county superintendent and state superintendent (or representative iroin nis ohilc hhuuiu huj c mi "8 luiii &lt;ii </seg>
            <seg id="p016">X 11. Teacher's minimum age limit. — After July 1, 1914, no one under the age of seventeen should be granted a certificate to teach in the schools of the state of Nebraska. 12. Teacher's minimum requirements. — After July 1, 1915, no certificate should be granted to any one to teach in any of the schools of Nebraska who has not completed the equivalent of a tenth grade course of study and who has not bad at least the equivalent of the normal training work as given in our tenth grade high schools. 13. Compensation for attendance at institute and county asso - ciations. — Teachers who attend the county institute and the county associations and do the prescribed reading circle work should be al - lowed an extra week's salary by the district in which she teaches five Lmore months during any one school year. Schools get as much efit as the teacher for the time spent in such special preparation. P14. Compulsory education. — The compulsory education law uld be amended in such manner as to insure every child between the ages of seven and sixteen years, who has not completed the work tthe eighth grade, at least seven months of school during the year, if it amount of school is held within the district of his residence. E Music. — Legislation in regard to the teaching of music in all oolB of the state is needed. After July 1, 1915, all teachers be required to pass an examination in the rudiments of music. R&gt;. District bonds. — The regulations in regard to district bonds be modified so that districts financially able may be permitted &gt; bonds sufficient to build adequate school buildings. 17. More equitable distribution of corporation taxes. — The rural communities that do not have the benefit of "corporations" are de - prived of the benefit of a subsidy that is given more fortunate dis - tricts. We advise the general taxation of corporations and an equit - able distribution of the funds derived. The whole state makes these corporations possible, hence all should reap the benefit. 18. School credit for home work. — Every school curriculum should include a plan for giving school credit for home work. C19. Playground legislation. — Laws should be enacted regulating ygrounds and playground supervision. ■ 20. Subsidies* — Agriculture, domestic science, manual train - lormal training, and weak district subsidies should be given more ordinary consideration. Respectfully submitted, JAMES E. DELZELL Superintendent of Public Instruction. </seg>

ALDRICH Ermit me to thank you most sincerely for the honor which you istowed on me in appointing me to the office of state superin- Ba assuming the duties of this office it is my purpose to continue jlicies of my predecessor, Superintendent J. W. Crabtree, .who &gt;ne so much to raise the standard of education in our state and &gt;. As is well known he has contributed remarkable service to this by assisting in placing the state normal schools on such a high basis, in unifying the colleges of the state, in inspiring the boys and girls of the high schools to seek a higher education, in encouraging the rural schools to put forth a greater effort to do more efficient work, in bringing the parochial and private schools into the highest degree of usefulness, and in establishing harmony among all the above tchools and the great State University. There will be no change in the personnel of the office force, nor in the "Board of Examiners for State and Life Certificates" and "Board of Inspectors for Normal Schools and Colleges." The above ar - rangement will insure the continued progressive policies of Superin - tendents Jackson, Fowler, McBrien. Bishop, and Crabtree. The city schools of the state are thoroughly supervised by com - petent men and women, and it is the duty of the inspectors to encour - age the good work and bring these schools into closer relation to each other. ETown and village schools are constantly changing superintendents principals; hence, the inspection of these schools, in connection i the inspection of the county superintendent, will be for increas - the efficiency of the teaching force and to assist in so arranging work of the schools that but a minimum loss will result on account he changes. With the hearty co-operation of county superintendents I hope to he able to arouse an added interest in the rural schools of the state. Already several counties have reported the erection of modern rural school buildings that are up to date in regard to heating, lighting, and ventilation. Continued effort along this line will soon place the state of Nebraska to the front with the up to date rural school buildings, as she now stands out prominently on account of the many excellent high schools. E Rural schools of the western part of the state will be given due sideration. An earnest effort will be put forth to make the schools the sparsely settled districts approach the efficiency of those in more densely populated parts. The united efforts of the edu - &gt;rs and statesmen of Nebraska will place a high school education bin the reach of each boy and girl in the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">2 The "Free High School Law" as it now stands has done much to enable iniany boys and girls to secure a free high school education. We hope to see some amendment passed to overcome the few objec - tions to the present law and thus give each boy and girl an opportunity to secure a free education from the kindergarten through the I'niver - •Uy. tThe progress made in manual training, domestic science, and other ustrial work has been most gratifying and I trust that thoughtful sideration will continue to be given to these progressive move- The '•Normal Training" classes fn the high schools have done more to raise the standard of the rural schools than any other educa - tional movement in the past quarter of a century. The last legisla - ture was w.ise in its appropriations for school purposes and no part of the funds for education will be productive of more pronounced results than the part providing for normal training in the smaller high schools in western counties and in the sparsely settled regions. The county and city institutes of the past have been for more or less preparation in academic work, two and three weeks being used for that purpose. Of recent years the teaching force has been recruited from the graduates of four year normal training high schools, normal schools, colleges, and universities so that it becomes expedient, econom - ically and professionally, to hold the institute session for one week, that time to be spent on professional and inspirational work. There is a tendency towards a three day session for city institutes to be used wholly in professional and inspirational pursuits and to give the city superintendent an opportunity to organize his work for the year with his teachers. We are in hearty sympathy with the movement. Teach - ers who attend this institute should be paid for their time the same ac for regular school work. This will place the teacher on a little longer pay roll, but the school district will be amply remunerated by better and more systematic work. The Reading Circle Board has selected an excellent course for country and city teachers. We hope each teacher will co-operate with the county super'ntendent in doing this professional work. It has been the aim of the board to encourage reading circle work by allow - ing a certain percentage to be added to certificate grades in the sub - jects completed. A "progressive" teacher keeps in touch with the best plans and methods, and for this excellent spirit the county superin - tendents feel justified in granting this credit. The "Rural High School" and "Consolidation" movement should be encouraged for the benefit of the boys and girls in the country. A "Rural Social Center" may be developed in this way by having a home interest for the boys and girls which will keep them frotn be - coming dissatisfied with their surroundings. The "Rural Life Com - mission" is endeavoring to help make rural life more pleasant and </seg>

We trust the combined efforts of all interests will bring results as will justify the earnest work now being done along The new certification law as prepared by Superintendent Crabtree and the rules and regulations as formulated by him and his commit - tee are being put in force in such way that no harm will come to any progressive teacher. It will be some time before the workings of this law and the new rules will be fully understood. In the meantime we anticipate the hearty co-operation of all who are interested in the wel - fare of the boys and girls of Nebraska. I trust each educator will study the law and rules carefully in their entire scope so that they may see Superintendent Crabtree's wisdom in the inauguration of one of the greatest movements for a well trained progressive teaching force that has been thought out and established in any state in the Union. E appreciate the courteous treatment I have received as deputy superintendent in all parts of the state and look forward to a Peasant administration during the remainder of Superintendent •ee's term.

            <seg id="p030">5 STATE OF NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OFPUBLIC INSTRUCTION LINCOLN March 1, 1912 To School Officers: Khe future life of our nation depends on the character of the boys rls of today, and more depends on the home life and school life ding this character than mast people are ready to admit. During the past forty-five years we have been building up •' creat state, financially. All this time we have done much to increase the efficiency of our schools through the building up of a great high school system, the establishment of four state normal schools, and one great state university. These are the pride of our citizens and the wonder of neighboring states that are patterning after us. Great praise is due the men and women who have thus accomplished so much. In establishing these schools the rural schools have not been forgotten, but they have not progressed so rapidly. The course of study for the elementary schools has been the means of making a graded system for our rural schools second to none in the I'nited States. All this has been secured through the activities of the teachers and school officers who have so earnestly devoted a portion of their live* to the great work of laying a foundation for one of the greatest educa - tional structures on the face of the earth. In visiting the country schools in different parts of the state I find excellent work being done, r great improvement in the preparation of the teaching force, in the equipment of the schools, and in the general sanitary conditions. Ce old-fashioned schoolhouse in many parts of the state 'en replaced by a commodious modern building, well d, well ventilated, heated and lighted, and set in grounds beautified with appropriate trees and shrubbery, with suf - ficient space devoted to playground purposes. This improvement may become more general by a united effort on the part of the teachers, school officers, county superintendents and state superintendent, each doing his part to raise the efficiency of our schools. There is another interest that is needed to accomplish the greatest good and that is the hearty co-operation of the patrons of the schools. In calling your attention to the above items, members of school boards, I am in hopes that you will be active during this spring and summer, up until the time of the annual meeting, in arousing public sentiment to such an extent that all the patrons of the school will be Kesent to urge a school for the coming school year that will be spoken as an "ideal school." We do not wish a revolution of the schools, but we do desire better </seg>
            <seg id="p031">6 The course of study is good — probably as good as has been pub - lished, but it is not yet well balanced. One-fourth of the time that is spent in the school should be devoted to the vocational side of life, so that all boys and girls could do a few things so well that they would be spoken of as boys and girls who could make a mark in the world in that particular line. The summer I was twelve years old I cultivated u ten-acre field of corn so thoroughly with an old "double shovel" plow and one horse, that my father told the neighbors that not a single weed could be found in the field. For seventeen summers after that it was my chief delight to have a clean field of corn. This became a part of my life. So, each pupil who learns to do some one thing exceptionally well will find in it deep satisfaction and an added incen - tive to greater effort. School officers, feel free to advise with your county superintendent in regard to the needs of your district, attend the School Board Asso - ciations of your county, and become well informed in regard to the most progressive schools in your county. Co-operate with your county superintendent in urging your teacher to attend some one of the many excellent summer schools in the state. The teacher who is pro- Five and up-to-date keeps in touch with all facilities for continued continual improvement. See that your teacher devotes thirty minutes each school month to the instruction of pupils in the subject of fire dangers, and in the methods of fire prevention. This she must do in order to comply with the law. She should also drill her pupils in the salute to the flag, to be given on the first Monday in each school month and on all flag days. Through the courtesy of the G. A. R. and W. R. C, instructions for the flag salute have been placed in the hands of every teacher in the state. The subject of school hygiene and sanitation deserves special attention at the hands of every teacher and school officer, for good health is necessary to the right development of our children. Just now in nearly every country school one or more pupils are preparing for the eighth grade examinations, looking forward to entering an approved high school next fall under the provisions of the free high school law. Lend such pupils your interest and support. By your hearty co-operation in these and other school matters you will be an active factor in making your school stand out prominently in the state. For any information that you cannot secure from your county superintendent directly, please feel free to write the state depart - ment, and we will be pleased to assist in every way possible. On points of law, always consult your county superintendents first as they are near at hand and are well informed as to your needs, and are anxious to assist you in making your schools first-class. Yours for the best possible school for our boys and girls, JAS. E. DELZELL. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">•SCHOOL, HOUSES. A pretty good schoolhouee could be built for $500 in the good old times. In early Nebraska days we could beat that, using sod instead of lumber. But for $500 we could build four walls, insert six win - dows with ten by twelve inch panes, shingle and floor with six inch boards. There might even be enough left to pay for a $15 soft coal tand paint and plaster for a blackboard. These buildings had ecial advantage that any time they were not wanted for school es they made very fair barns, as barns went in those days. Then with what surprise does on old timer view the picture of a "model rural school building" adorning a pamphlet distributed from the office of the state superintendent of schools. The thing isn't square or even rectangular. It looks more like a Carnegie library than a schoolhouse. There are fancy cornices and a diversified roof and cement walks and sash-sized window panes. An air of style pervades the place. From the looks of the chimney we judge the place is furnace heated. If abandoned as a schoolhouse one could be satisfied to move in and make a home of it. Tramps used to sleep in the old school houses. This one is so suggestive of bathtubs no tramp would approach it. A scholar would almost hate to write his name on the wall or throw mud balls at the door. It costs from $950 to $1,500. SiVe write this not by way of complaint, but merely as a matter its. Intelligent governments endeavor to make their public build - architectural models in the hope of thus stimulating improve - of the general character of the community's private buildings. That has been not the least of the services of the Carnegie libraries. One can imagine that the local schoolhouse might have a similar nae. It is possible to believe that children will grow better, mentally and spiritually, in a handsome school house than in a barnlike school - house. At any rate, there ought to be no objection when a school district makes the experiment. The school house by the road has so long been "a ragged beggar sunning" that it shocks the memory to see a tailor made building in its place. But we had to give up the old oaken bucket and its germs. We shall have to be resigned to this other change. — The Nebraska State Journal, October 7, 1912. *This extract from the State Journal refers to the bulletin which JAMES E DELZELL. </seg>

            <seg id="p035">10 STATE OF NEBRASKA DKPARTMKXT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION UMOOLJf JAMES E. DEI-ZELL, State Superintendent. To Members of School Boards and Teachers: tThe state department of public instruction has commenced an active paign for the betterment of the rural schools. County superintend - ents are lending their hearty support, but we must rely on members of school boards and teachers for assistance in carrying out our plans. Much good can be accomplished by the hearty co-operation of all who Ei vitally interested. To this end needed changes should be reported the state superintendent or members of his office force. One of the chief needs of our rural schools is more modern school buildings as to light, heat, ventilation, and general arrangement. We are pleased to give you in this pamphlet some plans and comments on a good practical rural schoolhouee. There are several architect* in Nebraska who have given much time and thought to the development of a suitable set of plans. They will be pleased to correspond with school board members who contemplate the erection of a new building. The school grounds should be fitted up with suitable playground apparatus, and the school board should see that the teacher takes charge, especially during recess and the noon intermission. The trees. shrubbery, and grass plots about the schoolhouses should be the pride »f the whole neighborhood. Eispector G. A. Gregory has been canvassing the situation of the town schools in the western part of the state for the purpose of shing a normal training high school in each county in which no grade accredited high school is located. This will give a better 1 teaching force for the rural schools in that part of the state. F Deputy State Superintendent Robert I. Elliott is giving much atten - :o the approval of the non-accredited high schools and will co-oper - with the county superintendents, who are the official inspector* of these schools. The free high school law enables the graduates of eighth Kde schools to complete the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade k in approved and accredited high schools. K Blatant State Superintendent Anna V. Day in her tour of inspec - the rural schools in the Platte valley was much interested in the and progressive work being done in a majority of the schools. One criticism made against our schools is that too much attention is given to quantity of work and too little to quality. Seventh and eighth grade pupils should not be overloaded. A reasonable amount of school work, well done, is of much more value than a "smattering" of many subjects Pupils of these grades may devote some time to study at home, but six hours of mental work in the school room and two </seg>
            <seg id="p036">11 tfce government will not allow an able-bodied man or woman to work more than eight hours, what time should be demanded of the growing boy and girl? The general discussion of the subject. 'The head, the hand and heart should be equally divided" has led many prominent educators to take cognizance of the fact that an education must be a rounding out of all the talents of each pupil so that a fully developed citizen will b« the result, instead of a one-sided character. The school is a community interest and should have the heartiest support of each citizen in the school district. September is the month for opening the majority of the schools of the state. Hence, a few words to remind you that "A stitch in time saves nine." Free the school grounds from weeds and rubbish. Clean the out - bouses and make and keep them sanitary. Paint the schoolhouse; one good coat costs but little. Install the sanitary drinking fountain, or the closed water jar and individual drinking cups. These are absolute necessities to prevent contagious diseases. Provide also a good supply of water, soap, individual towels, or paper towels. These are necessary for a child's self respect. kMow the road to the schoolhouse and give the children a dry Ik to school. An hour's use of the mower may prevent a severe d for some child. t Visit the school occasionally. Nothing will create a greater enthu - am in teacher and pupils for keeping the schoolroom a tidy, san - ry workshop. Make your schoolhouse a neighborhood gathering place and help make country life worth while. The proper use of a schoolhouse as such a social center will bring about a change for the better in the general management and course of study, and increase the efficiency of the school. Let your school give credit for industrial work done in the home. Why is there not as much brain culture in learning to do well all ordi - nary house work at home as if taught as a theory in some school - house? Why should the boy not have credit for industrial work well done at home as well as the boy who gets some merely theoretical idea at school? The parent should be a co-partner with the teacher and pupil. The pupil should be given credit for any home work well done, puch as house work, garden work, barn work, or farm work. Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the fact that work of any kind well don« makes for good citizenship. A trip through Lincoln one afternoon, visiting twenty-one houses where the gardens and backyards were kept by school children,- proved to me the value of any plan which makes the school and home a unit. The school should strengthen the habits of industry started in the home. In this connection I am pleased to give you herewith the "Oregon Plan" as prepared by State Superintend - ent Alderman and printed in the September issue of the Nebraska Teacher. A Pew Suggestions. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">12 SCHOOL CREDIT FOR HOME WORK State Supt. L. R. Alderman. Oregon The idea of giving school credit for home work first occurred to me nine years ago when I was a school principal. I had noticed that one of my rosiest-cheeked, most vigorous appearing girls spent much fine on the street after school. One day Mary's mother was pointed out to me She was a pale, nervous little woman with several children. Know - ing that the family was not very well-to-do I felt myself burning with Indignation at the circumstances that were drawing Mary away from interest in her home. I thought. "What is the use of my teaching that girl algebra and general history, when what she most needs to be taught is that her mother is her best friend and needs her help." At the algebra recitation the next day I announced that the lesson for the following day would consist of ten problems as usual, but that five would be in the book, and five out of the book. The five out of the book would consist for the girls of helping cook supper, helping to do up the kitchen work after supper, preparing breakfast, helping with the dishes and kitchen work after breakfast and putting a bedroom in order. When I asked for "hands up" on all the prob - lems the following day, I noticed that Mary kept her hand raised after the others were down. "What is it?" I asked. "I worked five In advance." she replied with sparkling eyes "I worked five ahead in the book, besides the ten that you gave us." From that time Mary's inter - est in all school work was doubled. She was right up in the first rank. The rest of the year we regularly talked over the girls' home work. School public opinion encouraged the girls so that more and more reported on what they had done in housework and sewing, and felt proud of it. Best of all, our discussions brought the school and the home together. The year was successful for all of us. More par - ents visited the school, and there was a concerted movement for the betterment of school conditions. Although I used the idea at institutes largely during the next four years, my work as county superintendent prevented me from putting it into actual practice at school. In Eugene several years ago I found that the women of the city were enthusiastic in aiding the schools. Thirty-two women gave up Monday afternoon to teaching the girls sewing, while the boys had military drill. As regularly as Monday afternoon came, the girls in each of our thirty-two school rooms would put aside books, and take out thimbles , thread, and needles. The result was a great revival in union of thought and purpose in home and school work. I give here in full an article used by a number of Oregon papers in June, 1910, when I was teaching in the educational department ol the university, as setting forth the conception I had of the home credit plan at that time, and tracing the beginnings of this work in Oregon </seg>
            <seg id="p038">13 School Credit for Home Work. tThat civilization is founded on the home, all will agree. The ool should be a real helper to the home. How can the school help home? How can it help the home establish habits in the children oi systematic performance of home duties, so that they will be efficient and joyful home helpers? One way is for the school to take into account home industrial work and honor it. It is my conviction, baaed upon careful and continuous observation, that the school can greatly increase the interest the child will take in home industrial work by making it a subject of consideration at school. A teacher talked of sewing, and the girls sewed. She talked of ironing, and they wanted to learn to iron neatly. She talked of working with tools, and both girls and boys made bird houses, kites, and other things of inter - est. A school garden was planned in a city, and one of the boys wa» employed to plow the land. Seventy-five children were watching for him to come with the team. At last he came driving around the cor - ner. He could manage a team. He drove into the lot. and a hundred and fifty eyes looked in admiration at the boy who could unhitch from the sled and hitch to the plow, and then as he "man-fashioned" — lines over one shoulder and under one arm — drove the big team around the field, all could feel the children's admiration for the boy who could do something worth while. I have seen a girl who could make good bread or set a table nicely, get the real admiration of her schoolmates. The school can help make better home builders. It can help by - industrial work done in the school, but as that is already receiving con - sideration by the press and in a few schools, I shall not in this article treat of it. The plan I have in mind will cost no money, will take but little school time, and can be put into operation in every part of the state at once. It will create a demand for expert instruction later on. It is to give school credit for industrial work done at home. Then the teacher and the parents will have much in common. Every home has the Euipment for industrial work and has some one who uses it with more less skill. The school has made so many demands on the home that the parents have in some cases felt that all the time of the child must be given to the school. But an important thing that the child needs along with school work is established habits of home making. What one does depends as much upon habit as upon knowledge. The criticism that is most often made upon industrial work at school is that it is so different from the work done at the home that it does not put the child into that sympathetic relation with the home, which after all is for him and the home the most important thing in the world. Juvenile insti - tutions find that they must be careful not to institutionalize the child to the extent that he may not be contented in a real home. In nyr opinion it will be a great thing for the child to want to help his parents </seg>
            <seg id="p039">14 do the task that needs to be done and want to do it in the best possible way. The reason that so many country boys are now the leading men of affairs is because early in life they had the responsibility of hmne trust upon them. I am sure that the motto "Everybody Helps" is a good one. Et one says: "How can it be brought about? How can the jive credit for industrial work done at home?" This may be lished by printed slips asking the home to take account of the work that the child does at home under the instruction of the home, and explaining that credit will be given this work on the school record. These slips must be prepared for children according to age so that the child will not be asked to do too much, for it must be clearly recognized that children must have time for real play. The required tasks must Dot be too arduous, yet they must be real tasks. They must not be tasks that will put extra work on parents except in the matter of instruct! m and observation. They may well call for the care of animals and should Elude garden work for both boys and girls. Credit in school for home ustrial work (with the parents' consent) should count as much as r one study in school. To add interest to the work, exhibitions should be given at stated times so that all may learn from each other and the best be the model for all. The school fairs in Yamhill, Polk, Benton, Lane, Wasco, and Cook counties, together with the school and home industrial work done at Eugene, have convinced me most thoroughly that these plans are practicable, and that school work and home work, school play and home play, and love for parents and respect for teachers and fellow- Ecan best be fostered by a more complete co-operation between and home, so that the whole child is taken into account at all Spring Valley School. A. I. O'Reilly, a young man who is just completing his third year at the Spring Valley school, a country district in Polk county, deter - mined last September (1911) to test the plan of giving credit to his pupils for the work they did at home. He went to his directors and secured their promise to give money from the general school funds to be awarded to the pupils earning the most credit in a home-work con - test. He then proceeded to work out his plans, the contest idea in bringing about the result being original with him. The duties for which home credit is offered on Mr. O'Reilly's credit schedule are these: Building fire in the morning, 5 minutes: milking a cow, 5 minutes; cleaning out the barn, 10 minutes; splitting and carrying in wood (12 hours' supply), 10 minutes; turning cream separator, 10 minutes; cleaning horse (each horse), 10 minutes; gath - ering eggs, 10 minutes; feeding chickens, 5 jminutes; feeding pigs, 5 minutes; feeding horse, 5 minutes; feeding cows, 5 minutes; churning </seg>

The conditions and rules of the home credit contest are given here: 1 Xo pupil is obliged to enter the contest. EAny pupil entering is free to quit at any time, but if any one ts without good cause all credits he or she may have earned will be feited. ■ Parent or guardian must send an itemized list (with signature ) to the teacher each morning. This list must contain the of the work each child has done daily. 4. Each day teacher will issue a credit voucher to the pupil. This voucher will state the total number of minutes due the pupil each day for home work. BAt the close of the contest pupils will return vouchers to , the six pupils who have earned the greatest amount of time, vouchers, receiving awards. 6. Contest closes when term of school closes. 7. Once each month the names of the six pupils who are in the lead will be published in the county papers. ■ Ten per cent credit will be added to final examination results pupils (except eighth graders) who enter and continue in the RWhen pupil has credits to the amount of one day earned, by er of the credits and proper application to the teacher he may ted a holiday, providing not more than one holiday be granted 3il each month. 10. Forfeitures — Dropping out of contest without cause, all credits due; unexcused absence, all credits due; unexcused tardiness. 25 per cent off all credits due; less than 90 per cent in deportment for one month, 10 per cent off all credits due. 11. Awards — Three having highest credits, $3 each; three having second highest, $2 each. Awards to be placed in a savings bank to the credit of the pupil winning it. Funds for awards furnished by the school district board out of general fund. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">16 All of Mr. O'Reilly's pupils, thirty-one in number, entered the contest with the vim and eagerness for which children are noted and have faithfully kept up their home work throughout the year. The parents have co-operated by sending in the list of work done by the children at home. Every morning Mr. O'Reilly receives these notes, which are usually written by the children and signed by the parents. Here are a few samples of parents' reports: FLORA MORTENSEN, April 17, 1912— Min.

May - aged 5, is doing: "Maynard brought in his wood twice, to bed swept the kitchen twice, washed his teeth twice, watered the What was being done in the little school in Spring Valley was soon talked of. Early in December, 1911, the Portland papers dis - cussed the novel experiment. Early in January, 1912, the cnunty school superintendents from all over the state assembled at Salem, as is the custom twice each year, to grade examination papers. Superin - tendent H. C. Seymour of Polk county invited all the superintendents to visit the Spring Valley school, and provided carriages for the eight - mile drive. It was a raw, blustry day, but the superintendents were not balked in their resolve to see what was being done at Spring Valley toward solving the problem of "How to bring the home and the school closer together." and "How to make the girls and boys in the country love their homes." I give excerpts from a first-hand impression of this day's visit written for the Oregon City paper by County Superin - tendent T. J. Gary of Clackimas county: "We arrived at the Spring Valley school at 10:30 a. m. and ob - served first a board walk from the road to the school house door and a well drained school yard free from all rubbish such as sticks, pieces of "Upon entering the room we observed that the directors had made provision for the proper heating, lighting and ventilating of the school room. On the walls were three nicely framed pictures. "The Sistine Madonna,' 'The Christ,' and 'The Lions,' all beautiful reproductions of celebrated works of art. The building was a modest one, much like the many school buildings we find through the country, but there was </seg>
            <seg id="p043">18 about it that which said plainer than words can say, 'this is a well ordered school.' "Looking to the right we saw on a partition wall, on the floor, and on the side wall a variety of articles, aprons, dresses, doilies, hand bags, handkerchiefs, kites, traps, bird houses, and various other things made by the boys and girls of the school. E"At the left in the other corner of the room were loaves of bread,' i cakes, tarts, doughnuts and other tempting things prepared by the ; and boys. The writer sampled various edibles, among them a cake sd by Master Zinser, son of our ex-superintendent, J. C. Zinser. I cheerfully say that it was the kind of cake that makes a man want "These things were all of interest to us, but the one thing we were most curious to know about was the system the teacher had of fiving credits for home work, not school work &lt;lone at home, but all kinds of honest work a country girl or boy can find to do. Pupils were given five minutes for milking a cow, five minutes for lighting a fire, five minutes for sleeping in fresh air, five minutes for taking a bath, and so on through the long list of common duties incident to home life and country. The rule of the school is that any pupil who has earned 600 minutes may have a holiday, at the discretion of the teacher. If the pupil asks for a holiday to use for some worthy cause the teacher grants it providing it will not interfere too much with his school work. It is further provided that no pupil may have more than one holiday in twenty days. "Space will not premit my giving a more detailed account of the plan. I trust that enough has been given to show the principle involved. The teacher was subjected to volley after volley of ques - tions from the superintendents, but was able to answer all of them with alacrity. The chairman called upon the parents to give their testimony as to the success of the movement. I can not write here all that was said, but will give two as fair samples of all. "Cne good motherly looking country woman said: 'Before this plan was started I got up in the morning and prepared breakfast for the family, and after breakfast gave time to the preparation of the children for school. Now, when morning comes the girls ins'st upon my lying in bed so that they may get breakfast. After breakfast they wash the dishes, sweep the kitchen, and do many other things as well a0 make their own preparation for school. I think the plan is a success. My only fear is that it will make me lazy.' "One father said: 'I have two boys — one in high school and Jack here. It was as hard work to get the older boy out in the morning as it was to do the chores, and as Jack was too young to be compelled to do the work, I let them both sleep while I did it. Now, when the alarm Bounds, I hear Jack tumbling out of bed, and when I get up I </seg>

Kthis point Superintendent Alderman said: Jack, stand, we see you," and Jack, a bright, manly appearing country boy of , stood blushing, while we looked our appreciation.

But Mr. O'Reilly gives credit for sleeping with the window boards in, for taking baths, caring for the nails, teeth, and hair, and for being in bed by 9 o'clock. The result is that a finer, cleaner, brighter lot of children can not be found in Oregon than in the Spring Valley district. The little girls are justly El of the dresses that they wash and iron themselves, all the chil - arrive at Bchool in perfect order, and they receive credit for attend - » their personal appearance. How does this school credit for home handwork affect the stand - ing of the school? In answer to this query, let me give the conditions that Superintendent Seymour of Polk county established as the stand - ard of his rural schools. Spring Valley was the first school to be stand - ardized. Superintendent Seymour's requirements for standardization include well-drained school grounds, school building properly lighted, heated, and ventilated, school house and grounds neat and attractive, sanitary outbuildings, walks to buildings and outbuildings, individual drinking cups, one standard picture added during the year, thorough work on the part of teacher and pupils, every pupil in the spelling con - test, an average of 95 per cent in attendance. In token of her victory over all the other rural schools of Polk county, Spring Valley has spread cut in the fore part of the schoolroom a large, white square banner bear - ing these words in letters of green and black, the school colore: "Spring Valley was the first to standardize in Polk county, October, 1911." The reports of the school work done by the boys and girls show excellent standings, the natural result of intelligent application. "This contest plan ought to be contagious," said Mr. O'Reilly, "for it is the best thing I have ever tried in the way of getting the children completely in sympathy with both school and home duties. It is not my intention to give full credit for time necessarily spent in home duties. I have explained to the children that it is best to go out into the world expecting, if necessary, to give more than they get. I am planning my forfeitures with the good of the school in view. The plan is an agreement between the pupil and myself. If he fails to live up to his part of it he learns that this failure -works a real hardship upon him. Perhaps I am teaching some practical law here. The plan of :. wards has started them on a commercial future and has resulted in my having to tell them all about savings accounts. The plan is going without a hitch. " </seg>

By means of a series of baffle plates the air is passed over the heating surface, but never coming in contact with the fire, passes out above the heater and exhausts into the room, as indicated by the darts, directly toward and against the cooling surface, which te the windows on the left of the room. The upper part of the receptacle which receives this heater curves outward at the top so as to deflect the warm air into the room. As the air leaves the heater, being pure and warm, it rises to the ceiling and would remain there were it not for the large ventilating flue and vent register at the bottom, which takes off the lower strata of air, allowing the pure warm air to fall equally all over the room. This entirely eliminates all currents and drafts and holds the temperature of the room the same in all parts. To absolutely insure an ascending current of air in the vent flue at all times there is an iron plate set vertically between the heat and vent flue just opposite where the smoke pipe enters. The heat from the smoke pipe heats this iron plate, which in turn heats the air in the vent flue, causing an upward current which pulls the air out of the schoolroom as above men - tioned. PThe apparatus as described and laid out is practically fireproof, much safer than stoves, as there is a double jacket between the and the woodwork at any point, and between these jackets is con - stantly passing a current of air. It would be next to impossible to build a fire intense enough to set the building on fire. While this plant includes all the desirable features of the more elaborate and more ex - pensive plants used in larger buildings, it has the distinct advantage of not being a patented article and can be installed without the payment tany royalties whatever, at the same time being practical and econom - 1. The fuel room is sufficiently large to hold fuel for at least a week, it being assumed that the janitor or person in charge can fill the same at the end of the week and do away with the dust and dirt caused by bringing in fuel from the outside many times during the day. The work room is large and well lighted and heated directly from the school heater, and is separated from the main schoolroom by a rolling partition or sliding door, permitting the same to be thrown inta the main schoolroom when desired. The closet adjacent is designed for the use of the teacher £The building as designed can be built of either frame or masonry, if of frame the only masonry required would be the foundation &gt; and smoke and vent flues. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">24 ■ RELATION' OF THK VNIVKKMITY OF XKBKASKA TO THK SCHOOLS OF THE STATE. By S. Avery, Chancellor of the University of Nebraska. Those Nebraska educators who have spent the greater part of their lives in the state have witnessed its development from the sod - house era to its present condition of comfort and culture. Not less remarkable than the economic and industrial progress of these years has been the development of our educational system. Within forty ▼ears our entire high-school system, outside of one or two cities, has been developed, until now we have over one hundred four-year high schools, and approximately three hundred giving three-year courses. All but one of the denominational colleges, and all but one of the normal schools, have been founded within the same period. Perhaps most remarkable of all has been the development of the state uni - versity, which, beginning as a struggling institution of one or two hun - dred students, has become one of America's great educational institu - tions. Great as the progress of the last forty years has been, however, we are about to witness a still greater educational expansion. We are on the threshold of a new educational era, in which we must continue our predecessors' work in their spirit, but not necessarily placing the chief emphasis where they placed it. And in this newer work it seems to be conceded by people of all shades of opinion that the University shall assume a position of leadership. The public school system of Nebraska, like that of the other states of the American Union, was established for the purpose of placing education within the reach of every citizen. This purpose was meant to apply to the higher grades of education as well as the lower; hence the state universities, agricultural colleges, and other institutions of higher learning established in nearly every state in the Union. In our own state agricultural college and university have very wisely been combined in one institution, which may aptly be termed the apex of the educational pyramid. The university, in order to fulfill its function as part of the state's public school system, must cover the last four grades of the sixteen. In order to do this and at the game time to meet the needs, of higher education, the courses must, as the top is neared, be more numerous and more specialized. The lower grades cover the fundamentals; the high school, which is growing to be more and more the "people's college," must be a school of citizenship, giving a maxi - mum of practical training and culture — a place wherein ideals are acquired and character formed. The university will in future be more and more a place for the training of specialists — the experts who must lead and direct the development of our state. At the same time, as the head of the public school system, it must be a fount of inspiration to </seg>
            <seg id="p050">25 Id this new era of educational expansion, the dominant feature will be the development of agricultural education. In other fields the University and the schools of Nebraska will sustain a relation no less important than is now the case; on the contrary, the I'niversity's duties toward other phases of education will become broader and heav - ier as time goes on. But the University's position as the head of the existing school, system is well established; standards have been set and the relation of higher division to lower worked out. It is only within a comparatively short time, on the other hand, that the existence of this new educational problem has been realized. It engages our attention now, and is dealt with here, simply because it still remains unsolved, and is therefore of more immediate interest than the other phases of the University's duty toward the state's public schools. I Beginning as rather low-grade institutions, in an academic sense. e "land-grant colleges" now offer courses of study which, in both practical and cultural value, compare favorably with those given in the older institutions of the country. Like other colleges in the I'ni - versity, the agricultural college will for a long time to come be a place tthe training of agricultural experts. For this work we have plenty gricultural colleges, and all the educational machinery we need. There may be some justice in the assertion that our American system of education is likely to become topheavy. Certain it is that in some fields there is room for the introduction of a more practical kind of training. The average Nebraska farmer of the future, the man whose business it will be to produce the largest crops at the smallest expenditure of labor and soil-fertility, the man who will manage his land to a very considerable extent with his own labor, must be the product of the agricultural schools. The problem is to devise a plan which will make an efficient farmer and at the same time a well - trained and intelligent citizen out of the man who has neither time nor inclination for college study. The ablest and most careful thinkers on this problem divide into two rather distinct groups, each group favoring a rather distinct type of agricultural school. One would have a number of separate schools supported by the state, and assisted, if possible, by federal subsidies. In general, they agree that pupils should be admitted from the country school and the grades, and that there should be an articulation with the college sufficiently close to allow the graduates to go on and take a college course, if desirable. Schools organized along these lines are found in Arkansas, Georgia, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. They very closely resemble the new school at Curtis, which is to be a strictly secondary school, without having instruction given by college professors. The argument for this type of school is, in brief, that only through state control can a really effective agricultural education be provided for; that in the general high schools agriculture will be taught by those who have no real interest in it, and will soon have as little </seg>
            <seg id="p051">26 vocational value as some of the other sciences now included in the high school curriculum; that the spirit of the high school is likely to be hostile to the farm, rather than favorable to it. Cn the other hand, those who favor agricultural sections in exist - ing high schools argue about as follows: That if the pupil must go out of his home county and among strangers, he might as well go to a central plant, maintained for the whole state, with resulting economy in administration, as to one of a scattered series of agricultural schools. That the separate school will become a class school, and thereby segre - gate the farmer and narrow his horizon. That separate schools would be a source of endless jobbery and log-rolling in the legislature, and that a far better way to develop local pride would be to make the local - fy itself responsible for the success of the agricultural section installed i its own high school. It is said, also, that such separate schools ould be an anomaly in our educational system; that they would injure the agricultural college by aspiring to be colleges: and that the state might be filled with struggling, low-grade institutions, giving cheap degrees, instead of strong schools training efficient, self-reliant farm - ers. On the score of economy, it is urged by such men as Dean Dav- Eort of Illinois, that since the main part of any school curriculum &gt;t be general, it is a waste to duplicate the work in separate schools. This, then, is the situation in Nebraska; On the one hand, we can to on multiplying separate, special agricultural schools. If the resources of the state will permit, we can place one in each county. At an esti - mated cost of 1100,000 for the plant and first building of each school, it would cost the state $10,000,000 to establish such a system, and a biennial expense of 15,000,000 for maintenance could be absorbed with no appearance of extravagance at any one spot. On the other hand, few Chool districts can afford to install efficient agricultural departments lless additional support can be obtained from some source or other. Rot the adoption of a system which will bring agricultural in - on close to the pupil, develop local spirit and responsibility, and the same time financially burden either locality or state, it would seem that our course is rather plain. Let the University maintain its position of educational leadership, as well in the newer movement we are discussing as in the school system already established. Let the state establish an efficient chair of agriculture in each of our four normal schools. Let the new school at Curtis and the central School of Agriculture at Lincoln be developed as models in secondary agri - culture training, and to their courses of study let certain normal train - ing be added, so as to enable the graduates to carry the good work into the rural schools. Then let the next legislature pass a bill grant - ing liberal subsidies to those schools which are actually making a begin - ning in efficient agricultural instruction. Blair, Tecumseh, and Hold - rege have already taken steps in this direction. Valentine's high school </seg>
            <seg id="p052">27 might easily make use of our experiment substation there for demon - stration purposes. The law could be made flexible enough to allow the subsidy going to a city like Omaha to be used in the establishment of trade schools, if the Board of Education of such a city so desired. In other words, the purpose of the plan would be to serve the industrial needs of the people and the state; and as agriculture is by far our moat tportant industry, it would naturally receive a very large proportion the money granted. IVe should of course set standards, such as a suitable tract of competent instructors, and so forth, the maintenance of which be necessary in order to receive state aid. The principal of the rsity School of Agriculture might be made supervisor of agri - al instruction in the subsidized schools, and no high school per - l to draw state money without his certifying to the state superin - it as to the character of its work. This work is of course somewhat apart from the teaching duties of the traditional college or university. But it is a work which the 1'niversity of Nebraska and the schools of the state must co-operate in doing. Probably our state could easily enough support four millions of people on a good American standard of living. If made as - ductive as certain portions of agricultural Europe, it could support eight millions. The time may come when our population will reach one of these figures, and the problem of agricultural efficiency will be one of the most vital ones our people will have to solve. It will be Ke duty of the 1'niversity and the state schools, working together, io d a solution. THK STATE XOKMAL SCHOOL: PAST. PKKSKXT \M» HTl RE. Perhaps one of the largest interests of the state is the education of young people for service in the public schools. It is well known that good teachers are invaluable in training the youth of our land for effective and intelligent citizenship, hence the scheme of public educa - tion for teachers. Nebraska has been favored with a normal school for nearly fifty years, but the normal school idea has had to go through a process of metamorphosis along with the other normal schools of the United states and elsewhere, shifting here and there in courses of study, arrangement of program, methods of instruction, aims and ideals. The normal school idea in America had slow growth. Violent opposition arose from many forces which should have lent co-operation. It is well known that in establishing one school or one department of edu - cation, all educational forces in the state are strengthened. But some - how people have not fully appreciated in education that just competi- l*re*i. A. (). Thomas, Kearney State Normal. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">28 Rthe life of trade, and that the more schools established, the eople there are who will go to school; that the idea of education agious. and that when one young person leaves a community for college life, others become affected by his enthusiasm and a dozen will attend. It is also well known that the majority of students who attend the schools of America are short distance people; that 75 per cent of all fi students in the colleges of our country come from within a radius 75 miles of the institution they attend. This is in a measure true many of our great national universities. The State Normal School at Peru prospered in keeping with the other normal schools of the United States. Its growth was slow; its influence throughout the state did not seem very marked. And yet when we come to figure up the sum total of its interest for the first 4" years of its existence, it has done an enormous work, but the flow of its current was so slow and so steady that it appeared not to make a ripple upon the surface of the educational stream of our generation. However, now it is known that thousands of men and women re&lt; their inspiration from that source. Eight years ago the legislature saw fit to establish a new normal school. It was located at Kearney. The agitation necessary to the passage of the bill; the agitation necessary for the location of the school; the agitation necessary to open and operate the institution gave an impetus to normal school education in Nebraska, and this agitation was going on throughout the United States. New normal schools were being established; the people were understanding the vast importance of such institutions; that if we are to have good teachers we must edu - cate them; we must prepare them by special process for the work they do. The people of our country were not slow in understanding that special education was necessary for the lawyer, the doctor and the preacher. But they seemed to think for many years that if one had the academic knowledge, he was prepared to teach; if he knew the subject he would find a way to teach it. But the advancement of the age would not let such an opinion rest, and the idea of special training for teach - ers was inevitable and bound to come. The first year after the Kearney school was established, Peru had more students than it hai ever had up to that time. The new school did not seem to take one single student from the older institution, nor has it apparently done so in the eight years of its existence. It has crowded forward rapidly. The establishment of schools at Chadron and Wayne did not interfere with Peru or Kearney, but rather added to their attendance and to their efficiency, until at the present time the four state normal schools are influencing thousands. It is remarkable that there should be any opposition to any school in the state. There should be co-operation. The purpose of the normal schools is not to injure the efficiency of our great universities. The </seg>
            <seg id="p054">29 Kearney Club at the University of Nebraska numbers half a hundred strong young men and women who are a credit to the school through which they first come and will be a credit to the I'niversity when they have completed its curriculum. The older institution. Peru, probably has proportionately larger representation. Those who look casually at the work of the normals are not fully conversant with the impetus they are giving to the education of the state. We are inclined to give credit as normal trained teachers only to those who graduate from the higher courses of the normals. Rwish to emphasize the fact that the State Normal Schools of ka are doing more for the rural schools of the state than any of normal schools supported by any other state. We are getting :o the problem; we are studying rural school conditions; we are Ing courses of study and programs especially for these rural school teachers. It is estimated from reliable sources, that the Kearney normal alone sent out on an average, in its 8 years. Too teachers annually into the public schools of the state, with more or less training. About 150 of these have gone into city schools, and about KM have gone back to the rural schools with life and enthusiasm, added knowledge and stronger equipment. This is also true of Peru, and Chadron and Wayne are coming in to such an extent that probably |,M4 teachers go out into the 'schools of the state from these institutions with nor - mal training. This is 25 per cent of the teachers of the state, and counting the average life of the teacher of Nebraska as three years, it does not take very great wisdom or deep learning to determine that the normal schools of Nebraska are vital forces in the educational inter - ests of the state. The University is also assisting largely in the work. Their Teachers' College is doing much to uplift the educational condi - tion. All of the private and denominational schools are adding their weight until Nebraska is now in position to reap bountiful rewards. But all is not yet done that shall be done. The normal schools shall grow stronger: they shall increase and strengthen their programs; they shall increase and strengthen their equipment; they shall receive ad - ditional buildings. They are now taking great care in the selection of those who are to become teachers of the normal schools, requiring higher efficiency and equipment and qualification. Let us put our shoulders to the wheel — the normal schools, the University, the private and denominational colleges — and by our thorough and earnest co-oper - ation, under the direction of the state superintendent, push the schools </seg>
            <seg id="p055">30 THE COUXTY SIPEHIXTEXDEXT'S PLACE IX THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF THE STATE. W. A. Voder, Superintendent Douglas County In the main, our public schools for elementary and secondary edu - cation are rural schools organized under Sub. Ill, town schools organized under Sub. VI, and city schools under Sub. XIV. The county superintendent must take into account all these schools in making up his annual report to the state superintendent, relative to school at - tendance, finances, etc. All of these come in for their share of the state school money as apportioned first by the state superintendent -nd later by the county superintendents. Since county certificates form the basis of academic preparation for city state certificates ami since, under the recent law, city teachers may attend county institutes in lieu of city institutes, county and city superintendents find their "aths crossing frequently and find plenty of opportunity for co-operation and unity of effort. The rural schools form a great majority of the schools of Nebraska. The greater number of these are still one-room schools, although some of them have two or more teachers each. In fact, a few such schools have as many as seven or eight teachers. Most dis - tricts containing more than 150 children of school age and a total population of less than 1,500 are organized under Sub. VI. It is with these two classes of schools that the county superintendent has most to do. The larger of these have their principals or local superintend - ents, some of whom have ample opportunity for supervision, while others must teach full time. At least a portion of the inspection and supervision of these schools must, therefore, rest with the county super - intendent. This inspection includes high school as well as grade work, since the county superintendent is recognized by the state department as inspector of high schools not accredited to the university. In case of the small rural schools, the county superintendent is in effect both principal and superintendent. Because of the large number of rural schools in the average county, because in many cases these are scat - tered over a large area, and because of the numerous other duties of the county superintendent, it must be admitted that the help given to these schools and to the teachers of the same by direct and personal supervision is not always adequate. Those who have studied rural school conditions realize that young, inexperienced teachers are too often thrown entirely upon their own resources in dealing with difficult situations. The generally recognized need of better rural conditions points out plainly many duties that should be performed by the office of the county superintendent. It is probably the awakening to the needs of </seg>

            <seg id="p059">32 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT RURAL SOCIAL CKXTERS. Bft i intende nt James K. Delxell, in Nebraska Farmer, July 17, 191 Our country schools have been organized and managed to lessen the amount of illiteracy in the nation on the theory that an enlightened man has more chance to succeed than an illiterate one. But experience has demonstrated that "book knowledge" alone does not prepare for life work, hence in many places the "technical school" has been estab - lished to prepare our young people for life's work. The little "red school house" on hill or in valley in Nebraska is the seat of learning of pupils between the ages of five and fourteen. The entire time in many of these schools is spent more or less on mem - ory work. There is no special training of the muscles of the body to co-ordinate with brain training. This is not as it should be. If man - ual training, domestic science, penmanship and drawing, with many of the simple agricultural pursuits, were taught, the pupils of the rural schools would become acquainted with some of the duties of life and would thus early form the habit of doing the really important things. To interest pupils in the above subjects, we should have a better prepared teaching force, teachers who are personally in touch with progressive thought along the "newer ideas" of real teaching. Another element is needed, also. Our country school houses should be a cen - tral meeting place for the entire school district. Here parents and children should meet with the teacher, who should be a leader in the organized recreation and social life for the long fall and winter even - ings. R regular short course in agriculture could be outlined, and er seems best for each particular neighborhood could be es - ed. The problem of good roads should be one of the first to interest the entire community, for without good roads the attendance could not be good. The gathering and storing of fall vegetables, fruit and grain could be made a valuable lesson. Then lessons in soil, till - age of soil, conservation of moisture, drainage, etc., could each in turn be made a part of an evening's work. Other evenings could be devoted to the discussion of farm animals. LEach evening should have an entertaining part consisting of the ging of familiar songs and a program by pupils. Once a month the domestic science class could furnish refreshments, which would give £ patrons a demonstration of the progress of that department. The r e are a few suggestions for the real uses which could be made le country school house for a rural social center. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">33 -MKDICAI, INSPECTION'. Superintendent James E. Delzell. The conservation of water, soil, and timber has been one of the themes discussed by the leading statesmen of America for several years. Our educators have been deeply interested in the same subject. Congress has debated measures to carry out the ideas presented. With all the publicity given by law makers, lecturers, newspapers, and maga - zines, but a mere start has been made. However, the outlook for increased interest and extension in this great work is very promising. A more important conservation problem is before America today, and that is the preservation of the health of the children. In my school - room experience of many years as teacher and superintendent, I found but little thought given by parents and teachers to the health of the children. PA start has been made in the right direction. The drinking foun - and individual drinking cup, the paper towel or individual towel, helps in the prevention of the spread of disease. The abolition of the "waving of the germ infected" handkerchief in the chautauqua or honor salute should be brought about. Honor could be bestowed as well by a wave of the hand or a small white flag, or, better still, by a small American flag. PThe sweeping of a schoolroom without oiled brooms, sweeping pound, or an oiled floor, is one of the ways to scatter disease germs, town school floors are mostly swept so as to eliminate the scattering ust. This should be carefully attended to in all schoolrooms. ■hildren sometimes go to school through the rain and are permitted in the room in damp clothes, and the teacher and parent wonder in the world the cold was caught. Bacher and parents should insist on proper care being taken of ldren in regard to heat, light, and ventilation. Medical inspection should be inaugurated for all the schools, both town and rural. We have national inspectors of cattle, horses, sheep and hogs. We have state and national inspectors of foods, and drugs. Why should we not have a medical inspector for preventing disease in our schools? The cost of prevention is cheaper and better than the attention after the disease has taken hold of the child. Medical inspection should be for the general sanitary improvement of the schoolroom and to give advice to pupils in regard to the eyes, ears, teeth, throat, and nose. Too much stress cannot be put on the general care of the health. Several Nebraska towns are profiting by the advice of a physician who inspects their schools. Great care must be taken that the inspect - ing physician be in reality an inspector and not a man to treat the case of discovered disease. A free hand must be left the parent to select a physician to care for the child. This will not take from any one the </seg>

For a number of years the school men of Nebraska have waged an active warfare against the use of tobacco by the boys in the public schools. And this warfare has been emphasized by the attitude taken by these same school men in regard to their personal use of it in any form. They work the theory that example is better than precept. is a noteworthy fact that the great majority of men in eduea - lal work in Nebraska never use tobacco, and especially is this true those engaged in public school work. The absence of clouds of tobacco smoke at the district and state associations is so much the rule that one ceases to comment upon it. But when thirty or forty of the prominent superintendents and principals attend the national educa - tion associations, they form a conspicuous group — conspicuous because of their clean personal habits.

STATE OF NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OF Pl'BLIC INSTRTCTIOX, LINCOLN. November 9, 1911. Dear Superintendent: tThe agitation of the question in regard to the use of tobacco by nors under eighteen years of age has been the means of securing a te law which will tend at least to lessen the use of tobacco. The state department of education received a letter from Superintendent A. H. Waterhouse of Fremont to tobacco dealers. It is considered one of the best moves made by any superintendent in the state to secure observance of the law on the use of tobacco. The letter is as follows: Mr. John Doe, Fremont, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Enclosed you will find copy of a new law in effect July 10, 1911, making it unlawful for a minor under 18 years of age to use tobacco in any form. This law taken in conjunction with Section 1 of the cigarette law previously on the statute books seems definite in its attempt to dis - turage the use of tobacco by boys before they have reached such a ige of development as to make its use less injurious. Section 1 reads as follows: 'That it shall be unlawful on and after the date this act shall go into effect to manufacture, sell, give away or willingly allow to be taken, any cigarettes or the material for their composition known as cigarette paper within the State of Ne - braska." The act of enclosure and the act of quoting Sec. 1 to you are done with the idea that you may not be familiar with the provisions of both acts, and that being unfamiliar with their provisions you might inadvertently render yourself liable under either one or the other of these sections or both. Fin my past interviews with school boys I have learned from them some dealers had cigarette papers on a shelf back of the counter and made no objection if boys went back there and helped themselves, an act of liberality which probably they would not perform with refer - ence to any other salable article in their stores. Again it was learned that some dealers were in the habit of throwing cigarette papers out </seg>
            <seg id="p063">36 with rubbish at their back doors, an act of extravagance which probably they would not repeat with any other salable article in their stores. Either condition by which boys receive cigarette paper is apparently in violation of Section 1, quoted above, for in either case the dealer Blingly allows to be taken the material for the composition of cigar - 38 known as cigarette paper. It is not my desire to give the impression that I would in the slightest measure wish to interfere with the sale of tobacco to persons whom the law regards of sufficient age to use it legally, but it has been made my duty in some measure by the department of education to Kst upon the enforcement of this law. I can with slight influence ress upon the pupils of the schools the necessity of being law ignizing and law abiding citizens should I constantly wink at the ation of this law. Sooner or later there will have to be some complaint filed against some minor under 18 for the illegal use of tobacco and this commun - ication is mailed to you in the hope that no reputable dealer will be involved should the minor elect to furnish the evidence indicated in Section 3 rather than pay the fine imposed in Section 2. Trusting that you will co-operate with me in the proper enforce - ment of this law, I remain Very truly, A. H. WATERHOUSE." E hereby approve the above letter of Superintendent A. H. Water - and trust the city superintendents over the state will take similar in regard to the new law. Very truly, JAMES E. DELZELL, State Superintendent. VOTE FOR HOUSE ROLL NO. 313 QUACKENBUSH AND DOLEZAL To whom it may concern: ■he boy who uses tobacco is fighting a losing battle. In almost case he loses out morally, physically and intellectually. Eir state legisature should pass House Roll No. 313 because it assist in reducing the amount of tobacco used, thereby giving the g boys a chance to keep their minds and hearts pure. (Signed) CHAS. E.

            <seg id="p064">37 After having made a careful investigation covering a period of ten years in Nebraska, I am prepared to say that three-fourths of the boys who fall behind in their work are cigarette and tobacco users and that their failure is directly traceable to the effect of this habit upon (Signed) J. \V.

It would form 3 for the handling of such cases in the Juvenile Courts. Kven without Section 3 of this bill the minor would not ordinar - prosecuted in criminal court, except for purpose above indicated would be handled by Juvenile court.

To County Superintendents: Several county superintendents have recently called our atten - tion to certain unscrupulous book agents now abroad in the state, who enter the school houses and take the time which properly belongs to the children, soliciting the purchase of books.

Crabtree, State Normal School, River Palls, Wisconsin, at Nebraska State Teachers' Association, November 8, 1912. President Rouse is noted for his hard common sense. As a lad on the farm and in the district school, he often placed both teacher and text book at a disadvantage in questioning the accuracy of prices as given in problems in arithmetic or in challenging the truthfulness of certain sentences to be analyzed in grammar. Later as a young car - penter, it is said that he never failed to hit the nail on the head. As an educator he has the reputation of always looking problems square in the face. In his teaching and in his addresses he never fails to get down </seg>
            <seg id="p066">39 Sis only natural, therefore, that he should choose as the central ought running through all the general and sectional programs of this meeting, the most practical, important and fundamental note of present day progress in the public schools, — namely, Economy and efficiency in education. Eiis same central thought might wisely be adopted as the cen - ought for many future meetings of this and other state associa- It might wisely become the motto for every classroom of every 1 school, college and university professor throughout the state. Let the teachers of Nebraska follow their worthy leader and take economy and efficiency as their slogan in their every day work and let them test by this standard every course of study, every subject to be taught, every topic to be emphasized every lesson plan prepared, every recitation conducted and every bit of advice or help given to young people, and soon Nebraska will stand out not only because of having the lowest per cent of illiteracy, as at present, but because of having the highest per cent of efficiency in her common schools of any Com - monwealth of this great union of states. The states of the central west are recognized as the leaders of pro - gressive political thought. They are leaders of advanced sociological thought. May we not say also that they are leaders of sanest and soundest educational thought and policy? Nebraska ranks high among the states that stand for reform. Our people do not always origi - nate the thought behind the movement but they are certain to be among the first to put wise reform and good plans into actual practice. Nebraska attached importance to education from the very first and incorporated into the fundamental law of the state far reaching provisions guaranteeing the opportunity of an education for every boy and girl, and guaranteeing in a large way the funds for giving them an education. The early settler of Nebraska, however severe his struggles against the adversity of drouth, and however great his suffering caused by the ravages of grass hoppers on his crops, and of wolves and coyotes on his calves and pigs, and however exasperating the depredations of Indians, cattle thieves and politicians, this noble man never lost sight of the importance of education in its relation to intelligent citizenship. In no other state did the pioneer show a more genuine and positive interest in the training of youth. It was only natural that this state should have the lowest per cent of illiteracy. It is reasonable to expect that the sons and daughters of these good people will see that tnext step is taken, that of greater economy and efficiency, and that will continue the leadership of Nebraska in education. Education is not a thing separated from everything else. It is only one of many factors for improving society. This question of econ - omy and efficiency in education is the educator's problem, just as con - serving the soil and at the same time increasing its yield is the problem </seg>
            <seg id="p067">40 Rural resources of the state and nation are problems of still other n in cloBely related lines of service. The principle of greater economy and efficiency is being urged at the present time in every line of human effort. So long as w,e had a frontier, that is, so long as our country had immense tracts of unoccupied lands which could be secured as free iiojnesteads or at low prices, the thought of the farmer was to gain possession of and to farm the largest possible number of acres rather than to concern himself as to the necessity of getting the most out of each acre and of conserving the strength of the soil for future crops. But there are no more homesteads of desirable land to be given away. Prices of good land have doubled, and doubled again even during the last two decades, in Nebraska. This territory so recently the frontier is now a thickly settled country, and there is no other of the public domain anywhere to serve as the frontier. Expansion and large farm - ing are necessarily giving way to smaller farms and more intense and intelligent farming. While men were increasing their holdings in land, factories were constantly increasing their plants and establishing additional plants. All branches of business were promoted in much the same way. States placed a premium on numbers rather than on the quality of their popu - lation. Cities were strongly inclined to pad their census reports. Quack schools of medicine sprang up everywhere and their grad - uates still have their shingles out in many small towns. The business college boom was on; where six months was ample time for gradua - tion, even though the pupil had not finished the eighth grade. Two - by-four colleges sold and gave away the bachelor's and higher degrees. There is even yet an occasional man holding a high position who takes pride in displaying his degrees secured in this questionable way. The schools in small towns extended their high school courses of, study to cover four years' work. Top heavy courses of study became common. Teachers taught too many subjects and too many classes. In some instances, the recitation periods in the high school were neces - sarily only fifteen to twenty-five minutes in length. We are not far away from some of these things in many schools even today. The frontier was not a bad thing. It offered a splendid opportunity for the common people to get homes and it enhanced their chances of success in life. It gave birth to the best in politics, and in society. It gave us the spirit which we call Americanism. It furnished ground where progressive principles could sprout and grow and mature and then spread over the entire country. It added to the general prosperity of our nation. Still, connected with the doings of the people because of the frontier, there were evils such as have been mentioned. Another important cause of inefficiency in our schools of today, and one which must not be overlooked, is found in the fact that condi - tions have changed almost completely since our school systems were </seg>
            <seg id="p068">41 established and our methods of teaching formulated. In the early days when schools were first organized and when we formed our standards of teaching, the children were taught morals and habits of industry, not Pi school, but at home. The school was needed only to teach the en to spell, to read, to write and to solve problems in arithm vocational training was given in the home. The school was ized to give only a small portion of the child's necessary train- The school did not open until nine, so the boy and girl could help in the work of the home for two or three hours before coming to school. The school day closed at four to give f.mple time for doing the chores in the evening. There was no school on Saturday because Eday was needed for going to market and for making preparations observing properly the Sabbath day. The summer vacation waa vise in the interest of the vocational training given by the home. Superintendent Pearse of Milwaukee says that the part borne by the home in the education of our children has "shrunk like a snow hank in the spring." Worst of all the part earlier borne by the home has not been taken over fully by the school. There is no criticism upon the work of those pioneer teachers and educators. They organized the schools to meet conditions as they found them. They did their work well. The fault lies with our - selves. We should have made changes gradually as conditions were changing, but not having done that a most radical readjustment is now demanded by the new set of conditions surrounding public school Going back to the influence of the frontier upon our educational policies it may be said that it was only natural that men should at that time center their thoughts on building and expanding in i line of effort. It was only natural for them to lose sight of other important considerations. If our country still possessed large areas of good lands to be given away to settlers, very little, if any, real attention would even yet be given to economy and efficiency on the farm, in business or in the school. One thing at a time is the order of the day. Certain lines of progress in the schools have been carried torward and certain other important points have been neglected. Ke are now laying stress on one of the important points which m almost entirely disregarded for several decades. Rhis idea of efficiency, like any other excellent thought, appeals pie more strongly when necessity forces it upon them or when 3 to become interested in it. Conditions now force the farmer srve economy and efficiency. Changed conditions make profit certain only where waste is re - duced and where efficiency is increased. While striving for efficiency in every other line of the human effort the people naturally demand greater efficiency on the part of the schools. Larger salaries are paid </seg>
            <seg id="p069">42 tpliances in order to reach this desired end. School men are thus reed to take up these same questions in which the public is so vitally interested. Many of them are greatly pleased to do so. Many had in vain tried to start this movement years ago. They failed because the great body of teachers was held in grooves by the iron bands of academic tradition and because the public was not yet ready to lead or force the imovement. Progress in the schools does well to keep pace with progress made in material affairs. Permit me to narrate, as I see them, some of the hindrances t greater efficiency: 1. Methods of teaching which attach more importance to arith metic and grammar than to child. 2. The view that the public schools are operated in the interests of superintendents and teachers rather than to promote the welfare of youth. 3. Lack of preparation on the part of the teacher and "a failure to appreciate the value of constantly growing in the profession. 4. The loss each year of many of the strongest in the profession, who find much better pay in business pursuits or in other professions. k5. The evil influences of the billiard and pool halls, of the livery , of the alley, of the public dance, of the saloon, and of evil minded and women wherever found in every community. 6. The practice on the part of so many teachers of striving harder to get the game than to play the game. T. Weak supervision and a lack of state inspection. P8. Bad methods of lighting and ventilation, and poor sanitary other health conditions of buildings. t9. A lack of vision on the part of those who shape our educational icies and a lack on the part of the teacher of a sense of appreciation the needs to be met. 10. The influence of the best friend and at the same time the worst foe to progress, tradition. tThe schools are battling down these hindrances more successfully 1 more rapidly than we could reasonably expect in the case of tra - k&gt;n. and it sometimes looks as if tradition is battling down the chers. Aristotle says that economy ; s a virtue, but he adds that too much or too little economy makes the miser and the spendthrift the worst of vices. Things in this life in order to be right must bear the proper balance to other things. Holding to the antiquated traditional view certainly becomes a menace to progress. It may seem to be a needless outlay if not a willful waste of capital for a factory to install new machinery before the old is badly worn, yet one of the world's great - est financiers has said that the chief element of success in the man - agement of a manufacturing establishment is to know when to thr j» the old machinery into the junk pile. The schools are certainly failing </seg>
            <seg id="p070">43 Eitribute their fair proportion to the junk pile. Not only anti - i text books and out of date appliances, but methods and tradi - galore, continue to impede the progress of efficiency in the public Is at the present time. E Tradition has held efficiency in check in all lines of service, but ially is this true in the work of the public schools. Our best Is are sometimes our worst enemies. Tradition is the friend of progress already attained. It is the friend of the methods and policies of institutions already established. But it is the arch enemy of inno - vation. Tradition is generalized habit. Just as habit is an attitude of mind of the individual, so tradition is the fixed attitude of public opin - ion. Habit may be strong, but it works single handed. Tradition is entrenched and powerful. It has not only the power of multiple mind in its support, but it has also the momentupn of multiple years behind it. So long as genuine progress is in harmony with tradition, that is, so long as it moves with the current of settled public opinion, just that long will harmony and peace prevail, but when progress must run counter to tradition or when it is necessary to change the direction of the currents, there is friction and trouble. Socrates was forced to urink the fatal hemlock because his view was not in harmony with • hat tradition said was right. Christ paid the penalty for planting a new religion in the world opposed to the traditional religion of his nation. Lincoln was a martyr to a cause. A foolish tradition made t honorable for one of the greatest and best men of our day to commit icide recently. As tradition is of gradual growth it can only be changed by slow degrees. Yet progress can advance little beyond the traditional view of any particular period. Pestalozzi interested teachers in the child, but it is not certain that tradition even yet accepts the child rather than the subject as the center of interest in all teaching. It required a period of fifty years for Horace Mann's convincing arguments in favor of professional training for teachers to become a part of traditional belief and practice throughout the country. Colonel Parker's plan of connecting the work of the school more i losely with the work of the home will have to fight tradition a decade or more before it will be generally carried into practice in all our EH cannot be disputed that vocational training will increase the ciency of our public schools many per cent. But tradition looks in vocational training as an unwelcome innovation. When the de - mand came fifteen years ago for manual training in the public schools, the people had in mind vocational training rather than what is now understood by the term manual training. Academic tradition fooled the people. It placed manual training in the schools, but carefully avoided its vocational features. It made manual training a disciplinary sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p071">44 Eith scarcely more of the practical in it than is found in any in which there is more or less laboratory work. Every year training in the public schools becomes more disciplinary and lees practical. The movement for vocational training has been held in check therefore by the conservatism of educators and without the knowledge or consent of the people. The college influence was doubt - leu the largest factor in diverting the wishes of the people in this instance. The current of academic tradition must be changed in relation to the work of the public high school or else you principals and high school teachers are likely to wake up some morning and find the high school without financial support and without students. There is dan - ger of your having little more than an academized high school. Tradi - tion believes in the high schools giving a general education only. If you put into the course of study manual training or domestic science or agriculture, it want* you to make this study contribute also to the idea of a general education. It causes you to tear the very life out of £jry vocational subject forced by the people into your courses of study order to make it of disciplinary value and in order to make it gen - .1. Ew what is the result? The people through their state legis - are establishing state agricultural schools,' state schools of c science, state schools of manual training, state vocational and industrial schools. Nebraska has not gone far in this direction, but she has made a start. Unless the high schools wake up Nebraska will go farther and dot the state from one end to the other with vocational and other state schools. When that is done the boys and girls will E attend the special schools which prepare them for doing some - in tbe world. A general education! Can anything be more and more purposeless than a general education? Business men see the narrowness and the fallacy of this high school view. Hard headed farmers are not in accord with it. Why are teachers so slow to realize the extent to which they have been blinded by academic tradition? The people want, not the general, but the special. They do not disapprove of an avocation, but they demand for their children first of all vocational training. They want this special train - ing to begin down in the grades. They want it to continue through the high school. They want it in advanced form in the university. Sometimes the people are wrong, but in this instance the teachers have been grossly mislead. The high school is the natural place for giving special training. The high school can do this work better and more economically than it can be done in the kind of schools states are organizing and better than the special schools the congress of the United States is about to establish throughout the country. The high school has a better organization than can be given to these special schools. I am in favor of the high schools doing all these special </seg>
            <seg id="p072">45 Ei of work. I regret exceedingly that high schools are holding forcing the states and congress to establish special schools. But in the high school does not come forward to give vocational and special training, then I heartily approve of other agencies takins Bsion of that fleld and doing the work as well as passible. Some one says we will see that the legislature does not locate another special school in this state. Each principal must bring pres - sure to bear on the members of the legislature from his country. Non - sense! Political methods may retard good movement, but they cannot check them. Men depend entirely too much on political trickery. If you don't want Nebraska to establish special schools, do away with the need for them. Do the work in your high schools. The continuation school would be entirely unnecessary if the high school would only broaden its field somewhat. The business college would be unknown bad the high school done its full duty years ago. The agricultural school established by the state two years ago would not have been thought of had the high schools of this state tried one half so hard to serve the interests of the people, as they have tried to serve the interests of the traditions of the colleges of the country. The failure to attain to a higher degree of efficiency in the high school, therefore, is not so much due to a lack of funds or to a lack of appre - ciation and co-operation on the part of the board of education and of parents as it is to the wrong viewpoint of ourselves. The little kitten pounces upon the moving broom or upon the rolling marble just as it will later spring upon its prey. It enjoy* doing that which develops its vocational instinct and as a result it becomes a good mouser. The Indian lad fishes in the small pond, and hunts easy game in the nearby woods. He fits himself for his voca - tion by actually doing in a small way the things he will later do with skill in a larger way. But tradition has established a gulf bet the child's school activities of our day and what he will do after he leaves school. The child craves a chance to do something with his hands. He wants to make things used in the home. He wants to earn money with which to buy things for himself and to help in the home. This desire is natural and wholesome. It should never be crushed. It should be developed. Ply plea, ladies and gentlemen, is for vocational training. It is e Crete Plan in domestic science; it is for doing things in the as a part of school work. It is for teaching boys to farm, to do work in the blacksmith or carpenter shop, to keep books in a bank, to sell boots and shoes, to write items for the newspapers, to teach in the country school. It is for teaching girls not to cut a whole in new cloth and to put a patch of new cloth over the hole, but to teach girls to mend garments where the hole comes in the natural way. and not only to teach girls to sew and to cook, but to teach them to make gar- </seg>
            <seg id="p073">46 to cook their own meals and the meals at home, and to make pies and rakes and other good things, and to sell the same in the community. My plea is for a high school which will give a definite preparation for what the boys and girls will do immediately on leaving school, and for not only giving more serviceable knowledge, but for giving knowl - edge of a more marketable value. Ety plea is for vocational training, not as a disciplinary subject, 8 a part of a general education, but as a training which will fit boy and each girl for earning an honest living and for actually something in the world. THE TEACHEUS' TWEXTY-YEAK CLUB. In December, 1911, Chancellor Samuel Avery, State Superintend - ent Jas. E. Delzell and Dr. A. 0. Thomas, while in consultation over mat - ters relating to the educational life, work and progress in Nebraska agreed to call an informal meeting of those who had taught twenty years or more in the state. The call was made for a meeting at seven o'clock Friday evening, January 16, 1912, to be held at the Lindell hotel. After the banquet the order of business was called by Chan - cellor Avery who acted as chairman and toast master. More than an hour was spent in good cheer, good fellowship and in recounting the sayings and doings of "the days that are no more." Short talks were made by Chancellor Avery, Dr. Bessey, Superin - tendent Oliver, Prof. Beck, Dr. Schell, Prof. Duncanson, Prof. Reed, W. K. Fowler, Dean Fordyce, Superintendent Delzell, President Clem - mon, Prof. McBrien, Superintendent Gardner, Dean Rouse, Miss Adams, Superintendent Waterhouse, Dr. Beattie, Jessie B. Pyrtle, and Super - intendent Olinger. It may be there are others who spoke whose names are not recalled. In the light of the value of such meetings it was voted to have another gathering about one year after the first. Dr. C. E. Bessey of the State University was elected president and Dr. J. A.

            <seg id="p074">47 Address (iiven Before the County Superintendents' Se&lt;-tiun (if Nebra«lui Teachers' Association at Omaha, Nebraska, November 8, 1912. By C. W. PUGSLEY Superintendent Agricultural Extension, University of Nebraska. I consider it a privilege to address the County Superintendents' Section of the Nebraska Teachers' Association, for you wield such an important influence in shaping the policies followed in our secondary schools. Your problems are paramount today in educational circles, for we are confronted with a serious situation. From figures fur - nished by the state superintendent I find that 99% of the boys and girls who attend our rural and grade schools receive no further educa - tion. The schooling which is there received is necessarily their prep - aration for life's work. Of those who are fortunate enough to continue their education in the high school, more than 50% enter life's work before they complete the course or immediately after graduation. Those who do complete the course often find that their preparation has been for further study in a university or college rather than for the special work they are to take up for life. Nebraska has the small - est percentage of illiteracy of any state in the union, and yet we find only about 40% of our youth of school age in the public schools. The county superintendents, together with the teachers must largely solve the problem of best meeting the needs of the students. To my mind, schooling is a preparation for life. It must fit the student to fill the position of a useful citizen. It should be a prepara - tion which will enable him to leave the community in which he makes his home better for his having lived there; a preparation which will A. A. Reed, Lincoln. Mrs. B. R.

Industrial Work in Out- Schools I know something of conditions which exist in rural and village schools. I have been a student and a teacher in both. 1 know that in most rural schools there are students rated all the way from the kin - dergarten to the eighth grade and these must all be taught by one teacher in one room. 1 would not add to the teacher's burden by insist - ing that more time be given to the school work, neither would I com - plicate the course of study by the introduction of needless subjects. My experience with eighth graders and with high school graduates in a normal school in Iowa, in the State University and the School of Agri - culture at Lincoln, has led me to the firm conviction that the youth of cur state is not receiving any too 'much training in the common branches. In fact if it were possible 1 would prefer that more time be given to the teaching of essentials, such as arithmetic, spelling, gram - mar and writing, than is given at the present time. I would, however, advocate the teaching of some of the studies which we now have in such a manner that the student, while he is receiving training in the technical part of grammar, arithmetic and history, might also be gain - ing knowledge of subjects with which he will come in close contact later in life. As an illustration of what I mean, let us take ordinary arithmetic. The majority of our rural schools are dealing with farmers' sons and daughters. The majority of these should go back to the farm and make their homes there. Take up any arithmetic which is used in our rural schools, examine the problems carefully from the standpoint of prac - ticability. You will find that a large number of the problems show merely an effort to get the student to work out a principle in arithme - tic, and that there is no thought of impressing on his mind at the same time important facts and figures which he will use later in life. Like - wise in the reading work you will find stories of some man who has done an impossible thing and few stories of the ordinary man who ha&amp; done the ordinary thing. The explanation of these ordinary things would make the most interesting stories in the world. There are thou - sands of interesting things occurring in nature every day which would add to the knowledge of the child if he but knew what was taking place. Properly written, these would make as good reading lessons as - any. They would also impress as good moral lessons as any of the time hdnored fictions which have crept into our readers, and at the same time would be throwing a flood of light on every day occurrences. Let us glance at the history also. In all of the work which I had in I'nited </seg>
            <seg id="p076">49 States history, I received no instruction as to the advancement of the I'nited States as an agricultural nation. My history told of all the wars that we had. In fact, as I recall history now, the changing of boundary lines and a study of the lives of a few of the men who were the most influential took up our entire time. These are important, and should be included in every history, but is not the industrial develop - ment of our great country as important? Why not teach the history of its agriculture, and the history of our industries, showing how they were either the causes or the effects of certain great historical events. Then in addition to the above there is a chance in most of the schools to increase the interest in purely industrial work. My partic - ular line is agricultural work. 1 would like to see each teacher have some interest in this fundamental occupation of our state. I would like to see the teachers impress on the minds of the students all over this great state of ours that agriculture is now, and always will be the most important industry in Nebraska; that the majority of our people will be either directly or indirectly dependent upon the production or the distribution of the products of our farms. Pith these things in mind I will briefly outline some of the work •h I believe the Department of Agricultural Extension can be of ■ on. It might all be classed as junior work, but for convenience divided the work into five different heads. The first of these I 11 the Boys' and Girls' work. This will comprise local County ate contests, County and State Short courses and local County and State Boys' and Girls' clubs. Many of you have already held county contests: some others are anxious to know how to proceed to hold them. Quite a number of those present have held county short courses; others are anxious to do so as soon as they can find funds or as soon as the department can furnish assistance. Quite a number are now organizing Boys' and Girls' club. Boys' and Girls' Work. Ex-Superintendent E. C. Bishop started the Boys' and Girls' Club in Nebraska. For a number of years it was carried on by the Department of Public Instruction in co-operation with the De - partment of Farmers' Institutes. Ex-Superintendent Crabtree and our present state superintendent, Mr. Delzell, felt that the work should be placed in some department where it could be given more time and where the leaders of the department would not be subject to the polit - ical whims of the people. The Department of Agricultural Extension of the University of Nebraska was asked to take charge of the work. We therefore found ourselves face to face with the problem of orga - nizing the work in such a manner that the interest of the local club members would be maintained throughout the year and at the same time allow the central office a chance to direct and unify the work. </seg>
            <seg id="p077">50 The plan we have in mind is familiar to most of you. We hope to have many local Boys' and Girls' Clubs in each county, each local club to consist of from five to fifteen members, duly organized with officers and uniform constitution and by laws. We hope these clubs will meet at least once a month and have a program which will be entertaining as well as instructive. We want these club members to act as social leaders in their respective communities, and to take the lead in orga - nized industrial advancement. The local clubs may hold judging con - tests, and agricultural and domestic science contests. The best judges of each club will be entitled to compete for county honors at the county - contests. The winning exhibits will be sent to the county contest to compete with the best exhibits from other local clubs. It should be the purpose of the county contest to find the beet exhibits and the best judges in the county and send them en to the state contest. The same general procedure will apply to the Junior Short Courses. Each local club should have the privilege of sending one or more stu - dents to the County Short Course. The two best boy students and the two beet girl students in each County Short Course should be sent to the Junior State Short Course. Judges for the contests and instruc - tors for the short courses will be furnished, if our funds permit, by the Department of Agricultural Extension. The local clubs of each county should have a County Boys' and &lt;&gt;irls' club, with its officers. The county superintendent will act as •■ounty leader for all the Hub work. The teachers of the county can be utilized in organizing and directing the local club work. That the work of the entire state may be harmonious it will be directed by a state leader in the university. This will give us a close co-operation between local, county and state organizations, and will give the mem - bers of every club some incentive to do good work. Programs can be directed and special contests outlined by the state leader in co-opera - tion with the various county superintendents. That this department might be best prepared to assist in this line of work, we have just recently made arrangements with one of your number to take up the junior work. We felt that the director of this line of work should be a county superintendent, and especially a county superintendent who has had experience in teaching. She would then understand the problems of the teacher as well as those of the super - intendent. After consultation with a number of county superintend - ents and with the State Department of Public Instruction, the univer - sity had secured the services of Miss Huldah Peterson, superintendent of £elps county. She will be placed in charge of the junior work and will in a aosition to render assistance to county superintendents who ire to establish contests and short courses and organize clubs. She will begin work with the department January 1st, 1913. Her appointment will be in co-operation with the United States Department of Agriculture in connection with the Boys' and Girls' Club work </seg>
            <seg id="p078">51 which has been so successfully carried on in the south far the last few years. Kiglitli &lt;ira«le Promotion Fill I If The second line of work in which we can assist the county super - ii.tendents is that of supplying speakers for your eighth grade promo - tion exercises. The following splendid scheme was originated by Super - intendent F. A. Stech of Butler oounty. I consider it one of the best plans for arousing interest in industrial work that has ever been (ievised. It is of special value in bringing to the attention of eighth graders the advantages of further education. Mr. Stech's plan is to have his eighth grade promotion exercises arranged in series throughout his county. These exercises are to be held at the various school houses. In this way all of the pupils can attend as well as their parents. He will be able to make from four to six school houses per day by taking the speaker to the various dis - tricts with an automobile. A local program can be held in connection v.ith the talks given by the special speaker and the count / superintend - ent. If any of the county superintendents desire to arrange for work of this kind, we will be glad to lend our assistance by furnishing, when - ever possible, speakers from the department for expenses only. We have lanterns and could arrange slereopticon lectures for the evening Teachers' Institutes. During the last few years, there has been great interest shown by teachers in industrial work. Several county superintendents have de - \ oted at least a portion of their institute work to agriculture, domes - tic science and manual training. It remained for Superintendent L. R. Willis of Adams county to hold the first purely industrial institute in the state. Last year he secured the services of teachers who were especially qualified to handle industrial subjects. The lines of work covered at his institute were those of domestic science, manual train - ing, animal husbandry and agronomy. The teachers were greatly in - terested in the work and many expressions of its value have reached my office. If it will be of any aid to the county superintendents we will be glad to help in securing the services of competent instructors for these various lines of work. Where it is deemed advisable by any county superintendent to devote all of the time to industrial work, the department could probably take the entire direction of the institute, secure the services of the most competent people and save the county superintendent money, while at the same time we could give a high grade of instruction. We have charts and apparatus for similar work ■t the short courses during the winter season, and usually know where to secure the services of experienced short course workers. It might not be wise in all counties to devote the entire institute to industrial </seg>
            <seg id="p079">52 P, but in the majority of counties a portion of the time could be ably employed in work of this kind. University Picnics. In this paper I am giving you the experiences of a number of county superintendents. It would not be complete if I failed to men - tion the work of Miss Alice Florer, superintendent of York county. It has been a dream of Miss Florer's for some time that she might in - terest her school children and their parents in the advantages of an industrial education. She realized that too many of the young people of her county entered life's work poorly equipped. She knew, how - ever, that it would be impossible for her merely to make an announce - ment of a picnic at the state farm at Lincoln and secure an attendance worth while. For some time she had been talking to the pupils and l&gt;arents as well as to the teachers of the advantages of a picnic excur - sion to Lincoln. When the time was ripe she made the announcement that on the 19th day of October the early morning train would carry all who desired to visit Lincoln. She asked all intending to make the trip to take a picnic dinner along. About a hundred and fifty availed themselves of this opportunity. The people in Lincoln, who were ar - ranging for the entertainment, met the train with special street cars to convey them to the state farm. Upon reaching the farm, tables were found in the judging pavilion and hot coffee with state farm cream was served to the guests. After lunch a short program was held where the work of the university and the school of agriculture was outlined. A trip was then made to all of the buildings of the state farm, as well as to the experimental fields. Special exhibits had been prepared by S various departments. Special cars were awaiting at four o'clock ike the crowd to the state house. Deputy Superintendent Elliott iucted them through the historical halls and pointed out the things Dterest. They went from there to the university and spent the under of the afternoon in the museum. The results of such work can best be shown by giving a portion of a letter written by Miss Florer immediately upon her return. "On the way home I was talking with one of the boys who finished the eighth grade three years ago, but who has never attended school since. He said: "Miss Florer, I have always thought I should like to go to school some place again, but today I have made my decision. I am going to the state farm next year. I shall work on a farm this year, save my money, and next year I will have enough money to go to the state farm.' Any effort I put forth previously for the success of this picnic was rewarded when I heard this, if nothing further should result. But from what I heard as we came home, I imagine that the results will be very much greater than the decision of this one boy." We will be plad indeed to make special arrangements for the entertainment of any excursions of this kind. We will make an effort to arrange the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p080">53 gram so that it will be interesting and instructive. I predict that the members of any such excursion will feel that they have not wasted their time. Farm Demonstration*. We now have under way in the department the beginning of what •*e hope will be a state-wide plan for farm demonstration. The plan is to put into each locality, probably using the county as a unit, a man whose business it is to study the agricultural conditions and to assist the farmers in adopting the best practices for their respective communi - ties. We do not like to call them "farm advisers," for they are not really advisers. They are merely technically trained men who keep track of demonstrations carried on by the farmers themselves under actual farm conditions. The demonstration is repeated a good many times in the community so that the result of the year's work will give an absolute indication of the value of any particular practice. I do not have time to go into the details of this work, but merely wish to say that such a demonstrator, coming in contact as he does with prac - tically every farmer in the county, should be of inestimable value to the work which we have in co-operation with the county superintend - ents. He can aid in aroueing interest in Boys' and Girls' Clubs, help in getting premiums for contests, talk at local club meetings, and give publicity to all lints of work. Industrial Assistant Ene time in the future I hope we may be able to have seme spe - hnically trained person, who has come up through the ranks of hers and preferably the county superintendents, to assist you in Sing industrial courses in your secondary schools. Such a per - son could be of great value in showing the teachers just how industrial ei could be presented, in helping to equip libraries, arrange lab - •s, establish gardens, and outline field excursions. I'ntil such a mes we will be glad to aid you in this work in any way possible. In closing it is my special desire to leave this thought with you: Our department is exceedingly anxious to help you in every way pos - sible and you will always find us ready to co-operate in all lines of work within our province. THE I'ROBLKM OF THK RURAL SCHOOL A paper read by Principal Harry E. Bradford, School of Agricul - ture, University of Nebraska, before the Schoolmasters' Club, Decem - ber 6. 1912. The choice of the one room district school by the rural sections in pioneer days was the most natural thing in the world. During the early history of each new forming state the people were few and scat- </seg>
            <seg id="p081">54 tered. Each group had its school. The size of this school community depended on the number of people living within traveling distance of the school. The teacher "boarded round" and his salary and other necessary expenses of the school were paid by the families which sent children to the school. Kit is not stratige that the people of the rural communities learned ove their little school. Its simple organization, its proximity to the ntry homes, its inexpensiveness, its local government and the close - ness of the teacher to the lives of the pupils made the little rural school wonderfully strong in the hearts of its patrons. No one could wish to take from it one iota of credit for good work done in the past. It has had and always will have a prominent place in our public school system. Owing to the geographical conditions it will no doubt always exist in perhaps a third of our entire territory. But this world of ours has been changing rapidly in the past quarter of a century. Business houses that were modern during one decade have been forced to entirely reorganize to meet the demands of competition and changed conditions. Some churches complained that the world was growing worse because their pews were growing empty Others recognized the fact that the people were moving onward and changed their plans to meet the new conditions. Country life has changed rapidly and completely and the little rural school has had many new demands, which to a large extent it has been unable to fill. The men teachers who were such a force in the early part of the nineteenth century have all disappeared. Better sal - aries in other pursuits is the cause. Farmers have asked for a training for their sons and daughters which would at least partially fit them for the life they were to lead. Just a glimpse at the city school may help us a bit. The cities have had a wonderful growth in the last thirty years. The valuation of taxable property has increased rapidly in spite of frequent, crafty attempts to dodge the assessor. Money for school purposes is plentiful in the average city and accordingly the city schools have taken the lead in progressive ideas. Magnificent buildings adorn city campuses. The length of the school term is nine to ten months. Expensive scientific apparatus is in the laboratories. Skilled teachers and supervisors are in charge. Somebody doubts whether the city schools are sanitary and health - ful and medical inspection becomes a part of the system. A rap at the efficiency and practicability of the schools and Manual Training* and Domestic Science are given places in the course of study. A sugges - tion from the business man and the commercial department stands on a par with Latin and Geometry. In short the city public schools have at least attempted to meet the demands and fill the needs of city life. It has taken money, equipment and cooperation. But what of the rural schools! One-half of our entire school pop - ulation attend the rural schools and at least 90 per cent of these child- </seg>
            <seg id="p082">55 E never get beyond the eighth grade. This being the case, the effi - cy of the little country school is a serious problem for the Amer - people. An investigation reveals the fact almost all country schools in Nebraska are one-room buildings, cheaply built and with very unat - tractive, unsatisfactory surroundings. The equipment is usually meagre and many of the books were out of date when you and I were pupils in the grades of the public schools. Great improvement has been recently made in the heating of rural school houses and still at least 80 per cent of the buildings are warmed by stoves not always in good condition. Ventilation in this large majority is a thing unknown. The Eiture is, to say the least, uncomfortable and in many schools not hy the name of "furniture." It is small wonder that the average try school pupil is not long attracted by his school. The rural school teacher very seldom has ever lived in the coun - try. She is probably a city girl with an education received in the city high school. It is extremely unlikely that her thoughts have ever turned toward the country as a place to live. She teaches her little band of farm boys and girls according to the ideas she learned in the city schools. Here is a little city school transferred to the country to be used by country boys and girls without regard to its availability. Fortunately there are exceptions to this picture but at best the rural school teacher is working against great odds with her many grades and classes and imperfect physical surroundings. And then the tenure of office! Rural school teachers seldom teach more than two terms in the same place. This perhaps would not be worse than the city school where the child changes teachers sometimes twice a year, but for the fact that the new teacher is too often entirely trperienced. What a pity that the teacher must move on just when is getting ready to do some real teaching! But consideration must be given to the district, its officers and its finances. Where three officers make up the school board, often per - sonal grievances enter into school affairs and render conditions unbear - able! One Nebraska County Superintendent writes the following from his own experience: "Whatever the unit may be. I am convinced that our present three member school board in rural districts is unsat - isfactory. So long as harmony prevails among the members, everything goes well. But let one member fall out with another, and the third man is between the upper and nether mill stones — whatever side he may take is the wrong side for one board member, and there is personal trouble. Per - sonal troubles in rural districts go right to the schools. More than one school board member was elected in this county this spring merely to give one man a chance to vent his spite </seg>
            <seg id="p083">56 reason. No trick has been too low to secure the election of men to school boards, solely for spite. I know of what I am saying. A larger school unit would allow a board of six members, which seems to me best, as there must always be a clear majority among such a board, before any proposition carries. The one man. school board is better than the three man board, but there is an opportunity for skulduggery there." R'he finances of the rural school district form a problem for ser - ansideration. It it not the well-to-do districts which deserve our ion but those which can hardly maintain a four or five months by taxation which is placed at the limit set by law. Two districts of the same area are only five miles apart. The one has a large income from railroad tax and supports a nine months term of school with a levy of five mills. The other is poor in property valuation and haa no line of railroad. It levies 25 mills and has five months school. And yet the children in the poorer districts are just as much entitled to the best school privileges as those who live in a railroad district. The legislature of Nebraska showed its appreciation of the truth of the above statement when it appropriated 150,000. for state aid to weak districts. The County Superintendent also deserves attention. He is nom - inated and elected by a direct vote of the people. At the end of two years he is called to account for his actions and again turned over to the tender mercies of the voters. And for this great privilege of being the nominee of a political party the Superintendent is expected to contribute to the county campaign fund and pay his own expenses. These are personal troubles of the head of each county school system in Nebraska. But after he is elected the schools must suffer on account of his limitations. Our County Superintendent is expected to be an office man, an adviser to school boards and a supervisor of rural and village schools. Usually no help is given him for his office and he is expected to carry on his manifold duties with dispatch and accuracy. His office work must be kept up and of course the school officers must be treated courteously and advised with carefully. But the schools have to take the remaining time for their supervision. With an average of 90 to 100 schools in the county the Superintendent can only hope to visit each school once or twice a year. This together with E'hers' meetings and the annual institute constitute the supervision ch rural schools receive. Nobody would would call it real supervi - i. It is only visitation. So much for the need of better conditions for the rural schools. No one will deny the crying need. We may differ materially as to the method of aproaching the problem. First the district unit is too small for effective school organisa - tion. The poorly equipped, one room school with its changing teach - ing force is the result of the small district unit. At the door of the </seg>
            <seg id="p084">district we may lay to a large degree the waste and inefficiency of the country school. The remedy, to my mind, is a county unit of organization. Instead of a district board of three we should have a county board of six mem - bers elected at large. This board should control the rural and village schools, and have the power to choose the County Superintendent, fix his salary and employ such help as may be needed to make the super - intendent truly a supervising officer. Under our present law the County Superintendent must have been a resident of the County which he is to serve. Under this proposed law, the Board of Education may search the field for the best material available. Why should we con- E ourselves to home products if an outsider can give us much r service? City boards of education do not even confine themselves eir home state in their choice of a head for their schools. The county superintendent should recommend the teachers for election and no teacher should be elected without his recommendation. The board should reserve the power to veto any nomination made by the County Superintendent but it should not have the power to elect a teacher whom the County Superintendent has refused to recommend. I'nder the county unit of organization the present system of local taxation would be changed. Instead of a district school tax we should have a county tax for the support of all rural schools in the county. The plan would equalize the school tax over the county and would re - sult in great benefit to the weaker districts. The standardization of the rural schools would naturally and almost automatically work itself out if the County Superintendent had all the powers of the City Superintendent. Today the rural schools have many standards, many plans, many heads and no expert authority with the power to work out a system which the teacher is obliged to follow. A city school system would be the object of much ridicule, if its Superintendent had to persuade and educate one small part of his people to bring the standard of their school up to that of one in another part of the city. It would be thought the height of folly to allow him to spend his time in this manner. But this is exactly the condition of the rural school system of Nebraska today. The County Superintendent may educate, and per - suade, and plead, and advise but he has no power to say "follow this plan" and know that it will be followed. Give him a County Board of Education behind him and the time to work out and supervise his plans and soon the people will be proud of a county system of schools worthy of the name system. I do not mean that individuality would be crushed out and that the rural schools would become lifeless on account of a lack of suitability to local conditions. This conclusion does not need to follow at all. Uni - formity would be only in essentials and the usual liberality in the </seg>
            <seg id="p085">58 Ris also quite worth our while to note that this County Board of Ion could work out intelligently the question of the consolida- Bchools and the establishment of rural, agricultural high schools. Both plans have been tried in other states and found entirely feasible and capable of developing very efficient and practical schools. I am well aware that consolidation is not a popular measure, first because it involves the loss of the local organization and second be - cause it demands the outlay of a considerable sum of money as an initial investment. But I am also aware that many voters in cities object strenuously to the changing of boundary lines and to the expend - iture of large sums of money for new buildings and equipment. In connection with the city schools it is encouraging to note after the im - provements are made that the men with the hammers are generally the first to boast of "our fine high school building." They may also be seen taking their out-of-town friends to see the improvements "we have made." The fact that consolidation is not popular does not mean that it is undesirable. It only means that a central organization should be had which could work out the problem unhampered by local prejudice. This County School Board with the assistance of the County Superinten - dent could carry on a campaign of education which would help bring about consolidation with a minimum of friction. It is not expected that consolidation could be effected or even would be desirable in all parts of the country. Our own state has many counties in which consolidation would be folly. Such counties as Ban - ner, Kimball, Dawes, Sheridan, Rock, Cherry and Cheyenne would be compelled to still maintain the little district schools on account of small population and large areas. But in Hamilton York, Filmore, Gage. Pawnee, Lancaster, Douglas and many other thickly settled counties, the conditions are very favorable for modern rural schools with four to six teachers. Professor Holton of the Kansas State Agricultural College has stated the advantages of consolidation very effectively. He says: 1. Solidarity of community conscience will be developed around the consolidated school, which can never be created around the one room school. 2. The larger number of pupils brought together in one t tiding makes it possible to assign not more than one or two ides to each teacher. This will give the teacher more time for individual work with the pupils. 3. The rural schools can be directed toward the needs of country life. 4. A high school can be placed at a "tram haul" distance of every child in the community. 5. It will make it possible to secure specially trained teachers for the departments of agriculture, mechanic arts, </seg>
            <seg id="p086">59 k6. Experience has proved that better teachers can be ured for the same money for consolidated schools than for one room schools. L7. The consolidated school will become the social center community life. E8. It makes it possible for the County Superintendent to effective supervision. If, instead of the 100 one-room lools in a county, there were 20 consolidated schools the perintendent could spend one day of each month in each lool. Under the present plan he spends one day each year each school." Another phase of the problem of the rural schools is the securing of properly trained teachers. No matter whether we have a one-room or a six-room school, it can never train country boys and girls for life on the farm unless the teacher has an agricultural training and is thoroughly in sympathy with farm life. This problem is not being solved satisfactorily at the present time. The college men and women are not attracted by the low salaries. The normal schools are busy training teachers for the cities and pay little attention to rural schools. It follows naturally that the greater part of our rural teachers are being furnished by the high schools. Further - more this situation is not likely to be materially changed in the near The solution, it seems to me, lies in the development of the Nor - mal Training and Agriculture departments of her high schools. Give to every Normal Training high school a man who can really teach Agriculture; add to the school's equipment a five or ten acre farm and a model rural school and you have provided a source of supply for teachers who will do efficient work in the country schools. The trouble with this plan is that the average Normal Training high school cannot stand the expense necessary for the salary of the teacher of Agriculture and for the equipment. Here the state should step in and assist by approprating a sum of money for every high school which teaches agriculture after a prescribed fashion. The Putman Act in Minnesota provides that: Section 1.

This would be an excellent law to be placed on the statutes of Nebraska And now to recapitulate: The one-room rural schools are ineffi - cient and have lost their standing educationally. The proposed plan would establish a county unit of organization instead of the district. The results would be standardized rural schools, the County Super - intendents out of politics, better physical equipment for schools, con- Esd schools in many places, Agriculture and Home Economics s of the course of study and the whole trend of rural school t toward the country. Marked improvements in rural schools are slow in coming but the signs of the time are that the farmers are awakening. They are study - ing and thinking and demanding better things. They are beginning to realize that their children are of greater importance than their cattle and the day will come when they will willingly double and treble their rate of tax for the support of their own rural schools which will lay the foundation for richer and better live* on the farm. </seg>

A common school system for Nebraska was established by an act of the territorial legislature approved March 16, IK.".."!. By this act the territorial librarian was constituted superintendent of public in - struction and provision was made for a county superintendent who was to be elected every two years. One of the chief duties of the county superintendent was that of examining all persons offering themselves as teachers, and of issuing certificates to those found qualified, and of revoking certificates for cause. Xo one else was authorized to examine and issue certificates, no requirement was made as to branches to be included in the examination, and no certificate issued was good for more than one year. RPhe act of 185."&gt;, with amendments of 1S56, was repealed by the ature in 1858 and a new law enacted, which provided for a terri - comniissioner of common schools to be elected at the territorial election for the term of two years. In place of the county superintend - ent it made provision for a county board of school examiners to be appointed by the probate judge of each county. This board consisted of three members and was empowered to examine applicants and issue certificates. No one could be employed in the primary common school unless found qualified in orthography, reading, writing .aaithmetic. Ephy and English grammar. In 1861 the office of commissioner unon schools was consolidated with that of territorial auditor was authorized to perform the duties of both offices. In the revision and re-enaction of the territorial laws in 1866 the legislature provided for a change from the board of three examiners appointed by the probate judge, to one examiner who was appointed by the board of county commissioners for a term of two years. He examined applicants and issued certificates to those qualified in the six branches requisite to teach in the primary common schools, and in the additional branches necessary to teach in the common schools of higher grade. The examiner could revoke a certificate for sufficient cause, and he was allowed to charge a fee of |1.00 for each certificate issued. Previous to this the law does not provide for any fee for a teacher's certificate. By an act of the state legislature approved June 20, 1867, a state normal school was established at Peru, Nebraska. The board of educa- </seg>
            <seg id="p089">62 &lt; ates on the completion of twenty-two weeks' attendance and the pos - session of the learning and other qualifications necessary to teach a good school. These certificates were valid throughout the state and for the time and in the branches stated in the certificate. By the sup - plemental act of 1871 the certificate of the principal of the normal school, as to qualifications to teach, was made to supersede the neces- Er for further examination or other certificate. This law continued force for ten years. P During the change from a territory to a state the school laws 866 continued in force until February 15, 1869, when the "Act to blish a System of Public Instruction for the State of Nebraska" was approved. By this- act the office of commissioner of common schools, as held by the auditor, was abolished and that of state superintendent of public instruction was created. At no time while Nebraska was a territory did the law authorize any one to pass on the qualifications of teachers except the county superintendent at first and later the county board of school examiners, and still later the county examiner. Indi - rectly the act of 1869 recognized the right of the state superintendent to grant certificates in these words, "No person shall be accounted a qualified teacher, within the meaning of the primary school law who has not a certificate in force, or the certificate of the state superintendent of public instruction." But previous to 1876 there is no record of any certificates by the state superintendent. In the place of the county examiner the act of 1869 established the office of county superintendent of public instruction and authorized him to grant certificates, in such forms as shall be prescribed by the state superintendent, and with the restriction that no certificate shall be granted to any person who shall not pass a satisfactory examination in orthography, reading, writing, grammar, geography, and arithme- k Three grades of certificates were to be granted: a first grade on one year of successful teaching in Nebraska and valid in the y where granted for two years; a second grade, valid in like er for one year; a third grade valid in a specified precinct for ore than six months. No distinction was made as to the branches ich the applicant was required to pass examination. Another important act of the legislature of 1869 led to the es - tablishing of the city examining committee for the certification of teachers in cities. When Omaha became the territorial capital its citizens furnished the grounds and contributed a goodly sum of money for the erection of the building occupied by the different departments of the territorial government. After the seat of government was moved to Lincoln the state legislature, by the act of February 4, 1869, ceded to the people of Omaha the vacated grounds and buildings for educa - tional purposes. This law provided for a board of regents of six mem - bers, whose duty was to manage and control the high school, college. </seg>

            <seg id="p092">EMPLOYMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS 63 4 Before the high school could be opened the legislature of 1871 passed an act which consolidated all the common school districts in th» and, with the high school, established the system of city schools for Omaha. The duties of the board of regents passed to the board of education. This board was given the power to appoint an examining committee and was forbidden to elect to a place as teacher in the Opnaha schools any one who had not secured a certificate from this committee. It was thought that the Omaha school act was unconstitutional and to overcome this defect the legislature of 1873 re-enacted its e— ■ tial provisions in a general law governing schools in cities of the first class. The provision relative to the city examining committee was re - tained and the right to revoke its certificates was reserved to the city board of education. However, the act of February 25, 1875, organiz - ing schools in cities of the second class, not only made no provision lor a city examining committee, but specifically required all teachers employed in cities of this class to inesent certificates in force granted by the county superintendent of public instruction, the state sui tendent, or the state normal school. The legislature of 1873 amended the law relative to county i cates. The third grade certificate was based on examination in the six required branches and made valid for six months in some special dis - trict. Not more than three third grade certificates could be granted to one person. The second grade certificate required examination in all third grade branches and in the history of the United States, black - board drawing, and theory and art of teaching. This certificate was valid throughout the county where granted for a term of one year. The first grade certificate included examination in all second gradt jects and in algebra, geometry, physiology, botany and natural phil - osophy. It was valid in the county in which it was granted and for a period of two years. Thus was established the idea of gradation in c ertificates based on additional academic requirements. All the laws relating to the public schools were codified in 1881 and approved as a new "Act to establish a system of public schools in the state of Nebraska." This law defined a qualified teacher and enumerated the sources from which certificates could be obtained. It provided that a certificate could be revoked only by the authority granting it. Previous to this time no one but the county superintend - ent had power to revoke any teacher's certificate. The law defined the requirements for the various kinds and grades of certificates issued by (1) the county superintendent, (2) the city examining committee, (3) the state normal and (4) the state superintendent. K^he county superintendent could endorse certificates from other ies not only in Nebraska, but in other states. He could grant on nation three grades of certificates: The third grade, based on ig satisfactory examination in the six subjects previously required </seg>
            <seg id="p093">64 10 which were added physiology and English composition; the second grade, which included in addition to the third grade subjects examina - tion in the history of the United States, civil government, bookkeeping, blackboard drawing, and theory and art of teaching; the first grade, which added algebra, geometry, botany, and natural philosophy to the second grade requirements. The third grade was valid for six months, the second for one year, and the first for two yeare. State normal school certificates were of two kinds: The element - ary, valid throughout the state for two years, was issued on com - pletion of the common school course; the normal diploma, valid for three years, was granted on completion from the higher course. Two years of successful teaching after graduation, or three yeare before, entitled the student to an additional diploma good for life. The examining committee of the board of education in cities of r.ot leas than 2,000 population was authorized to grant certificates to teach in the schools of the city, and these certificates could be revoked by the board of education for sufficient cause. The state superintendent could approve a diploma from a state normal school of another state. He could grant, without further ex - amination, a professional state certificate to a graduate of a college or university of good standing, provided the applicant held a first grade county certificate in this state. He could grant a professional state certificate to permanent teachers of high character, broad scholarship, and successful experience on passing examination in written arithmetic. United States history, reading and elocution, English grammar, com - mon and physical geography with map drawing, mathematical geo - graphy and projection, school economy, physiology, algebra, natural philosophy, chemistry, composition and rhetoric, bookkeeping, plane nnd solid geometry, plane trigonometry, geology, zoology, botany. Eng - lish literature, general history, logic, astronomy, civil government and prhool laws, history of education, and the theory and art of teaching. During the sixteen years from 1881 to 1897 not many changes were made in the school laws. In 1&amp;85 the teaching of the effects of stimulants and narcotics was made obligatory and the granting of certificates forbidden to any one who had not passed a satisfactory examination in physiology and hygiene. That same year math - ematical geography and projection. solid geometry, political fonomy, moral philosophy, logic, and astronomy were by law dropped om the list of requirements for the state professional certificate. A w for the government of schools in metropolitan cities was enacted in 1887, with the same provision as in other cities relative to the teachers' examining committee. In 1889 the law was changed to re- Kire registration of state normal diplomas or certificates with the [&gt;erintendent of the county in which the holder may be teaching. A new source of certification was established in 1897 when grad- </seg>
            <seg id="p094">65 of arts and certificates showing the completion of courses for the spe - cial training and instruction of teachers were accredited as qualified teachers. Such certificates were issued as first grade state certificates valid for three years. After three years of actual teaching these cer - tificates, if countersigned by the state superintendent, became perma - nent state professional certificates. The same legislature authorized the state superintendent, after personal inspection and approval, to issue to graduates of any college, university, or normal school certifi - cates of same tenor and effect as certificates issued to graduates of the state normal school. In 1901 the law added I'nited States history to the requirements for the third grade county certificate, and limited the number of third grades granted to one person to two instead of three. It added agri - culture to the list of second grade subjects. The provisions relative to state university certificates was extended to graduates of other Neb.raska colleges, or universities, if the state superintendent finds their courses equivalent to those in the University of Nebraska. In 190S a new division of cities of the first class was made which included those having a population between 25 and 40 thousand, but no change was made in the examining committee. Ee amendments enacted in 1905 were the most important yet a the school laws. Certificates to teach in Nebraska were to of three classes: state, county, and city certificates. State cer - i were to be issued in three grades: The professional, good for life, was issued by the state superintendent to the holder of a first grade county certificate who had taught one year and had secured satis - factory grades in chemistry, English literature, general history, geo - logy, physical geography, plane trigonometry, pyschology, rhetoric, and zoology. The state superintendent could also issue the profes - sional certificate to college graduates, normal school graduates, and holders of professional certificates from other states. First grade state certificates were issued with the approval of the state superintendent, by state and other institutions authorized to grant them, and the sec - ond grade state by the state normal and other schools recognixed on the same basis. The basis of county certificates was fundamentally changed. The authority to prepare questions and grade papers of all applicants was placed in the hands of the state superintendent or of a committee ap - pointed by him. The county superintendent retained the power to issue certificates on the grades reported by the state superintendent, pro - vided he was satisfied as to the applicant's moral character and aptness to teach and govern a school. Kd grade county certificates were based on satisfactory examin - orthography, reading, penmanship, geography, arithmetic, y and hygiene, English composition. English grammar, and </seg>

Second grades were 3d on examination in civil government, bookkeeping, blackboard drawing, theory and art of teaching, and agriculture in addition to third grade subjects and a year's experience in teaching or eight week's rormal training in an approved school. The second grade was valid for at least one year and not more than two years. The first grade required examination in all second grade subjects and in algebra, botany, geom - etry, and physics. It also required at least twelve weeks of normal training in some approved training school or not less than one year's Kerience in teaching. It was valid for not less than two years and to exceed three years. No changes were made in the city certificates, either in the manner of issuing or of revoking them, in cities of any class. The amendments of 1905 also defined the qualifications of a high pchool teacher as not to be less than graduation from a regular four year college or university course, or of the advanced normal course of a college, university or normal school, or the holding of a professional state certificate. For the grades below the high school department in any city school the qualification wae fixed at the county second grade as a minimum. fThe state normal school act was amended to make necessary regis - ion of certificates and diplomas with the county superintendent of county in which the holder should teach. The same provision was nded to all elementary state certificates and professional state cer - ates. In 1907 an act was passed to establish a county high school to bo controlled by a body known as a board of trustees. This board whs authorized to issue certificates and diplomas to students completing the course of study and these certificates were to have such force and effect as mfght be determined by the state superintendent to entitle the holder to teach in any of the schools of the county for the space of three years without further examination. EThe legislature of 1911 made no important changes relative to the nee of county or state certificates or certificates issued by the ty high school. But an amendment was passed requiring city certificates to be issued as state certificates, under rules prescribed by the state superintendent of public instruction. It further provided that "No person shall be elected to a position in any city school as teacher principal, supervisor, or superintendent who does not hold the legal city certificate entitling him to teach the grades or subjects to which elected." However, this law was not made to apply to city schools governed by Subdivision XlVa and XVII, Which apply respect - ively' to South Omaha and Omaha. </seg>

Pe development of Nebraska's system of public instruction since ay be traced in the evolution of the teacher's certificatt titication was in charge of a local authority exclusively, without definite list of required subjects in which examination should o.

The mission of the state normal school is the preparation of trained teachers, and today there are no less than four such schools issuing certificates, besides the State University and eleven private and denominational schools, approved by the state super - intendent, doing a similar work. PWith the organization of the system of city schools for Omaha in I a new source of certification was recognized, that of the examin - conunittee of the board of education. Eventually the power to ap - point similar committees was delegated to boards of education of all cities. But the law of 1911 abolished these committees, except in the c'ties of Omaha and South Omaha, and gave the state department the power to issue city certificates. As far back as 1869 the law indirectly recognized certificates issued by the etate superintendent but previous to 1876 no certificates were issued by him. However, in 1881 his duties in this respect were clearly defined. The power of the state department of public instruction has been extended from time to time until now it has to do directly or in - directly with every certificate in force in Nebraska except those granted by the examining committee in- the cities of Omaha and South Omaha. Erhe requirements in educational preparation for teachers have raised almost from the three R's to a good high school education iral teachers and for city teachers in grades below the high school e equivalent of graduation from tae standard normal ana ior school teachers the completion of the standard college course. A study of the history of certification shows two growing ten - dencies: The first is centralization of authority to grant certificates, and the second is better qualifications for teachers of every grade. Better schools demand better teaching, better teaching comes from better preparation for teaching, and better preparation depends on placing the authority to grant certificates in responsible and expert educational hands. </seg>
            <seg id="p097">68 CITY CERTIFICATES Anna V. Day, Assistant State Superintendent Until the summer of 1911 there had been no provision for uni - form certification of the teachers employed in schools organized under subdivision 14. Each district worked out its own scheme and made its Kn rules. The result was that in many cases teachers of mediocre ilifications were able to secure positions in our best schools. Since there are in the state forty-eight districts organized under this subdivision employing about thirteen hundred teachers, the sit - uation was more or less serious, not only to the schools but to the teachers as well. In order to improve the situation, Supt. Crabtree secured the pass - age of a law providing that the teachers in all such schools should be cer - tificated through the state department. Rules governing the issuance of these certificates were to be formulated by the department. A commit - tee of three members, — Superintendent A. L. Caviness of Fairbury. Superintendent Elizabeth Bettcher of McCook, and Superintendent Alice Florer of York, — was appointed, and immediately took up the Ksideration of the subject. The rules which follow were the result. y have met the need remarkably well and require but little revision. Six classes of certificates are called for, — Kindergarten, primary, grammar, high school, supervisor, and superintendent. There are three grades of each class except the superintendent. Of this there are The lowest or second grade certificate is good for one year; the first grade for three, and the professional for life. The first grade county certificate is the basis for all city certificates, and no city certi - ficate is issued unless the applicant has done some professional work. Psychology is required for all certificates. Up to this time 2,764 certificates Have been issued, — 900 of them professional, 861 first grade and 828 second grade. Owing to the mis - understandings which attend the introduction of any new system, some schools and some teachers were not ready for the regular certificate on September 1. To meet this condition, emergencies were issued, valid until the returns from the first regular examination should be el. One hundred and seventy-five such certificates were required, lers of which wrote on the missing subjects during the Novem - mination. As this system becomes more firmly established it will inevitably result in producing a corps of teachers professionally alert, and of even better scholarship than has been found in Nebraska schools in the past. The best thing about it is the practical impossibility of any teacher becoming stagnant, or getting into a rut. Conditions for renewal </seg>
            <seg id="p098">69 GENERAL LIFE CERTIFICATES Jennie B. Adams, Secretary State Department of Education. Eate professional certificates, qualifying the holder to teach for life raska. are of two general classes: City state certificates and state certificates. The rules and regulations governing the e of city state professional certificates are given elsewhere. General state professional certificates are issued by the state normal schools and the state superintendent of public instruction. The University of Nebraska, and institutions approved by the state superintendent on the basis of courses similar in subject and equal in extent to the courses offered by the university and the state normal schools, are authorized to grant first grade state certificates, which are K verted into life certificates by the countersignature of the state erintendent, when the holder submits evidence of three years' suc - iful teaching experience. Bring the past two years from September, 1910, to September, ife certificates (or diplomas) have been issued by the state schools, as follows: Peru 258: Kearney, 118: Wayne 14; i 2; total 392. The state superintendent has countersigned certificates from the University of Nebraska and various approved insti - tutions, during the same period, as follows: University of Nebraska 53 university certificates, emergency 2; Bellevue College, 10 college certificates, 5 normal school: Cotner University, 1 college, 3 normal school; Creighton University, 1 college; Doane College, 6 college; Fremont College, 30 normal; Hastings College, 5 college; Nebraska Wesleyan University, 17 college, 12 normal; Nebraska Normal College (Wayne), 11 normal; York College, 1 college, 4 normal; a total of 94 college certificates and 67 normal school certificates. Life certificates have been issued by the state superintendent from September, 1910, to September, 1912, as follows: Based on college graduation, three years' teaching experience in Nebraska, and a Nebraska first grade county certificate, 65; based on graduation from a standard normal school with a diploma good for life in the state where issued. 45 (about one-half of those certificates were granted on life diplomas from Pennsylvania state normal schools) ; based on a life certificate from another state, the equivalent of the life certificate in Nebraska, 53; baaed on examination in nine subjects beyond those required for the first grade county certificate, a first grade county cer - tificate, and one year's teaching experience in Nebraska, 53; total 206. KEPORT OF BOARD OF INSPECTORS AM) EXAMINERS KOK STATE AND LIFE CERTIFICATES. State Superintendent James E. Delzell, — The Board of Inspectors and Examiners for State and Life Certi - ficates respectfully submit to you the following general report of their </seg>
            <seg id="p099">70 There has been nothing strikingly different in the character of the work of this Board in the above mentioned period from that of others who have carried on the work previous thereto. In fact the work has been a substantial carrying forward of work already inaugu - rated by preceding boards or more fully completing plans laid out by The work of the board in quite definitely suggested by its name. vii: Inspectors and Examiners for State and Life Certificates, and a report upon that work seems naturally to classify into the two heads, Inspection and Examination. Inspection Ris definitely known by those who have given the subject of cer - on through accredjtment any thought that a multiplication sources of certification calls for some form of inspection with the e of standardizing the work leading to the issuance of the various grades of state certificates. At the present time there are seventeen different institutions approved by the state department of education for the issuance of state certificates. These institutions lrom the character of the work which they offer in preparation for certification divide more or less de - finitely into two groups, — those preparing for University and College rst Grade State Certificates, and those preparing for Elementary Second Grade State and Normal First Grade State Certificates. tThe State University alone determines the standard of preparation the University and College First Grade certificates; the four i Normal schools set the standard for the preparation for the Ele - ary or Second Grade and the Normal First Grade State certificates. Pias sometimes been assumed that inspection of the various state ons is superfluous. Were these institutions the only ones pre - heir students to receive the various grades of state certificates ight be some slight grounds for the assumption. Even then 1 business management would dictate that when an institution i certificate with the concurrence of an outside department, the concurring department should have representation in the determin - ation of the sufficiency of preparation. This need is more emnlmic when several institutions under varying conditions of equipment, teach - ing force, and student body assume to establish the standard for other institutions granting the same grades of certificates. Without reference to other institutions, it is well to have an independent intermediary body among these institutions having the privilege of suggestion toward standardizing and unifying work. Inspection of the state schools finds its great necessity, however, in the fact that they determine the standards for the other institutions, and unless the Board of Inspectors acquaint themselves with those standards they can not use them in the measurement of the work of others. The Board could not acquaint themselves with the standards unless they visited the factories where the standards are made to de- </seg>
            <seg id="p100">71 termine not only the paper claims for the excellence of material and workmanship which go into those standards but to see the machinery of the factories, to watch a little the process of manufacturing, and to rnake note of the more or less raw materials used. In inspection the Board generally at the time of the visit to any institution are given by the management of the institution the privilege of going anywhere about the building. The Board usually do this, noting the quality of the care and upkeep of the building, the sufficiency of laboratory resources to do the work professed to be done., the siie of the library and its adaptability for the work claimed, and the general equipment in office, chapel, laboratories, and class rooms. The Board visit as many classes as their necessarily limited visits will permit, not - ing in them the type of students taking the work, determining the quality of instruction and the spirit of the instructor; they note the quality of board work done by the students, or exhibited before them as models by the instructors, observe the responsiveness of the students in class to determine whether the spirit of initiative developed in those classes give promise of successful teaching by those who display it. EThe Board make note of all of these things observed and then dis - them among themselves, and when it is thought that probable good come of it, they discuss them with the head of the institution or with lead of the department in which the noted work is done. Wherever there is a model school in connection with the insti - tution, whether organized and maintained solely for observational and practice purposes, or whether such school is an academy used incidental - ly for observational and practice purposes, the Board spend considerable time in it observing and noting the work as fully as mentioned above in the regular institutional classes, and discussing the work as indicated above. Always at the time of inspection of the non-state institutions, ob - servation and discussion is with the standards established by the state institutions in mind. The purpose in this is, of course, to standardize the work of all institutions. The effort at standardization inaugurated by preceding Boards of Inspectors and continued by this Board has been remarkably success - ful. The success finds its chief evidence in the fact that whereas a few years ago several institutions were asking credit for work done in var - ied lengths of terms now none are approved unless they give satisfactory work, and ask credit but for a full term of eighteen weeks, the time standard of the university and normal schools; a secondary evidence of the success of the effort at standardization is found in the fact that all institutions have begun making positive effort at observation and practice teaching in schools or departments of their own, and based upon such work done in the state schools. Examination That any form of examination of the credentials of applicants </seg>
            <seg id="p101">72 of the institutions desirous of granting these certificates has, at some times during the last biennium, been resented by some of them. The Board have not felt, and do not feel, tnat any institution has any just grounds for resentment at the right of examination based upon any of - ficial act of the Board, for they have always attempted to extend to every applicant for certificate every courtesy and credit to which he was entitled upon the showing made by the reports of subject and time credits in the hands of the Board and issued from the office of the institution. The need of examination of credentials from the various insti - tutions is disclosed more by the fact that, being as humanly careful as they can, the office force frequently makes mistakes in recording &lt; redits, and the most frequent mistakes are those of omniission. For the reason that all applications are checked up against the requirements determined by the authorities of the state institutions, both students and registrars, or other authorities choosing or assigning work, are planning better than in years gone by, and work when finished more surely checks out satisfactorily. So definitely do these applications from some of the institutions check up that the Board feel that to re-check them is almost a superfluous task. This is not so from som&lt;&gt; of the other state institutions where apparently, for some reason or other. Krk has not been so accurately credited, or not so surely assi - 1 taken. Ee Board is pleased to report that in all institutions issuing cer - there is a far greater accuracy and a fuller compliance with nents for the issuance of certificates than at the beginning of inium. The Board of Inspectors and Examiners feel that this report should not close without their expressing to you, and they hope through this report to the heads and faculties of the various institutions, their fullest appreciation for the many and never failing courtesies shown to the r»rd by those heads and faculties, whenever official duty called all a part of the Board to any of the institutions.

There has been a slight increase in the number of these papers every year since the certification law was passed placing the examination of papers in the state department rather than under the direction of the county superintendent.

BThe total number of county certificates issued for the year begin- July, 1911, as follows: First grade "with honor," 110, 'with it," 181, regular, 656, total, 947; second grade, 'with honor, " 131. h credit," 552, regular. 3,666, total, 4,349; third grade, 895; rgency, 342; total number, 6,573. Ris interesting to note the number of graduates from normal g high schools in Nebraska for the past year, most of whom have d certificates and are now engaged in teaching. There were lormal training graduates, exclusive of academies last year, and duates from academies, which makes a total of practically 1,400. Most of these graduates are teaching on second grade county certifi - cates, a few upon third grade. For such graduates the first grade sub - jects may be used on county certificates, if the county superintendent is willing to accept them. In most counties, these grades are accepted ; in a few counties, only a part of them are accepted. The provision for the issuance of emergency certificates is a wise one. During the past year there was a scarcity of teachers in some of the western counties and the only way by which certain schools could have teachers was to issue emergency certificates. The time has not yet come when this class of certificate can be done away with. Often - times, in some of the most populous counties of the state these certifi - cates are called for. During the past year examinations were given in the months of January, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and No - vember. Up until two years ago, examinations were given every month regardless of the number writing on the examination. Two years ago the rule was changed so that examinations would be given four times a year regularly. Special examinations were given in addition to these upon the requests of five county superintendents at least thirty days before the regular time for holding the monthly examination. You will note from the above that requests were received for five special examinations during the year. There is but little doubt that examina - tions four times a year will be sufficient as soon as the teachers be - come accustomed to the new regulation. ■&gt;n the whole, the rules governing the issuance of county eertifi - are very satisfactory. Now and then objections are heard, but </seg>

It is hoped that the present system may cou tinue with but few alterations, since it is difficult (or all the teacher concerned to become familiar with new rules and regulations COMPLETE RULES 1911.

Staley Superior PREFACE This little book is published for the information of district school boards, county superintendents, boards of education, city superintend- ents, and teachers generally. It should be carefully preserved for future use, as it supersedes all former publications on the issuing of teachers' certificates. Nebraska has recently added to her many excellent school laws a new and progressive measure on certification of teachers in city schools. It is intended to bring about uniformity in city certificates, to eliminate improper influences in the selection of teachers and to furnish an in- centive to higher professional attainment by providing an easy and natural gradation in certificates from the lowest to the highest. The progressive teacher ought to be protected by reasonable standards, and school boards should be furnished with reliable infor- mation on the face of the certificate as to the fitness of the teacher for the particular position. The state department desires to express sincere appreciation to the many city and county superintendents and other educators who have aided in working out this scheme of certification, by means of sugges- tions and criticism; to the committee appointed by the University School of Superintendence, whose names are given on another page for expert and valuable suggestion and for final approval of the com- pleted plan; and to the state board of examiners for the able manner </seg>
            <seg id="p104">75 in which it has handled the many problems encountered from the out - set; and to the chairman of this committee, to whom all are greatly - indebted for the logic and thoroughness of the outline and the well balanced system of the whole scheme. May we not look upon this bul - letin as a very valuable state paper. .1. W. CRABTREE. Lincoln, Nebraska, August 15, 1911. EMPLOYMENT OF TEACHERS. I. Qualified Teachers. (a) In general: No person shall be accounted a qualified teacher, within the meaning of the law, who has not a certificate in force. School Laws, Sec. 1, Subd. IX. A school board cannot make a contract that will bind the dis - trict with a teacher who does not hold a valid certificate, and members of the board will be personally liable to the district for money paid to a teacher who is not legally qualified. 13 Neb. 52. (b) In high school districts (Subd. VI.): No person shall be granted a certificate to teach in the high school department of any high school district who is not a graduate from a regular four year course of a college or university or a graduate of the advanced course of a Erd normal school, or who does not hold a professional state cer - i obtained from the state superintendent on examination Laws, Sec. 17, Subd. IXa. No person shall be eligible to teach in the grades below the high school department in any high school district who does not hold at least a county second grade certificate or the equivalent. See School Laws, Sec. 17, Subd. IXa. (c) In cities (Subd. XIV): No person shall be elected to a posi - tion in any city school as teacher, principal, supervisor, or superintend - ent who does not hold the legal city certificate entitling him to teach in the grades or subjects to which elected. School Laws, Sec. 19, Subd. IX. II. Election of Te»ohers. Superintendent: The board of education may at any regular meet - ing elect one superintendent of public instruction, at such salary as the board may deem best, and they may enter into contract with him for a term of not to exceed three years. Teachers: The election of superintendent and teachers shall be by ballot, and no person shall be declared elected except he rt - the vote of a majority of all members of the board. See School Laws, Sec. 8, Subd. XIV. Note 1: It is held that the board of education is a con- tinuous body and may elect teachers at any time. It is urged that they do this not later each year than the regular meeting in May. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">76 Note 2: It is held that no teacher, principal, or super - intendent can be legally employed except by a formal election at a meeting of the school board. This applies to schools in districts organized under Subdivision VI as well as XIV. Note 3 : School officers are urged to make the tenure of the teacher's office more permanent. In many states one election is sufficient during satisfactory service, and is termi - minated only by reasonable notice by either party. III. Contracts with Teachers. Ra) Legal contract: A legal contract cannot be made with a tr who is not properly qualified. Members of the board should e applicant's certificate, as it is a necessary evidence of qualifi - . The contract should be signed on the part of the district by' the president and secretary of the board of education and by the teacher. It should be made out in duplicate and specify the wagefe per month, the length of term, and the duties to be performed. However, a con - tract need not be in writing, provided it can be proved that the teacher was elected by the board, that he was notified of such election and clearly indicated his acceptance of it. See Decisions, Sec. 11, Subd. IV, School Laws. (b) Violation of contract: Either party violating the provisions of a teacher's conduct would be answerable in damages to the aggrieved party. In case a teacher breaks a contract the board has a right of action on the original contract and may maintain: (1) A suit to obtain damages for loss sustained by the breach; (2) a suit to obtain specific performtfnbf of the contract by the teacher. Or, if the court were to find it difficult to assess damages, or should fail to enforce a specific performance because it cannot supervise or insure its execution, they could, by injunction, enforce the promise not to teach elsewhere during the time covered by the injunction. See Clark on Contract, 702. IV. Discharge of Teachers. (a) By action of the board: A school board has the right to dis - charge a teacher for cause. The only course then open to the teacher in an action for damages, and the question of drawing pay for the full time of the contract would be determined by process of law. See Decisions. Sec. 11, Subd. IV, School Laws. Eb) By revocation of certificate: The revocation of the certificate terminate the employment of a teacher in the school where he may be employed. Only the authority granting a certificate has the power to revoke it and then only for such cause as would have re - quired such authority to refuse to grant it if known at the time.

Provided: That the passing standing ■hall not be less than 80 per cent in any subject; provided further, that </seg>
            <seg id="p126">97 t determining the corresponding grade of certificate this recognition of dits shall apply to any certificate regardless of territorial restric - ns in the state wherein the certificate was issued. R Equivalent credits for any subject or subjects may be accepted discretion of the proper authority of the state wherein reeogni - sought. 3. Credit for successful experience may be allowed in accordance with the regulations in force in the state where recognition is sought. Recognition of Diplomas or Certificate* from Standard Normal School*. By a standard normal school is meant a school meeting the follow - ing requirements: BFor entrance, four years' work above the eighth grade in an ited secondary school. E2. For graduation therefrom, two years' additional work, in - ling a thorough review of the common branches and training in a ctice school. E3. The maintenance of a well equipped training school for obser - :on and practice, such school to cover work in the eighth elementary des. E4. The total attendance in the secondary school and in the nor - school shall be 216 weeks above the eighth grade, provided, that normal school may accept satisfactory credits covering twenty s' work above the eighth grade. RECOGNITION OF DIPLOMAS FROM STANDARD COLLEGES AM) UNIVERSITIES. A diploma from a standard college or university granted upon tne completion of a 120 hour course including fifteen hours in education shall be recognized. Definition of a standard college or university. To be considered a standard college, all of the following conditions must be fully met: ■ The completion of a four year secondary course above the grade shall be required for college entrance. P2. The completion of 120 semester hours shall be required for uation. 3. The number of class hours for the heads of departments and for students shall not exceed twenty a week. 4. A faculty properly qualified shall consist entirely of graduates of standard colleges and each head of a department shall hold at least a master's degree from a standard college or have attained eminent success as a teacher, which success shall be determined by the chief state school officer of the state in which the institution ie located. 5. The library shall consist of at least 5,000 volumes, selected with reference to college subjects and exclusive of public documents. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">98 6. The laboratory equipment shall be sufficient to establish efficient laboratories in all laboratory courses offered. E7. The means of support is denned as requiring a permanent en - ment of not less than $200,000, or an assured fixed annual income usive of tuition of at least $10,000; provided that this requirement shall not be mandatory until five years after the institution has been recognized. The college must maintain at least seven separate depart - ments or chairs in the arts and sciences. In case the pedagogical work of the institution is to be accepted for certification, the college must maintain at least eight chairs, one of which shall be devoted exclusively to education or at least to philosophy, including psychology and educa - tion. The head of each department shall, in no case, devote less than three-fifths of his time to college work. Note: The rules governing the issuance of certificates in Nebraska carry out the above principles and suggestions. RECOGNITION OF RKAIHXO CIRCMC WORK 1. A vital connection is made between the reading circle work and certification. For the year 1911-1912, the County Superintendent may allow five per cent to be added to the grade in Theory and Art or Reading on Colgrove's The Teacher and the School, five per cent to be added to the grade in History on Hoyt's History of Education or on Winahip's Great American Educators; five per cent to be added to the grade in English Composition on Cabot's Ethics for Children. Raising a grade by means of reading circle credits counts the same in reissuing a certificate as raising the grade on examination. 2. The State Superintendent gives additional recognition for read - ing circle work by providing an examination at the end of every year in each reading circle subject. For the school year 1911-1912 one exam - ination in Theory of Education will be based on the reading circle work of the year in Colgrove's The Teacher and the School; one examina - tion in History of Education will be based on Hoyt's History of Educa - tion; one examination in General History in which six of the questions Kl be based on Winship's Great American Educators. Grades made this examination will be recorded at the State Department, to be ced on the city state certificate when desired. 3. The following is assigned as a topic for the "papers" required for the first grade city certificates: Teaching morals and manners in the grades. Replace the dash with kindergarten, primary. grammar or high school, depending on the certificate desired. The paper may be based largely on Cabot's Ethics for Children, and ehould contain more than a thousand words. The paper may be sent in as a part of the examination, or the work may be done under the direction of the county or city superintendent, college or normal school, and the grade submitted by the proper authority. Candidates have the priv- </seg>
            <seg id="p128">99 ilege, however, of writing on other topics instead of the one assigned. 4. Students and others preparing to teach, who do the reading circle work as outlined, may have the same recognition of grades on their certificates as those who are teaching. bo. See the reading circle bulletin for more complete outlines suggestions. The rules in this bulletin supersede the rules in the ing circle bulletin on reissuing certificates. 6. The County Superintendent has a legal right to refuse to re - issue a certificate to any teacher who has failed to do the required reading circle work. At present each county superintendent determines for himself the lowest amount of reading circle work he will accept as meeting the legal requirements for his county.

            <seg id="p145">APPROVAL OF NON-ACCREDITED SCHOOLS UNDER THE FREE HIGH SCHOOL LAW Robert I. Elliott, Deputy State Superintendent It is not necessary at this time to enter into a discussion of the reason for inaugurating a system of approving non-accredited schools. As soon as the free high school law was passed giving pupils the benefit of free high school tuition, it was necessary that schools which were not accredited to the University should be approved by the state depart - ment in order that tuition could be collected under the free high school CThis year for the first time since the approving of schools was in - urated, schools have been approved as third class schools. A num - ber of schools have received this approval, which under the former sys - tem could not have received any approval. This class was added for a type of schools which technically could not meet the requirements, but which because of excellent work and general efficiency are entitled to some kind of recognition. Altogether this year this department has approved eight schools of this class. The noticeable decrease in the number of approved schools from year to year speaks well for the improvement in and the effici - ency of the school system in Nebraska. The decrease is due almost entirely to the fact that schools which were formerly approved are now accredited to the State University and hence are not placed upon the ap - proved list at all. In the year 1910-1911 there were 127 four year high schools of the first class. In the year 1911-1912 there were five four year high schools of the first class. In the year 1912-1913, thus far, six schools have been approved as four year high schools of the first class. This simply shows a remarkable increase in the number of accredited schools. As a general rule schools which are approved by this department (four year high schools of the first class are placed upon the accredited : for the following year unless there is a noticeable decrease in effi - ncy and equipment. Generally speaking, there is one objection which this department gnizes in approving schools and a word of caution may not be amiss. Some schools are willing to sacrifice quality for quantity in order that they may receive some kind of approval for high school work. In such cases the grades are sacrificed for the sake of the high school. This works a rank injustice for the present as well as the </seg>
            <seg id="p146">117 future of the school and principals canot use too much care and judg - ment in such matters. Many schools approved as second class schools make application the following year for the approv tl with one advanced grade. Oftentimes such schools receive the approval asked for. In most i-asee. however, it would be much better for the standing of the school and the scholars in general if such schools were made first class schools in - stead of being advanced a grade as second class schools. The approval of schools depends largely but not entirely upon the recommendation of the county superintendent. The first schools to be visited after school starts in the fall should be these non-accredited schools. After receiving recommendation from the county superintend - ent the applications are looked over carefully and checked by this de - partment. The showing made upon the application together with the rec - ommendation made by the county superintendent determines the class cf approval which the school can receive. If the recommendation of the county superintendent and the application from the principal reach this office later than the first of November, schools are not classit: the Education Directory as approved tchools. Each year some schools do not receive reccgnition in the Education Directory because of the lateness in receiving reports from them. Other schools act upon the assumption that they will be approved by this de- I.artment for advanced work and accordingly enroll non-resident pupils with the idea of collecting tuition anJ then attempt to virtually force this department to apprave the schools or let the dstrict sun inancial loss. Schools should be exceedingly careful and exceedingly cautious not to hold out any idea to pupils which they cannot live up to, absolutely. Blany non-accredited schools are doing work on a par with ac - &amp;d schools. Some do not, but it is hoped that such an advance - will be made that the grades in all schools may do as good work grades in the accredited schools are doing. There is a vast difference in the type and general efficiency of ap - proved schools. In some schools the organization is excellent; dis - cipline of a high standard, and conditions splendid in general. In other schools which are technically entitled to approval, conditions are gen - erally not of the best. The general spirit of the pupils and organisa - tion, the ability of the teachers to get results, and the equipment are not up to the standard, but according to the rules such schools are technically entitled to some kind of approval. E; the past year, some country schools have been approved Inth grade work. This is only done in rare caaee, where the thoroughly qualified, holding at least a first grade county ir its equivalent, and where several grades are missing so time may be given to the grade work and high school ill. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">118 EWith the number of schools to inspect, it has been impossible for suite department to cover the ground and for this reason the county erintendents have been made the official inspectors. It is worthy of note that they have always been prompt in their inspection and their reports to this department upon the whole show much care and good judgment. The principals and teachers have been willing to co-operate with £ county superintendents and the state department, and all working ther have brought about much progress and efficiency in this class Approved Schools for the Year 1912-1913. To the Principals of Non-accredited Schools. Progressive teachers are always thinking of ways to improve them - selves as well as their schools, more especially at this time of year when we are making new resolutions and new plans. The approval of non-accredited schools by this department de - pends upon the educational qualifications of the teachers, the course of study, the length of recitation periods, the amount and kind of equip - ment, the number of teachers and the general management of the school. Have you asked your Board of Education to improve conditions by the purchase of more equipment or the addition of another teacher? Most school boards are willing to do all in their power to improve their schools when they understand conditions and are convinced that the schools are securing the proper results. It may be that some of your teachers would attempt to secure higher grades of certificates if you explain to them the advantages to themselves as well as the school by so doing.

Elliott will have charge of the approval of schools for this school year. LWe are sending to the principal of each non-accredited high school Nebraska as listed in the 1911-12 Nebraska Education Directory, three copies of blank report of high schools under the free high school law. The principal of each non-accredited high school is requested to fill out the three blank reports promptly; mail one copy to me, one to the county superintendent, and file one copy with the school district records. In the copy of the report sent to this office, the blank application on page 3 should be filled out and signed by the secretary of the board of education. High schools cannot be approved for educating non-resi - dent pupils under the free high school law until the proper report and attached application is received at this office. The county superintendent is recognized as ex-officio county in - spector of non-accredited high schools. He is requested to inspect carefully each non-accredited high school in the county and report recommendations to me. The county superintendent in the inspection of non-accredited high schools should compare the equipment, course of study, the work being done, and the corps of teachers with the offi - cial report of the principal made to this office. The free high school law makes the Nebraska High School Manual the standard by which high school courses of study are measured. The principal points to be considered in the approval of high school courses of study are the following: (1) Subjects given and arrangement of subjects in program of studies. k(2) Time of recitation given to each class. This should b than the minimum named in the high school manual, which is 40 utes. (3) Equipment for successfully carrying out the work given. This </seg>

There are schools attempting to teach too many subjects with a limited high school fac - ulty. Do not crowd the teachers by attempting too many grades. We would much prefer that you do the work well as far as you go. There is danger also of giving the grade teachers more work than they can handle properly in order to give more time to the high school subjects. It is a mistake to strengthen the high school work at the expense of the grades. I hope you will not make the mistake of crowding the grades in order to advance the high school. The law provides that 75 cents per week tuition be paid by the borne district to non-resident pupils for high school attendance in ap - proved high schools. In justice to the district paying the tuition no fcchool should expect to be approved for receiving pay for instruction where such instruction is not of the quality demanded by law. The school district compelled to pay 75 cents per week high school tuition should be assured that the high school receiving such tuition is giv - ing 75 cents' worth of service per week. The advantages to a high school which complies with the requirements of the free high school law are important, among which are these: ■1) In order to be approved the high school must maintain a high of good standard. This benefits resident pupils as much as non - it pupils. (2) The 75 cents per week tuition is a help financially to the dis - trict in maintaining a good school. (3) The graduates of an approved high school can go from such high school to advanced grades in other high schools and without break in their work receive full credit for all work done in the home school. This applies also to college entrance requirements. Classes of High Schools. In a circular letter to you some time ago I called your attention to the new classification of approved schools for the coming year. I desire to call your attention again to this classification in order that </seg>
            <seg id="p151">121 Heretofore, we have had two classes of approved schools. This &gt;ear a third class has been added. First class: Those meeting the full requirements as outlined in the Nebraska High School Manual. This includes all three and four Ehigh schools accredited to the University of Nebraska, and all one two year high schools meeting the full requirements as to course udy, equipment and teaching force. Second class: Those failing in some minor points to meet the full requirements of the high school manual, but which, on account of small attendance or other reasons, are doing the proper standard of Third class: Those schools organized under subdivision 3 of the school laws having equipment and teaching force which do not always meet the requirements for schools organized under subdivision 6 of the school laws, but which are entitled to approval because of the excel - lency of their work and the results obtained. Nine grade schools with two teachers may be approved as third class. EHigh schools approved as first, second, or third class schools will entitled to collect tuition from non-resident pupils under the free i school law. L Pupils completing high school grades in the first class high school recommended to the county superintendent as eligible to county high school certificates without further examination. EThe approval of high schools under the free high school law is one year only. Schools approved last year must be approved again this year before they are entitled to collect tuition under the free i school law. The principal of non-accredited schools should be careful in mak - ing out reports. If all items are not included in the report it is neces - sary to send the blanks back to the principal for a second report, and in some cases it has been necessary to return the blanks two or three times before securing the accurate report. The sooner an accurate re - port is received by this office, the sooner will your school receive a definite answer relative to the approval. A prompt and accurate report talso necessary in order that approval may be indicated in the educa - ■n directory for 1912-1913. Do not neglect, in reporting to this office, to have the blank ap - plication on page 3 filled out and signed by the secretary of the Board of Education. The county superintendent's office is the clearing house for each county in carrying out the provisions of the free high school law. The issuance of county free high school certificates, the inspection of free high schools, the settlement of questions relative to the attendance of non-resident pupils and payment of tuition therefor are important matters which require careful adjustment and well kept records, which will not only enable the county superintendent to have a complete </seg>
            <seg id="p152">122 knowledge of the record of each non-resident pupil of the county and of the work being done for such pupils by free high school districts, but which will enable school districts paying free high school tuition to know that the high school education for which they pay has been prop - erly given to the proper persons. EThe work is much facilitated by the use of proper blanks. The . for any county is small. The county superintendent should pro - s the proper blanks and supply each free high school district with icient blanks for use each year. The free high school law has meant much to many boys and girls in Nebraska. It has given an opportunity to the boys and girls from the country districts, who have been unable to receive high school training in their own community, to get this training in good high schools. This law in a measure gives the boys and girls in the coun - try the same advantages that the boys and girls in the city have in an educational way. The ruling of the district judges in the case before the court was that the law is not constitutional where the high school does not give 75 cents per week worth of instruction even though such high school should be approved by this department. We shall, therefore, care - fully guard against approval of any high school which does not meet the requirements of law. I call your attention to the new High School Manual issued Jointly by the state university and state department of education for the year 1912. You will find many suggestions in this manual which will 'be helpful to you in arranging your program for the year. Make note of the fact that considerable attention and space is given in this man - ual to a course in agriculture. This department calls your attention to this course because of the emphasis which the subject of agriculture is receiving, not only in this state, but in other states. We are anxious that better work be done this year than has been done thus far in approved schools. The kind of work depends largely upon the initiative and management of the principal in charge as well as the corps of teachers. You are at liberty to call upon us at any time we can be of service to you in the way of suggesting or helping to plan the program or course. It will be impossible for us to visit all of the non-accredited schools, but we desire to visit as many as possible and to aid in every way to make the school successful. Some schools on the approved list in Nebraska are doing work which will compare very favorably with the work being done in the accredited schools. It is hoped that all ap - proved schools may soon reach this standard. Very truly yours, JAMES E. DELZELL, </seg>

To County Superintendents: January 2u, 1911. tThe state department of education will permit rural schools under :ain conditions to offer ninth grade subjects and will recognize the des earned as high school grades. In order to gain this recognition: 1. The teacher must hold a first grade certificate or must have completed the work of a twelve year school. 2. The school must be properly equipped. 3. The attendance must be small enough so as to allow ample time for recitations in the higher subjects. 14. The application for permission must be made by the county perintendent and recommended by him. Very truly J. W. CRABTREE. State Superintendent. KIGHTH (iKAIIK EXAMINATIONS. My Dear Superintendent: January 27. 1 !♦ 1 2 Enclosed please find circular governing the eighth grade examina - tions for the current year. Lin order that the questions may be of a nature which will be uni - rsally satisfactory, each superintendent is requested to send to this office two questions on each subject required. Please have these ques - tions in by February 15. A test in drawing will be given this year which may be used at the option of the county superintendent. All questions should follow closely the work as outlined in the course of study. Last year 6,908 pupils passed these examinations and 5,898 free high, school certificates were issued. The largest classes in the state were: Lancaster, 233; Dcuglas, 200; Furnas, 194; Otoe, 192; Custer. 187; Gage, 185, and Burt, 181. This year should see even more pupils successfully taking the test. It is the most practical and effective means we have of judging whether or not the work being done through all the grades in the rural schools is thorough and satisfactory. Please report by February 13 the number of sets of questions needed in your county, counting one set for each pupil. Sincerely yours, A.\.\A \ . 1JA l . </seg>

            <seg id="p156">R regard to the findings of the committee appointed by State tendent Crabtree to investigate school conditions in the western the state, Superintendent Crabtree has the following to say: Soon after beginning my work as state superintendent, I was in - formed by county superintendents and by members of the legislature of the fact that owing to a scarcity of teachers, and to other causes, many children had been deprived of school advantages during the past year in certain counties in the western portion of the state. I was requested to study conditions and to advise as to necessary changes in the laws of certification- and other school laws. In order that the results of this study of conditions would be of value as a basis for legislation, I felt that it would be necessary to center the best thought and effort of the department in that direction for a few weeks. Knsequently, a series of questions were sent out to the county super - indents of the forty counties in the western part of the state. Some of the Questions. Fl. In what districts in your county have the children been de- Bd of school advantages during the school year 1909-1910, and also school year 1910-1911? Give causes. Fin what other districts have the children been deprived of privileges for a portion of the year, owing to a scarcity of teach- 3. In what other districts, if any, has there been any delay in beginning school owing to difficulty of securing teachers properly cer - tificated? What caused the delay in each case? ■ How many of these districts could pay better salaries? How reach the legal limit in levying taxes for school purposes? K Mention each case specifically where a teacher failed to finish m, giving the reasons therefor. Have your teachers met with ty in finding boarding places? Why? 6. What per cent of your teachers hold emergency or conditional . certificates? What per cent hold third grade certificates? What per i-pnt hold second grade certificates? KHow many in your county who have taken- the examination t out would have been safe teachers? 8. What per cent of your present teaching corps taught in your lounty last year? 9. What per cent of your teachers are from homes in your own county? 10. To what extent is normal training in high schools carried on in your county? </seg>

Make suggestions regarding examination questions, emerg - ency certificates, conditional certificates. The Conference February 4, 1011 This department held conferences with county superintendents, principals, and members of school boards at the following central points: Sidney, Ainsworth, Alliance, McCook, Broken Bow. These points were chosen as the most convenient meeting places for the county superintendents of each section of the western part of the state. The purpose of each conference was not only to get facU from the county superintendents of the counties in that section of the state ,but to study the situation at such close range as to sense mat - ters from the view of the people actually concerned. Permit me to give, briefly, at this point the results of this investi - gation and to follow later with portions of the conference reports and quotations from county superintendents having an important bearing on the questions investigated. Some of the Results. 1. The children in many hundred districts, in counties west of a line drawn from Boyd county on the north through Furnas county on the south, have had no school advantages, whatever, during the past year. The children of many hundred other districts were deprived school advantages for a portion of the school year. 3. Practically all districts off the railroad now reach the max - imum levy for school purposes. U4. Over 500 districts in this section have had less than six nths of school during the past year. 5. There is practically no opportunity in this entire section for any local preparation for teaching. Out of 110 normal training high schools, only 10 are found west of the line through Boyd and Furnas counties. Nearly 400 districts in this section of the state have received te aid during the past biennium. Conditions that deprive children of school advantages, in this tion at the present time, are: (a) Inability to secure teachers. (b) Delay in securing teachers. (c) Impossible to secure boarding places for teachers. (d) Only small pupils and too far from school to attend. (e) Taxes for school purposes together with state aid not sufficient to maintain a school. (f) Teachers leaving positions shortly after beginning term. </seg>
            <seg id="p159">128 8. Scarcity of teachers due to: (a) Small supply of home teach - er*, (b) Short term of school, (c) Difficulty in securing boarding places. (d) Standards of examinations. (e) Distance from normals and colleges, (f) Experienced teachers leaving for better paying posi - fns. (g) Experienced teachers accepting places farther east because better social advantages. Present Relief, The state department believes that a school taught by one weak in scholarship is better than no school at all. I am unwilling to permit the children of any district in any county in the state to be deprived of school advantages because of a scarcity of teachers. I see many ways of remedying conditions temporarily under our present laws, but in order to meet the situation fully it seems necessary to ask for a slight rhange in the laws pertaining to teachers' certificates, giving the state trtment authority to issue permits in emergencies. This permission &gt;e guarded so that present standards will not be impaired. Final Relief. Every possible effort must be made to provide well qualified and efficient teachers for the western counties as well as for the eastern counties of the state. A careful investigation shows that normal train - ing in the high schools not only adds to the number of qualified teachers but it greatly improves the teaching service in the eastern counties. In my judgment it will be worth even more to counties farther removed from normal schools and colleges. But present requirements are too E'or the smaller high schools of the west. I therefore suggest a e in the laws regulating normal training in the high schools, g standards as they are in general yet permitting the state super - intendent to designate a high school of lower grade to give normal training in counties having no high school meeting present require - ments. These normal training high schools should offer free instruc - tion to eighth grade graduates from weak districts and to other non - resident pupils entitled to free high school privileges under the free attendance high school law. A Sample Report Ehe following report from a county superintendent is typical of the s received from county superintendents in answer to the ques - sent out from this office February 1. It certainly gives a good t into actual conditions: E Children in the following districts of this county were deprived ool advantages in 1909-1910, districts Nob. 7, 24, 31, 36, 51, 70. d T.'i. Teachers could not be obtained at all in same. Other dis - had only three to six pupils, and these living over five miles the school. In most cases the roads were bad, through canons </seg>

Besides these districts, Nob. , 29, 40 and 58 had short terms because of not getting teachers all terms. "District No. 14 was late in beginning, having waited for applica - tions; No. 17 refused to accept non-resident teacher, and the home teacher could not qualify; No. 24 received applications late and teacher could not qualify; No. 26 could not pay the wages asked; No not provide boarding place for teacher until late; No. 30, no resident applicants, wages and board not satisfactory to non-residents; No. 37. hard school to manage and few applications; No. 40, had no non-resi - dent applicants until late; No. 41 waited a long time for teacher to qualify; No. 43. board hard to secure; No. 44, small pay. being state aid district; Nos. 48, 53, 58. 62, 66. 72, 74 and 76 were late in begin - ning for reasons much like those already given, most of them being state aid districts. "Only five of my districts could pay better salaries than are now paid. All except two districts reach the legal limit of twenty-five mills. Brhe teacher in district No. .")"&gt; gave up the school because she not find a boarding place. The teacher in district No. 58 came he east and could not adapt himself to conditions, and hence left end of ten weeks. g Fifty-seven per cent of my teachers hold second grade certifi' I r cent hold third grade certificates, and 19 per cent hold condl - certificates. Abcut seven failed in examination who might have along well teaching. About ~'i per cent of my teachers are non - nts. We have no high school normal training at all. ■rhe examinations have been severe, considering advantages and ions out here. A slight bending of requirements would help very in this county." OK. (LARK'S KKIHUtT Dr. W. A. Clark conducted the conference of county superintend - ents, and board members at Sidney. Ntb., February 3 and 4. 1911. Ha i-i-ports some important facts brought out in the earnest discussion* ot that section of the state. The following is a portion of hfs report: E "There is an actual shortage of qualified teachers in these coun- There are not enough competent persons in some of these coun - available from other avocat'cns, to meet the demand for teachers r the most liberal system of licensing; some teachers must be se- I from outside counties. El rule, low salaries are not a primary cause of difficulty in a teachers from other more populous parts cf the states: |4"&gt; month for a term of six or eight months is quite loramon. •e very rarely under $40, and some rural d'strict* pay $6",. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">130 With few exceptions these districts are paying all they can pay; and as a rule districts away from railroad lines are levying up to the legal limit. "The matter of boarding places for teachers is far more serious than can be appreciated without such a close range study of the facts as I found them in this conference. In some instances the whole question of whether to have school in the district at all for the present year is made to depend upon whether a place can be secured for the teacher to board. While we were in conference Saturday a director came in to report to the county superintendent of Cheyenne county that school could not begin as they had planned, because "no one has a place for the teacher to stay," and he also said: "We can have no school until the first of March, when we hope Mrs. So-and-So can take the teacher in." I found on inquiry that this was by no means a solitary instance, though, of course, this is not the common condition. In Cheyenne there are at present three teachers (two women and one E, living in their school houses and boarding themselves. This tion, which they assure me is rapidly improving, will disappear the homesteader's one-room house gives place to larger homes. "Teachers from eastern counties give satisfactory service in this section, though seldom staying more than a single term, unless on account of climatic conditions in seeking health. As a rule, their services are sought and appreciated; and they fit into this life even better than persons born here fit into the school and social life in counties farther east. It does not appear that teachers here break con - tracts any more frequently than in eastern counties — probably only on such reasonably justifiable grounds as uncomfortable boarding places or marriage contracts. Consolidation Xot Practicable "Consolidation of rural schools is not generally practicable in this section of the state, and it will contribute little to the teacher problem. It Is very difficult to work out any reosanable scheme of routing con - veyances for the transportation of children; and there are many mat - ters of neighborhood limitations and local jealousies that can only be K predated in the county superintendent's close contact with them that &gt;uld make them hesitate to attempt consolidation. "It was the unanimous judgment of those in the conference that larger discretionary powers should be granted to the superinten - dents in these counties in licensing teachers, both in emergencies and for particular schools. Doubt was expressed quite emphatically that any form of restriction in the number of low class certificates that might be issued to one person Ts benelcial. It was also thought that some who have failed to secure certificates in the regular examinations would have made good teachers for particular schools, if the county superintendents had some power in fitting the teacher to the school. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">131 P? there was no desire to weaken the good effect on our state 1 system of the uniform examinations, it was thought that in so ne it should be less inflexible in its adaptation to local conditions. It was thought that the third grade examinations comprise too many subjects and that the questions are in some cases too difficult to be a proper testing for this low grade of temporary license. For example, in arithmetic, one set of questions could be used for the most elementary test and another more difficult list for those who would add to it additional branches in seeking a higher grade of license. Atao some favored fewer examinations in these elementary subjects — that is, fewer opportunities to "try this month," and if 1 fall out try for an easier list next month, until I strike an easy one." Normal Training Helps. Kormal training in the high schools is helping some in s living cher problem in these counties, and it should be fostered. ■A half mill levy for the common schools, or some form of state f taxation for rural schools was favored. Bit was thought that a field agent giving his whole time to a •ange study of rural schools conditions in these western counties be a most valuable part of the work of the state superintendent's Could not Mr. Penney be spared for that purpose? "I appreciate the privilege of having some part in this investiga - tion, and I regret exceedingly that circumstances hurried the notification so as to make it difficult to get together all that should have joined in the conferences. I trust that the facts gathered by all of those sent out may in the aggregate prove very serviceable." MR. DKLZKM/S RKPORT. "The report of Deputy State Superintendent James E. Delzell, February 4, 1911, is as follows: "In accordance with your request I visited Ainsworth on Friday and Saturday, February 3 and 4, and there were present four county superintendents, namely: Superintendent C. P. Kelley, Sheridan county; Superintendent Cora Thackrey, Cherry county; Superintendent Ma me McAndrew, Brown county, and Superintendent A. Boshart, Keya Paha county. These superintendents represented about 6,777,500 acres of land, equal to about 10,590 square miles. In these four counties there axe 371 school districts, making almost thirty square miles to each district, if equaly divided. These four counties can get along with u62 teachers, but have not been able to secure that number. "In the districts outside of the Kinkaid region no change is asked in regard to certification. Teachers can be secured, and of a good' grade, </seg>
            <seg id="p163">132 "In forty-seven districts there has been no school this year on account of scarcity of teachers. It looks as if the certification law is beyond the reach of those in this part of the state who are willing to go out twenty. thirty or forty miles from the railroad to teach in the sod schoolhouses of the Kinkaider and undergo the privations and hard - ships of that country. "Fifty-one districts have only been able to have school a part of time owing to this same reason, teachers being unwilling to under - the hardships of the sand hills. "Several other districts have been unable to secure teachers be - cause of the difficult examinations. E"The districts are paying as heavy wages as possible, and in some inces are paying an excess out of private funds in order to secure hers at all. P" Boarding places have been a problem to both teacher and county rintendent. In some instances teachers would pass by a place, and school paying $60.00 per month would be the last place asked because of its being impossible to find a boarding place. "About 25 per cent hold emergency certificates, and 20 per tent third grade certificates. We were unable to estimate the per cent of the other grades of certificates. Forty Fail to Pass E'here were about forty of the teachers who failed to pass in four counties, who would have made safe teachers had they led in passing the examinations. ■The question regarding what per cent of the present teaching was employed in the same county last year was not discussed. r "About 80 per cent of the teachers in that section of the country from homes in the counties in that section. "Normal training in this group of counties has been very helpful. suggest, however, that a different standard be offered for normal training. We suggest that normal training in the twn schools be eo arranged that not quite so much time i put on the first grade subjects, and more time on the five sentials, and that eleven grade schools, accredited to the university be permitted to do this work and that an effort be made to establish at least one normal training school in each county so that the people might have a school that would send back a chid ready to help further the upbuilding of the country life and make the homes of the people of the country more attractive and helpful to all. v The four county superintendents were unanimous in regard to the matter that the examinations as a rule were not practical enough and too difficult. These county superintendents were serious about the Difficult K\anii|iiitiiin». </seg>
            <seg id="p164">133 matter when asked to certify that a teacher might help instruct the little fellows and could not do so on account of rulings and that something ought to be done to relieve the situation. "It was suggested that the county superintendents might be given discretionary power to grant certificates to each in these Kinkaid dis - tricts and thus relieve the tension. The people up in those sand hills are of excellent material and should have an opportunity to exist and have their children properly taught to become citizens. Twenty Miles From Cody. E"I met a lady on the train with two very bright children. She she and her family had lived for the past eleven years twenty miles 1 of Cody, Nebraska, in Cherry county, away out in the country, that last year and this year was the only time they had had a good ler. $45.00 per month for seven months. She seemed happy that 'our children were receiving an education. "We are of the opinion that some relief should be given tc the western part of the state, in regard to the preparation of teachers. We must remember that the west is in the condition of the east 20 years ago. If we had been as severe on the teaching force of 20 years ago, in the eastern part of the state as we are now on the west, the wast would have gone begging for teachers. Give us the best possible teachers, but give us teachers, is the western cry. The state superin - tendent should be given permission to relieve the situation in some way so that each school in the state can have a teacher. 'The west is a great empire, and should be given an opportunity to develop educationally." MB. CA\ IXKSSS REPORT. The report of Superintendent A. L. Caviness, February 4, 1911 is as follows: "Relative to the investigation you desired me to make of rural schools in this part of Nebraska, I beg leave to submit the following: "In some instances emergency certificates do not cover enough time to allow teachers to take examination, because of long distances and poor facilities for traveling and occasionally stormy weather. It might be well to provide for extension of time in these extreme cases. "The third grade certificate seems to work all right, and no county superintendent desires any changes in it. "Normal training in high schools is giving excellent results but there are so few schools able to do this work. The smaller ones are unable to secure a part of the apportionment because they cannot meet the requirement of ten or more in the training class. The grad - uates from normal training high schools are spoken of by the county superintendent as among their best teachers obtainable. This work ought to be extended and encouraged, and the limit in number ought </seg>
            <seg id="p165">134 to be reduced below the present limit of ten. A class of five or six means many more home teachers who understand western condi - tions and who do not have to pay out so much in railroad fare to reach their work. Half Mill Levy. "A half mill levy for the common school fund would be of advan - tage but no data is at hand to give an idea of how it would help. In some counties all the districts levy the full 25 mills, and I could learn of no county in which half or two-thirds of the districts did not levy the limit. "Salaries average abont $50 per month in the rural schools in most of these counties, but the shortness of the term is a serious drawback, especially in cases of teachers coming from a distance. This is really the most serious difficulty to be met. State aid would lengthen the term, but increased normal training in even the smaller high schools would be a more practical means of relief. I "Consolidation does not seem destined to furnish much relief, the districts now often include a township or more, besides the mat - ter of transportation of children for long distances daily is a difficulty hard to overcome. In the few instances where children were denied school privileges, it was due to their living so far away from any school house. Teachers from the eastern part of the state, as a rule, meet with some success as they would at home. Very few fail and those who do, for lack of ability to control and teach children. Very little trouble is caused by teachers breaking contracts, occasionally one gets married, as they do elsewhere. "Good boarding places can usually be secured, but these are fre - quently at a long distance from the school house. In general, no changes seem needed or desired in the law governing certification of teachers. All the county superintendents consulted were well sat - isfied with the present law. However, some changes can be made in the rules governing examinations that will expedite matters all around and avoid unnecessary delays in opening schools each year. Urges State Aid. "I cannot too strongly urge the importance of a liberal appropria - tion for state aid in weak districts, and a more liberal policy of build - ing up normal training in high schools, and especially in the smaller high schools in the western counties. Fifty state normal schools would not meet the demand for rural teachers, but fifty high schools in west - ern Nebraska doing normal training by means of some state assistance would do wonders in supplying teachers for the rural schools in western "On account of limited time I find it necessary to embody sugges - tions relative to the issuance of certificates in another report to be submitted later, as your instructions call for a report to be mailed you today. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">WESTERN SCHOOL CONDITIONS 135 "This report is based on a careful investigation more especially on conditions in Box Butte, Morrill, and Scotts Bluff and other counties. These counties, are I think, typical of north-western Nebraska. How - ever, a week would not be too much to devote to a study of educational conditions in this interesting and progressive region." MR. PEXXEY'S REPORT. The report of Examiner C. M. Penney, February 4, 1911, is as fol- lows: "According to your request of January 31, I spent Saturday, Feb - ruary 4, at McCook in conference with Superintendent Bettcher and teachers, members of school boards, and patrons. "In general, school conditions are much better in Red Willow county than in most of the western counties. Few of the districts have been deprived of school the past year on account of a lack of qualified teachers. "In regard to teachers who fail to pass the examinations, I believe the failure to pass is generally due to lack of preparation. Few, if any, of those who have had normal training in the high school fail to pass the examinations. The larger number of failures are by those who have only attended high school a short time or have never attended any school above the eighth grade. Favors Standard Text. "Superintendent Taylor, of McCook, suggested that the examina - tion questions in theory should be based on some standard text so that prospective teachers may have something to guide them in their preparation. This seems to be a very good suggestion and for the Cmainder of this year I believe it will be wise to follow Barrett's actical pedagogy in making out questions in theory. "The law requiring that only one third grade certificate may be issued causes injustice in some cases where teachers pass from one county to another. When a third grade is issued on grades earned in ex - aminations in one county, the candidate should be privileged to teach during the life of the certificate even though she may remove to another county. The law should be amended to meet such conditions or the ruling of the state department should be that the holders of third grade certificates could pass from one county to another when conditions de - mand it. "My observations lead to the conclusion that rules on certifica - tion that may be satisfactory in eastern and central Nebraska are not adapted to conditions in western counties. These matters are worthy of your careful consideration and deliberate action." </seg>
            <seg id="p167">136 VISITING Rl'RAL SCHOOLS. Anna V. Day, Assistant State Superintendent At the request of State Superintendent Delzell the months of February and March, 1912, were spent in visiting rural schools, par - ticularly in the western counties of the state, where the valuation of rperty is so low that it is a difficult matter to get funds enough have even a short term of school. Howard County The first trip was made to the north to Howard, Garfield and Sher - man counties. In company with Superintendent Vogt of St. Paul, the day in Howard County was spent in visiting districts 8, 27, and 18. In district No. 8 we found a large school house with fairly good equipment. There was a large class of third graders, nine in all, an unusual number to find in one grade in a country school. The building was equipped witli single seats and was in all respects above the average. Mr. \V. C. Bucy was the teacher. We took dinner at the home of J. W. Dodds. At district No. 27 there was another large school with fifty pupils enrolled, about forty of whom were in attendance. Each pupil had his own desk, single seats being provided, and all were busy, and what is more, happy. The most pleasing thing about the whole school was the very neat and attractive appearance of the teacher, Mr. "Jimmie" Dobry. He had escaped entirely the pitfall which gets so many of the young men when they take a school in the country — that of neglecting his personal appearance. He was as neat and well-groomed as though he had been on the city streets, instead of in a school house set in the midst of treeless grounds on a muddy day, miles away from any town. District No. 18 came far nearer being an average school. Classes were over, and recitations were called at the request of the guests. The teacher was untidy in her appearance and she called her first class with the gracious remark "Guess I'll hear the third grade reading, that's about the worst class we have." Fancy asking pupils to recite after an introduction like that. Under such conditions the only thing t:; be said was "Come on, let's hurry and go." Poor children, and the district kept her there year after year. EThis visit to Howard county showed the schools in more than an ige condition of excellence. Mr. Vogt, the county superintendent, recently purchased an automobile, by means of which he is able sit the schols more often and to keep closer in touch with their :. This is his third term in charge of the Howard county schools. Sherman County. In Sherman County we found Mr. L. H. Currier, deep in the many mysteries which present themselves to the new county superintendent. Mr. Currier was elected to the county superintendency from the schools </seg>
            <seg id="p168">137 at Kockville, and he finds a most interesting problem before him. The first school visited in this county was in District No. 4, taught by Miss Tucker, formerly of Pawnee county. The building was in poor condition, both as to repair and as to arrangement and furniture. The hall which should have been fitted up for a cloak room was used for a &lt;oal house. The seating arrangements were poor and the ventilation was very poor. We heard four reading classes here, and found that the pupils were depending upon the teacher to help them with all new and a good many old words. We feared those children would never be - come very fluent readers at that rate. There were six big girls present and no boys. We wondered why this was, as there is no important farm - work to be done at this season. As there was no hitching post, the horses were tied to the barbed wire fence, rather a risky way to leave a restive team. County superintendents would appreciate it if there were a good strong post at every school house, and the big boys would be glad 10 put one up if it were suggested to them. From this school we drove three miles south to District 36, where we found Mies Lettie Peugh in charge of the school in her home district. The first glimpse of this school was most delightful. The children were ai recess and all together were playing "Black Man," boys and girls, big and little. As we drove up, the sides were lined up at opposite ends of the playground and all were crying "Run, Mary Jane, run!" while "Mary Jane," a youngster about seven years old, tore across the open space between them ae fast as her little legs would carry her. A school wnere such a spirit of comradeship prevails on the playground could not help but be delightful within. There were twenty-two pupils enrolled and seventeen were present. A siege of scarlet fever had made some afraid to come back. All of the seventeen were busy at their own work. When they were in their wraps after dismissal and ready to start home each and all came to the door to say "Good night, Lettie," to the teacher. There was not the slightest indi - cation of disrespect in spite of the familiar acquaintance. Miss Peugh is one the normal training graduates from the Loup City high school. The visit to Sherman county and the statements of the county superintendent only confirmed the well known fact that it takes the ceacher to make the school. Where there is a teacher well prepared, sympathetic and conscientious, you can't have a poor school if you try. (Jarfleld County A long, tiresome ride by B. &amp; M. motor, I". P. passenger, and B. &amp; M. passenger, took me to Burwell. At an early hour in the morning Superintendent Jenkins was on hand with his team of black ponies and we started for one of the schools typical of the best conditions in the county. It is eight miles south of Burwell and is taught by Miss Eva Hathaway. There are twenty sections in this district and fifty pupils in attendance, thirty-five of whom were present. The building has been </seg>
            <seg id="p169">138 r.arged to accommodate the increased attendance and the new wing built at right angles with the old part, giving the novel result that the seats face in two directions. Supplies and equipment are poor, but the pupils were industriously working and the four eighth graders present were evidence that the work was having its effect. A box supper was to be given there the next night and preparations for it were in evidence in the school room. Seats did not all fit the pupils, es - pecially in the case of a few pupils. Back to Burweil fcr dinner and off again in the afternoon to visit another type of school In another direction. The snow in the yard had melted and there was a sea of mud between the fence and the door. Of course the room was muddy and the dirty floor had a demoralizing effect upon the whole school. In spite of more or less disorder the instruction was excellent and the pupils had the chance to do excellent work if they wished, the teacher being a man of wider information than many of the teachers in the rural schools. They certainly need a benediction and a bath as to the school room, however. A most pleasant evening at the pretty home of Superintendent Boomer of the Burwell schools ended the visit to this county. Should children in the more thickly settled parts of the state have to go to school from such distances, to work with such a scarcity of supplies as these children they would fuss even more than they do now about going to school. If school boards in the east would contribute to the welfare of the schools in the same proportion that the boards and patrons in these poor western districts do, the schools in the east would have such a boom of prosperity as they have never yet enjoyed. Lincoln County. EA short call on Superintendent Dorothea Kolls of Hall county and went on to Lincoln county, where Superintendent Cleo Chappell is ng up her work in a most spirited and effective manner. She is placing special emphasis on the flag salute and in this work is receiving strong support from the G. A. R. in North Platte. They have agreed to furnish each school in the county with a fine flag if they will learn the Gettysburg speech and from the number of schools where we saw this speech on the board, they will all qualify. Lincoln county has the best rural school houses of any county in the state visited up to date. Superintendent Ebright gave the matter special attention while he held the office, and Superintendent Chappell is continuing the same line. The first school visited was District No. 127, just south of North Platte. This is a very large district and has two houses exactly alike. They are built of concrete, properly lighted and seated, and equipped with their own water system from windmills near the buildings. Heat is furnished from a furnace in the basement and there are two inside toilets. It is the intention of the board in this district to continue their work until the grounds, too, are in a model condition. After waiting until nearly </seg>

The first visited was No. 8, a new two room concrete building as up-to-date In every way as the two buildings seen the day before. The district plans to make it a social center for the community and has furnished it ac - cordingly. The two rooms can be thrown together and made one big audience room.

            <seg id="p171">140 After some miles of the most dreadful roads we came to District No. 11, another two-room rural school. In this school we found an eighth grade class of nine pupils — pretty good for a rural school.

Since Lincoln county has two kinds of time, one an hour later than the other, we were able to make another school the same afternoon, in spite of the dreadful roads. The last one wag O'Fallons, where there are three teachers and where the ninth and tenth grades are carried. This, in a rural school. A most striking feature of this high school was that there were five boys and two girls enrolled, — a reversal of the usual proportion. The pupils here, very many of them, drive to school and there is a fine barn on the grounds where they keep their horses. This is so arranged that there is a door into each stall, so no pupil has to go behind a strange horse. The teacher of the intermediate room also comes on horseback from her home a few miles away.

            <seg id="p172">WESTERN' SCHOOL CONDITIONS 141 Keith County. In Keith county Mrs. Richmond was at the station with all arrange - ments made to start at once for the country. Roads again were almost impassable to any one but a count/ superintendent or a rural mail carrier. The schools of Keith county are making a point of serving hot lunches at noon to the children, instead of the unappetizing cold lunch of time-honorei custom. The first school visited was District N about five miles from Ogalalla. Here Mrs. Rosengrant has five pupils In attendance. While they study their arithmetic lessons she does the pimple cooking necessary. On this particular day they knew that com - pany was coming and the menu was a little more elaborate than usual — boiled loin of pork, macaroni, and potatoes baked in the ashes. These, with the bread and butter and the fruit provided by Mrs. Rich - mond, furnished a meal good enough for any one, and those who were fortunate enough to be present did it ample justice. .Mrs. Rosengrant Lunch Time, District X .1. ."».

So satisfactory have the re - sults of this plan been that the board are considering furnishing the materials for the lunch themselves next year. Usually only one hot Els provided. Some of the neighboring districts are also taking up work. It seems destined to become a permanent feature of the 1 school program, as well as of many city schools. rPive miles across pastures and through or over barb wire fences we came to District No. 19. This is one of the districts which presents the most serious problem the state has to solve — that of pro - viding adequate educational facilities for the children in the big dis - tricts with the small valuation. With the aid of the state funds this district has five months of school during the year. Thirteen children were in attendance. The teacher was Mrs. Phillips from Council Bluffs, who felt most keenly the handicap of conditions and the injustice that was being done the children. Bright youngsters, they were, and ready to take all that could be given them, if they came under the influence of a teacher strong enough to "hold them down." Not enough books were available, no chalk for days at a time, and when school began no writing materials at all. Wouldn't you like to have to keep thirteen lively youngsters busy under such conditions? Mrs. Phillips had taken special pains with their writing and had developed some very pretty penmanship. "Oh," she said, "if some one could just go on with these children now. They are just at the point when so much might be accomplished in two or three months more." The money was used up, 'however, and the children were to have seven months in which to forget what they had already learned. Another drive across the pastures and over the fences and we reached District 22, taught by Mr. Dressier, a young man doing his first work in teaching. While this district is a little better off than the last visited, it is in pretty poor condition. The income is about $300 and that won't pay the teacher for very many months' work, nor give him very many supplies to work with, yet these children are going to be men and women and help to rule the state some day. It doesn't look as though they would be very well prepared, does it? Deuel County. Kss Yockey of Deuel county was in California at the bedside of a ter, so the visit there was decidedly handicapped, especially as some of the owners of the automobile liveries refused to drive a woman. One braver than the rest was found, however, and one school visited. This was Miss Lottie Davis', about four miles from Chappell. Miss Davis is teaching a most excellent school, and has the proper teacher's spirit, as evidenced by her words: "Oh yes, I'm going on through </seg>
            <seg id="p174">143 Eool, if I have to wait until I'm gray headed." A class of mary children never started with better or broader drill than s. The Chappell schools were in excellent condition under the super - ion and leadership of Mr. Chambers. A most profitable time was spent with Mrs. Richmond in her office Saturday discussing the many problems common to the offices of the county and state superintendent. Kimliall County F Sunday afternoon in a drizzling rain Mr. Alden of Kimball county us at the train and kindly took a more or less homesick traveler to home for the visit to Kimball. The arrival of the governor on Mon - day morning and the dismissal of the schools to hear his address in the afternoon, together with the severe storm which was raging, made the stay in Kimball county rather unsatisfactory. The most interest - ing thing about the schools in this county is the county high school. There is only one other in the state. The whole county is taxed for its support and tuition is free to all children in the county. It is a most interesting proposition and one which seems to offer a great oppor - tunity. A most excellent corps of teachers is employed and a fine class of pupils is in attendance. We expect to hear great things of this school as it gets more firmly on its feet. This is the second year of its existence. A school inspector who follows the line of march taken by the gov - ernor on one of his trips labors under a certain disadvantage. All the town schools and the country schools near enough to be visited dismiss to hear him and there's not much left in the school line to visit. Hav - ing had this experience at Kimball we were able to meet it quite phil - osophically at Bridgeport. Morrill County. Miss Cora Thompson, the new superintendent of Morrill, met us at the station and took us to her office, where we discussed reports and school matters in general until noon. After a fine dinner at the home of Mrs. C. C. Wade, her boarding place, Miss Thompson saddled one horse, harnessed another, tied them together by the bits and we started for the country. Northport, the school which took the second premiun for the best collective exhibit of work by rural school at the state fair last fall, was only one which we were able to visit, and this was more or less unsatisfactory, owing to the fact that the governor was speaking in Bridgeport and many of the children were there to hear him. This is the district in which Miss Thompson taught before she took her office as county superintendent. It comprises a whole township and has two </seg>
            <seg id="p175">144 school houses. Getting to school presents some serious problems in many cases. While Miss Thompson taught there one small girl of six met her every morning and rode four miles on horseback to school with her. When M'ss Thompson resigned to take her office this small girl had to stop school, as no parent would allow a girl of that age to take such a ride alone. The wonder is that her little legs would hold 'her on the horse at all. Miss Thompson visits her schools on horseback, and when she is mounted on her range pony clad in her corduroy riding habit, with her slicker tied to the saddle behind her, she is a typically western girl.

P. line to Gering is going to be a blessing some day, but the trains that now operate over it are not exactly through specials, (letting off a freight train after dark in a town where you don't know about the accommodations isn't exactly the most pleasurable experience in the world, but there is always some one to take charge of the help - less and unfortunate and it was so in Gering. After a half day with Eitendent Mummau in his office discussing reports and school Is and visiting the Gering schools for a little while, we took the or Mitchell. We crossed the river to Scotts Bluff and visited the very excellent schools in that city under the direction of Superintendent Greenslit. The high school has just gone into its new building and is experiencing the boom which a finely equipped new building always brings. A fine class of pupils was in attendance and good work was being done. Superintendent Greenslit says it is almost impossible to keep a full corps of teachers, they get married so soon after coming there. ■tchell also has a fine new building. The towns in the older the state will have to look sharp or this new and bustling v«rt ve them completely distanced in up-to-date buildings. A fine little team of ponies took us first to District No. 34, where Miss Opal Bolyn is teaching. There are sixteen pupils enrolled and the work is that of the average school. Ewo miles east of this school we found District No. 6. Mr. Walker teaoher. Th's is one of the good big country schools which used common in the easterfi part of the state. Twenty-eight pupils were in attendance, many of them good sized boys and girls. I wonder if a man teacher can keep the big boys in school better than a woman. This school was observing Washington's birthday in an informal man - ner, — bits of his biography were read and at the end of the period each pupil spoke of some trait which seemed to him to be particularly admir - able. This made the pupils think and compare and was altogether a </seg>
            <seg id="p176">145 EDd exercise. These boys and girls were particularly proud of their g and regretted long and earnestly that it needed some repairs and uld not be put up. bAt District No. 37 we found a good school house and • good school it by Miss Perrein. Preparations were under way for a spelling st with a neighboring district. Two miles west of this school we found another of the typical Miiall schools. Half a dozen children were in attendance and as recita - tions for the day were over, there was no inducement to linger long. Five miles over dreadful roads took us to one of the best schools in the county, in a district south of the river. Owing to the impossibil making good time over such poor roads school was just dismissed as we drove up. It is interesting and pathetic to see the youngsters leav - ing for home on a cold winter night. Horseback, in buggies and on foot these children went, and the teacher with his pony and cart joined them and drove to his homestead near the town. Several of the older children in the district were in attendance, but there were no eighth grade pupils to take the examinations. One or two of last year's class were back reviewing, however. One lad told us that he did not enter high school because he could not start until late in the fall and had to leave early in the spring. Too bad that parents cannot be made to realize how they are handicapping their children for life when they do not make the necessary arrangements for their children's education, desperate though the effort may be. Box Butte. Another fine breakfast at the Mitchell hotel and we were on the way to Alliance to spend a little time with Superintendent Delia M. Reed. Miss Reed was on hand at the station when the train rolled in and from that minute there was something doing every second. In spite of very bad roads, muddy and snowy, an automobile was engaged and we were off for the country. The first visit was at a schaol taught by Miss , who had recently come from Seward county. This was a nice school and quite a class of eighth grauprs were in attendance. A brief visit and we went on to a school taught by a young man from the far east- He has the unusual record of having taken all the examinations for a first grade certificate at one time, ami having had no grade below 85. A lack of supplies here handicapped Another drive over fences, through gates and snow drifts up to the body of the car and we reached one of the poorer districts.

The next visit was made in ■nowy morning and Miss Fenske Sioux county.

            <seg id="p178">147 Ba mere trail and the snow was falling so fast that it could not be , so it was hard for a stranger to follow it. Mr. Harry West, a esteader from Wyoming, has been in charge of the school for the past two months, since Christmas. He has a nice hard working school, with several big pupils in attendance. This district, like all those near the railroad, has plenty of money. They are very poorly supplied with books, however in some classes several of the same kind having to be consulted before the whole lesson was found. Part of it would be in one book and part in another. As the storm was getting wors there was no livery stable in the place, there seemed to be nothing to do but go on to Harrison, get dinner and return for the afternoon ki Glen. The snow, the heavy load and the grade all together, too much for the engine, however, and it was long past noon before Harrison was reached. A visit with Miss Fenske in her office regarding her new duties in the formation of the state aid money, and some of puzzling, and a call on the Harrison charge, and the trip to Sioux county new districts, the apportioning of the other questions which are so schools, where Mr. C.

            <seg id="p179">148 plans were made for a two days' trip with Miss Munkres on the table - land. The continued heavy snow made it unsafe to start on such a trip, so three schools near town were visited instead. If any one thinks that the task of a county superintendent is a snap, he should take some of these long, cold trips with one. This morning the mercury wm about 6 above zero and it was snowing hard, — the wind was blow - ing from the northeast and there was no indication at all that the trip was to be a "pleasure exertion," to quote Samantha Allen. Miss Mun - kres drives her own horse, being urged thereto by the fact that a livery rig costs her $5 a day and the horses which she gets are not always re - liable. Even with a horse which one knows thoroughly it is no fun to Kness on a cold morning tie and blanket at each school, and unhitch feed at noon. Cold work at best. P'he first eight miles were very cold, but a good fire and a thorough ing in Mrs. Gillett's school put us in better shape for the next of the trip. Mrs. Gillette is a teacher of considerable experience, and is discerning enough to give the children just what they need, each one, — an advantage over the teacher in the town school with ht-r extremely big classes. t After a very pleasant visit we drove on four miles (seemed more e forty) to the next school. Just before reaching there we saw two figures going off across the fields toward home. When we reached the school house a novel effect was produced by the efforts of the s-hool board to economize. The school house had been built originally for forty or fifty pupils. As the children grew up and moved away '.he school had dwindled to less than a dozen, and in order to save coal, in this country where they say "Its twenty miles to water and forty miles to wood," a partition had been built across the center of the building eo that only half of it need be heated. No doubt the effort at economy was successful, but the architectural effect was decidedly novel. It developed that the two boys who were going home had been sent home by the teacher because they would not behave. The combined efforts of the teacher and the "paddle" of the father had failed to produce a proper respect for the school authority. The trouble seems to have arisen from the fact that the teacher gave the board to understand be - fore she was employed that she held a first grade certificate, and « ».en the contract was made out she could present only a second grade. Con - fidence in her was gone from the whole district, hence the trouble with the boys, who regretted to the superintendent that they had been ab - sent when she called the second time. It seems that they had missed her the first time she was there, too. Three pupils in this school ex - pected to take the eighth grade examinations. They would mahe the fifteen-mile trip to town on a handcar for the purpose. Leaving this school during the noon hour we started on the nine - mile drive back to the third school.

            <seg id="p181">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 150 Sheridan County. The next morning in Sheridan county it was clear but very cold. Superintendent Keller was on hand bright and early, however, and the start was made to a school eight miles from town, taught by a teacher whose home is in Rushville and who drives the eight miles morning and night. Here we found a nice, orderly, industrious school, digging away at their last week's work as hard as they could. School was about to close. It was good to hear the teacher say "We think we have an excellent superintendent." That speaks volumes for the success of the work in any place. Back to Rushville for dinner and six miles out in another direc - tion for the afternoon. Here we found a big school in a fine new school nouse, taught by Miss from South Dakota. There were five in the seventh and eighth grades in attendance, and an effort on the part of the visitors to spell them down from the Crabtree spelling book on the words which they had been over this year met with failure. It couldn't be done. The work of the primary pupils in this school was particularly interesting and unsually good. The teacher had been fing the Rational Method of reading and the results showed it. The use which this school had occupied last year was being used for a </seg>

No wonder they are happy in their nice new big The School at the H*W Hou«.«-. En the southern part of the county the districts have more trouble their finances than in the north. Mr. Kelley tells of one school ! the seats are one long bench across the corner of the room, cut - ting off the stove. The children all sit on this bench. When they are reciting they face the room; when they are ready to study again they all swing around and face the stove and get warm. Such conditions </seg>
            <seg id="p183">152 are fast disappearing, however. Visiting; schools in this county is not at all fun either. Mr. Kelley travels on horseback or motor cycle. When on horseback he carries his grain with him, as a great part of the county is among the sand hills and they find it hard to get grain enough for their own horses, let alone feeding visitors'. The hardest place to get schools supported is in the districts controlled by the big ranches. There are children in some parts of this county fourteen years old who have never had an opportunity to attend school, and the cattlemen who own most of the land in the districts where they live are very reluctant to see that such privileges are provided. This condition of affairs is fast passing away, and the owners are be - ginning to see that it is to their advantage to have at least fairly well educated people for their neighbors. Cherry County. Big Cherry county seems to take a special pride in doing honor to its women. They have a woman superintendent of schools and a woman county treasurer, and many girls are employed in the court house. Judging from the way in which those whom we met worked, the confidence is well placed. Miss Thackrey had her horses ready at 8 o'clock on Friday morning, with foot warmers and hot bricks galore, and we started for the first school, nine miles away. It was a lovely sunny morning between blizzards, and the road up through the can - ons with their many evergreen trees was a thing of beauty. Finding the way in a country where the roads run through the best places re - gardless of section lines is a very different fhing from driving in the eastern counties, where you go so many miles straight east and so many miles south and are there. After inquiring several times we reached Dry Creek school, only to find the house closed and no sign of recent occupation. It developed later that the board had persuaded the teacher to give up the last month's work and she had failed to notify the superintendent of the fact. A fine dinner at the home of Mr. W. T. Bullis in some measure made up for the disappointment and we started for Harmony. Here again bad luck awaited us. It was Friday afternoon and the school had had a half hour noon, no recess, and dismissed early in order to let the teacher go to town before dark. A more healthy, wholesome, hearty looking Scotch lassie than this Miss McLean, with her tam-o-ehanter cap. her short skirt, and heavy high boots, it would be hard to find. She is a graduate of the Valentine normal training class of last year and there was every indication of good work in the school </seg>

Every one had gone. E Cherry county prides itself upon the many fine new buildings that going up in districts all over the county. Financially it is in ex - nt condition and the schools take second place for no one. Key a I 'aha County. Springview, the county seat of Keya Paha county, is twenty-five miles from the railroad and is reached by stage from Ainsworth. — a lovely drive in summer time, but leaves something to be desired when the roads are rough and frozen, or deep with mud, and you have to walk up all the hills. The hotel at the county seat leaves much to be desired, but good accommodations may be had in private families, if you know where to look, so a transient visitor need not be too uncomforta- Superintendent Boahart was on hand with hia team of bronchoes HARMONY DISTRICT, CHERRY COCNTY </seg>
            <seg id="p185">154 north. Mrs. Hillyer is the teacher. Here we found fourteen pupils and heard several reading and spelling classes. These subjects are receiv - ing special attention at Mrs. Hillyer's hand. The most interesting thing about the school, however, was the teacher. She is a mature woman with grown-up children. When her matrimonial bark went astray she decided to teach. So she went to school to her own daughter, secured a third grade certificate and taught a year. From that time on she has taught and gone to school in turn, until now she is one of the best qualified teachers in the county. Last summer Mrs. Hillyer and her son and daughters were all working together in the Fremont normal. The school house in this district was also an average building, as well Enned, equipped and furnished as the average school house in far ilthier counties. The county is fast improving both as to the finances of its resi - dents and as to its schools. On the way to the next school we passed an interesting illustration of this. A fine frame house, big and homey - looking, and in the same yard an old log cabin, which had been the family home until the last year or two. As the homes improve the school houses improve, too. Four miles farther on we found the next school. This building was not so good. Poorly lighted, poorly ventilated, and in very poor repair. It was warm, however, as it was lined throughout with building paper. From an artistic point of view much was left to be desired, but from the point of the comfort obtained, little could be asked. In this school the children nearly all came on horseback, and the school grounds looked like the streets of a country town on circus day. All sorts and conditions of horses and vehicles were there. It was a won - derfully studious, orderly school throughout. Good work is not by any means confined to model buildings. Superintendent Boshart makes his rounds on horseback, finding that he can make better time and meets with less inconvenience in this Owing to the many kinds of time prevailing in Keya Paha county there was an extra hour before the stage left in which to visit the Springview schools. It was rather a poor time for regular school work, as they had given an entertainment the Saturday night before to such a full house that it was to be repeated that night. Under such circum - stances neither teachers nor pupils were in condition to do their best work. The entertainment had demonstrated the fact that the school was working in good earnest and that the teachers had the situation veil in hand. Springview needs a new school house and much new equipment, which they hope to have as soon as the new railroad goes </seg>
            <seg id="p186">155 Brown County. One of the blizzards which have been so frequent this spring made it impossible to visit the country schools in Brown county. Burritt had her note book full of questions, and it took a good fore - noo.n's work to go over all the ground which they covered. Burrett is having a seige with the petitions for division and consolida - tion, which are so constantly coming up in fhe western counties. superintendent suggested that the people do not have enough to do to keep them busy about their own affairs, so they quarrel about the schools. Petitions and counter-petitions and remonstrances are one of the chief joys of a rural school community when some change in their ways of doing things is proposed. An afternoon in the Ainsworth schools showed them to be in good condition, where we were successful in finding recitations in progress. Visiting study periods is at best rather dull work. An excellent recita - tion in Miss Snell's geometry class, another in grammar in Miss Peck's eighth grade, and Mrs. House's spelling were well worth visiting. Other grades were studying. &lt;irant County Eiving Lincoln at 6 o'clock Sunday evening, April 14, 1912. I Whitman at half past three the following morning. Soon after st Mr. Walker, the principal of the Whitman schools, called ery pleasant morning was spent visiting the Whitman schools, ms there are very unfavorable to good work, especially in the high school and the grammar room. The partition between the two rooms extends only about seven feet from the floor, the rest of the space being open, and every sound in one room is clearly heard in the other. This makes it impossible for either class to study or recite. Notwith - standing this condition the high school is doing some very creditable work. The classes are small, and each pupil can be given exactly the attention which is needed. A manual training department is conduct - ing itself in one of the rooms of the second floor. The principal out - lines the work and the boys do it by themselves as time will permit. They are getting much good from it. The attendance In the grade rooms was very small, as the ranchers had begun to incve back to the country to take up the spring work. The eighth grade had been having rather serious trouble about the state examinations, having failed badly, but one girl expressed the spirit of the class when she said she was going "to stay with them" until she did pass. The intermediate rcom is in a dwelling house adjoining the school grounds. Good work done, but teaching through a double door is always decidedly unsatis - factory. The primary room was attractive as primary rooms always are. The teacher, Miss is a Whitman girl and says she has a "perfectly dandy bunch of children." </seg>
            <seg id="p187">156 Kt noon Mr. Wheeler, the county superintendent, came over from is and we started to visit a school ten miles out in the country, there had been great trouble during the past year. As an evi - dence of the kind of pupils who attend there, a sliding cover had been fixed over a broken window pane so that the boys could shove it one side and spit out of the window. The floor was covered with dirt and the school grounds were a mass of discarded wire fence, old boards and other junk. The two outhouses stood side by side in defiance of all law, and serious trouble had arisen from the condition. The teacher had been a girl whose most prominent qualifications were her ability to ride a bucking broncho and serve as an extra cattle hand. Perfectly K ood qualifications, but hardly tne most essential ones for a school teacher. Rifter a long drive through the beautiful cattle country Hyann's ached long after dark. A most welcome supper prepared by .Mrs er was eaten by two very hungry people and at least one of them the sleep of the just and righteous. The morning of the sixteenth was spent in the schools of Hyannis. Unfortunately, there is a factional fight on in Hyannis and it is taken into the schools to some extent. This, of course, makes it impossible to secure the best work or the best results. Teachers are chosen, re - tained or dismissed, according to the sides taken in the fight, without regard to their success or worth as teachers. Excellent work is being done in mathematics, primary methods and grammar. It seems a pity that in a town as large as Hyannis only ten grades are carried. The board feel that this is true and is planning to add a grade another year and put in the normal training. The twelfth grade will be added tsoon as it seems advisable and people will be able to give their chil - :n a full high school course without sending them some distance from ne, as they are now obliged to. Hocker County An evening train took me to Mullen, where 1 learoed that Super - intendent Garret was in the eastern part of the state and that all the country schools within twenty-five miles of the town had been closed. A very pleasant morning was spent in the Mullen schools, however. It reems that the school spirit in these newer western towns needs more or less arousing, though the conditions in Hooker county are such that it is not so much a case of lack of spirit as it is the unwise scattering of available school funds. There are but eight districts in the county, almost the entire county being included in the Mullen d'strict. Of tourse it is impossible for the children to go to the same school, and the result is that there are twenty-two or three school houses in the district with the prospect that an indefinite number more will be built. Whenever there are six or eight children in a neighborhood the par - ents petition for a school house, and the rest of the district with the </seg>
            <seg id="p188">157 most generous intentions vote to let them have it. This scatters the money so that no one is having a very good school. One man reported five children ready for the ninth grade and said he was entirely unable to pay the $100 a month it would cost to board them in town while they attended high school. As they were some fifteen or twenty miles from town it was out of the question that they should attend and live at home. Mr. Hills, the principal, had six pupils in his room and was doing some good work with them in quadratic equations. There were only two pupils in this class, so it was not possible for either one of them to escape doing the work required from them. Mr. Westabrook was in charge of the intermediate room. He is making a specialty of his gram - mar and penmanship work and is getting some excellent results. Miss Ruth Rennick, an Iowa girl, is holding down a claim sixteen miles from town and teaching the primary room. Every Friday night she mounts her pony and goes out to spend Sunday on the claim. Needless to say p girl with grit enough to do that can teach a good school. She not only can, but does. Instead of calling her pupils "Busy Bees" and "Butterflies," she calls them a regiment and each class is a company. They feel the responsibility of soldiers and you should see them work. A pleasant call on two members of the school board and the visit to Mullen was over. BA team of livery horses was trying to jump over the tongue of the y, apparently, or walk on their hind legs, but they soon settled down long swinging trot and covered the eleven miles between Mullen Seneca in record time. The Seneca school house stands up above the rest of the village and is a big wooden building planned to accommodate all the children who are likely to need instruction in Seneca for years to come. Miss .losiassen is the principal. There were no boys in this school above the sixth grade, the boys who should have been in school having had a falling out with the teacher earlier in the year and quitting the school. The board says there is no trouble in controlling the children — -it's the parents who need discipline. The teacher of the intermediate grades gave up her school in the middle of the year also and Mrs. Phil - lipps from Keith county was finishing the term. The amount of inter - est that she has been able to inspire in her pupils is shown by the at - titude of the bad boy in the room. When the writing was being shown he eagerly pushed a very creditable tablet forward, saying "Here's my book." Miss White is in the primary room. Sixty-eight children have been enrolled and in attendance there during the greater part of the year. How any teacher can be expected to do good work with so many children in the first three grades is a puzzle. Miss White was doing the best she could under the circumstances. She seems to like the school and the school seems to like her, as she goes away and teaches some- </seg>
            <seg id="p189">158 Thomas County. Thedford, the county seat of Thomas county, is the next town down the line. The morning of April 18 was spent in the town schools, where Miss Haasen, a South Dakota girl, is the principal and teaches the ninth grade. One boy is taking tenth grade work. He hopes to fit himself for an electrical engineer some day. There were thirteen eighth graders in Miss Granly's room and eleven seventh graders. This promises well for the future of the school and the board means to employ the very best principal they can find for the coming year and will add the eleventh and twelfth grades as soon as possible. The intermediate room was a great contrast to the Seneca school, there twenty boys and four girls in attendance. They were doing some cellent arithmetic work, analyzing at request some rather com - plicated problems in percentage, — the very kind of work that the Ehth grade candidates were doing to secure their free high school tiflcates. Miss Inez Oakes is the superintendent of this county. She has the distinction of being the only resident person in the county who held a first grade county certificate when the county commissioners were called upon to fill the vacancy. She is a graduate of the Broken Bow high school and is teaching at Natick. Last year she said the county super - intendency paid her $420 less the hire of the livery rigs with which she made her visits. Not a particularly lucrative office when you remem - ber that a team costs $3 a day in that country and you have to take a driver if you ever want to find your way around, and must pay his expenses, too. In the afternoon we drove about ten mile3 south of Thedford to visit one of the best rural schools in the county. We found an old building in very poor repair, with the oldest furniture which would serve the purpose. Five pupils were present, two first graders and two eighth. The first graders did sonie excellent work in reading and sounding words for us. The teacher, Mrs. Emery, had drilled them well I phonics, thus giving them the best foundation possible for their r work. The eighth graders had passed part of the eight grade ninations and were planning to finish the rest at the May examina - i. One family of five children was staying out of this school be - se they had no shoes fit to wear. The stove was standing very variously in the center of the room on wooden legs.

Miss Reynolds is the teacher of this room. Some excellent work in reading and reproduction was being clone, but the conditions for seeing the school were most unfavor - able. Mrs. Hastings is tbe principal and teaches the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth grades. Only five pupils were in attendance here. The Dunning school house is a big building, planned for four rooms. It It convenient and airy and, like the whole town, is looking forward to a big school some time. All books used in this school were bought from one company — a poor plan, no matter what the company. No one firm has a monopoly of all the good books published and it is not fair to ask the children to use anything but the best. It is a waste of their time and the teachers, too. Ouster County. A fourteen mile drive took us down into Custer county to attend the last day dinner of District No. 27U. .Miss Jessie Moore, another home - steader from near Dunning, was just finishing a most successful term of school. Of course, there were no recitations in progress, but a visit with the patrons and pupils gave many interesting circumstances in connection with that school. In the first place, it means something when every family, in the district, except the sick, will turn out at the height of a rushing spring season to go to the last day of school, and take their dinners. And such a dinner! There was chicken, and sandwiches, and salad, and cheese, and jelly and cake and pie and pickles, and all the good things you can think of, in quantities to sup - ply a small army. Another nice thing about it, too, was that the girls did a good deal of the cooking. One ten-year-old was heard to run to her mother and say: "Oh, mother, Miss Moore ate some of my cake and she said it was fine." The recitations, songs and exercises were well done, every child on the program appearing twice in solo parts and oftener in songs and concert exercises. The hit of the afternoon was made by a small boy in the third grade, who sang the "houn' dog" song. It was sung without much attention to time or tune, but with tbe en - thusiasm that makes whatever it touches go. After the children had done their part the parents took their turn and the nice things they said about their teacher were enough to fill any one's heart with pleas - ure. It seemed to be the unanimous feeling that more had been ac - fomplished in the year just closing than for many years before. As an instance: There was in the district one seventeen-year-old girl who had for one reason and another been deprived of school privileges so that she was only ready for the third grade at the beginning of the term. By dint of hard work on the part of herself and teacher she was ready for the eighth when school closed. The third grade boy who sung the "houn' dog" song was finishing his first full year's work. There were three sisters living between three and four miles from </seg>
            <seg id="p191">160 school who had gotten up all winter, got their own breakfasts and walked to school, missing very few days and being tardy very seldom. This is a new district and the school is receiving the hearty support of all the parents, which is one of the essential things of a good school. When Miss Moore left for her home that night it looked as though she were taking most of the requisites for housekeeping with her, with the half dozen hens, dog, trunk and books. It made a good load for the gray ponies in their twenty-mile drive home. BA restful, rainy Saturday and Sunday on Miss Moore's homestead ned a good preparation for another week of strenuous visiting, ving Dunning early Monday morning, I reached Broken Bow about half past eight and was met at the station by Superintendent Grimes «d his visiting assistant, Miss Alice Jacobs, with the suggestion that i go on to Berwyn and drive from that place. Reached Berwyn in ison to make a short visit to the village school, before going to the country. This is another of the unfortunate schools where the teacher has had trouble during the year and the school was finished by a second Echer. The trouble was settled by expelling the refractory girl who i caused it. The entire sentiment of the community was with the ird in the expulsion. It is a dreadful thing to see a girl of fifteen or sixteen get the wrong idea of what is smart and so ruin her whole after life. A sight of the school grounds leads one to think that possibly she was not the only one at fault. The grounds looked as though they might have been the town dump. Tin cans and refuse of all sorts were scattered about and it was necessary to jump a small ditch formed by the water from the recent rains before reaching the rickety plat - form. Th appearance of the interior bore out the first impression. The floor was muddy, the furniture old and badly cut, and the supplies in the same condition. No teacher and no school could do good work un - der such conditions. The work was what might have been expected and we were not sorry to cut our visit short and go to some better cared for place. This we found at District No. 43, where Miss Alice Mittan teaches. The room was immaculate and so was the teacher's personal appear - ance. Decks were in good condition and the floor was free from mud and paper. Seventeen pupils were present, four girls and thirteen boys. There were eight in the first grade, no two of them reading in the same place, in fact, the teacher was doing most of the reading herself. The third grade reading was better. The last thing before school was dis - missed the whispering roll was called. That was a custom which I supposed had vanished years ago. A six-mile drive during the noon hour brought us to the school which Miss Jacobs said was one of the very best in the county, — District No. 33, taught by Miss Golaher. The school house was neat and the yard in good condition. There was also a barn where the children who </seg>
            <seg id="p192">161 in the school quickly put our team, while one of the boys went to a neighboring house for grain. Every one was playing ante-over when we drove up, and when the bell rang for school lines were formed out - side the door and the pupils marched in to music, — a march played by one of the big girls. Before passing their seats each child passed the drinking fountain, got a drink, combed his hair and washed his 'ace. The teacher then went to the organ and some singing formed tffte open - ing exercises. Each of these children had his own drinking cup. The school was as neat as a pin. We were unable to hear any recitations, however, because the children spoke in such low -voices. The teacher herself never spoke above a whisper. It made a quiet school room, but would seem to be a rather questionable practice. A fine hanging globe vu a rather unusual part of the equipment of this unusually good coun- Bf'rom District No. 43 we drove across to District No. 68, where we 1 Miss Lottie Peterson teaching her second year and working on 1st week of the term. She was very homesick because the sister whom she had lived for most of her term had moved "back She was decidedly embarrassed because the floor had not been swept for two days, and it certainly looked it. The school house was in good repair and the children were quite interested in their lesson*. The writing done by the primary children was particularly good. Ten big boys had been enrolled, but had dropped out on account of spring work. P weaving this school we returned to Berwyn, and from there to &gt;n Bow, where we met the city teachers in an evening meeting. Eisanter bunch of teachers than these same Broken Bow people it be hard to find, or a corps which is better qualified. Only one of them had a certificate below a first grade city, — a record which larger towns could hardly equal. Eperintendent Grimes is very proud of his new office, as he well The new Ouster county court house would be a credit to any Hall County It is a long trip from Broken Bow to North Platte, going as the railroad goes, but it gives an opportunity for a stop in Grand Island, and a short visit to Superintendent Barr and the departmental work in the down town school. Some excellent chorus work was being done by the grammar room. An interview with Superintendent Barr brought out the fact that Grand Island has an exceptionally well qualified force of teachers, the city examining board accepting nothing less than a first grade county "with honor" as a basis for their city certificates. A pleasant visit with Miss Kolls and it was train time </seg>
            <seg id="p193">162 Logan County. From North Platte the objective point wag Gandy. Gandy lies thlrty-flre miles north east of North Platte and is reached by a mail route covered by an automobile every day, if the auto works right; every two days when it does not. This fact of the connection between the two places seems to be kept carefully concealed from tbe traveling fcblic, however, as it was only after long and searching inquiry that the inection was located. It was a perfect spring day and the long drive among the sand hills and across the plains was most delightful. The only atop made on the whole trip aside from leaving mail in the rural mail boxes and stirring up the engine was at Myrtle, where there is a neighborhood postoffice. It is in charge of Mr. and Mrs. McNickle, who have lived there for the past thirty years. What that means only the more recently homesteaders in the country can even faintly guess. Their house is a comfortable "soddy" and the outbuildings indicate that they have prospered. The children have all grown up and gone and the father and mother are left alone on the old homestead. The old fash - ioned rifle hanging from the rafters speaks of the days gone by when It served a more serious purpose than shooting stray coyotes and prairie chickens. (The fourteen miles to Gandy passed quickly and the little town i the hollow with its big frame court house and its little frame school ouse came into view. Mr. Paul, the county superintendent, has a multiplicity of interests. He is principal of the Gandy school, owns a ranch near by, and superintends the schools of the county. Mrs. Paul runs the Gandy hotel to occupy the moments which her three girls leave empty. Gandy is undergoing pangs of disappointment just now that the railroad which they have been looking forward to having for twenty jeare has passed them by and is leaving them three miles from the road. A new town is being built there and Gandy is undecided whether to move over and grow up with the country a second time or to stay where it is and try to run an opposition town. Since the court house is at Gandy there will doubtless always be a town there. It is hard on the tple who have expected great things of their town when the road did e, however. The Gandy schools employ two teachers and are just now suffer - ing from the effects of an epidemic of smallpox and scarlet fever, and many of the pupils were out of school. In the higher room there were thirteen in attendance instead of the usual forty; in the primary room sixteen instead of the usual fifty. Mr. Paul is teaching the fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades. This year an eight months' school is being taught, which seems a strange thing in a town school. Mr. Paul is giving special attention to the work in writing, which is being bo neglected in many of our schools, and is getting some excellent </seg>
            <seg id="p194">163 reading with fairly good expression and a good understanding of the meaning of the selections. The primary room is very crowded when everyone is there. The sixteen in attendance filled it sufficiently full. Miss Philpott devotes her attention to developing the reasoning power of the pupils with the result that the memory work needs more or less bracing up. She very kindly turned her classes over to the visitor and allowed them to be subjected to all kinds of tests. Fun for the visitor and rather interesting to the classes. Most of the country schools in Logan county were closed but there was still one in session in the school house three miles and a half south of town. That was just a nice walk for a fine spring morn - ing and was accomplished in good season. Miss Crist from North Platte was presiding over the destinies of the pupils. This is one of the big districts where there are two school houses, one in each end of the district. Four months' school are held in one house in the fall and four in the other in the spring. Miss Crist has taught both schools for the past two years, and has done excellent work. School was nearly over for the year and only six pupils were in attendance. They were nice bright youngsters and were doing excellent work in arith - metic, being led to do their own thinking. The room was neat and clean and the school house was in good repair. Fifty dollars a month rpaid the teacher. Good pictures of Washington and Lincoln are the wall. Having missed the mail carrier there was a three mile and a half valk back to town to be taken. This was not so much fun as the walk out, but by taking plenty of time and stopping on the way to uee; dinne - from a benevolent woman who lived on the way it was finally accom - plished. The mail carrier arrived shortly after and when the customary repairs had been made on his car was ready to start back to North Riding in an open car at the rate of thirty miles an hour against a wind going in the opposite direction at the same rate is not as much fun as it might be, but we finally reached our destination with enough breath left to get out and into the house and with devout thanks - giving to be back 'on the road" as they say, again. Garden County. Owing to a recent wreck on the road, the local running between North Platte and Gering had been ordered not to make more than fifteen miles an hour, and the result was a long tiresome ride up to Oshkosh, reaching there about four thirty. Superintendent McKee and some eighth grade pupils who had been taking the examinations at Lewellen boarded the train at that place and formed a pleasant escort for the last part of the trip. Oshkosh is a promising little town way up near the end of the line, which is plannng to make the most of its opportunities. It has a nice churcn, a new opera house, and as soon as possible will build a suitable school house. </seg>

The primary teacher was, however, making up a day which she had lost earlier in the year and a very pleasant forenoon was spent in her room. Like so many of the teachers in the western part of the state, she is a home steader, having moved to Garden county from Missouri. E3he is teaching until proof is made on a claim, when all expect to move back to Missouri. About one-third of the ) were absent, since it was Saturday, but enough were left to give a very good idea of the work being done in reading and numbers. They also gave the flag drill and sang America in a most inspiring way. A pleasant visit with the members of the school board, who were available showed most encouraging prospects for the coming years for the schools of Oshkosh. Everything will be done that can be done and as rapidly as it can be done to improve them. As in the great proportion of the western towns, it is hard to get the necessary funds, but as the towns grow and valuations increase this will pass away. The people in Oshkosh were very cordial in their welcome of a rep - resentative from the department and their invitation to return at in - stitute time was most urgent. McPherson County. Another ride on the local took us to Keystone, where Mrs. C. E. Phillips, who used to be Miss Helen McArthur, and who taught in Shelton and Beatrice, was waiting to take us to her homestead at Glen - rose to spend Sunday, and to attend a meeting of the school patrons in McPherson County Monday evening. Mrs. Phillips has been a home - steader for the past six years and they have now proved up and are the possessors of a fine claim. Mr. McArthur, her father, has a claim ad - joining Mr. Phillips' and the two houses stand in one yard. Mrs. McArthur is in great demand in the neighboring districts as a teacher, and no wonder, for she is a most skillful instructor. For the past month she has been teaching in her own home the four children of school age in the two houses and a nicer school it would be hard to find. Of course the supplies are very scant, and there are no blackboards, but the instruction is of the best and the children are mak - ing rapid progress. They sing like young larks. Next year there will be a school house within a mile and a half of the home so it will not be necessary to mix school teaching and housework, though neither have seemed to suffer from the combination. At present they are five miles from a school. The meeting on Monday afternoon was held at the school house in the McPherson County district and was for the purpose of hearing the remonstrators to the petition for a new district which had been granted by Miss Nichols, the county superintendent of McPherson county. Nearly everyone in the district both for and against the new district was present, and Miss Nichols gave everyone an opportunity to say what their views on the subject were. At the conclusion of the </seg>
            <seg id="p196">165 meeting she announced that she saw no reason for changing her mind and that the action already taken would stand. So skillfully had she managed the whole affair that even those who had lost their conten - tion went home satisfied. No higher praise than this can be given any presiding officer. The prevailing sentiment of the majority of those present at the meeting was if the proposed new school would be for the good of the children, and the financial conditions would at all warrant it, by all means let the district be formed. With so ttful a superintendent, and so fair minded a constituency, the proa - ts for good school conditions in McPherson are excellent. STATK All) FOK WKAK DISTUKTS. Anna V. Day, Assistant State Superintendent. Perhaps one of the most interesting phases of educational progress in the state is the effect of the appropriation for aid of the school dis - tricts which are not able to support school from their own resource*. This fund is generally spoken of as the state aid fund. The first appro - priation for the purpose was made in 1907 and called for $50,000 to be used for the purpose of helping every district in the state to hold at least seven months schools. When the applications from the districts which wished to receive a share of the fund were all in it was found that they had asked for $89,000. K making the distribution of the state aid fund the following pro - of the law must be observed: LI. A district that wishes to qualify for state aid must ve voted at the annual meeting a school tax of 25 mills. t|. Funds derived from this appropriation can be ap - ied only in the payment of teachers' salaries, and to en - ile a district to hold five months of school with a legally lalifled teacher. 13. No district formed after the passage of this act March 28, 1909) containing lees than twenty sections of land ball receive state aid. 4. In determining the resources of a district that wishes to qualify for state aid, the estimated income for the urrent year shall be the sum of all moneys belonging to the (strict in the hands of the district and county treasurers, lus 25 mills times the assessed valuation, plus the esti - mated apportionment of state school funds. 5. The estimated expenditures of any district that re - ceives state aid shall not exceed $275. The best distribution possible was made of the money available and the legislature of 1909 amended the law to allow $75,000 for the blennium and the length of term to be held was made five months in - stead of seven. With this increase in the appropriation and the de- </seg>

A visit to some of the districts which are dependent upon state aid shows that nowhere in the state is there a class of people who value their educational privileges more highly or who will make more sac - rifices to secure such privileges for their children. Examples of gen - erosity between districts are not lacking, either. In the southern part of Keith County are two districts, one of which was too small to draw state aid, and too poor to support a school from its own resources. Ad - joining it was a district which was in a little better condition and could support school without aid. In order to help its poorer neighbor this district deliberately cut off two sections from its territory and gave to them, so that now both districts have an income of about $300 and the children are getting a taste, at least, of school every year. </seg>
            <seg id="p200">HI LES AXD REGULATIONS. COURSE OF STl I&gt;V. INTRODUCTION. Every pupil in normal training classes should be supplied with a copy of this bulletin and should become familiar with it. He will find it helpful as a guide in directing his work and as a means of inform - ation on matters of importance relative to preparation and certification us a teacher. Each teacher who is in any way responsible for the nor - mal training work should have a copy of the course of study and should know clearly all its provisions. tThe cases in our experience where normal training students learn the time of graduation that they have failed to comply with some the requirements of normal training and hence are at a disadvantage in securing their teacher s certificates, come largely from failure on the part of such students to become acquainted at the proper time with the normal training requirements. Often they have been misdirected by 6 teachers. For this reason, we urge that each normal training stu - ind instructor, at the beginning of the year become at once familiar ill the provisions concerned in the normal training course. At the time of the first edition of the course of study, normal training in high schools was in the experimental stage. Considerable space therefore was devoted to discussion of the value of this work and its relation to the teaching force of the state. The experimental stage has passed. The excellent results attained by actual trial of this method of helping to prepare more and better teachers for rural schools attest the wisdom of those who evolved the plan. The hundreds of such teachers now doing successful work in b schools are evidence of the fact that normal training in high )ls in Nebraska has helped in a large way to solve the problem greater supply of better trained teachers for the rural schools. Since the course of study has given such general satisfaction, very little change is made in the outline for this edition. The course is in - tended to be suggestive as well as directive. After meeting all requir - ed conditions, each superintendent and director in charge will make Buch use of the course of study as is found most helpful with local conditions.' That the normal training work is meeting with the approval of </seg>

The work has grown from sixty - nine schools In 1907-8, when the state appropriation was made avail - able, to 143 high schools in 1911-1912. The general expression of satisfaction from county superintendents, school boards and patrons with the quality of work done by graduates of normal training high schools is our strongest evidence of the wisdom of continuing to ex - tend the work to all communities of the state. EAt the last session of our legislature the value of this work to the e and its bearing upon the development of the highest type of cit - ship through education was fully discussed, after which the appro - priation was increased from $75,000 to $100,000, thus indicating the views of men who give careful attention to the real needs of the people. No other appropriation of an equal amount has done so much for the betterment of the rural schools. Ke interest in and the enthusiasm for the work so general out the state comes from the real test as shown by the results attained even in the short time that normal training has been operative. Our normal schools, filled to their capacity, are yet unable to supply a sufficient number of teachers for the grades of the city and town 8chools. This leaves the high school our greatest source of supply for teachers for rural schools. Our rural schools must continue to be supplied with teachers, very largely, by the high schools. Whether trained or not for it, high school graduates begin their work of teach - ing .almost without exception, in the rural schools. It is this condition which makes the normal training course in high schools of so great im - portance to the upbuilding of the rural school which has been and will continue to be one of the greatest factors in education in this country. Encidental good results are reported by city superintendents. The majority agree that: Normal training has improved the discipline ; high school; given higher ideals to the school: helped normal pupils into better attitude toward their studies, as well as toward discipline; and brought the community into closer and more helpful relation to the schools. Each of these points will appeal at once to the Bligent patron of our public schools as being very desirable for form - the atmosphere and environment that will be most helpful in de - ling true manhood and womanhood. County sperintendents report that the normal trained teachers from high schools have very much improved the grade of work done In rural schools. We are at the beginning of a solution of the problem. Teachers for rural schools should not only have a general training for teaching, but should have an operative degree of special training for teaching in rural communities. This provision is being rapidly uet by our best high schools in the introduction of courses in agriculture, dc- </seg>

The time is near when these courses of study will be a requirement in all institutions training teachers for rural communities. JAS. E. DELZELL, Lincoln, Nebraska. State Superintendent. August 1, 1912. REPORT OF INSPECTOR. State Superintendent James E. Delzell, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: fin compliance with your request I submit the following report of Department of Inspection of Normal Training in High Schools for biennium 1910-1912. The number of public schools giving normal training has increased from 103 to 143 and the academies from 7 to 8, making a total of 151 schools where normal training is given. Each of these schools has been personally inspected once, twenty-eight of the newer ones twice during the past year. During these 179 visits the work of about 1.100 teach - ers has been carefully noted and about 700 more hare been met in conferences. R'he number of pupils entering the training classes has increased the enrollment reached 3,000 the second semester of 1912. About of these were in the senior year and most of these are ready to teach. These young people are, in the majority of schools, the most capable pupils in the classes and are usually found to be very much in earnest and quite anxious to receive suggestions concerning their work. Superintendents are discouraging weak and careless pupils from enter - ing the training class. This attitude is the right cne. It is desir - able that only competent teachers be sent out from our high schools to take charge of the rural schools. Often these trainers have been found doing substitute work and usually in a commendable manner. P Methods and plans for observation work in the grades have 1m - ed. Superintendents are making regular schedules for observa - and giving suggestive outlines to be followed. The results are very encouraging. Trainers are becoming more carefully critical and are much better prepared to take charge of a class. A greater degree of self-reliance is noticeable. Rural school visitation is better and more systematically done by the trainers. Two days spent in at least two different rural schools is proving quite satisfactory both to the trainers and to the school author - ities. Usually the county superintendent is consulted regarding the best </seg>
            <seg id="p203">172 K schools to visit. The trainers take their noon lunches with them nd not less than half a day in any one school. The demand for these normal training teachers in rural and village schools is still increasing. At no time during the last three years has there been a sufficient number to fill the places open to them. Ability to organize their schools quickly and begin work successfully without Iom of time is winning approval from school boards and county super - intendents. This is shown by the increased salaries they are receiving, many rural schools paying from $50 to $70 per month and sometimes even higher wages. The wisdom of the legislators who secured the additional appro - priation with the intent of encouraging more schools in the western part of the state to undertake normal training is already justified. Under this provision seventeen schools have begun normal training west of the first guide meridian, about on a north and siuth line through Hastings and Grand Island. Trainers from these schools will help to relieve the scarcity of teachers which so often occurs in the western half of Nebraska. There is a general feeling of satisfaction among superintendents and boards of education over the results already secured through the city certification law. It is much easier than formerly for authorities to secure a properly certificated teacher since schools organized under subdivision 14 of the school laws require all teachers to hold city certificates. These certificates specify the grade in which the holder may teach, or in a high school certificate, the subjects, and otherwise safeguard both teacher and the school board. By this means better qualified teachers are being secured for the normal training schools. The most cordial co-operation by city superintendents, boards of education, county superintendents and teachers has made the work of inspection a pleasure. All have given aid in securing data necessary to a full understanding of the conditions and results of normal train - ing; all have been helpful in making reports giving information neces- E' to the most successful inspection and all have united in helping trainers to make as full preparation as possible for the work before Q. , » The following recommendations are made after careful observa- tion: Superintendents or some one duly authorized should make out all reports promptly and when secretary needs to sign them, take them to him for his signature and then mail them to the state superintendent. The reason for this is that the secretary is generally a very busy man and it would take him much longer to make out the reports than it would for the superintendent to do so. After noting the result of rural school visitation the past year I wish to recommend a continuance of the requirement that trainers shall </seg>
            <seg id="p204">173 Trainers should write out and leave on file with the superin - tendent a report of these visitations so that the inspector may call for them during his visit. There is still need of better trained teachers in agriculture. Many of those teaching this subject are doing little more than hear recitations on the subject matter of the text book. Every teacher of the subject should be able to take pupils into field and garden as well as in the laboratory and help them to deal directly with the simpler problems of soil, plant, and animal life. Trainers as well as teachers are pleased that the course is to include the minor reviews, drawing, mental arithmetic, penmanship, physiology and orthography. No trainer should be certificated to teach who has not reviewed these subjects for at least four weeks for each of the first four and two weeks for the last. y'o teacher should be employed in the grades who has not taught st six months or else is a graduate of the advanced course of a .1 school and has done the actual teaching such as is required of aduates of the advanced state normal course. G. A. GREGORY. Inspector. TO THK NORMAL TRAINER. During your course in normal training you are making prepara - tion for a useful and very important work. If you are in the right attitude toward this work during your preparation you will not only receive great benefit from the instruction given but you will be - come much more self-reliant, more keenly awake to observe care - fully the methods used by your instructors, more ready to be helpfjl to your associates. Doubtless you have found that with a definite purpose in mind you have more Readily held yourself to the task beforo Rl placing normal training in the high schools of Nebraska our tors hoped to provide better qualified teachers for rural and schools. That this hope is being realized is shown by the general approval and encouragement offered by county superintendents to normal training teachers, by the desire of school boards and patrons to secure these teachers, and by the fact that usually the trainers Cm high schools receive the best wages of any class of rural or village chers. School boards have found that these trainers are usually pre - pared to begin school the first day. They have been taught what to do the first day and how to do it: how to organize and conduce their schools, prepare programs, and do other detail work. They have spent much time in observing both town and rural teachers at work, have noted their methods both in instruction and of discipline. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">174 grades of their home school. They have talked with their instructors •bout what they have observed and learned to know the best methods. Ee first class was graduated under the present provisions of the training law in 1908. It had 550 members. The number of :es has increased each year, the class of 1912 numbering 1,002 Over 4,000 high school graduates have taken the normal training course in the past five years, and there are now enrolled for the graduating class of 1913 over 2,000. Bis data is given that you may know this movement is meeting roval of educators, taxpayers, and pupils. EH is somewhat inspiring to be a part of the educational army of raska. The cause is a great one, there are plenty of obstacles to bat and there is a sure reward of growth and strength both mental moral to the one who properly prepares for the fray. » Besides the fitness of a teacher to give instruction in the subjects the course of study there is another quality that has much to do with the greatest efficiency of the teacher. This quality is quite within the reach of everyone, but it is most easily attained and perfected dur - ing the years spent in high school. This quality may be termed, per - sonality. There are at least three factors under this head which are within the control of everyone. L(a) General bearing and movement. The best teachers are quiet, t give an impression of firmness and self-command in every action. They have poise, or balance, and are not seen doing things in undue haste by which many nervously inclined children are made restless. On inquiry, such teachers were found to be careful of their health. They took proper sleep and exercise, were not attempting to teach school si". hours, make preparation three hours, manage one or two clubs and in - cidentally spend a few hours reading useless fiction. They considered that their time and strength belonged first to the children whom they had contracted to teach. (b) Voice is a potent factor in success. A clear, well modulated voice, medium pitch and subdued force is bringing many teachers from ten to twenty-five dollars a month. Their salaries are that much higher than they would be without the voice. The effect upon pupils is won - derful. I have seen pupils in a high school recitation who were rest - less and inattentive, even rebellious, under a loud voice, who in passing to another teacher became attentive, quiet and responsive under the influence of a good voice. (c) The eye is the window of the soul and through it may shine rays of influence that will conquer the most refractory disposition. But there must be a real soul back of the window. These three factors combined in one person go far to win success. Who has not felt the power of the teacher who with queenly bearing, and well modulated voice rests her eye sympathetically upon the pupii she ad droned* All this is within the grasp of every teacher. </seg>

            <seg id="p210">179 SUPERINTENDENT AND TRAINERS. It is your duty to become familiar with the requirements for the completion and recognition of normal training. In the following pages you will find directions which must be carefully followed both by your superintendent and yourself in order to secure credits that will enable you to receive a county second grade certificate at the close of your high school course. All records of your four year high school course must be properly reported. Much responsibility rests on your city superintendent and you should do all in your power to help him keep your record clear. Among other duties your superintendent must report to the state superintendent each year, your attendance in the normal class. He must also report to the State Uni - versity all the grades of your four years high school course, in all sub - jects for which you are to receive University credits. Declaration PSign the declaration, which is sent to your school for that pur - !, on entering the class. This must be done each year you are in class. Failure to do this forfeits all rights to any grades. &lt; 'lass Attendance PUtend all the twelve required classes the full time, inese claaaes inder major reviews: Reading, grammar, arithmetic, geography, not less than nine weeks; history, pedagogy and agriculture, each not less than eighteen weeks. Classes under minor reviews are: Draw - ing, mental arithmetic, penmanship, physiology, ortbograpiiy. Four weeks for each of the first four minor reviews and two weeks for E;raphy. In cases of absence from the class you must make it sat - ry with the teacher for he must vouch for your attendance full Four Years' Attendance and Credits rYou must complete the entire prescribed course in normal train - and graduate from the regular high school course of study. AH the above studies, except agriculture, must be taken in the junior and senior years of a normal training high school. Pedagogy must be tak - en in the senior year. You must graduate with not less than twenty - eight University credits. Examinations Before you can receive credit for certification in subjects it will be necessary for you to register with the county superintendent and thereby secure a number, for which you pay $1.50. This should be done early in the junior year. A grade once entered on a given registration number exhausts the candidate's rights for that subject on that number. To secure the </seg>
            <seg id="p211">180 entry of a different grade in that subject the applicant must re-register and secure a new number. The county number too is necessary before any attendance record can be certified to the state superintendent. Grades received in any normal training high school in English composition, algebra, geometry, botany, physics, physiology, civics, and agriculture, if accepted by the State University may, at the op - tion of the County superintendent, be transferred to the state super - intendent's record and then to the county superintendent's record and placed on the pupil's certificate, thus obviating the necessity of a special examination in these subjects. Bookkeeping when taken a full semester receives credit with the above studies. When taken but six weeks, in accordance with suggestions given under "Four Year's Program," the pupil will be credited with the grade if it is given in the report with the other studies when sent to the State University. No University credit is given for minor reviews. A pupil registered under a county number who takes an exami - nation on one of the above subjects loses right to the University grade on that subject under that number, but may re-register and then secure the University credit under the new number, at the option of the county superintendent. Responsibility of City Superintendent and Secretary of Board of Education. Your records in the state superintendent's office are made up from material sent in by your city superintendent and secretary of the board of education. Any errors or omissions by either of them will make your records incomplete and will delay or prevent your certifioatkm. Changing School Should you change schools during your high school course, have all your grades transferred because only the school from which you graduate can send the final report to the state department. Grade of Certificate Normal training graduates who have had no experience will re - ceive a second grade certificate. After one year's successful teach - ing and doing the reading circle work a first grade certificate may be issued without further examination, at the option of the county superintendent. The above rules are subject to change, but all county and city superintendents will receive due notice. SUMMARY From above statements it appears there are three groups of sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p212">181 k First. Normal training special subjects: Major re W8, history and pedagogy. Examinations are required in se. Second. Those studies which are not accredited at the State University: Minor reviews, and, if not studied in the high school, civil government, bookkeeping. Examinations are required in these subjects. Third. Subjects that are accredited by the State Univer - sity and not found in the first group: E;ebra, botany, geometry, physics, agriculture, and, if taught high school, civil government, bookkeeping, physiology, and composition. In these no examination is required if the ity grades are accepted by the county superintendent. For convenience of reference the law relating to issuance of county certificates to normal training pupils is given below. CERTIFICATION'. Sec. 7. — First grade county certificates. — Normal training. — The first grade county certificate may be granted to any person of ap - proved learning and character, and possessing evident ability to teach and govern a school, who shall pass a satisfactory examiation in all the branches required to obtain a second grade county cer - tificate; and in algebra, botany, geometry, and physics: Provided, That on and after September 1, 1907, no person shall be granted a first grade county certificate who has not had at least twelve weeks' normal training in a college, university, or normal school of ap - proved standing in this or in another state, or in a state junior normal school of Nebraska, or in a high school of Nebraska approved hthe state superintendent of public instruction as being equipped ;ive such normal training: Provided further. That one or more re' successful experience as a teacher may be considered the ivalent of the normal training required by this section. Sec. 8. — Second grade county certificates. — Normal training. — The second grade county certificate may be granted to any person of approved learning and character, who, in addition to the branches specified for the third grade county certificate, shall pass a satis - factory examination in civil government, bookkeeping, blackboard drawing, theory and art of teaching, and the elements of agriculture, including a fair knowledge of the structure and habits of the com - mon plants, insects, birds and quadrupeds; Provided, That on and after September 1, 1907, no person shall be granted a second grade county certificate who has not had at least eight weeks' normal training in a college, university, or normal school of approved stand - ing in this or in another state, or in a state junior normal school of Ne - braska, or in a high school of Nebraska approved by the state super- </seg>
            <seg id="p213">182 intendent of public instruction as being equipped to give such normal Ening; Provided further, That one or more years' successful ex - ence as a teacher may be considered the equivalent of the normal ning required by this section. Sec. 9. — Third grade county certificates. — The third grade county certificate may be granted to any person of approved character who shall pass a satisfactory examination in orthography, reading, pen - manship, geography, arithmetic, physiology and hygiene, English composition, English grammar, and United States history. MINOR REVIEWS. Eis found that in most schools normal training pupils have no undei a teacher »n the subjects of penmanship, drawing, mental etic, physiology and orthography. P Beginning with the school year 1912-13, instruction in these cts is required. Four weeks are to be given to each of the first and two weeks to orthography. In case anyone of the five minor review subjects is regularly taught in the high school, pupils who take the subject in such regular class need not take it in a review class but the superintendent must report the number of weeks taken by each trainer in each of the five minor reviews. Normal trainers may need to omit chemistry, which is no longer required for University entrance, solid geometry or some other subject of less importance to them. Normal training is given to help prepare teachers, primarily to teach in rural schools. It is found that they need at least the amount of review indicated in these subjects. CREDIT FOR REVIEWS. Hereafter two credits will be given by the University for a minimum of nine weeks given to each of the major reviews, provided that the pupil wishing two credits shall not take more than three other subjects during the time he is taking a review subject and pro - vided the superintendent shall so state in his report to the University for each pupil wishing such credit. The University in granting such credit expects the pupil to put as much time on a review subject as on any other academic work. OBSERVATION. The observation work of trainers should be planned and sys - tematized so that the pupil, the superintendent and the grade teachers know when the observation lesson will be given and who will observe. The superintendent should often be present. The work should be discussed at some later period. A mere visiting a grade by a trainer will not be very helpful. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">183 VISITING RURAL SCHOOLS. During the senior year every trainer hereafter must spend at least two days in a rural school. Two or more good schools should be se - lected for this purpose and a full written report of each visit filed with the superintendent. These visits, if properly planned and the time ju - diciously spent, will be of much help to trainers. MEMBERS OF NORMAL TRAINING CLASSES. The only method of knowing who are members of the trainers' class is the signature of the members filed with the state superintend- It is imperative hereafter that the pupils sign in duplicate, one signature being in some permanent record book kept by the school. During the coming year the inspector will meet the trainers' classes and discuss the work already covered, the plans followed in obser - vation work and all such details as may in any way lead to a clear knowledge of the value and the progress of the normal training in the respective classes. He will also endeavor to meet some or all of the teachers who are directly concerned in the normal training work. Though county superintendents are usually very busy among their rural schools we trust that each one will visit the trainers' classes in his county early in the year and be able to give helpful criticism when opportunity offers. COMPLETING EXAMINATIONS. Pit should be the aim of every trainer, to finish all examinations later than April of the senior year. By doing this there will be possibility of receiving from the county superintendent the teachers' certificate on the day of graduation. Superintendents of normal training schools should encourage pupils to do this. There are many advantages to the trainer who is in possession of her certificate at the close of the high school course. Schools that adopt the plan of a semester given to four or five "other reviews" will soon be sending out teachers ready for immediate employment. RECORDS Normal training as contemplated by the state law will not care for itself. There must be some machinery to run a system in which are found one hundred fifty schools and over two thousand trainers. The law makes the state superintendent of public instruction the head of this system and he must know in some way the condition of the schools, quality of work, type of teachers who come from the schools, type of teachers who are training them and many other </seg>
            <seg id="p215">184 school. At the close of the first week of school in the fall a report is made which shows the qualifications of teachers and gives the names of the trainers together with the application for recognition. Near the close of the year the attendance report of the trainers is to be given. Any flaw or failure in either of these reports might cause much trouble to the entire class of trainers. Usually no other etten reports are required, but occasionally some data bearing on work is asked. ESo vital to the interests of the trainers are these two regular re - s that we are asking school boards to consider it a grave error one whose duty it is to make out the reports to fail to do so. one can make them out except the superintendent or some one he faculty appointed for that purpose though the secretary of board must vouch for them. E Trainers are involved in the report made to the University of the les of the graduating class. Grades of subjects needed on a first le teachers' certificate may be sent from the state university to state superintendent and then, at the option of the county super - ndent, called for and placed on the trainers' certificate. Sometimes it has occurred that a report from a superintendent failed to show the attendance of a pupil in the normal training classes. Such pupils in due time received a card from the University showing thirty-two entrance credits and the pupils wonder why the grades for normal training have not been sent to the county superin - tendent. See Normal Training Bulletin No. 6, for explanation. Out of over a hundred mistakes during the past year affecting normal trainers all but three were due to superintendents who had omitted something or copied the record incorrectly. EARLY REPORTS. Both the University inspector of high schools and the inspector of normal training advise that the university report and the attend - ance report to the state superintendent be mailed to their respective destination at least two weeks before the close of the spring term. By that time the records of the graduating class are sufficiently complete so that the report may be safely sent. In case of any emergency after the reports are sent, an amended report to cover the emergency can easily be made. tit is to be hoped that school boards will hereafter hold the proper ■mber of the faculty responsible for the sending in of these re - rts. An incentive to prompt action is offered by one school board which pays the superintendent his last month's salary when he pro - duces evidence of the acceptance, by the proper parties, of these </seg>
            <seg id="p216">185 BETTER WORK IX GRADES. Pt is not enough that a normal training school shall be well ped in the high school department only. Well qualified teachers successful experience should be in charge of every grade. This is necessary that the pupils may be well fitted for the high school normal training class and that the trainers may have ample opportunity of observing good grade work. The policy of some school boards to elect inferior or inexperienced teachers will soon result in lower - ing the quality of work done, then in a removal of the normal train - ing from such school. OVERCROWDED ROOMS. No teacher should be expected to take charge of a grade in whu-h. over forty pupils are enrolled. Although during the growth of a town it is not always possible to keep down to this number, school boards and superintendents should anticipate as well as possible the needs of the year. Better arrange for thirty to a teacher than to plan for more than forty. Often an emergency is met by renting an outside room and employing an extra teacher. When several grades have a few more than the proper number the problem is solved by taking a few of the best pupils from each grade and placing them with a strong teacher who is paid a better salary than others for doing tn:s harder work. It is very important that trainers should have ample opportunity of learning the best methods of the best teachers in the grades. Read - ing, arithmetic and language are the three subjects poorest taught in the country. Trainers should be well founded in good methods in these branches. If teachers in grades are not using some consistent method of teach - ing addition and other fundamental processes in arithmetic, require them taught in the review class. Give opportunity of hearing good language work in the grades. So important is this subject and so effet-tive is the example of the teacher. that no trainer should be continued in the class 6d the eleventh grade, who does not use good language, with good iation. It has been said, and perhaps truly, that "the subject poorly taught in our American schools is English," meaning by laily oral English and the written work ot every day life. INSPECTION. ■'uring the school year personal visitation and inspection of the is made by the normal training inspector or one of his assist - rho reports to the state superintendent. During this visit the credit points already made by each trainer will be called for and a note made of the general standing and ability of each one. Those in charge of the training may facilitate this work </seg>
            <seg id="p217">186 ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY. There are many valuable suggestions for normal training pupils in the 1910 edition of the Course of Study for Elementary Schools. Normal trainers will find it helpful to use in connection with their review subjects. Examinations in drawing will be based on the out - line given there. Every normal trainer who becomes a teacher should get in touch with the county superintendent and use the course of study according to his directions. TEACHERS IX NORMAL TRAINING SCHOOLS To the teachers in normal training schools is entrusted a great responsibility. You are helping prepare some of the pupils in the high school department of the public schools to teach. It is a privilege to do this and at the same time it is an incentive to do the best you can. both directly and indirectly, to make your daily class room work as nearly ideal as possible. is a pleasure to note the effort generally made by teachers to as helpful as possible to normal training pupils. High school teach - ers, especially those who are teaching normal training subjects, are in immediate contact with the pupils. They have much to do with the successful outcome of the normal training movement. The grade teacher, however, must present model recitations and regularly use such methods as will not only secure good results for her pupils, but also will be readily understood by trainers who are observing. The manner and voice of the teacher, her direction and control of the activites of the room are so important that every wise teacher is giving these matters large consideration. In visiting over two thousand teachers in the normal training schools, there has been opportunity of noting many types of successful teachers. It is the purpose of this bulletin to emphasize some of the commendable traits found in those who are doing the most for the pu - pils of their classes, to note some of the good methods in use, and to mention briefly other matters that may be helpful in securing a greater degree of efficiency. LANGUAGE. Familiar conversation on subjects in which children are interested begins the first day of the child's school life. Backward pupils are carefully encouraged. The teacher finds out what things interest the child most and soon wins the child's confidence. Often, with bashful children, some of the best lessons are taught in the games of activity in the school room or on the play ground. The value of language keeps this subject present in every recita- </seg>
            <seg id="p218">187 the day of graduation. Our best teachers are doing this and the results show plainly what may be done by careful effort. Stories told and retold, furnish a vast amount of language drill. Encourage children to tell about their pets, or about some of the many events that are important in their estimation. The live teacher finds plenty of interesting material. HEADING. El teachers recognize the importance of this subject. Many are g good results, many are doing medium work, some are doing P Results vary so widely as to be almost incredible. Why should the nd grade A, at McCook, read thirteen books in eight months whilo same grade in another town in the same time reads fifty pages in one book? In the first case, the reading was bright, expressive, intelli - gent and the pupils knew meanings of words and could read well in any new book including third readers. In the second case, the reading was dull, without expression and pupils could not read, without help, the lessons they had studied. The pupils in the first case were better pre - pared in all other subjects than were those in the second case, show - ing that an undue amount of time had not been spent in the first case on reading. One more comparison will be enough to emphasize the point: Why should pupils in Emerson who entered school in September read through two Ward primers. Ward first reader, and then be reading miscellane - ous selections in May, while in another town the pupils entering at the same time had read to page 40 in another primer, conceded to be much easier than the primer used at Emerson? The best reading without exception is found in those schools where phonics and phonograms are properly used. There has not been found Eher in the first three grades who was teaching reading well who &gt;t adhere very closely to a system of reading based upon sight phonics and phonograms. Ehat we need in many schools is better reading and if it can be 1 by some certain method then why deny the children the privi - that method? In order that I may be definite it may be well to state that in the i-ases of McCook and Emerson the Ward or Rational Method was used, in the other two, no method. About ninety per cent of the good read - ing observed in the state last year was secured through the Ward method. It is hoped that every normal training pupil may have oppor - tunity of observing and becoming familiar with some one of the meth - ods based on phonics. If one of these methods is not in use in the grades of any normal training school, it is suggested that the teacher of reading in the training class give the trainers an opportunity of be- </seg>
            <seg id="p219">188 follow and has been successfully used in numbers of rural schools, as well aa villages, towns and our largest cities. Normal trainers can secure the books and work the method successfully without assistance, if necessary. Reading and Dictionary. While visiting the Havelock schools, I was much Interested in watching an experiment of putting the diction - ary in the hands of a grade for the first time. The pupils were given twenty words. They were prepared to spell the words, mark them diacritically, place the accent, give a meaning for each and use it in a sentence. Here are a part of the words taken from the board: vermillion grotesque developed existence conscious prismatic opaque extraordinary familiarity intricate coquettishly consternation Very few errors were made by the class when called on. 11 jw rould a third grade do this the first time of using a dictionary? How could they spell and understand such words? Nothing but the Ward method had been used to prepare them. k Similar results are obtained in the larger towns and cities where method is used. But no matter what the method, the public that for the work has a right to call for results and the children who &gt;ass this way but once need the best we can give them. FMtoi Assignment. Some teachers fail in their treatment of read - cause they give too little attention to the assignment of the les- Pupils do not have &amp; clear idea as to what is expected. Often pupils are permitted to pass on to a more advanced book without master - ing the one in use. There is a tendency to place in the hands of pupils books of literature beyond their comprehension or ability to grasp. The result is a loss of interest which soon leads to careless preparation or none, and then to slovenly expression. Is it too much to ask teach - ers in normal training schools to give this matter very serious consider - ation? If improvement is possible, undertake it with a spirit that will lead to success. Heading Kxaminations. Eis believed that better results in review of reading may be se - by making' an intensive rather than an extensive effort. So time has been spent on the theory of the subject and in striv - ing to gain a knowledge of so many authors that little time was left for trainers to gain skill in the art of reading. A teacher who can - not read well is not likely to teach others to read well. With this in mind, it has been decided that all the theory of read - ing needed in review is found in "Sherman and Reed's Essentials of Reading," and that the only authors to be discussed in examination, until further notice, are the following, together with their selections, which are found either in Sherman and Reed's Essentials of Reading </seg>
            <seg id="p220">189 or in Studies in Reading by Searson and Martin. These texts are named because it is believed they are found in every normal training bchool. prose selections to be used from Part IV of Sherman and d's Essentials of Reading are from the following writers: (Good teachers differ as to the time to begin this subject. There is, owever, general agreement that considerable facility should be gained rst in reading. Many begin spelling at about the time of the com - pletion of the first primer, some take a short review of the first primer and while doing this introduce the spelling of a few of the most in - teresting words in the reading lesson. Others begin it when entering the second primer. When it is begun, all words should be taken from the reading lessons. Indeed many of the teachers who are securing the best results do not permit a regular spelling book to be used until the fifth or sixth grades. They require more and more of the new words met in any study to be spelled at the time of reciting that lesson. Script or Print. Pupils should be taught to do all written copy work in script and as soon as spelling is begun all written work on the board by the teacher should be in script. The question of having a text in script, for a reader, is of little importance. Teachers are succeed - ing as well without a script text as with it. Children will learn script tr writing purposes and not confuse it with print in books if the teach - will encourage them. A list of all words spelled should be kept by the teacher and fre - quent reviews given of the difficult words.

            <seg id="p221">190 NUMBERS. Those who seem to be succeeding best in teaching numbers are not emphasizing this work during the first two school years. Counting, making the figures, learning to make and recognize the numbers as found on the pages of books used, telling time on the clock, and similar in - cidental items that come naturally into the school life of the child are all that are attempted during the first year or even year and a half. Shenever addition is begun in a formal way it is of the utmost im - rtance that it be treated carefully and patiently. Addition Very few teachers are securing good results from their methods in teaching addition. This ought not to be since the whole process of teaching it can be reduced to a few steps which, if logically taken and the proper amount of drill given, will develop in the pupil, speed and accuracy. We have all seen pupils counting numbers together either by tapping the board, making marks or counting fingers. We hasten to condemn this process but forget that children would not do this had they not been permitted by the teacher to form the habit. If the fol - lowing method is carefully and properly used the pupil will not be tempted to count the numbers together and one-half the time usually spent in learning addition will give the pupil the ability to add rapidly and accurately. Counting Objects. The usual method of teaching the sum of two digits by counting objects together is correct, but this should be done during one lesson only for each combination. It may be done by the teacher or by the pupils but never repeated in a following lesson. Probably it is better to give each pupil the proper number of objects, as kernels of corn. If the lesson is to discover the sum of four objects and five objects, tell the pupils to make two groups one of four and the other of five kernels, then ask them to put the two groups together and count the one large group. It is better if one child has corn, an - other beans, another tooth-picks, another books, etc. ; as many different sets of objects as may be convenient. After all the pupils in the class seem ready to give the results of their counting the teacher calls on Mary who replies, "Fcur kernels of corn and five kernels of corn are nine kernels of corn." Charles says, "Four beans and five beans are nine beans," and so on around the class. Tiie teacher continues, "Four tree* and five trees are how many trees?" Four kittens and five kit - tens are how many kittens?" Continue this with several things. The teacher then asks, "Will four things and tive things of the same kind make nine things?" Then finally, "Four and five are how many?" then, Five and four are how many?" Only that one combination should be taught during the lesson but before closing the lesson be sure that each pupil has said separately as well as in concert, "Four and five are nine." This lesson should be given early in the morning and the pupils </seg>

These ten recitations combined should not occupy more than two or three minutes. It is done by simply calling, '•Atten - ion, B class. How many are five boys and four boys, William? How nany are four boys and five boys, Dora, etc." Then pass on to the work. Jo not let pupils do any counting with objects at seats nor give them anything whatever to do in numbers except the drill under your direc - ion as above indicated. One new combination every two or three days s enough since a continual rapid review of all preceding work is to be done each day. If any pupil should forget the result, let a pupil tell him. Keep high interest with rapid short drills. No time should be given pupils to reason out the result. This was done when the combination was first presented with objects. The question as to when to begin teaching these combinations will be determined, in towns, by the principal or superintendents, in the ■ountry, by the teacher and local conditions. Reading, talking and games are far more important than numbers during the first year, but t may do to begin the combinations in the latter part of the first year. n some rural schools where there are two or three pupils in the first grade more and better work is often done by the end of the first year han is possible in a large grade in town. </seg>

If an average of two a week thoroughly mastered all will be learned in eighteen weeks. With the usual lack of system few pupils know these combinations after three years' effort.

An ex - cellent drill may be given by the teacher pointing to the combinations t Figure 2, the individuals answering quickly. An exercise like the ve, Figure 2, should be given in less than five seconds. Another good drill device is shown in Figure 3. The nine digits except one are arranged promiscuously about the outer circle, the cen - ter number is varied as the teacher wishes, not using a number, how - ever, larger than that found in the group of table number one (1) thu was last learned. Figure No. 4 Pfter pupils are proficient to about the 6's in table number one that they can use the combinations as shown in Figure No. 3, then such as in Figure No. 4, should be introduced and less of Figure used. In using Figure No. 4 proceed as follows: Pointing to 6 the says "Six," then to 8 the pupil says "Eight, fourteen. Set down carry the 1." The teacher then places 14 at the top of column and 4 below. The teacher then points to the 1 at the top of the column, pupil says "One," pointing to 7 the pupil says "Seven, eight," pointing to 4 the pupil says "Four, twelve, set down the 2 and carry the 1." The teacher places 12 at the top of column and 2 below. Proceed thus through the work. The sum of each column should be placed at the top in smaller figures and left there. Continue this practice of leaving the sum of the column at the top through the grades. In actual bust- </seg>

Figure No. 5: Pupils should now be made very familiar with the scale of numbers from twenty to one hundred. An aid in doing this is shown in Figure No. 5. It is not necessary to use more of the scale than from 20 to 40, with the children, as they easily understand that there is constant repetition, each group of ten being formed in the same regular way. Pupils should be able to answer instantly such questions as: If we think of the number 23, what is the first number up the scale ending in seven'.' Answer, "27." Ending in 4, "24," in 0, "30," etc. We are now ready to take the last step preparatory to real addition. The pupil knows that 7 and 8 make 15. Few, however, are impressed Eth the fact that the result, 15, ends with the figure I. Set down the mbers as follows: and have pupils add them. Then show two things, that the sum of 8 and any number ending with 7 will be a number ending with ."&gt; and that the sum will always be the first number ending in 5 up the scale from the number taken. That is, if 27 is taken, 27 and 8 give the first 5 up the scale from 27, or 35. In a similar way teach other combinations, for example, if the sum of 4 and 8 gives a number ending in 2, then 64 and 8 gives a number ending in 2 and it is the first 2 found in the scale j 7 87 47 «7 8 I 8 8 8 5 »r&gt; 55 7T, </seg>

Bthe preceding work has been carefully done and all of it under mediate eye and most of it by the hand of the teacher with the either answering from their position in the class or going to the one at a time, then the pupils are ready to begin real adding. Ethe practice work that follows, do not use for some time any of its from 1 to 4, inclusive, then since the work will be done rapidly rill be less temptation and scarcely time for stopping to count s together. 5 17 9 5 Description: The teacher points and pupils are trained to read as follows, beginning at units column with figure 6, "Six, nine, fifteen." teacher writes 15 in place then points to 5 in 15, pupils read "Five, eight, three, twenty-three." The teacher writes 23 in place then piinis to 3 of the 23, pupils read, 'Three, seven, naught, thirty," the teachcer writes 30 in place then points, pupils read, "Naught, nine, nine, thirty-nine," teacher wrifes 39 in place then points, pupils read "Nine, six, five, forty-five," the teacher writes forty-five at the top of the col - umn. Pupils say, "Set down the five and carry the four." Teacher now points to 4 at the top of the column then to 7 at the bottom, pupils ■ay "Four, seven, eleven," and thus the work continues. After a few days of careful drill, the teacher may stand at the board and write in the numbers as fast as the pupils read them. The work as heard by one listening will then be for the units column in Figure 6, as follows: Six, nine, fifteen; five, eight, three, twenty-three; three, seven, naught, thirty; naught, nine, thirty-nine; nine, six, five, forty-five. This may be shortened by emphasizing strongly the units figure of every number above twenty, as the emphasis will mark the figure in the minds of the pupils as well as is done by repeating tt. The units column of Figure 6 will then read, six, nine, fifteen; five. igure No. 6 Figure No. 7 48 M 9 7 8 6 :.798 41 in 7 8 6 9 6 9 7.-, 7 8 6 8 8 6 9 7 8 6 8 7 9 7 6 8 2« 23 S 6 7 8 7 9 7 6 4 7 0 7 2 ii ii C 7 8 9 1 1 a t\ •* r* </seg>

After a good degree of proficiency is secured ask pupils to read the columns the same but visualize the inserted numbers, picture the Eibers in place, the teacher pointing to them just as though they e there. Units column in Figure 7 will then read, "Six, eight, fourteen," teacher points to place of 14, "Four, seven, one, twenty-one," teacher roints to place of 21, "Eight, nine, twenty-nine," teacher points to place of twenty-nine, "Five, four, thirty-four," teacher points to place 34, "Eight, two, forty-two." Teacher writes 4 2 at top of column. Pupil says. "Set down the 2 and carry the 4." The last step is asking pupils to read the column by simply naming the result after each figure. Units column of Figure 7 will then read: 'Six, fourteen, twenty-one, twenty-nine, thirty-four, forty-two." The next column will read, "Four, eleven, seventeen, twenty-Jive, thirty-one, thirty-eight, forty-seven." Up to this time, though it may be one or two years after be - ginning addition with the class there should be given no opportunity for pupils to work by themselves at their seats or in large groups at the board, give no seat work in numbers, except writing numbers to get form and quickness, or copying numbers for practice. EPhis method has been tried and found entirely practical. Any er who cares to save time for pupils and at the same time get ble results can perfect herself in the method, but she must prac - n it before she tries it with the class. Joseph Sparks, president of the Cha-lron state normal, several years president of the state board of examiners for county certificates, stated that the two greatest sources of error in arithmetic ex - aminations were addition and placing of decimal points in division of decimals. PThe above method carefully followed will in a few years give us teachers and pupils who can add. If teachers will teach division by Austrian method the foundation will be laid for teaching quickly effectively, the pointing off in division of decimals. Austrian Method of Division. All agree that logically the quotient should be placed as near as possible to the dividend and that the rela - tion of each quotient figure to the part of the dividend from which it is derived should be apparent. In short division we have all been in the habit of placing the Quotient in this relation to the dividend by putting it immediately below the dividend with each figure immediately below the one from which it came. If now, we place the quotient above the dividend in long </seg>
            <seg id="p230">197 It is very important that each quotient figure should be placed directly above its dividend figure. By this method it is evident that the pupils can scarcely fail to place a cipher in the quotient when it is needed. For division of dec - imals the following rule would do, though not technically worded: L Write the dividend and divisor as for the Austrian method. Make (x) at the right of the divisor, make an (x) as many places to the right of the decimal point in the dividend as (x) in the divisor is to the right of the decimal point in the divisor and put a decimal point at once in the quotient's place directly over the (xi in the dividend, Evide as in simple division, treating the numbers as integers. The fol - ding illustration will explain the rule: 1. 2. 3. 4. ••va 46 i 1058292 984 742 738 492 492 32x ) 3.96x8 2x 12.4 32x ) 3.96x8 3 2 76 ,4 128 128 — 124 00. 32x ) 3968. OOx 1.24 </seg>
            <seg id="p231">198 Figure 1 indicates what is done before dividing. The decimal point is located, as it should be before the division takes place. Decimals is the new topic for the pupil. He knows division, hence emphasize the decimal point. If the decimal point is placed before dividing, it will not be forgotten afterward. Figure 2 shows the work completed. There are three possible cases in division of decimals. Case 1 : In which there is a decimal point in both dividend and divisor. Figure 1 illustrates this case. Case 2: In which there is a decimal point in the divisor only. Figure 3 illustrates this case. In this case the decimal point which may be •aid to follow every integer is made visible in the dividend, then to apply the rule it will be found necessary to annex ciphers. Case 3: In which there is a decimal point in the dividend only. Figure 4 illustrates this case. In this case the rule applies, but since the decimal point is not moved in the divisor it must not be moved in the dividend, therefore, place the decimal point directly above the point in the dividend. Et is readily seen that this method is based entirely on the prin - already familiar to the pupil: "Multiplying dividend and divisor &gt; same number does not change the value of the quotient." E&gt;ne author of arithmetics suggests actually moving the decimal out of the divisor and moving the point in the dividend to corre - , and erasing the original points. This would destroy the prob - o that it could not be restored and it is not necessary. r &gt; upils in sixth grades, who were floundering in pointing off have taught this method in a few minutes and their troubles removed. Omitting Paits of Arithmetic. All parts of arithmetic are not of equal importance. Careful teachers are now passing lightly over many Eics and omitting others. The following subjects are receiving slight sideration below the high school: E Complex fractions, tables of denominate numbers that are rarely I; all rules of computing interest except "Multiply the principal by rate, the product will be the interest for one year. Multiply the rest for one year by the time, the product will be the required in- Eundreds of tests taken with teachers in institutes and pupils in chools prove that no other rule is so easily remembered. An - nterest, compound interest, bank discount, true discount, ex - . stocks and bonds, are lightly touched or entirely omitted below ;h school. Metric system should not be treated until it is needed inced work. GEOGRAPHY Nature study and geography are being treated orally through the third and fourth grades in many schools. In some of the best schools a text is not introduced until the fifth grade. The old style of slavishly following the text is quite obsolete Geographical readers industrial </seg>
            <seg id="p232">199 readers, papers of current events and much other valuable material showing man's relation to the earth, the influence of climate and topog - raphy upon him and his progress, varied industries and activities are giving excellent results when properly used. PHYSIOLOGY Talks on the use and care of the parts of the body, uses and abuses of food, drink, sleep, exercise, play, work and rest should begin in the first grade and continue through the grades. Reading books on the subject, such as the Gulick Series, are taking the place of the formal study of the subject. One semester in the seventh or eighth grade, given to a text is considered sufficient. Even in using the text, mem - orizing the names of all the bones and committing much of the technical material is not practiced in many schools. Charts illustrating anatomy are properly left for the high school. The use and abuse of alcohol and tobacco are generally carefully and consistently taught through the !The most hopeful movement in connection with the teaching of this act is the practical application that is being made in some schools le information gained from the study. Pupils are cleanly of person tidy about their desks. They do not play in mud or snow then i into the school room to sit in damp clothes. They stand erect are not seen slouching. An increasing number of schools are tak - calisthenic drills, not listlessly but with a vim and vivacity that indicates good health. Teachers are more careful about ventilation and temperature of school rooms. They are more careful to practice what they preach about keeping late hours. There is in fact a strong indi - cation that physiology is being utilized as a practical study. DRAWING. More attention should be given to this subject in the grades of many normal training schools. Every teacher can prepare to teach pencil drawing or blackboard drawing. It is this style of drawing that is most useful for the purpose of illustration and it is most easily man - aged in the average school room. Normal trainers in reviewing draw - ing should handle both pencil and crayon. The most practical outline to follow in this review is the "Course of Study for Elementary Schools of Nebraska" since that will be used in most counties in rural and village BChools. PKRTIXKXT TOPICS. Under this head will be mentioned several things that are giving good results in the schools where they were in u»e. Hand rai.sing. Careful teachers do not permit children to wave their hands to attract attention, nor to move from their positions in the </seg>
            <seg id="p233">200 class. A. strong, resourceful teacher develops quiet, self-reliant child - ren, who will not interfere with other children. Whispering. Hundreds of grades have been visited where whisper - ing and other useless habits were not seen. Borrowing pencils, knives, etc., is avoided by having e common knife always sharpened on the teacher's desk to be used by any one who needs it. A few pencils to loan may be kept on the teacher's de3k. Boisy Seats. Pupils are easily trained to turn and rise in the aisle it lifting seats, thus avoiding the noise so noticeable in disorderly . Two or three hundred may rise in an assembly room with no eeable noise. F fasting Time. Some teachers use fifteen seconds to pass a class seats to blackboard ready for work, olhers use two or three niin- A careful teacher will have her classes moving to a definite plan soon after the class is organized. I have seen pupils beginning early in the year come from seats to correct position in class without aid from the teacher. In marked contrast I have seen, in few cases, a leacher near the close of the year put pupils in position by taking hold of them as they came to class then if her arrangement for that par - ticular recitation did not suit her she would move them again. Survival of the fittest is rapidly displacing this latter type of teacher. The judicious teacher utilizes her pupils as helpers in passing material and in many other ways. She will quietly direct the move - ments of her pupils in various useful activities, take fewer steps herself and give the children the chance of resting their bodies by change of position. In the lower grades all ihe pupils will be given at least four short rest spells, one midway between morning and recess, and so on. This may be done by a little game, a run, calisthenics, or similar change, always with fresh air in the room. * Itepeating Questions and Answers. A good teacher seldom repeats a question. If the question is not understood it is the fault of the teacher usually. Either she has not the attention of the class or she does not speak plainly. Repeating questions or restating them develops the habit of inattention in pupils and cultivates the habit of useless talk - ing on the part of the teacher. In assigning lessons do not repeat. Even worse, if possible, is restating an answer given by a pupil or even making any reply if the answer is sufficiently accurate. A few indi - viduals are still found in charge of a school room who are afflicted with the "All right" habit or something similar. Throughout the reci - tation they are heard chirping- "All right, all right," to the pitch of B flat. Fortunately most of the pupils soon learn to ignore th-'s folly and would proceed the same if the teacher chirped "All wrong." Another weakness that can be corrected if the teacher and pupils work together is the use of the rising inflection after statements. The following taken from a recitation will illustrate. The interrogation </seg>
            <seg id="p234">201 Teacher: '"John, what state John: Ohio?" raises the most corn?" Teacher: "Mary?" Mary: "Kentucky?" Teacher: "William?"

Our best teachers are those who are giving heed to eir daily work, not only in the presentation of lessons but also in their daily walk and conversation. They are forming better habits of speech, gaining easier self control, and daily growing in their power of helpful influence. They are the leaven. To them we look for the example that will encourage pupils to strive toward noble ideals, and at the same time be an inspiration to their fellow teachers. NORMAL TKAIMXG LAW. TEXT OF LAW.

The grade earned in this six weeks' study may be reported to the I'niversity and then passed on to the State Superinten- Cnt. This grade may then be used on the certificate of a nornril lining pupil. KKQIIKKMKXTS KOK ADMISSION TO THK IXIVKKSITY Admission to the I'niversity is gained enly through registration in some one of its seven colleges or four schools. A uniform table of entrance requirements has been established which varies only in a small degree for all of the undergraduate colleges. The fol - lowing table of entrance requirements becomes effective September 1st, 1912: tuired Subjects — Points English 4 Mathematics* : 4 Science (Laboratory)* •» Elective Subjects — rher subjects taught in an approved manner in an accredited secondary school 12 Total 30 It is recommended that Greek and Roman History be offered in meeting the European History require - ment. ■History: For entrance to the College of Arts and Science* at least two years of Latin are recommended. Two years (four points) are required of students enter - ing the six-year combined academic-medical course 2 Language Eistory (European) 1 2 inguage (Foreign)- 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p241">208 For entrance to the College of Agriculture a third year (two points) in Mathematics may be offered Id place of the third year in foreign language. For entrance to the College of Engineering 6 points in Mathematics are required. To meet this require - ment a third year in Mathematics may be substi- tuted for the third year in foreign language. ♦ Science: It is recommended that Physics be offered in meeting the science requirement. An entrance credit or "point" is given for the work of a class holding five recitations a week, of 40 to 50 minutes each, for at least eighteen weeks. In laboratory courses a credit "point" is given for three recitations and two double periods of laboratory work, under the supervision of an instructor, each week for at least eighteen weeks. In laboratory courses without recitations, the equiva - lent of fifteen single periods each week are required. AtlmisKicn to the Various Colleges EFor admission to the freshman class in the college of Arts -ciences, the College of Agriculture and the College of Engineer - the candidate must present 30 credit points from an accredited dary school of which he must be a graduate. rFor admission to the freshman class of the College of Law candidate must present one year of college work in addition to above 30 points. For admission to the freshman class of the six-year course in the College of Medicine the candidate must meet the regular require - ments of the College of Arts and Sciences with four of the six points of foreign language in Latin. For admission to the freshman class of the four-year course the candidate must present two years of academic work in addition to the 30 points. For admission to the freshman class of tne two-year and three - year courses of the School of Pharmacy the candidate must present the equivalent of a two-year high school course. For admission to the four-year course the candidate meets the regular entrance re- Birements to the College of Arts and Sciences and is registered in it college. For admission to the School of Fine Arts the candidate must meet the entrance requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. E Conditional admission is permitted to graduates of accredited &gt;ls on a minimum of 28 "points." Graduates having less than points" will be required to make up deficient "points" in at ac - ted school, for conditional admission.

            <seg id="p242">209 time element indicated with each subject is essential. Real equiva - lents for the attainments named are, however, in all cases accepted, actual proficiency being of more account than the precise method by which it is acquired. Points offered by graduates of accredited schools for admission to the University are determined from the point of view of the high school rather than from that of the University. The first or initial credit in any subject must amount to at least one point. In science work partly done in laboratories, two periods of laboratory time are equivalent to one period of recitation and preparation therefor. The maximum entrance credit in German or French is six points. El accredited schools are approved by the State Department of ion as first class schools under the provision of the law for gh school privileges. Some three-year accredited schools have four years of high school •work, but because of the number of teachers employed, the conii of the equipment, or the short time that they have been organized as high school, they have not yet reached the rank of four-year accredited There is some 'confusion regarding the term ■'approved" and "accredited." The University "accredits" three and four-year sec - ondary schools. Graduates of accredited schools with a minimum of 24 points are admitted without examination to the University of Ne - braska and other higher institutions of Nebraska and of most of the other states. Admission is conditional on 2 4 points, 30 points being required for full admission. The State Department of Education "approves" schools under the provisions of the free high school law, giving tiie district the right to receive non-resident students and to collect the tuition from the home district. Schools are approved for each of the four years of the high school course and are classified as first-class and second- Cie University of Nebraska will accept at full value the eredits dents entering an accredited school from an non-accredited an approved school of the second class, or a non-approved school, for all subjects in which the student has carried advanced work in the accredited school from which he graduates, as the satis - factory completion of the advanced work is deemed sufficient to validate the previous standing in the subject. The University will re - serve the right to examine students in all subjects not pursued in an accredited school, unless the local school authorities shall certify that examinations have been held in such subjects, the examination papers for which are retained on file for the information of inspectors.

            <seg id="p251">218 COURSE OF STUDY. Many have asked where in the high school course of study the normal training work should be given. The statute makes it nec - essary to give it in the eleventh and twelfth grades, unless a school desires to give it all in the twelfth grade. When given in the eleventh grade reading and grammar should be the first work to be substi - tuted for solid geometry or such other subject in the course of study as may be recommended by the local principal or superintendent. In the twelfth grade there should be a thorough review of geography and arithmetic. In case elementary agriculture is not in the regular course of study, it shall be required in the course for normal train - ing. If this subject is in the regular course of study, there is no legal mandate in which year of the high school it shall be given. We leave it entirely to the local principal or superintendent. The •tudy of American history for at least one semester in the eleventh or twelfth grade is a requirement for the normal training work. While the minimum requirement is nine weeks each for reading, arithmetic, grammar and geography, and one semester for American history, it is recommended that wherever possible at least one semester be given to each of the four subjects and two semesters to American history. Seventy-two periods of professional training are required, and must be given in the twelfth grade. It may not be necessary to form a special class in every subject required for the normal training work. For example, the normal training class may study American history with the regular class in that subject if the instruction meets the requirements as laid down tthe normal training course already cited. Neither is it necessary have one instructor do all of the normal training work. In fact, it would be better to assign each subject to the high school instructor who is best prepared to teach it. The work in professional training is to be given by the city superintendent of schools or by a member of the high school faculty recommended by him and approved by the state superintendent of public instruction. PTwo of the major review subjects may be carried in the eleventh and the other two in the twelfth year. However, to economize e teaching force, schools that desire to do so may combine the as follows: For the school year 1912-13 combine the juniors seniors and teach arithmetic and geography each for a period of nine weeks in the first semester. During the school year 1913-14, combine the juniors and seniors into one class and teach reading and grammar in the order given, each for a period of nine weeks. This plan makes it unnecessary for a school to carry more than two major review subjects in any one year and by the alternation makes it possi - ble for normal training students to complete the course within two years. In some schools it will be necessary to vary this program somewhat in order to give seniors an opportunity to complete the </seg>
            <seg id="p252">219 Rring the past school year. Under some conditions it will be poe - le for schools to do all the normal training work in the twelfth grade. Where some seniors did not take the regular work last year, it may be necessary to give all the reviews this year. The alter - nation plan is recommended for small high schools where the teach - ing force is limited. Pedagogy and Observation. — We recommend that the subject of pedagogy be carried a full semester of not less than eighteen weeks, five periods each week. The class in pedagogy will do the observa - tion work in each of the review subjects and in history while study - ing methods in these subjects. Under this arrangement the observa - tion work will be more effective, since the class will be more mature and will have a better understanding of general methods at the time the observation work is being done. Although pedagogy is placed in the second semester in the program, local conditions and the city superintendent should decide which semester is most practical.

ARITHMETIC As the teacher takes up this work let her bear in mind these things: First, a teacher can teach only that which she thoroughly understands, and as she is sending from her classroom those who shall without further study attempt to teach this subject, let her see to it that they have a clear view of every topic taken up. In the second place, keep constantly in mind as she prepares her work and as she presents it, that no matter what fine spun theories she may present, the method her pupils will use will be the methods she exemplifies before them. E&gt;y will teach as she teaches and not as their grade teacher did, for sn they were with their grade teacher they were not old enough to ice method. Let some such plan of a recitation as follows be con - en tly used. 1. Assigning next day's lesson, indicating difficult points, with suggestions as to how to prepare. 2. Reciting today's lesson, consisting of — a. Testing individual preparation in various ways. b. Correcting false and clearing up doubtful impressions. c. Drilling on essential points by whole class. The work of the class should be along two lines: Academic work which must constitute the major part, and Methods and Devices. The committee do not think it best to separate this work in detail, but yet the teacher must so plan her work. For convenience we shall here </seg>
            <seg id="p258">225 t forth what we think should be done in each, but do not recom - d that it be so done in the classroom. Academic Work In the academic work one recitation each week should be given strictly to Mental Arithmetic. Select some good text and furnish each child with one. Assign definite lessons and expect the same preparation as you do for written work. One of the reasons that mental arithmetic has fallen into disrepute is because we as teachers have made what little work we did offer desultory and fragmentary. In addition to this regular period use five or ten minutes of each recitation for easy oral problems, bearing directly upon the topic under consideration and introducing the topic for the next recitation. Since it will be impossible to cover all classes of work in the nine weeks given to the subject, we recommend that the following be 1. Rapid combination drills in integers, fractions and denomin ate numbers. 2. Problems dealing with ordinary business transactions such as small bills; involving fractional parts of one dollar; discounts and interest. 3. Measurements. 4. Ratio, with special reference to its application in solution of problems. ANALYSIS. — The present generation of pupils has had no train - ing along this line and to this phase of the work the teacher must give special emphasis. The state superintendent declares that the papers now coming to his office prove clearly that teachers them - selves have no real conception of mental arithmetic. They are forced to solve simple problems algebraically. This must not be counte - nanced in mental arithmatic. It would seem to us that it would be well to carry this work almost daily by assigning one or two problems just for analysis. Have many handed to the teacher in writing that she may see that each pupil has a clear form of analysis of the Kiinary problems that should be solved without the aid of pencil d paper. Kno text is at hand for this work, we recommend Dr. Brooks' Mental Arithmetic." published by Christopher Sower Co., lphia. Make a careful study of his preface and all sugges - teachers. In the written work we think the following topics should be covered first, then if time permits, others may be added: 1. Notation and numeration. Merely a rapid glance at the two methods of notation, the principles underlying each and the ad - vantages of the Arabic over the Roman. There should be some drill in numeration of Roman Notation. Do not allow the class to leave </seg>
            <seg id="p259">226 your hands until they habitually read the ordinary Arabic correctly. One-half of the teachers in the schools today do not know that the "and" should be used only in reading mixed numbers. k2. A short review of the fundamental operations. The emphasis e should be placed upon checking. Give problems that arise by use the technical terms applicable to these operations. More will be I of this topic under Methods and Devices. 3. The three special forms of Division — a. Fractions, Common and Decimal. b. Percentage and the most important of its applications. c. Ratio and Proportion. As suggested by the arrangement above, these subjects are really only different forms of division and should be treated as very closely related. They should be divested of the mystery that is usually thrown around them. Common sense methods should be used in teaching them. Percentage should be taught as a case in fractions. The subjects should be carried along together and thus prepare the would-be teacher to so present them to her classes. 4. Measurements. Review of common tables. b. Actual use of the ruler; yard stick; measures, both dry and liquid; and scales, wherever possible. c. Much work in areas and capacities— too much work can- not be offered here. Plastering, carpeting, and prob - lems requiring number of bushels, gallons, etc., are invariably stumbling blocks. 5. Square Root and its applications. Methods and Devices tit is meant that this work shall be done in connection with the ular class work. Of necessity some time must be given wholly his phase of the subject. 1. Teaching the fundamental operations Pupils should leave this class with a clear distinction between counting and adding. That is to say, they should be given enough work in rapid addition and subtraction to learn the value of knowing combinations as soon as they see the figure. No better way can be suggested than to drill upon combinations of two figures; then three, four and five. Such columns should be added at sight correctly. When they find the value of such practice, that they will use it in Eeir classes is unquestionable. Methods of presenting and drilling ion the multiplication "tables" should be given them. If not al - ftdy using the "Austrian method" of arrangement in division they should be taught it at the start and not be allowed to use any other method in the class. By this method we refer to the placing of the quotient above the dividend and any digit in the quotient exactly above the last digit of the dividend used or "brought down.'* The </seg>
            <seg id="p260">227 value of checking subtraction by addition, and multiplication and division by each other, should be firmly fixed. F2. Visiting the grades to see some of the strong teachers pre - t the most vital topics. This should be done under the direction the superintendent of the schools, that only best methods be observed. There should be one hour spent in each of the lower grades. After the visits there should be a conference in which the teacher, super - intendent, the class and their high school teachers may discuss the recitation observed. This means that these conferences must be after - hours' meetings, but we believe this will be gladly done by all con - cerned. E3. Each pupil in the class should have an opportunity to present ais classmates one or more topics. Assign this work several days advance that the pupil-teacher may make careful preparation for maiden effort. After his part of the work is done, the teacher class should discuss the pupil-teacher's work. 4. There should be a careful study of the problems something as follows: a. Reading the problem b. Solving by indicated processes only. c. Checking by approximate computation d. "Blocking out" the problem. e. Making of problems in each subject, for actual use in the recitations. It has been suggested that we amplify this last somewhat. We mean by reading the problem that the primal difficulty in problem work is that the child does not read it. He glances at it and proceeds to do something with pencil and thinks that he is solving the problem. For preparation have a great many problems read carefully and the recitation consist of merely telling how to solve; "b" is only the written form of "a." On other days assign many problems and require the work to be merely indicated. Do the mechanical work In the classroom. When a child has read a problem let him mentally estimate by use of approximate numbers about what his answer should be. Then as he goes through the process of computation he will have something to tell him he has made some fatal blunder in his work. By merely misplacing a decimal point he may have an answer ten times too large. Suppose it is one of those in percentage, as: A house costs $850.00. The yearly taxes are 18.00, the water $5.00, repairs $13.00. il rents for $8.00 per month. What percent does the owner realize on his investment? The child reasons thus: He receives $96.00, but pays out $36.00; this leaves him $60.00. Now, if his house had cost him $800.00 he would have exactly ~Vz per cent, but since it cost him more than $800.00 his investment will pay him a little less than 7% per cent. By blocking out the problem is meant only the sketching </seg>
            <seg id="p261">228 the use of the graph. We know of nothing that will help a pupil so much as to actually make his own type problems. We are satis - fied that a mere trial of this will establish its use. FWe suggest that every teacher to whom is assigned this very at responsibility secure three or four of the latest texts and carefully over the prefaces, suggestions to teachers, and read the manuals which accompany all good texts. As a help to the teacher we suggest the following as being good modern texts: Walsh's, Smith's, Durell and Robins', Ferrel's, Young and Jackson's, Wer - ners' (Hall's) and McNeill's Mental Arithmetic. We recommend also that she read three or four good books bearing directly upon this subject such a "Methods in Written Arithmetic," Cook; "Teaching of Elementary Mathematics," Smith; "Psychology of Numbers," Dewey and McClellan.

We give these reports on account of their inestimatable value. There has been a great - ■niand for these reports than for any publication ever issued by department. Every teacher and prospective teacher into whose s these reports fall should not fail to master them. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON ENGLISH FOR THE GRADES. The following resolutions were adopted by the committee: 1 . To report on the work of the first eight grades only ETo report upon the principles upon which a high school course be based, leaving the working out of the plan to a future com- 3. To make no attempt to outline all phases of English but to emphasize certain important ones, leaving others to be taken up The purpose of the work in English should be ( 1 ) to : - freedom of expression, (2) to secure correctness of expression, (3 1 to enlarge the vocabulary, (4) to teach pupils to connect both oral and written expression with thought, and ( 5 ) to correlate literature with technical English as a medium for culture. Etiese five purposes involve many things, each of whirh Df the utmost importance. With the first, however, the primary r is most concerned. It is easy to say, 'encourage the child to express himself," but to do this in the best sense in an altogether different matter. To obtain freedom of expression there must firrt be created a desire for expression, and herein lies the teacher's para - mount responsibility. To select those topics of conversation which come within the understanding and environment of the pupil quires much tact. Elvery lesson in the curriculum is, in a certain sense, a language , and as such should be borne in mind by the teacher. Care be taken not to interfere with the thought or make thought aible by untimely correction or criticism. Those points which correction should be made note of and later should be drilled mtil the use of the correct form becomes a fixed habit. The exercises in the elements of literature should be both etructive and interpretative, and as far as possible constructive, or synthetic, work upon each should precede the analytic, or interpre - tative. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">236 I II Your committee beg leave to submit the following outline: First Grade. Technical English. Drill in Forms, based ( 1 ) on common mistakes and (2) on less familiar forms that need to be known for correct ex - pression. r Capitals. — Beginning ( 1 ) sentences and (2) proper names; (3) the pronoun "I." r. Punctuation. — (1) Period, (2) interrogation point, and (3) other marks, as needed, given incidentally. r Nouns. — (1) Possessive forms and (2) singular and plural forms of such nouns as children need to use. r Pronouns — Use (1) of personal pronouns and (2) of nom - inative case after forms of the verb "to be." r. Verbs. — (1) Simple tense forms, (2) compound tense forms which children need to use, and (3) correction of errors in agreement of verb with its subject in number. P. Use of "a" and "an.' Constructive English. A. Description. — The simplest description is merely a process of identification and tells (1) who or what it is, (2) where it is, and (3) what it is doing, if animate. The higher form of description is a process of visualization and can be introduced gradually as the developement and condition of the pupils warrant. Have descriptions (1) of a pupil acting before the class, (2) of two pupils acting before the class, (3) of pictures, (4) of seeds, leaves, animals, weather, etc. B. Narration. — (1) Of a simple action which has been per - formed before the class, (2) of experiences suggested by emotional words or phrases, and ( 3 ) of incidents which will be of interest to the class. In (2) have pupils tell as nearly as possible, (a) when it was, (b) where it was, (c) what he was doing, and (d) why he remembers it. r Reproduction. — Selections read to the children to have the thought reproduced. Allow no attempt at reproduction of the writer's language. D. Hints. — (Effects) — (1 ) — Have pupils give and interpret hints. (2) Have pupils give hints for teacher or class to interpret. (This is important, for here the pupil may be taught to give sufficient effect for the cause he wants assigned. He must be held to give only logical conclusions, also to be charitable in his interpretations. Much of this work will be in the nature of character effects.) </seg>
            <seg id="p270">237 I Interpretative English. \. Hints. — (Effects) — ( 1 ) Make pupils familiar with hints by giv - ing a great many for interpretation. (2) Have pupils select hints and give the interpretation. These may be taken from reading lessons, stories and incidents. Very little material can be found in the reading books of this grade, but some can be obtained by careful selection and modification. ( 3 i Have pupils select hints for teacher or class to interpret. See note under D. 2 above. B. Emotional words and phrases. — (1) Selection of emotional words and phrases from lessons, poems and songs. Material may be found in the poems of such writers of child verse as Lucy Larcom and R. L. Stevenson, and in the short poems now published in all the better grade of the first readers. Suggestions. — (1) Language work of the firBt grade should be entirely oral during the first half of the year. A little written work may be given near the close of the second half. ( I ) When a technical term in needed, give the cor - rect one. Use no terms, however, until needed. They mean nothing to pupils if forced. (|)Um the word tence" from the beginning, when sentence is meant, the incorrect use of the word "story." (4) See that the pupils of all grades observe the laws of selection, complete - ness, method, symmetry, and unity, so far as applicable to their age and development. (6) The technical work of the first five grades is based upon the idioms of language, and requires the incidental presentation of many facts of form and construction. This is incidental to the pupil only, and requires careful, thoughtful planning and presentation by the teacher. It must be by no means accidental. Second Grade Technical English r Capitals. — (1) Review work given for First Grade and (2) teach the use of capitals in titles and poetry. F Punctuation. — (1) Review punctuation marks given in fir3t grade. (2) Quotation marks, (3) the apostrophe to denote possession, and (4) the comma in such sentences as children use. r Nouns. — (1) Possessive forms, both singular and plural. (2) Plural number formed regularly by adding "s" or "es" and such irregular plurals as children need to use. (3) Study spelling of such words. r Pronouns — Work as laid out for the First Grade reviewed and extended. E. Verbs. — ( 1 ) Review and extend work laid out for first grade. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">238 F. II I in number. ( 3 ) Teach the correct use as to meaning of such verbs as teach and learn, get and have, lie and lay, sit and set, etc. Adjectives. — (1) The correct use of such descriptive ad - jectives as the children use. (2) Comparative forms where needed. G. Sentence. — Teaching also subject and predicate. Constructive English. r Description. — (1) Review and extend each point suggested for First Grade. ( 2 ) Visualization of person. r Narration. — Review and extend each point suggested for First Grade. F Reproduction. — See that the pupil has the thought first, then expresses it in clear, concise language of his own.

Parts of "Hiawatha's Childhood," "Seven Times One," and similar poems can be used. Abundant ma - terial is to be found in all the late second readers. Suggestions. — Most of the composition work for this grade should be oral. That which is written should be carefully planned and watched by the teacher. See that the first written work is correctly done. Avoid the formation of bad habits by obtaining careful, thoughtful, and correct ex - pression at the beginning. Third Grade.

            <seg id="p277">244 REPORT OF COMM1TTKK OX ENGLISH FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. The course here given is a continuation of the outline prepared for the grades last year, and it embodies the same fundamental pur - poses. All work in English should secure freedom and accuracy of expression and an appreciation of'tbe ennobling things in literature. The most careful guidance is needed along each line mentioned. The teacher should strive for freedom in writing. Do not limit or cripple the student by prescribing a theme of a particular length. The committee is of the opinion that the pupils should be asked, or at least advised, to buy their literature books. EThe committee would recommend that a minimum of four hours week the first year, and three hours per week the three following s, be given to the subject of English in the high schools. Your committee begs leave to submit the following report: Ninth Grade I. Technical English. 1. Grammar study. A review of principles and inflections adapted to the needs of the class. Grammar for use rather than discipline is intended. E. Capitalization. Punctuation. . Abbreviations. 5. Forms of composition. a. Heading. b. Margin. c. Indentation of paragraphs. d. Folding and indorsement. 6. Marks for correction of essays. 7. Review of ordinary letter forms. 8. Etymology as occasion arises. 9. Orthography and orthoepy incidentally 10. Tense formation. 11. Constructive English. 1. Extend the work as outlined in the preceding grades. 2. Descriptive. A study of individual and class visualization. Suggested Kxerclses. — As an example of individual vis - ualization, ask the student to visualize some friend or promi - nent character in town; as an example of class visualization, he may describe briefly, by the use of class characteristics. a policeman, and a doctor. Many exercises of a similar nature will suggest themselves to the teacher. L Individual and class characterization. Visualization of places continued. Visualization of interiors. </seg>
            <seg id="p278">245 SiiKgeHted Kxeroises. — In connection with this topic the student may be asked to write several themes in which the visualization of the room will suggest the character of the occupant. These exercises should not be given until the student has written effective descriptions of several rooms. 6. Mood study continued and extended. SuKKestions. — As occasion arises, the work in ted. English should be done in connection with the constructive work. In all written work, consider natural and easy expression of chief importance. It is also advised that every written exerc'se be care - fully corrected by the teacher, and then returned to th» pupil. Interpretative English. Continue the study of poetic and emotional w:&gt;rds. Explain the various classes and have the student bring examples of each class. Then begin "Evangeline." emphasizing the of words. Pee Dr. Sherman's "Elements of Literature," and "The North-Western Journal of Edut -ation," for Sept. and October, 1896. 2. Continue the study of "effects" of k'nd and degree 3. Study of types. 4. I'rose. poetic, and emotional phrases \ study of th. rowed elements in figures and figurative phrases. Sii|4R» slions. — Have the student bring eximples. such a3 "sighing treetops," anj ask h'm to « xplain the derivation and force of the borrowed element in each example . Apply this work to the selections studied durng the year. 5. A more extended study of the elements. SuKRestic.fis. — Selected poems from Tennyson, such as "The Lotus Eaters," "The Passing of Arthur." and Galahad" may be used very effectively in the study of ures, phrases, and words. [The following points should be carefully studied in con tion with all books assigned: (a) The author's meaning; (b) the central thought or purpose; (ct is the interest of the book mainly in the characters or in the incidents? "Marmion." "The Cricket on the Hearth," "Sohrab and Rustrum," and "The Lady of the Lake" may be studied in the same manner as the work already outlined, but none of these selections furnish sufficient material for the tH of characterization: "Captains Courageous" might be use&lt;l for the study of effects in this grade. 7 Selections for reading at home. </seg>

Tenth Grade Technical English In this grade attention should be given, as the needs of the pupils demand, to the points mentioned in the Ninth Grade. While instruction in technical matters should now be incidental, it should by no means be neglected. A list of common errors in English is here given for the use of both teacher and pupil in the revision of exercises. t Misplaced modifiers. Lack of concord. a. Subject and verb. b. Adjective and noun. c. Pronoun and antecedent d. Subject and complement. Le. Principal and subordinate verb. Mistakes of case. 4. Mistakes of mood. t Misuse of shall and will. Adjective or adverb. {Conjunctions and prepositions Reference of pronouns. 9. Unrelated participles. </seg>

Suggested Exercises. — Ask the student to introduce two or more characters into his theme, and make the reader understand the character of each by means of the conver - sation. 2. Conversation that shows mood. t Visualization and characterization of a crowd. Associational themes. Suggested Exercises. — Describe a place in such a man - ner that a stranger would wish to see it. Describe a place or a room in such a manner that the associational feelings are sad. Many exercises of a similar nature may be as - signed. 5. Character through mood. t Write character sketches, selecting as subjects the various ararters found in "Elaine." During this and the following year the fundamental principles of good composition should be systematically presented. The main stress should be laid upon numerous short themes and occasional longer ones. Paragraph themes in descriptions of persons, places, and objects within the experience or ob - servation of the pupil may be continued. Point of view, selection and arrangement of details, vividness and accuracy should receive attention. Interpretative English. "Tales of a Traveler," "The Vision of Sir Launfal.' Twice Told Tales," and "Elaine," and other Idylls consti tute representative selections for study in this grade. These books or their equivalents may be used. Study "Elaine," emphasizing the work on effects. See articles in "North- Western Journal" for 1897. Written preparation on the part of the student should be required. Excellent results may be obtained by reading "Elaine" and several of the other Idylls, omitting as deemed advis - able, the firs,t selections mentioned. Examples of the mode of association may be found in "The Tales of a Traveler." This book will furnish also some material for the study of the story. The mode of mystery may receive attention here. The author's meaning, the central thought or purpose, and the selection and order of details, should be studied in </seg>

Eleventh Grade 1. Technical English. The directions for work in the Tenth Grade should here be followed. Attention should also be given to polite corre - spondence and to forms for official and other business. II. Constructive English. 1. Subordination. Suggested Exercises. — Write themes introducing conver - sation between two people, and make prominent the mode of subordination. Many kinds of exercises under this topic may be as - signed. 2. Interpretative writing. Suggested Kxercises. — Write short themes in which such prose statements as "It is winter" are expressed in the feel - ing way. 3. Negative characterization. Suggestion. — The student should 'introduce first char - acter hints which give the reader a mistaken impression. Hints which establish the true character should then follow. 4.

            <seg id="p282">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS 249 Ill I II Suggestion. — Narrative, descriptive, themes, plot, char - acter and mood. One element should be considered at a time and many short exercises be prepared and discussed. A theme of some length may be undertaken near the close of the year. These themes should be carefully criticised and revised in the light of all previous work. The note books in the study of literature should be re - garded as part of the composition work, and time should be allowed for their careful preparation. Interpretative English. The following selections contain material suitable for the Eleventh Grade: Browning, Selected Poems: Maclaren. "Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush;" Chaplin, "Eli," 'The Vil - lage Convict." If time permits, one of Tennyson's Idylls, or its equivalent, may be read. It is suggested that the selections be studied in the order mentioned above. The stories of "Eli" and "The Village Convict" will fur nish excellent material for study -of visualization, char - acter and mood. They may also form a basis for study of story construction. It is assumed that topics suggested before will be here kept in mind, and adapted to the partcular selection of prose or verse in hand. The setting, the structure, the elements used, the plot, and the central thought will sug - gest topics in addition to those already mentioned. Selections for home reading. Goldsmith: The Vicar of Wakefield. Dickens: David Copperfield, and Oliver Twist. Thackeray: Vanity Fair. Mulock: John Halifax. Scott: Heart of Midlothian, Old Mortality Howells: The Rise of Silas Lapham. Wilkins: A New England Nun. Barlow: Irish Idylls. Stevenson: Master of Ballantrae. Barrie: A Window in Thrums. Twelfth Grade Technical English. Intensive work in grammar. Six or eight weeks should be given to this. Constructive English. [Exposition. Occasional themes should be written outside of class. Personal consultation and class criticism should con - stitute important features not only of this particular topic but also of all work in English. 2. Argument. Nature and purpose. Kinds. Order.

            <seg id="p283">STATE SUPERINENDEXT'S REPORT 250 4. The constructive work of the Eleventh Grade should be con tinued. HI. Interpretative English. The minor poems of Milton, "Paradise Lost," I and II, "Silas Marner," and "Macbeth," or their equivalents are recommended as suitable books for the work in this grade. The Play of "Macbeth" should be studied with Dr. Sher - man's analytic questions. A note-book should be used by the student, and written work handed in at each recitation. "Silas Marner" will furnish material for the study of the novel. If time permit, the minor poems of Milton, and "Paradise Lost" I and II, may be taken up for additional study. The committee thinks it best that all the interpretative work of the Twelfth Grade should be given consecutively in the first semester; and that the technical and constructive English should occupy the second semester. Suggestion. — Those high schools that do not continue the work beyond the Eleventh Grade may omit some of the selections mentioned in the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Grades, and select for the 'ast year's work Macbeth or other desired topics from the wark as outlined for the Twelfth Grade.

            <seg id="p284">251 GEOGRAPHY Aim 1. The Normal course should be made a review of grade and high school geography, emphasizing method of teaching the subject. KThe instruction should be of feted by persons who are trained raphy teaching. EThe teaching should be made concrete rather than abstract, experimental and observational work should be employed out geography facts and types. 4. Of the nine weeks, two weeks should be devoted to general principles of geography; two weeks to a comparative study of con - tinents; two weeks to the United States; and three weeks to Nebraska, including exercises in home geography. Outline of Course I. General discussions to show what geography is; its place in the schools; and how it is related to other subjects. (Time 3 weeks.) 1. The View Point — Definition of subject. Why classed as one of the five essentials? What are geography facts? What are the purposes of geography instruction? How is the subject related to nature study? To Agriculture? Botany? Zoology? Reading? Explain the definition, "Geography is the study of the earth as the home of man and of life in general." How does the earth influence mar.? "What is meant by the terms "relation," "control," "type?" Give ex - amples to illustrate each. L2. Parts of the Earth or the Spheres of Influence — Study each here in general, giving its position, form, mass, extent, physical and chemical character. Compare the atmosphere and the water sphere (Hydrosphere) in motion, compressibility, elasticity, resistance to motion, etc. Can you see, weigh, and hear each? How are the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere related? To what sphere L living things belong? In what sphere are most plants and ani - s found and why? 3. Geographic Influences — Define. How are animals related to air, to water and to the ground? As shown by its structure, to what spheres is a duck adapted? A fish? In what way does the atmos - phere influence (1) crops, (2) animals and (3) man? Note some of the effects of sunshine, temperature, wind and rainfall. Why do we study these weather and climate elements in geography? What relations exist between mineral industries and the rock formations? Between topography and travel? Drainage and disease? Soil and agriculture? Harbors and cities? Make an outline to show th«? principal geographic influences. Which of these affect people most? 4. Departments of Geography — Compare; give relations of each to the other. A. Physical — Define, facts of </seg>

Relation to nature study. Why important? What does it include? How taught.' Enumerate the home geography relations. B. The Primary Text — When introduced? Relations to home geography. Foreign relations in geography. How use the text. C. The advanced text. When introduced? Why follow Primary text? Do we spend too much time on the primary or advanced texts? Why cover about the same ground in each? In what respects do the texts differ? How use text? D. Regional Geography — Define. Purpose. How like home geography? Why follow advanced text? B6. Study of Geography Texts. — Compare the Frye, Dodge, iral and the Tarr and McMurry series, noting in each the Mas - ons, maps, exercises, questions, style, plan, continuity of plan, ence of subjects and the fitness of each book in its series for the es for which it was written. Which series emphasizes physical features most? The Industrial? Which is the best adapted to coun - try schools? To town and city schools? Which is written most from the view point of children? Of the geographer? Which is easiest taught? Which gives the best notion of geography as a whole? F7. Illustrative Materials and Methods of Instruction. Give a ' periods to the use of specimens with which to illustrate the forms industries; the handling of globes; making and interpretation maps, and to field excursion. II. Comparative Study of Continents. (Time two weeks.) Study and compare continents as to position, form, area, coast line, mean annual temperature, heat belts, wind systems, rainfall, relief, drainage and topography, vegetation, native animals, people, political divisions, governments, resources, products, industries, com - mercial centers, methods of transportation and trade routes. III. Geography of the United States. (Time, two weeks.) Use Russell, Dodge, Powell, Frye, and Tarr and McMurry as references. Follow outline in Complete Geography by Tarr &amp; M- Murry or in Dodge's Advanced Geography, See library references. Do laboratory work with weather and topographic maps, climatic charts, wall maps, etc. IV. Geography of Nebraska and Home Geography.

            <seg id="p290">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS 255 UNITED STATES HISTOItY Aim and Scope I. The object to be kept in mind should be to prepare young people to teach United States History in the rural schools. Those who can teach history well in the rural schools can teach it in any grade in the town school. But the reverse is not true. The course should be for those mature enough to teach, others will not get the best results from it. The course should be given in the senior year, and be built upon previous history work done in the high schools and grades. B. What the teacher of United States History in the rural i should know before attempting to teach the subject: A. He should know the aim or purpose of the subject — the purpose of the subject as a science, and the reason for its being in the course of school instruction. Unless he has definite ideas on this, his work is liable to be aimless, scat - tered, and result in no definite accomplishment. 1. He should know the definition of history and under - stand it thoroughly — so thoroughly that he can continually test his work by it, and point out its application as the study proceeds. 2. He should know, too, that in our country, where the welfare, stability, and efficiency of the government rests primarily on the intelligence of the citizens, the most im - portant part of this intelligence is derived from the study of history. B. He should have a good grasp of the facts of the portion of the history he expects to teach. This means the whole of American history, including the biographies of the prominent characters. 1. Unless he has this knowledge before beginning to teach — a. He will be overwhelmed with the daily prep - aration of lessons. b. He will go wrong continually in guiding the student, because he has not himself a clear view of the goal to attain. 2. This does not mean that he should know all the minutiae of that history, but the broad lines of develop - ment, the important features, the prominent characters and events, and should he able to trace the develop - ment of our principal institutions, movements, and activities. He should be able to give briefly a comprehensive outline of the whole subject. C. The teacher of history should be a student of history and as a student he should know how to proceed — </seg>
            <seg id="p291">256 1. To find materials — the sources for his study 2. To collect and sift facts, and estimate their rel- ative worth. 3. To group them into logical form. 4. And to present bis accumulated facts in what seems to him a truthful account of the subject considered. based on the evidence at his command. 5. He should know something of the value of the works he has at his command, or has access to. He should become acquainted with at least a few of the better authors, know the difference between the original sources and the secondary writers, and the peculiar value of each. D. The teacher of history should have some knowledge of the relative importance of the various portions of history as found in the text or outline, so that he may wisely select, if for some reason his class should not be able to complete the book or outline, or course prescribed. E. The teacher of history should have some knowledge of the work that may be, and ought to be, done in the various grades. He needs this knowledge, not only in planning the details of regular course work, but in order to arrange har - moniously the lower grade reading, supplementary work, etc., so as to produce the best results when the regular study of history is taken up later. F. The would-be teacher of history should have some definite ideas of assigning lessons, directing pupils in the preparation of their lessons, and hearing recitations. G. He should know that he will probably not find things ideal in the school which he engages to teach, but that he must fit his plans to the pupils and equipment until he can induce or produce changes foi the better. While this is a general caution, it should be made especially in the history department, where so commonly conditions are far from what they ought to be. III. What the teacher of history should feel — A. The subject of history is the most important of all, so far as making intelligent citizens of a free democratic government is concerned. B. He must have a real desire to teach the subject well if he is to accomplish results. C. The lessons from the study of history are numerous and valuable, but it rests largely with the teacher to mate these apparent. IY. What the course should include — </seg>
            <seg id="p292">257 B 1. The definition — not a formal definition, but a con - crete realization of its meaning. Emphasis to be placed on the evolutionary nature of history, its unity, and the relation of events to each other; interpretation of events and movements should be especially emphasized in this normal course. 2. An amplification of the definition and purpose of the subject in the classroom work. A careful study of the main features of American his- 1. This should nut be a mere review- or a substitute for the regular course, but a new course so planned for each school that the student will receive a distinct ad - dition to his knowledge of the history of the United States. 2. So much here depends on the teacher, the pupil, and the previous work accomplished that a definite, specified course might result in disappointment so far aa results are concerned; however, your committee ventures the following recommendations. a. The subject should be taught by outline, rather than by following a single text-book; other methods are approved, as the "multiple text" plan; also the use of the single text with assigned readings from the sources and more advanced narrative works. All the recognized approved methods may be used, and ought to be explained. b. "The Outline of American History by the New England Historical Teachers' Association," should be taken as a standard, but not slavishly followed. c. The use of texts faulty either in fact or method of procedure should be avoided. d. Since the whole of American history cannot be covered in one semester's work, only the most im - portant points should be considered previous to 1763: (1) A very brief study of old world conditions that led to the movement may be made; (2) territorial claims by the various European nations should be noted — extension and extinction followed in general outline; (3) colonial development previous to 1750 should be confined mainly to , Massachusetts, Vir - ginia and Pennsylvania — and here only the prin - cipal institutional features should be noted; (4) the French-English rivalry, 1600-1750, and its culmi - nation in the French and Indian war should be </seg>
            <seg id="p293">258 1763 all purely military operations of the wars should be omitted, and such other topics as the particular conditions of the case may require. e. A short (review of the Constitution of the United States should precede the study of the con- stitutional period. f. The other topics of Civil Government should be reviewed as they occur in connection with the history The reference books used should be of the sort that may be used in the rural schools, rather than the larger works. C. At least one paper should be prepared, showing the results of the intensive study of a short period or institution involving all the steps from the finding of the material to the completion of the narrative. D. Chronological tables should be prepared by the stu dent to Indicate the steps of the development of all im portant institutions, etc. E. Sketches of a few of the best authors should be given to show who they are, or were, position occupied, methods of work, so that the student-teacher has a familiar feeling with the works of an author, and can take an interest in his work that comes only with such familiarity. P. The work that may be done in the lower grades may be taught by referring to the course of study in the home school and the State Course of Study. This work should bo outlined for each grade. G. Instruction and practice should be given in laying off the work, assigning the lessons, giving direction for their preparation, and even hearing recitations. In connection with this part of the work, visits could be paid to the lower grades and where possible to some rural schools. H. Short readings from some good elementary work on the teaching of history should be made, not so much for the information gained from the book as for Inspiration, and for teaching them that theire are such works. MicMiurry, Kemp, Hinsdale, Macy, Bourne and the Report of the Com - mittee of Seven are good. EV. The teacher of United States History should know more he expects to teach. He should not only have a good under - ding of American history, but also some knowledge of European history, especially that of England from 1500 on. The more he knows of European history, the better he will understand and teach American history. Throughout this course the instructor should constantly keep in mind the preparation of teachers, and the student </seg>
            <seg id="p294">259 Etions. An able teacher with an earnest desire to instruct, a.id a igent student with an earnest desire to learn, cannot help but ke a change in the teaching of history in th e rural school. Outline The American History department of the University has, at the request of the state superintendent, attempted a suggestive outline of a Normal Course in American History. Being intended as supple - mentary to and interpretative of the regular high school course, and not a substitute for it, the outline aims mainly at the bringing out of only the most important and significant items of the various periods covered, trusting to previous study and the daily preparation of the teacher for details and background. The department expresses its willingness to aid teachers of the state in adapting this outline to the e; needs and conditions of the different schools, and to make o inquirers, either in person or by letter, any portions of the course that do not make themselves understood.

After conference with eome of the best school men, we are con - vinced that but few high schools in Nebraska are at present properly equipped to tarry the two semester course in agriculture. For such as can carry the two semester course, the full course as outlined by the committee is recommended. For high schools whose equipment will not justify them in attempting the two semester course, a one semester course adapted by the Department of Public Instruction from the two semester course is here given. The outline of this course is the same as that for the two semester course given above, except as herein noted. Class Work Laboratory Work Number of Number of enipsti ter. Period ds Doub )le Perio I.

These four items are probably already at hand and it is not likely they will have to be supplied specially for this work.

Two dozen flower pots, at $0.75 — $1.50 (tin fruit cans may be used instead of flower pots in the experiment successfully). Three thermometers, graduated to 100 degrees C, at $1.00 — $3.00. oil auger, 1V4 with forty-two inch shank, about $2.00. Five rass or galvanized iron tubes, two inches in diameter, ten inches all with perforated bottom one inch from end of tube. The brass ubes would cost about $1.00 to $1.50 each. The galvanized iron ubes can be made at the local hardware for about 40 cents. Five brass or galvanized iron tubes, fifteen inches tan, a per - orated bottom one and one-half inch from the end of a tube, a olid bottom at end, an opening just above solid bottom fitted with one-fourth inch delivery tube; at the top, at right angles with delivery tube and one inch from top end, two one-fourth nch delivery tubes placed opposite one another to allow water o flow across top of soil. E would recommend the galvanized iron tubes for this purpose, would cost about $0.75 each. For work in the High Schools I these tubes can be dispensed with and the experiment performed with simpler apparatus which is cheaper and illustrates the prin - ciple just as well as the use of these tubes. In my own laboratory I am using student lamp chimneys for this purpose. These chimneys cost me $0.90 per dozen in Lincoln. The manner of using this sort of apparatus for the experiments is well illustrated in the exercises on soils given in Bulletin 186 of the Office of Experiment Stations. Exercise 31 on page 46 of that bulletin. Ee glass tubing which is the next item mentioned can be dis - with if the lamp chimneys are used for the experiment per - by the two previous pieces of apparatus. The frames to hold the lamp chimneys or glass tubes can be made by any local carpenter or handy student and probably cost $0.75. Eie next item on the list, 5 galvanized iron cylinders twenty - 5ht inches high and four inches in diameter, would prob - ly cost about $1.50 each. I would recommend in their stead. tlvanized pails which can be bought of the local hardware d will answer the purpose just as well. One porcelain crucible for igniting soils. I would recommend instead of a porcelain crucible a so called spun iron crucible which would cost about $0.25. One dozen beakers about $3.00. </seg>

One solution balance, twenty kilo, at $20.00. The soil, sand, gravel, loam, clay, etc., can usually be gathered from land near the school. The chemicals can be bought in the quantities necessary for laboratory use at the local drug store and any bright, active boy can obtain a supply of the compost or well rotted manure. Slaked lime can be obtained from the local building Kterial dealer. The sawdust and straw can be obtained without iculty. E Although I was not a member of the committee that drafted thta le of study, I did prepare the course in soils at Dr. I.yon's request. since preparing the outline I have given considerable thought to methods of teaching soils in the High schools. I am convinced the simpler the apparatus and the more evident the demonstration, ;reater the interest in the subject and the more thorough the re - obtained. . All the exercises given may be performed with apparatus and material which can commonly be obtained from local sources, instance take the experiment entitled "Power of loose soils to retain •water." The experiment could be performed with a considerable irree of accuracy by placing a given quantity (volume) of loose soil in a student lamp chimney or glass tube having a cloth strip over the lower end. A measured quantity of water is added until percolation commences at the lower end. The water which drains off is collected and measured. The difference between the amount of water added and the amount drained off represents the amount of water which the soil is capable of retaining. This illustrates in one specific case what can be done in these exercises by the use of simple apparatus and My suggestion would be that they be used instead of obtaining the more costly, if somewhat more accurate, apparatus. rilOFKHSIONAL TRAlMMi. General Suggestions. P Owing to the age and preparation of the students, the purpose le instruction, and the limited amount of time to be devoted to study, it was thought best to confine the work to a few lines in which the teaching can be made most concrete and practical. For these reasons it is advised that no attempt be made to teach technical pedagogy, psychology, history of education; and other subject* ba - longing to the more comprehensive work of the normal school and uni- </seg>
            <seg id="p313">278 1. A course (30) lessons in the Theory and Practice of teaching including a brief outline of the fundamental principles of elementary education. 2. A course (30) lessons in method of instruction and dis- trict school organization and management. 3. At least twenty-six observation lessons under grade teachers and three to five practice lessons with high school classes in which the papil. teacher teaches all or part of the period of a class of which he is a regular member, or in lieu of the latter actual teaching in the grades under direct supervision. All observation and practice lessons should be carefully planned, reviewed and discussed. The teachers giving the lesson should meet subsequently with the observers in order to aid in the study of the aim and various facts of the lesson. The pedagogical instruction should be given in classes especially organised for that object, membership being restricted to those hav - ing serious purpose of fitting themselves for teaching in the grades and country schools. In order to give clearer direction to the work different members of the committee were asked to make brief sug - gestive outlines of different phases of the work; Dr. W. A. Clark outlining Course 1. on theory and principles; Professor W. R. Hart, Course 2, on methods and management; and Professor W. R. Jack - son the course on observation lessons. The outlines are intended only to be suggestive and must be enlarged and filled in by the teacher. Dr. Clark has outlined only the last half of Course 1. It should be preceded by the first 133 pages of White's, The Art of Teaetalng; or some other good book as Roark's Method in Education; Page's Theory and Practice of Teaching; Parker's Talks on Teaching; De- Garmo's Essentials of Method; Hinsdale's, The Art of Study; Mc- Krry's, The Method of the Recitation; Arnold's Waymarks for chers; Putman's Manual of Pedagogics, etc. PThe committee is of the opinion that the pedagogcial work in outlined should cover at least five recitations per week for half year, or preferably Course 1 two hours per week the first semester, followed by courses 2 and I at least three hours per week (three recitations) the second semester of the last year of the high school course. The process of teaching an individual how to teach is far more difficult than the ordinary process of instruction and requires scien - tiflic as well as experiential knowledge. To assign this work to a tyro means to invite failure from the beginning. Tne teachers of this subject should have had actual experience in the fields in which these pupil teachers are preparing to enter and should have supple - mented their experiential knowledge by scientific study of the sub - jects they are to teach. Anything short of this should be discour- </seg>
            <seg id="p314">279 It is not intended that this coarse of professional study should be accepted in any sense of permanency. It has seemed to the com - mittee the best for the present but it should be modified as time and conditions show need of change.

Review Points of Interest Not Fully Brought Out in the Previous lesson. The foregoing outline of work in Methods of Instruction and Management is based on Levi Seeley's New School Management and E. E. White's Art of Teaching. The subordinate points in the outline are .suggestive only. They are not intended to restrict the Teacher, nor is it intended that all sub-topics should be exhausted. The lesson titles, however, are considered sufficiently vital in their aim as to be deemed a fair working basis for those having charge Lthis work, to approach a desired uniformity in the amount and i of work given in different schools. The order in which the lessons are taken up is a matter for each teacher to settle. The following suggestion is offered: So far as possible a good arrangement would be to study the lesson in method in connection with the Common Branch which is being reviewed, or which the class has an opportunity of observing in the grades. The lessons in management should be grouped if possible. The lesson on the teacher should come late in the course. COURSE 3. Observation Lessons. The following outline is used in the discussion of each lesson taught. It is to be worked out in a series of preliminary discussions before any lesson is presented. As great stress is placed on the discussions as on the lesson itself, the lesson may take twenty min - utes and at first the discussion may take three periods of forty-five minutes. Without discussion, the lesson is of very litle value. L These lessons are merely suggestive and are not to be slavishly lowed. The teacher must have had special training and must have originality or the work will be a farce. These lessons are but twenty-five out of about 170 well corre - lated lessons that would be presented in a thorough normal school; hence it will be seen that there cannot be the unity or continuity that might be desired. </seg>

The following is suggested as oua of the lessons that might be given as one of the first lessons in reading, using "Action" as a basis: Eacher — I am going to tell Mary to do something, and I wonder can guess what I say. (Teacher whispers, "'You may run." I 3 you can tell the exact words I said to Mary? Child — You may run. Esacher — I will say to you, without saying it in words, exactly said to her. How do you think I will say it? Yes, I will t on the board. Teacher writes, "You may run." (Drill bv ring to other pupils and writing sentences.) E Teacher — I am going to tell someone else to do something. dspers to another child, (You may jump.") (The child performs action.) I will tell you on the board what I said to her. (Writes n may jump,") Present "You may fly" in the same way. Bill by writing different sentences and having the acts per - or sentences read, or child whispering to teacher to write any the three sentences which he may choose to have acted . Leaaon II. After the children have been in school a few weefcs, the follow ing lesson might be given: A drill of the old words might be given first: See, I, pretty. jump, can, run, like, apple, peach, plum. Teacher points to the object and the child finds the word. Teacher points to the word and the child finds the object, or if action word, performs the action. Mbjert-Matter Kitty-kitty-kitty.

            <seg id="p324">II JUNIOR NORMAL SCHOOLS The junior normal schools are tuinmer sessions of eight weeks each conducted by the State Department of Education in various I i.rts of the state. These schools are taken into these sections of the state somewhat remote from the state and private schools offer - ing courses of instruction during the summer vacation period, at whkli time many of our rural school teachers are compelled to pursue their education further, and in, many cases prepare themselves more fully for the examinations required for the issuance and re-issuance of county certificates. The average attendance at the junior normal schools during the nine years of their existance has been about 175 each. The stu - dents have been unsually earnest ind eager for knowledge. The junior normal school has brought to iiiany of them their first glimpse*, not only of the vast field of knowledge spread out before them, but of the broader cultural side of life r.s exemplified to them daily by the men and women selected as instructors in these schools. The new law providing for eight and twelve weeks' normal train - ing for second grade and first grade county certificates, respectively, makes it imperative that an opportunity be given rural teachers in the outlying districts to sec &lt;re this normal training at a minimum expense. In order that the free high school law may be effective and may serve the children of the state to the best advantage, it is necessary that the teachers in the rural schools shall be properly equipped to give their pupils adequate training in the elementary course of study. The junior normal schools provide a course of study especially adapted to the needs of teachers who desire to give first class work in the c ountry schools. School boards who pay reasonable salaries to teachers have a right to expect reasonable qualifications, and should urge teachers to attend some reputable summer scliool. The junior normals afford opportunity for rural teachers to acquire a fair knowledge of all sub - jects required to be taught by the staie course of study for elementary The junior normal schools aim especially to supply at minimum cost the maximum academic and professional training which can be given in a summer session of eight weeks under skilled instructors. Fvery teacher and every prospective teacher in the rural schools is invited to attend a junior normal school during the session of 1912. Every effort will be made .to make this term's work of lasting benefit to all in attendance. The members of the faculty will make it their highest aim to serve their students, and nothing will be left undone which will add to the efficiency of the schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">288 E Permit me here and now to ext?nd a welcome to every one who Us this year, and to pledge the co-operation of every member of faculty in making this year's session the greatest success possible the funds at our command.

Normal Training. A model school will be conducted in connection with each junior normal school so that students attending may qualify for normal training in accordance with sections 7 and 8. subdivision 9a, school lawB, and the rulings of the state superintendent under the law, as follows: (a) For a second grade county certificate, the student must complete the eight weeks' normal training course, which course must give one full period of forty-five minutes five times a week for eight weeks in school management and methodology, and one full period of forty-five minutes five times a week for eight weeks in observation, with the privilege of taking in addition thereto not to exceed three academic subjects for full periods.

In a number of cases superintendents of adjoining counties have also indicated such week as the institute week for their counties. A special program will be arranged for this week, and a number of interesting features added especially along the line of inspirational Brk. If possible, one number of this lecture course will be given ring institute week. Junior Normal Credit In determining the final junior normal credit for six weeks' attendance, the final examination grade shall be counted as one-third ; the class instructor's daily markings and occasional tests averaged, ■hall be counted as one-third; and the class instructor's judgment of the worthfulness of the student-teacher's endeavors and capacity to instruct shall be counted as one-third. Before a student is entitled to a junior normal credit in any sub - ject he must pass with an average of at least 70 per cent in these three points, and must be in attendance upon instruction in that subject for at least thirty days. No fee is charged for the junior normal school examination for junior normal credit. Examination for Count) Certificates. In order to accommodate teachers attending the junior normal schools, the state examining committee will give a special examination at the close of the junior normal term, July 25-26, in the county certificate branches. (The same questions will be used in the examina - tion for junior normal credit.) Teachers not residents of the county in which the junior normal is conducted may register for the examina - tion and receive a county number in the county in which the junior normal is situated, for which there shall be a charge of fifty cents, the regular fee for an examination number, which goes to the state examining board. This examination number shall convey no examina - tion rights outside of such county, nor certificate rights in any county. PUpon passing to his home county the teacher may take an examina - number. paying the full fee of $1.50 for such examination number, state- superintendent will then, upon the request of the county superintendent of such county, transfer the grade earned from the Kunty In which the junior normal was conducted to the county of the icher's residence. A teacher who has registered for the examination at the junior nor - mal, and who desires a certificate in the county in which the junior normal is conducted, shall pay to the county superintendent the fortifiraTtnn fAA nT nnp dollar </seg>
            <seg id="p328">291 This arrangement is made to save the teacher the added expense of going to the county seat in his home county to take the co.inty examination, after the close of the junior normal. Elementary State Certificate* A student who has been in attendance at a junior normal school four sessions of not less than six weeks each may be granted an ele - mentary state certificate upon the completion of the Teachers' Training Those who have attended junior normal schools heretofore, but have not had the full twenty-four weeks' attendance, must attend at tst six weeks this year in order to be entitled to the elementary state tificate.

            <seg id="p341">304 KKPORT OK im. I1KATTIK. Hon. Jas. E. Delzell, Superintendent of Public Instruction Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: — I hand you, herewith a report of the Junior Normal Schools as I found them during the visits beginning June 3 "and ending June 26." As the visitations were made at times when the work was at different stages of advancement no comparison of one with another would be just and because it could not be just, as well as for other considerations, no attempt is made to state the special merit of each. For example the schools at Broken Bow and Geneva were seen when the institutes were in session and during tbe first week while the others were seen at a later date and independent of the in - stitute.. The institute enrollment at Broken Bow was large and all the teachers seemed to appreciate the efforts of Supt. Grimes and the in - structors. Supt. Alice Jennett, at Geneva, had as special instructor during the institute week Prof. N. A. Bengston of the State I'niversity. i instruction was of the greatest value to the teachers of Fillmore ty and to the students in the Junior Normal School from that and surrounding counties. At Alma and McCook the work was in the id week and everything was doing well. LThe teachers in Harlan county who could not be in the institute first week were given the opportunity to attend the second week and k was provided for them. PAt North Platte Superintendent Tout reported a smaller institute last year and a gain in the Junior Normal School proper. On day I was there (June 17th) the roll showed a gain of seven i 7 over the enrollment of last year. This gain will, no doubt, be increase I before the close of the session. The one at Alliance when cons'dered independent of the institute has the largest enrollment of the eight, The day I was there the roll was 145. This will probably be increased and cause Alliance to have the largest enrollment for the session of 1H 1 1. UThe combined list of the institute and the Junior Normal School e largest this year, in the history of the school at Valentine. f'he number of students at O'Neill has gained constantly since the lg day of the session. While the schools at Valentine and O'Neill imewhat smaller than some of the others as good and as earnest is going on there as can be found anywhere. The following and conditions are most significant: 1. Each one of the eight has a well-pronounced individuality. 2. Earnest, honest, devoted and enthusiastic work by the prin - cipals, the teachers, the county superintendents, and the students is being done in all the schools. 3. The club boarding system which is a feature of the school at Alliance is of real value. While it could not be employed successfully </seg>
            <seg id="p342">305 at all the places — in one for one reason and in another for other reasons — it is a distinct advantage to the school at Alliance. 4. In appearance — whether in fact or not I do not know — the stu - dents at McCook seem to be younger than those at any of the other places. They do not appear to be less mature, or less advanced as indi - ■ ated by the schedule of classes and subjects but younger in appear - ance when taken as a body. 5. The smallest number and the least percentage cf young men are found in the school at O'Neill. There are only two young men. 6. The years as they go by justify the Junior Normal Schools and show the wisdom in starting this class of summer schools for teachers and students. Their support for something to come is justi - fied by four things: (1) By the marked influence they have exerted on the young people of that part of Nebraska which is naturally tribu - tary to them; (2) The added purpose and intelligence they have car - ried into the schools of the state because of the ideas gained, the ideals created, the ambitions aroused and the aspirations inspired by those who have taken advantage of the instruction and the inspira - tion furnished by these centers of influence; (3) The students who have gone from these summer schools to the regular normal schools, to the colleges and to the other institutions of higher education; and (4) The school sentiment, school spirit and school desire they have created in the eight centers where they are. Any one familiar with the conditions will testify to these four things and will say that they justify the use of all the money, both local and state,' and also, all the efforts which have been put forth in their behalf. The past has been rich in results and with such results, also, as indicate what ought to be done for several years to come. Of the students in the Junior Normal Schools now probably not more than one out of six, or perhaps only one out of seven would have gone from home the longer distances, necessary to be in school at other places. This is a most significant rt in the life of the 1100 or 1200 students who during the session 1912 have the instruction, discipline and guidance of these schools. Respectfully submitted July 1, 1912. J. A. BEATTIE AX KIGHTH GRADE IDEAL Outline of one of three addresses given by Dr. J. A. Ileattle before the eight junior normal schools, 1912. Six considerations serve to introduce the theme, to give meaning and importance to the several parts and to the ideal as a whole. 1. Every teacher feels the need of an ideal, a goal, a measure, that the work of teaching and its results may be definite, accurate and efficient. 2. It is the desire that each one shall raise the questions with </seg>
            <seg id="p343">306 rlow? la it worthy, or unworthy, as the foundation on which build the education given in the high school and in the college and university to which some will go? Is it a preparation, as far as it goes, for the every day affairs upon which many will enter as soon as the eighth grade is completed? 3. What ought an eighth grade pupil to be and be able to do when the work of this grade is complete? F4. Is the ideal here presented in harmony with the best that is *n of the educational foundations which ought to be laid during first eight years of school life and instruction? Is the ideal such in character, such in scope and such in purpose that it lays the foun - dations for a business education, for industrial growth and for pro - fessional life and development? 5. Is the ideal set forth in the following specifications in harmony with the nature and destiny of the immortal beings to be educated? If it is realized will the pupil, at thirteen or fourteen, have an informed mind, will he be established in principle, will he have a regulated heart, will he be worthy in character, and will he be inspired by the highest and holiest things? 6. If this ideal could be realized in every country school and by the work of the grades in every town and city would our days be happier, our homes better, our skies brighter, our society purer, our aspirations higher, our work more efficient, our worship more sincere, our devotion more constant and our business life and relations more completely under the control of the Golden Rule? With these things in mind and constantly raising the questions suggested let us study this eighth grade ideal. ( 1 ) Pe able to speak the English language. (2) Be able to write readily and legibly, easily and accurately. C(3) Be able to spell the words used in common life and daily ness. (4) Be able to read a book and a newspaper with distinct artic - ulation, clear enunciation and correct pronunciation. B) Be able to gain the meaning from the printed page with earness and understanding that it can be told to others. B) Be able to use all the arithmetical knowledge necessary for n life and ordinary affairs. E(7) Be able to employ free-hind drawing in illustration of ught, the charm and harmony of music in the cultivation of taste [ beauty. (8) Know enough geography to appreciate current events, pos - sess a general idea of the earth's surface, and understand the relation of geography to individual and national welfare. (•) Understand the leading facts, the heroic deeds, and the sincere devotion of the makers of American history so well that they </seg>
            <seg id="p344">JUNIOR NORMAL SCHOOLS 307 E;iO) Value the principles of our government well enough to an intelligent ballot, to appreciate men and measures and to righteously the acts and the representatives of the people. ■11) Be intelligent in the laws and conditions of health and be &gt; appreciate the advantages of I "sound mind in a sound body." (12) PoEsess definite preparation (as far as it goes) for a vocation, knowledge of the use and productiveness of machinery, understand the requirements of a useful life and be able to appreciate the conditions of industrial progress and material well being. (13) Be honest in purpose, worthy in conduct, genuine in char - acter, generous in heart, and trust woi thy in life. ■14) Have formed fixed habits of thrift, industry, politeness, ranee and truthfulness. (15) Be able to enjoy the beauties of Nature and the glory of the heavens; to appreciate the sacredness of human rights and the wealth of opportunity on every hand and be inspired by the almost divine in the literature of the English tongue. Is the foregoing ideal such an one as we ought constantly to cher - ittb? Is it worth while, for us as teachers, to make the preparation which this ideal implies on the part of those who are the guides and instructors of childhood and youth? "He built a house; time laid it in the dust; He wrote a book; its title now forgot; He ruled a city, but his name is not On any tablet graven, where rust Can gather from disuse, or marble bust." "He took a child from out a wretched cot, Who on the state dishonor might have brought And reared him to the Christian's hope and trust The boy, to manhood grown, became a light To many souls, and preached for human need The wondrous love of the Omnipotent." "The work has multiplied like stars at night When darknesB deepens; every noble deed Lasts longer than a granite monument." The Aim of the Foregoing Ideal All true education has for its aim the development of the indi - vidual, the enrichment of the community, the en-noblement of society, the welfare of the state, and the endowment of the race. As a result the individual possesses sight and insight; the community loves truth and virtue; society delights to honor worth and worthiness; the state rejoices in the perfection and righteousness of the people; and the race lives a higher and more useful life. K behalf of better teaching, fulls:- development larger opportuni - d more abundant life. </seg>
            <seg id="p345">THK HKTTKRMKXT OK RURAL SCHOOLS THItUKiH BOYS' AND GIRLS* (LIBS. The Nebraska Plan Jas. Deliell, State Superintendent of Public Instruction of Nebraska, before the National Educational Association, Chicago, July, 1912. Ehe idea of establishing boys' and girls' contest clubs was conceived ' former worthy state superintendent, E. C. Bishop, now superin - it of Agricultural Extension in Schools in the Iowa State College, Ames, while he was deputy under State Superintendent J. L. McBrien. This plan invested in the state department of public instruction the central power, county superintendents the co-operating generals, city town, and rural teachers the under officers, and the pupils the With this vast and well disciplined army of co-workers, the children of the entire state were united in a definite line of vocational work. Agriculture and domestic science were prominent themes. Corn con - tests, potato contests, cooking and sewing contests, school garden and home garden clubs were organized for the boys and girls. This work was further promoted by monthly bulletins sent out by the state de - partment of public instruction, and a card system record was kept in tbis office of the work done by the individual pupils. The work was so planned that the boys and girls entered into the scheme and ideas with really more zeal than into ordinary school It would seem at first that the "Nebraska" plan would detract from the regular school work. However, it was soon discovered that Superintendent Bishop had hit upon a practical plan which not only added to the financial side of the boys' and girls' lives, but also gave the boys and girls of the rural districts a "vision" of the real meaning of hie. It taught them that in becoming good farmers and good home Epers, there was more in life than drudgery, and that their school k prepared them to see that "vision" of life. When Superintendent Crabtree entered upon his duties as state superintendent, he followed in part the "Nebraska Plan", but he gave the State Agricultural School a wider range of control. When I took up the work of this department, I placed the entire management of the boys' and girls' clubs in the hands of the State Agricultural School. The work is now carried on th« same as formerly, with the exception that the clubs are in active touch with the State Agricultural School. This gives the boys and girls an incentive to become actively engaged </seg>

With this in view, the n the rural schools are more earnest in their work, our rural 3 are better prepared than before, our schools are more !ike aps, and the "completed products" are demonstrations of the Ke following report made by Assistant State Superintendent Anna , upon her return from visiting the Keith county rural schools, ffice to show some of the benefits of domestic science clubs in al schools: "The schools of Keith county are making a point of serving hot li.nches at noon to the children, instead of the unappetizing cold lunch or time-honored custom. The first school visited was district N about five miles from Ogalalla. Here Mrs. Rosengrant has five pupils in attendance. While they study their arithmetic lessons, she does the simple cooking necessary. On this parrcular day they knew that pany was coming and the menu was a little more elaborate than usual. — boiled loin of pork, macaroni, and potatoes baked in the asbqe. These, with the bread and butter, and the fruit provided by Mrs. Rich - mond (the county superintendent), furnished a meal good enough for anyone, and those who were fortunate enough to be present did it ample justice. Mrs. Rosengrant began th's work because she felt that some cf her pupils were not getting sufficient nourishing food at the noon meal, so teacher and pupils now talk over from day to day what tliey shall have, and each one furnishes that which is most convenient. So satisfactory have been the results of this plan that members of the board are considering furnishing the supples for these lunches theni- B&gt;s next year. Usually only one hot dish is provided. Some of th ■ hboring districts are taking up the work. It seems destined to be - i a permanent feature of the rural schcol program as well as for y city schools." These clubs will, within a decade, have so changed the ideals of farm lire In Nebraska that the boys and girls will hail with delight the time when the preparatory stage of school life is over and a nice farm and farm home is the reward for the preparation made under the"club" movement in Nebraska. We will then have better schools, more happy farm homes, and the ideal of farm life will be of such high standard that Nebraska will rise up and call Prof. E. C. Bishop "A man who was worth while." Nebraska today envies Iowa's opportunity of having a man with vision so clear that she will have a chance to outshine us; but we have one consolation, and that is, that the seed sown in Nebraski lias taken deep root and we are now in the race to keep our schools &lt;n the front. The Nebraska Plan for boys' and girls' club work is doing mucn toward making the rural school a social center. It aims to make the school represent, as it should, all the ideals of beauty, culture, refine- </seg>

August 8, 1911 rMany inquiries have been received by this department regarding work in the Boys' and Girls' Industrial clubs for the coming year. kin conjunction with the Agricultural Extension Department of the te University this work will be continued as heretofore, except that county will be the unit hereafter instead of the state. A contest will be arranged for January during the meetings of or - ganised agriculture in which the best articles from each county may be displayed and compete for honorable mention. At this contest prizes will be offered for the best ten ears of yellow corn, the best ten ears of white corn, the best ten ears of corn other than yellow or white, and the best exhibit of twelve potatoes. Lin domestic science prizes will be offered for the best shirt waist, best machine made work apron, the best hand made fancy apron, best washable sofa pillow cover, and the best initialed table linen. Prizes will be offered for the greatest number of eggs produced by Em of twelve fowls for the month beginning November 15 and end- December 15, 1911. Bulletins will be sent during the fall for the pose of giving instructions and suggestions concerning poultry, n request of the county superintendent. In the past, contests and the giving of prizes have played a large part in the carrying on of this work. It would seem that the time has come when the giving of large prizes may be dispensed with and smaller prizes with honorable mention or awards for particularly mer - itorious work substituted. It will soon be necessary to arrange the schedules for county con - tests in all counties desiring the assistance of this department and the University of Nebraska so far as speakers and judges are concerned. In order that we may arrange so as to be of service to the greatest lumber of counties possible, it is necessary to know just which coun - ties desire assistance. So far as possible we shall arrange schedules to accommodate the wishes of the county superintendent but they wiil have to be made so as to save the time and traveling expenses of speakers and judges. PWe can arrange schedules for speakers and judges to begin in Oc - r and close January. We may be able to take care of a few Boys' Girls' short courses in this schedule. The University of Nebraska, through Prof. C. W. Pugsley of the Agricultural Extension Department, will furnish judges for the work in domestic science and agriculture, and this department will send °. speaker to present the educational phase of the subject whenever de - sired, provided dates can be made to fit into regular schedules. County superintendents will be expected to bear the local expenses of speakers </seg>

PUQSLEY, Supt. Agricultural Extension. TEST SEED CORN. January 31, 1912 To Superintendents and Principals: After a conference with C. W. Pugsley of the State University Farm, on the subject of "Seed Corn" for Nebraska farmers, it seems advisable that county superintendents, city superintendents and town and village principals instruct the teachers under their charge how to test seed corn. To follow the above suggestion would be one of the most practical ways of convincing the farmer that ft is worth while to teach agricul - ture in our schools. EThe loss to the farmers of Nebraska by planting poor seed corn been a very heavy drain on the income from that one product. In section there are 640 acres of land, in one township there are 40 acres. If one-eighth of that acreage were planted to corn, and is of four bushels per acre were caused by planting poor seed corn, township would lose 11,520 bushels, which, if corn is worth bushel, would make a loss of {5,760. That is not a very large loss but there are about 2,100 townships equalling 49,177,600 acres. A loss tfour bushels per acre on one-eighth of the above would mean ,800 bushels, which at 50c per bushel would make a deficiency of 1,294,400 in the cash funds of the farmers of the state. The total number of bushels' of corn ra'sed in 1911 was 13J. - 400,303, which at 50c per bushel would equal $66,7' Thus a loss of four bushels per acre would be about one-fifth of last year's crop of corn. Now is the time to select good seed corn and to know that it is good. You will probably see many articles in the Epers along these same lines. This letter and enclosures will be added incentive to help "Boost" for good seed corn. You will find enclosed three forms of testing seed corn. Dm the one that seems most suitable to your locality and cond; The "Rag Baby" system appeals to me as being the most practical. Urge the testing of seed corn this spring. Make a special cam - paign on this one item of agricultural study and you will have done the state a lasting good. </seg>

Pis little folder is for the purpose of interesting the school 1 of the State of Nebraska in vegetable and flower gardens, hope that the time is not far distant when the homes of our ill be surrounded with flourishing trees, refreshing vines and ll flowers. We desire to urge each home to have a garden t artistically and filled with a variety of the common vegetables suited to the various sections of the state. As a step in this direction we send these suggestions for the purpose of interesting children at school in the work. Practical ideas from various sources have been freely used in this bulletin. SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENS School (iarilens. K school garden could be started by the school during the spring and a "volunteer company" arranged for caring for the garden the summer. Value of the Work The work would be valuable in many ways, — for beautifying the grounds, teaching the use of garden tools, showing to the home tho possibilitiies of production from a small garden plot, properly cared for. and for giving practical instruction in elementary botany. It is be - coming every year more imperative that Nebraska farmers should learn better ways of caring for their crops and how to make their crops more kfi table. The schools have here a field of the greatest practical ie . The making and caring for these gardens will develop a different line of activities from that most commonly used by teachers and pupils but the opportunities which the ground offers to any one who will bestow time and trouble upon it are well worth the effort it takes to introduce a new line of work. Plans for the (Jarden In planning your garden, study first the amount of ground avail - able, the lay of the land and the amount of sun or shade which ii will receive. Decide next what you will plant, whether vegetable* or flowers. A good arrangement would be to have some space devoted to vegetables and some to flowers. The most satisfactory vegetables to plant would be those that mature early, so that the pupils will have the pleasure of harvesting a part at least of their crop before school closes, and flowers which bloom early in the spring or late in the fall. \ bed of English violets is easy to care for, and few flowers yield more blooms for the time Kiven them For another spring plans could oe </seg>

Methods of Cultivation. After you have decided what you will raise, study the best ways of cultivating those particular things. Consult with successful farmers in the district, send for government bulletins on the subject, write to the state farm for help and try to make your garden successful in the amount of produce you can show as well as in appearance. Below are given plans for two gardens which have been worked out successfully in other places and may be suggestive, if they are not exactly what is wanted here. A Girl's Vegetable Garden Ida M. Angell, in Country Life in America. Cost of seed, $1.90. Cost of man's time for digging, $4.50. Total yield of vegetables, $32.15. Time spent in planting and cultivating, 83 hours. This is our garden record for 1904: An average of thirty-five minutes' work a day, from April 11th to August 31st, provided the season s vegetables for a family of five. The gardener who accomplishes this is by no means a heavyweight. ■o any able-bodied person ought to have as good results or better.

            <seg id="p353">316 Directions for a Hotbed. If you can arrange for a small hotbed you will find that it adds greatly to the interest and gives you earlier returns, which are of most value to the truck farmer. The following description of an easily made hotbed is taken from the government bulletin on vegetable gardens. No. 255, which contains many other valuable suggestions on raring for gardens. t"A simple hotbed, such as would ordinarily be employed on the , is easily constructed by the use of manure from the horse stable means of furnishing heat. Select a well-drained location, where the bed will be sheltered, shake out the manure into a broad flat heap. and thoroughly compact it by tramping. The manure heap should be x or 9 feet wide, 18 to 24 inches deep when compacted and of any de - sired length, according to the number of sash to be employed. Tha manure for hotbed purposes should contain sufficient litter such as leaves or straw to qrevent its packing soggy, and should spring sl'ghtly when troden upon. After the manure has been properly tramped and leveled, the frames to support the sashes are placed in position facing toward the south. These frames are generally made to carry 4 standard hotbed sash, and the front should be 4 to 6 inches lower than the back in order that water will drain from the glass. Three to five inches of good garden loam or specially prepared soil is spread evenly over the area enclosed in the frame, the sash put on and the bed allowed to heat. At first the temperature of the bed will run quite high, but no seeds should be planted until the soil temperature falls to 80° F, which will be in about three days." SOME THINGS TO TRY 1. As soon as the ground is in good condition in the spring sow the seed sparsely in rows twelve or fifteen inches apart, covering about three quarters of an inch deep. To secure a very early crop, sow early in cold-frame or house and transplant. 2. When the seedlings appear, stir the soil surface between tfca rows and weed as early as practicable. 3. When the young plants have developed two or three seed leaves, thin to about three inches apart. If taken up without injuring roots, beet plants may be transplanted successfully. 4. During the following weeks keep the plants free from weeds, and the surface between the rows frequently tilled. As soon as the young beets are about two and one-half to three inches in diameter pull the larger ones for use. Continue pulling, an the beets become large enough, until the crop is harvested. Remove the cut leaves and all discarded beets to a heap or some place where the will not permit tfie spores of various fungus diseases to develop. </seg>
            <seg id="p354">317 RSoon after the ground is in good condition in the spring, iow bbage seed in a shallow drill, covering only lightly. A hotbel earlier sowing. 2. The young seedlings will soon come up and should be trans - planted when the first true leaf is well developed. They may be transplanted to another part of the same seed bed or if the ground where the main crop is to be grown is ready, they may be transplanted directly there. The soil must be very rich. 3. Plant in rows at least eighteen inches apart in the rows 4. For subsequent culture keep the ground well tilled, free from weeds, and, in case of dry weather, give the plants a liberal supply of water occasionally. 1. Mark off hills four feet apart each way, dig out several shovel - fuls of earth, then fill the hole thus made with old well-pulverized barn - yard fertilizer. Cover with a few inches of soil, but do not have the surface of the hill higher than the sourrounding soil surface. Plant a dozen or fifteen cucumber seeds, scattering them over a circular sur - face a foot or more in diameter, so that the plants will come up N all parts of the hill. Cover with about one inch of soil. 2. As soon as the young seedlings appear watch carefully for striped beetles and black squash bugs. If these pests are very thick, apply a shovelful of tobacco powder to each hill or dust with plaster, or, perhaps a better way, protect the hills with mosquito netting held by frames or supports. In most sections of the country the raising t cucumbers or other related plants involves a constant fight with the ect enemies. 3. Keep the surface of the ground well tilled and stirred, and d &gt; not thin the plants until they begin to crowd so that there will be danger of disturbing the roots of those left when you pull up those that are to be taken out. Thin finally to about four plants to a hill, having the plants left well distributed in the hill. El. Sow the seed sparsely in shallow drills and cover with about half inch of fine soil. Rows should be twelve or fifteen inches B. When the seedlings are up weed the rows carefully and thin ions to about one half inch apart. 3. About two weeks later weed again, and thin to one inch apart. 4. Keep the surface of the soil well tilled and free from weed*. 5. When the onions are matured pull them during dry weather ?nd leave them on the surface of the ground to ripen. &lt; u&lt; umber. </seg>
            <seg id="p355">318 Radish. kl. Sow the seed about one quarter of an inch apart in drills ut one half of an inch deep and twelve inches apart. Cover with f an inch of soil. 2. When the plants are up, weed carefully and thin to one inch or three quarters of an inch apart. 3. Keep the soil between the rows hoed freely and, if practicable, water the plants if the weather is dry. PPull the radishes as soon as they are of good size and do not them so long that they become stringy, or hollow and pithy. El. As soon as the garden ground can be worked in the spring, the seed sparsely in drills about one foot apart. Cover with one or three quarters of an inch of fine soil. 2. When the plants come up, hoe between the rows, pull out all the weeds in the rows, and thin the plants to about one half an in h apart. 3. If the weather should be very dry water occasionally. If the ground is not rich sprinkle a little nitrate of soda between the rows to hasten the growth. ■ As plants get of good size, cut out about every other one to ; greens, leaving the others to grow to larger size before bein£ Tomato. 1. Make little drills one half inch deep and one inch apart in the earth of the seed box by pressing downward a ruler or other straight edge. Sow the seed in these, leaving the seeds one eighth of an inch apart in the rows. Cover with one-half inch of fine soil. Water carefully. 2. Keep the seed-bed moist for the next ten days. By that time the little seedlings should appear. As soon as they show, put the seed - box where it will have all the sunlight possible, and arrange for as much air as can be given without chilling the plants. Water carefully, preferably when the sun is shining. 3. The greatest danger to the seedling is the damping off fungus. In cloudy weather and when the surface of the soil is kept wet this causes the plants to die through injury to the stems. As soon as any plants are injured, withhold water and give all the air and sunshine possible. Take care that mice do not nibble the seedlings at night in the house. 4. When the plants have one or two leaves in addition to the cotyledons, transplant them to shallow boxes, or preferably to two and one half inch pots. Set as deep in the pot as you can that roots may develop along the stem above the place where the roots first came </seg>
            <seg id="p356">INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 319 12 After three or four weeks growth in the small pots it will probably be desirable to transplant into three inch pots. Set rather deeply down that more roots may ccme from the additional part of the stalk that will thus be covered with earth. 6. As soon as the sunny weather out-doors permits set the plants on a sunny porch or in a cold frame or in some sheltered place where they can be protected at night and be gradually hardened off. By the time they are ready to put in the garden they should have buds or Iiiossoms. If they blossom much before they can be set out pollenize the flowers. You may thus get some fruits started early. 7. When danger of a killing frost is past, plant in rich soil in the garden. The distance apart will depend upon the method of after treatment. Set the plant so deep that the stem is buried in the soil about half way up to the lower leaves. New roots will come out on the buried part and enable the plant to grow faster. 8. If the space is very limited, and the plants are set close, say eighteen inches apart, prune the growing plant to a single stalk and tie this with cloth strips to a stout stake, four feet h'gh. With more space support vines on a low rack of slats, or within hoops around the plants, raising the fruit above the soil. Cultivate, weed and water, if necesaary. like other crops. 9. As soon as frost touches the vines, gather the green tomatoes, then pull the vines and burn them to prevent the spores of fungus diseases from developing. Or pull up the vines with the unripened fruit attached and hang up in the cellar. Some fruit will ripen nicely. Lettuce. 1. As soon in spring as the ground can be worked, sow the lettuce seed sparsely in a shallow drill and cover with about one half inch of fine soil. 2. As soon as the young plants appear, stir the surface of the soil between the rows and keep the rows free from weeds. 3. When the first true leaf is fairly well developed, thin the plants to six inches apart in the rows; or the rows may be sown in the hotbed and transplanted. t4. The only subsequent treatment needed will be frequent st'rring the soil and pulling of weeds. Gather the heads as soon as they ach full size.

Westgate, I&gt;ept. of Horticulture. State Farm Bulbs fur the (iarden. Of the many plants which are grown none are more easily cared for than bulbs. Their early spring flowering habit makes them espe - cially well adapted for school gardening work. Of the common bulbs, tulips and hyacinths are easily grown and are not very expensive, especially the tulips, which can generally be obtained for about twenty - five cents per dozen. Tulips, are planted in the fall, early in Novem - ber being a good time. The tulip bed is prepared as follows: Thro* ovt the surface soil from the bed to the depth of eight inches. Thor - oughly pulverize the soil which has been taken out and replace about four inches of it. Carefully level the surface of the replaced soil with a rake and place the bulbs on the bed about four inches apart. Cover them with three or four inches of locse soil and leave the bed in this condition until winter weather comes. Then cover the bed with six inches of straw to prevent frost injury to the bulbs during winter. In the spring this mulch should be gradually removed as the bulbs are coming through the ground. As soon as the bulbs have flowered, dig them up, remove the tops, and store them in some cool, dry place where they can be kept until time to plant them again the following fall. However, where one can afford it, it is better to buy new bulbs each year. L Hyacinths are treated much the same as tulips, except they should planted two inches deeper and about two inches farther apart lie bed. Hyacinth bulbs are somewhat more expensive than tulips, illy costing from fifty to seventy-five cents per dozen. If desirable, a few summer flowering bulbs may be used. Most of these flower after school has closed in the spring. For that reason they are not so well adapted to school srardeninK work The cann&lt;i </seg>
            <seg id="p358">321 is one of the most important and easiest grown of any of this class of bulbs. Where one desires to grow it, bulbs should be planted abont May 1st. The ground should be prepared much the same as for tulips, except it is unnecessary to have the bulbs at a uniform depth. Hardy Chrysanthemums. Eese plants may be grown from either seeds or cuttings. If re planted in the spring the plants from the same will not ! blooms until a year from the following summer. Where quick results are desired, it will be best to buy rooted cuttings from nurserymen or florists. These hardy chrysanthemums can be grown in almost any soil providing the location is such that the plants will receive plenty of sunlight. Previous to planting, the soil should be thoroughly pulverized. During the summer it should be hoed fre - quently in order to destroy the weeds. These plants are perennial, so that when once established, the plants will almost take care of themselves and produce flowers for a number of years. The Violet. This plant finds its best environment in a well kept greenhouse but it may be grown with some success in an ordinary garden. It blooms in May when grown out of doors and for that reason is worth trying in the school garden. The best location for the violet bed is south of a house, board fence or some similar winter protecting device it must not be too close or the bed will become too warm and growth may start during winter thaws. This plant does best in a medium heavy soil which is well drained. Previous to planting the first of May, the ground should be thoroughly pulverized. If desired, the plants may be set as close as eight or ten inches. The California violet is one of the beet varieties to use. Plants of this may be obtained from any florist in the spring at little cost. The violet bed will generally need little care except in the fall, when it should be well mulched to protect the plants during winter. During the summer about all that is necewry is to keep the weeds out of the bed, although occasional applications ot some fertilizer will do no harm. Publications That Will Help.

Beautifying the School Grounds, Youth's Companion Co. The School Garden Book, Weed &amp; Emerson, by Scribners. These are only a few of the many, many helpful things on the subject. As you take the work up you will find more and more that is helpful. As you think about a garden it may be that it will seem to the teachers in the rural schools that there are more difficulties involved in doing it than can possiblv be met but they do not all come at one </seg>

NkBllASKA BOYS' AM) GIRLS' CLUB EGG COUNTING CONTEST Not. 15 to Dec. 15, 1011. DEPARTMENT AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION, UNIVERSITY O* NEBRASKA, STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. Prizes for the pen of one dozen fowls producing the greatest number of eggs from November 15 to December 15, 1911. Selecting Hens for the Contest. It to just as difficult to select a good laying hen as to pick z winner in a race course. EH is the active, sprightly, alert hens that lay the most eggs — first out in the morning and last on the roost at night. Do select a fat, lazy hen. She is not likely to be a good layer sut a good deal of training. Previous to the contest hens should receive the same care they would receive were they already in the contest, and in the meantime hens should be given a tryout to eee if they are fit for the race. It is eggs that count. Find out if possible what hens are laying and discard the drones. Housing. Pying hens should be provided with a comfortable house. Id be neither too warm nor too cold. Artificial heat is not 1. A cold house, warm enough to prevent freezing of wattle, jr feet, will give good results. Draughts in particular must led against. A roost with a drop curtain is of especial advantage nights. Houses with drop curtain windows are much recom - . These are inexpensive and prevent quick changes in tempera- Selection of Location. Rens like cats, don't like wet feet. A muddy yard, a damp wet bedding, wet, sloppy feed cause colds, croups and other is. They also cause a smaller egg yield. A sick hen is not much use as an egg producer. She cannot do her best, and nothing short of that ought to satisfy you. A location high and dry with good natural drainage, shelter from the rain and cold winds, facing the </seg>
            <seg id="p360">323 Exercise. E During the warm weather the hens might be given the freedom of ge run. In the colder days exercise must be provided in other . Feed the small grain in litter of chaffy straw, dried leaves or material. Make the hen work for her living. She enjoys it, if not azy. A fat hen or a lazy hen does not make a good layer. Kind of Feed. There are two main classes of foods, the protein and hydro - carbon. From milk we make butter, which is largely a hydrocarbon. From milk by another process we also make cheese, which might be said to represent the protein, though it contains hydrocarbon. Eggs also contain these two classes. Corn is heating and fattening; it should be fed with meat, bone, bran, gluten and such feeds. Cracked corn should be siful to prevent waste. Corn on the cob affords some exercise. Wheat is considered better than corn, though usually more costly. Barley and oats are also good. Some variety in feed is desirable. Meat scraps, alfalfa and clover leaves should be fed to provide protein, of which there is not enough in any one grain. I»repared Foods. Buite a number of prepared foods may be used to advantage, hould be used cautiously and in small quantities. Hens Have N'o Teeth. PHens have no teeth. They must have grit. A box of clean, ;ht. sharp, rather course sand should be provided. This should where the hens can get it. Do not wait until Jack Frost froaw up the sand hills. Oyster shell or other grit might be used to advan - tage, but sharp sand or gravel is equally good and is cheaper. A healthy hen will eat two ounces of flinty sand in a day. Green Feed. Ereen food is necessary for the health of the laying hen. Clover lfa leaves help keep the hen in good condition. A cabbage strung ring might be used. It should be hang Just high enough to give the hen some exercise in getting at it. Sugar beets and silage might be used to advantage. Too much green feed can scarcely be given. (lean Feed If tEe hen is to do her best she must have clean feed. Here again the health of the hen must be considered. A sickly hen can not do her best. She must ha.e clean feed in clean vessels. This is more particularly true of feed mixed with water or milk. This mixture sours and causes gastric troubles. Hens constantly bothered with the stomach-ache do not make the best layers. Clean feed and green feed prevent stomach troubles. How to Feed. The practice that is used by the most successful egg producers </seg>
            <seg id="p361">324 bowel trouble, so do not leave any about. Feed only what will be eaten within twenty minutes. A feed of mixed grains should follow, scattered as suggested. Some more grain should be scattered in the litter in the afternoon, and if the weather is cold give a feed of corn just before the hens go to roost. Overfeeding and Underfeeding. Overfeeding should be avoided. An overfed hen is usually no good as a layer. She becomes torpid, lazy and her digestion thrown off the balance. By all means use some judgment else fewer eggs is the result. At the same time you can not get something for nothing, and care should be used. If the hen is overfed, reduce the feed to one meal a day. Feed this in the evening. Make her scratch for the rest. Water. EA hen needs water. A dozen hens will drink about two quarts water a day. More than that the hens must have clean water in in vessels. On cold days the water should be warmed slightly. To ask the hen to drink from filthy pools or pick enough snow tD quench her thirst courts failure. A good practice is to protect the water with a box. With some leather a hinged top can be put on the end. In front ordinary house lath might be nailed, and a cross-partition put in four or five inches from the bottom. On this the water vessel may be placed. Hens can not then get dirt in it from scratching, standing on the edge of pan, or in other ways. Some new variety in drinks might be given by the use of skim milk. Some recommend that this be clabbered. Most excellent results are obtained by the use of dried casein. Milk is soured then drawn off and the casein dried in the sun. This is rich in protein and very digestible. Dost Bath. Knlike the boy, the hen likes a bath every day. This is partly bath and partly a dust bath. This may not always be provided, ds to the health and comfort of the hen. Wood ashes make a uitable bath as it usually contains some burnt bones and pieces erial that are medicinal in nature. In the preparation of the house a thorough cleaning must be given same. Turn the nest box over a sulphur smudge, apply whitewash, put in fresh material. Roosts should also be cleaned and house sprayed with lime wash. To some this might seem a good deal of work, but it will pay. A hen that is made to feed a thousand vermin with her life blood should not be expected to lay many eggs. Don't Fuss With Your Hens. ETo get best results from your hens they must be contented and et, yet active and energetic. While hens need exercise, such rcise should be natural. Stray dogs should be kept away. A Kl layer is usually nervous. Take no chances. </seg>

DOMKSTK' SCIENCE Crete Plan INTRODUCTORY. EThe rapid and substantial growth of industrial education during past few years can be explained only on the hypothesis that it is ting the demands of the best educators. To find a place in ou.  - eational system a new subject must add something to the phys - mental or moral development of the pupil. Industrial education proved that it adds to the powers of the pupil in all three of theje ntials. b Manual training and domestic science have made the most rapid th, partly because it is easier to prepare for the successful teach - &gt;f these subjects and partly because skill acquired in them. is more ly and quickly applied in actual life. Schools in the cities and larger towns are able to equip room3 for manual training and domestic science and employ special teachers for these subjects. The smaller towns and rural schools, however, where such work is needed as much as in the cities, cannot meet the extra expense of equipment and teachers. Whatever will in any way add to the efficiency of our smaller schools will be helping to develop the powers of a large and important class of our pupils. It is with this in mind that this department is </seg>
            <seg id="p369">332 En use in the state more than five years and has been pronounced cal by many superintendents of schools and by teachers of do - : science. The many inquiries that have been made concerning the Crete Plan in domestic science, the general interest shown in the subject of industrial culture as an important part of a broad education for o&lt;ir young women, the success that has attended the Crete Plan when managed properly through the co-operative effort of judicious superin - tendent and progressive home-makers, are the reasons for the pre - sentation of the plan in this form. E There are over cne thousand towns and villages in the state where Crete Plan might be used successfully. This plan costs the school •ict little or nothing. As conducted in Crete for five years it cost nothing. The plan of furnishing a room and equipping it for a kitchen, furnishing material for the work and employing a special teacher costs considerable, but the results secured are worth mucli tre than the cost. There are abojt fifteen of the larger towns and es that now employ special teachers with good results. Probably it will be many years before fifty places In the state will be able to do this. While the Crete Plan is not a substitute for the larger course it has proved to be useful in encouraging our girls, through their intimate association with leading home-makers to appreciate the fact that the ladies who have the broadest culture are those who can use their hands as well as their heads. If by any plan the thousands of girls in town and villages can be helped to realize the nobility of toil and to understand that bread making is as compatible with high and noble thinking as is piano playing or the study of Shakespeare then we shall be moving more tidly toward the day of happier homes and truer culture and at the le time be returning a better value to the tax payers for the mil - lions expended by them for education. The Crete Plan of domestic science did not receive its name from the originator nor from any of the philanthropic women of Crete who made it possible for the plan to succeed. Others who saw the value of the fudamental principles in the method as it was developed in Crete spoke of it as the "Crete Plan in Domestic Science." The Omaha World-Herald of January 21, 1906, in an illustrated article calls it "The Crete Plan." F. G. Stephens in a lengthy article for an eastern paper uses the same term. Supt. E. C. Bishop in an address at the N. E. A. meeting at Los Angeles, 1907, gave a careful summary of the "Crete Plan." These and others are responsible for the name by which the typ^ of domestic science effort originated at Crete is known. There is nothing new in this method except the manner of combination of several factors and forces in such a way as to secure a new result. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">333 Eis bulletin is prepared by Inspector G. A. Gregory, who origi - nd developed this method of teaching domestic science, while tendent of the Crete public schools. Very Sincerely, I \V CRABTREE Lincoln, Nebraska, August 30, 191 THE CRETE PLAN By G. A. Gregory The Plan FTo fully understand the value of the plan it is well to note some he fundamental principles on which it is based. This can be done Following the process of reasoning which led to its inception. A study of our American educational system and the results ob - tained, leads to the conclusion that the intellectual training rw does not give the broadest culture nor fit the average pupil to live properly. A large part of the most valuable culture received by many of our most competent girls does not come from the schools but froii the home. From their mothers the girls are learning lessons that go far toward making them efficient cultured women both for the home and society. Other girls are not receiving or practicing these lessons. Th are still many girls who grow up in an atmosphere where the culture that fits one for the parlor or library is rated high while the culture that prepares one to excel in the kitchen and dining room is rated low. Many a girl is said to be educated because she has graduated with a good record in Latin and mathematics. Other girls who have not s nished a school course, are considered as lacking an education, al - though it often happens that these are the girls who staid at home and became proficient in the kind of education that will go farther to make a happy home than will the intellectual type of culture. The girl who goes through the schools is lauded and cheered on by the EThe one who must sacrifice her desire for a college course in to help at home receives little encouragement from the public so often, little from those who receive her assistance. Pwas for the purpose of recognizing the vahie of the home cul - of placing honor on toil, and of giving all the girls in the high a chance of receiving recognition for the culture that comes manual effort, that the Crete Plan was devised. In every community there are women who are known to be skillful In certain lines of cookery. They are always in favor at picnics, and banquets. No matter how they acquired their ability they are judged by the results of their efforts. Such ladies are usually amoHg the most genial and liberal, most affable and helpful women in the com - munity. If these capable women could be helped to see the oppor - tunity open to them of doing great good to the girls of the high school </seg>
            <seg id="p371">334 Pvas believed they would gladly respond. They, of all women, would quick to realize that the school and home should be more closely touch. They would be alive to the grow.ng demand for industrial education. If they would consent to become a part of the corps of instructors in the high school, giving from their practical experitnce, lessons in domestic science then could a workable plan be readily put into action. FA meeting of ladies who were believed to be interested was calle 1 these ideas laid before them. The result was more encourag - than any one could anticipate. Much enthusiasm was shown by all and more volunteered assistance than could be accepted. It was decided that instruction should be offered to all high school girls \n the preparation and cooking of twenty common articles. The instruc - tion would be given in the homes of the ladies. Each instructor would give lessons on two articles. The girls would take notes on the in - struction given by the teacher and on the observation of her methods of preparation of the given article. The girls would then practice in their own homes until they believed they had become quite skill - ful, when they would bring the prepared articles to an exhibit where it would be passed upon by judges. The superintendent of the school would have the general management of the plan, organize the clawo... and direct their movements as well as keep all the records. If the work was well done by the girls, so that it met the approval of the judges and the board of education, it should count for one credit toward graduation from the high school course. That is, a girl on completing the course would have placed to her credit on the high school records her grade in domestic science and it would count as much 'o - ward her graduation as a semester of Latin or Chemistry. P&gt;Vhen the plan was presented to the high school girls they re - l it with great enthusiasm. About two weeks later the girls a request that they be given some of the work during the sum - vacation, soon at hand, so they would be well started by the beginning of the school year the following September. Their request was granted and the plan was in operation in June. Through the sum - mer of 1905 about fifty girls were meeting in regular classes. The plan was therefor well under way at the opening of the fall term of EThe Crete Plan is used successfully in a number of places. Crete, rer City, Exeter, Clay Center, DeWitt, Blair, Nelson, Ashland, dron, are some of the towns where the progressive ladies are giving domestic science instruction. In some places the plan is modified tn suit local conditions but in all the same general principles are followed. In May, 1911, there were known to be more than ninety instructors and three hundred pupils working along this line. Some of the claims made by these instructors, for the Crete Plan are: Recognition of the cultural value of domestic science; utilizing the knowledge End skill of practical housekeepers of the communitv* </seg>

            <seg id="p374">335 bringing high school girls into friendly association with real home makers; giving these girlB frequent opportunities of seeing and noting the arrangements of many home interiors from kitchen to parlor; tee - ing the most respected and influential ladies engaged in culinary operations; doing all the work in a real home with home atmosphere and home environment; placing honor upon toil in the home; giving recognition to the work on the records of the school. The successful combination of these and other principles as worked out at Crete, has proved the plan practical. Its adoption and successful operation by other schools is evidence that the home and school can help each other and that both are made better through their co-operation. ORGANIZATION AND WORKING OF THE PLAN The Crete Plan is best suited to villages, and towns up to about three thousand population. With slight modification it can be used in rural schools. In cities the pupils in the high school come from si large a territory that it would be difficult for them to meet at the homes of the instructors. B'he movement to organize for the work may originate within or iut the school, but it cannot succeed unless there is earnest in - in the work both from the home and school. The superintendent be in hearty sympathy and either he or one of the most influential high school teachers be willing to stand for and manage the school side of the work. Before any general meeting is called there should be a full and fair discussion of the plan and of the advisability of trying it, between the superintendent or principal of the school and a few ladies who are heartily interested in the girls and the school. la the case of Crete, the superintendent after a few months' careful thought counselled with Mrs. E. K. Manville. principal of the hi*h school, Mrs. C. B. Anderson and Mrs. G. A. Gregory. These due deliberation urged the matter forward. First Meeting of Ladies. rlf after careful consideration between the school authority and a reliable ladies it is deemed wise to go farther, a meeting of women representing as many as possible, of the various church and social interests, should be called at some home at a time when th&lt;v school can be represented. If it is decided best to try the plan and enough ladies are willing to open their homes and act as instructors then it is safe to proceed. Preventing Plan to Girls. The next step is to present the plan to the high school girls. This can be done at the school building at some opportune time but should be done by the one who is in hearty sympathy and best adapted* for it whether in or out of school. The girls should be shown that th &gt;y </seg>
            <seg id="p375">336 can easily carry this work without omitting any other subject since they have four years to master about twenty articles of cookery and that if preferred most of the work can be done in the summer follow - ing the lessons they have received during the school year. This wouM mean that they could graduate with an extra point to their credit on the records of the school. Or if properly arranged with the school board the domestic science might take the place of one term of some study of the junior or senior year. Sometimes from sickness or other cause a pupil fails on a semester of work and is unable to make it up, then the domestic science may be substituted. Several pupils havj graduated from Crete with their class, who could not have done so Kpt for their domestic science credit. Many more have graduated thirty-three credit points. PVfter the plan is well explained if there are enough girls who to undertake it the way is open to proceed. Usually it is not to undertake it unless at least half the high school girls care for it. Eighth grade and even seventh grade girls if deemed best may - be admitted. Local conditions must govern in many details. Operating the Plan. In selecting the instructors care must be taken to secure a rang: of ability among them. Generally this is not difficult. The specific articles listed in the course may vary with the abilities of the instruc - tors. To illustrate in a concrete way the following original corps of instructors at Crete together with their subjects is given: Mrs. C. B. Anderson, soup stock, noodles, and preparation of left overs. Mrs. G. A. Gregory, pies. Mrs. H. McCargar, cakes. Mrs. S. L. Mains, gems and corn bread. Mrs. C. B. Goodell, meats. Mrs. E. L. Wilcox, bread. Mrs. M. E. Streeter, biscuit Kiss Nell Murphy, desserts and salads, ■s. Z. Waterman, cookies and doughnuts, •s. J. H. Bahner, vegetables. Eince 1905 some of these have removed from Crete or withdrawn se of health or household duties but the corps has been kept by the addition of: Mrs. E. J. Steidl, cookies and doughnuts Mrs. A. Dredla, bread. Mrs. Emily Russell, cookies and doughnuts. Miss Stella Stephens, vegetables. 'Mrs. R. D. Brown, meats. </seg>
            <seg id="p376">337 PThe corps of instructors is self-perpetuating and it will be seen l the above original list and the changes that the same course continued throughout. Eote also that some have more subjects than others, that is, under sad of meats three articles, cooking of roasts, meat loaf, and y, were taught. Two kinds of cakes, two kinds of pies, usuallv or more vegetables were taught by one person. It is not neees - o follow this course. Each locality manages that to suit condi - or instructors. Some places have more than twenty article*. ei few less. E arranging classes it is usually well to have at least six in one ten is still better if the homes can accomodate that number lly it is well to group the upper grades together rather than the upper and lower. Time of Meeting. Elf past three for all the classes has proved a good hour. TaM the week should be chosen to suit the instructor. In most there are few or no recitations in the high school after half past three. Even if there should be the girls can be excused to attend the domestic science for it would not on the average happen more than five times a year. If a pupil is excused no record should be made of her absence since she is in a class of as much importance as the ono she lias left. During the first year of the work some of the seniors may wUh to move rapidly so as to finish the course before graduation. After that no pupil will need to go to a class oftener than once a month, since there are about twenty articles in the course and four years to complete it an average of five articles per year would cover the work. I'sually a girl visits a class not more than once to get the lesson on each article, though she may attend as many times as she likes, and since some of the instructors give their lessons on two subjects at one session it is evident that there is no great burden as to class attendance either for the pupils or teachers. There should not be two classes meeting during the same week, then the passing of the class out of the building is scarcely noticeable. Fixed and Changeable Dates. Each instructor should have a fixed day for her class as, the third Wednesday, or the second Tuesday, etc.. of each month. Occasionally an instructor is called away. She should simply notity me superin - tendent who announces, "Mrs. Anderson will not meet her domestic science class this week, Thursday." Later a special day may, if deemed bert. be arranged. </seg>
            <seg id="p377">338 Passing of Classes. Suppose the girls arranged in four classes. Class 1, seniors: class 2, juniors; class 3, sophomores; class 4, freshman. Send class No. 1 the first week of the month to teacher No. 1, class 2 the sec - ond week to teacher No. 2, class No. 3 the third week to teacher No. 3 and class 4 the fourth week to teacher No. 4. Thus during the first month each girl has received instructions on which she can be at work, and four of the teachers have given in - structions. month take the same order with the classes but go on witli remaining teachers in regular. order, i. e. Class No. 1 goes to teacn - er No. 2. Continue this until each one of the teachers has given a lesson then go around again if necessary. This gives the teachers a chance to exchange their views and experiences at a comparatively early date. Pupils who miss a class should always take the next class, but stay with her division for the regular work. Arrangements are easily made for pupils who may Is out a few months or even for two years Sometimes it is Hrtvisaule t» change pupils permanently from one class to another. Suit personal choice of pupils as far as possible. A monitor is appointed by the superintendent for each class. Her duty is" to report back to the superintendent the attendance at each meeting and he keeps a record of it in a convenient book. Instructors should not be asked to do anything but give instruction and do such other work as pertains directly to domestic science. .At the He me. E Arriving at the home of the instructor at half past three they seated in such room as is convenient, parlor, sitting room or dining n and the talk to the class is given. In this talk the girls are toll only the recipe but details as to materials, preparation of same, ■ee of heat required common causes of failure, etc. In fact every - g that in the mind of a practical cook would help the girls to Each girl places at the top of the left hand page in her note book the date and name of instructor, copies the recipe carefully an-1 makes such other notes as she may choose, then signs her name ai the bottom. Occasionally all the books are called in and inspected. Careless work in note books should not be permitted. The instructors besides giving a talk and the recipe usually pre - pare the article ready for cooking and sometimes as in biscuit, cookies, and the like cook the article in the presence of the girls. With meats and poultry the article is prepared for cooking. With white bread the girls are asked to stop a few minutes after school at the home of the instructor, and see the first step, setting the sponge, call the next morning before school and see the next step, mixing the bread, about half past eleven and see the bread ready for the oven, at one o'clock </seg>
            <seg id="p378">339 on the way back to school and see the result, a fine loaf of well cooked bread. Home Practice. The girls now go to their homes and at the earliest possible dare. when they can have time, carefully try the recipe. There should be no objection to receiving help from any source at this time. In fact it is a good thing for the daughter to get her mother to watch he: - and offer suggestions in the many little details familiar to every mother but which cannot all be told by an instructor in one lesson. Keripe Optional. Rhe pupil should faithfully try the recipe given, a few times, which if she knows, or if any one can tell her, a better way &gt;( ig the article she is at liberty to use that method. Remembering that the purpose of the plan is mutual benefit to both home and school, and remembering that nearly every one knows how to do some things better than any one else knows how to do them it is the part of wis - dom to accept the best without regard to the source. This liberal policy, too, disarms the criticism sometimes offered that the instructors of domestic science do not know more about rooking than do the women who are teaching it. The instructors admit this and invite any one to make suggestions and help the work along. L Girls in the different classes are practicing in their own homes and rning to handle real cooking utensils on a real stove heated by the usual fire of that home, the materials being of the kind an&lt;l quality used in the home. This is no play work. It is the 'real thing" and there seems to be a certain exhilaration about it that helps to cheer the girl on to success. Eit is a good thing, and no one doubts it. to learn domestic in a school where everything that invention and skill can do n at hand for the pupil, is it not worth while to enter the fie'.d al life and with cruder implements win a fair degree of su- We have seen loaves of white bread made in rude sourroundin^s baked by a cob fire win prizes over those baked in the ovens of fine ranges.

This is done by having each girl bring one or more of the articles she has learned to prepare to the school house on Saturday afternoon where they are arranged on tables for the inspection o" </seg>
            <seg id="p379">340 E judges. A good improvised table may be made by laying a couple clean boards lengthwise of a row of seats in a room that can be veniently heated. F Saturday afternoon is considered the best time as the girls will from Friday after school to prepare the articles. Often a girl bring several articles which she has made since Friday. Cookies, cake, dessert, meat loaf, and corn bread are easily prepared. Another Eage is that a large part of some articles can be used for the meal at noon on Saturday. Every girl should have her family ghly interested in her success. E\ committee of the girls should receive the articles, label an&lt;l them properly before the judges arrive. They should also pla:i the room be as clean and cheerful as possible for the occasion. They should provide all the utensils necessary for testing articles. t pencils for marking. They should arrange so that their instrm - who are the judges, shall have nothing to do but act as judges. llringing Articles to Exhibit. In most cases it is not necessary to bring more than a part of an article to the exhibit; enough so the judges can have a fair idea as to the quality of the work. This applies especially to meats, veg - etables, salad dressing, desserts, large cakes and the like. Most girls, howeve". prefer to bring pies, cakes, and the most toothsome articles whole and treat their companions at the close of the exhibit. Parents are usually pleased to furnish all the material the girls need for these exhibits. Judging. When the exhibit is ready, which should be as early as half past two, the girls withdraw to another room while the judges are busy. Generally no one but judges and the class should be in or about the building. The instructors always act as judges, but no instructor judges the product of her own instruction. The advantage of this is evident. Two judges should pass on each article. This will often necessitate each set of two judging several articles. Saturday after - noon is usually a busy time in the home, but since the exhibit need not come more than three times a year, instructors can make suitable arrangement*. In some towns, where farmers' institutes and fairs are held, the domestic science class of the high school is invited to make an exhibit. It is well both for instructors and the girls to accept such invitation occasionally, if possible. On such an occasion all the articles can be entered with the regular card and the instructors can judge and mark as for the usual exhibit. In this way the public may see some of the work of the girls, and the girls receive credit for </seg>
            <seg id="p380">341 Marking. Each article when placed on exhibit has attached or placed witn it a judging card, which is printed in a form that makes it a cer - tificate of the faithful preparation of the article by the exhibitor. The one used by the Nelson high school is a good form and is given below. These tags may be bought of any dealer. The Nebraska Paper &amp; Bag Company, of Lincoln, handles them at about 70c per thousand plain, or $2.20 per thousand, printed both sides as shown below: 1 Nelson Ijtglj £&gt;rtjoni DOMESTIC SCEINCE Nelson.

            <seg id="p381">342 Enough of these cards are taken home by the girls before the exhibit so they can be filled out, signed, and brought with each article. On the reverse side the judges are to place their grades, which are to be of the same kind and in the same terms as are used in the schoo! for marking algebra. The first line of this s'de should be printed ir. such terms. The superintendent would g:ve explanation of the mark - ing used so that the ladies can easily follow them. After "Remarks' the judges write anything they wish in the way of suggestion: "Too tch shortening," "Baked too long," "Take this pie to your instruc - ," "Try it again," etc., or leave the lines blank. Filing Cards. P After an article has been accepted by the judges as passing tlv ired standard, the card should be filed away by the superintendent, the cards should be kept as a permanent part of the records o' school. Thousands of them will occupy but little space. Not lew than a thousand cards should be purchased to begin any class. Record Book. Besides filing the cards a record book of a convenient form shoali be kept. In this the girls' names appear, and the work they have done placed opposite the'ir names in a compact form. Each one can devise a book suitable to conditions. The following sketch proved satisfactory at Crete. The book used was a regular daily attendance school register, using a double page and writing in the headings at top of the page. Part of Left Hand Page. a glance.

            <seg id="p382">343 Banquets The course is extensive enough so that by the time a class has finished it, or even before, the girls are capable of giving a banquet to their instructors or to the school board. This has been done in several towns. One given at Crete was a full four course chicken dinner. Tu&lt;? fathers and mothers of the fifty girls, members of the school boar.l and their wives, domestic science faculty and husbands, together some of the prominent people of the town, one hundred and fifty in all. were easily and sumptuously cared for. EU1 the girls are at the service of the ladies for afternoon teas other functions. Here they acquire skill in setting tables anil ing. General Demonstrations. Ecasionally the entire class with their instructors meet in a •oom, an oil stove and necessary equipment are brought in and nstration given by one of the instructors. This may be on making tea or coffee, biscuits, home-made candy, or any other easily made article. By this means much valuable instruction is given that is not included in the regular course. This is a time when many things may be discussed that pertain to the well being of the move - ment and the upbuilding of the girls. Foods and their relative nu - tritive values, various methods of preparation, new dishes, are profit - able topics. Flexibility of the Plan. It is readily seen that the plan is very easily adjusted to the local conditions of any town. There are only two absolutely essential ele - ments necessary to its success: Mature people with good judgmert who believe in industrial culture, and are anxious to help high school girls grow into the best type of woman, and high school girls who are anxious to secure the broadest and best culture possible to th- i: in their environment. A wise superintendent belongs to the first class and he can usually bring the two elements into harmonious rela- Cn if he wishes. All other details are easily worked out and a 1 - ited if the plan is undertaken. , PThe fact that the plan is quite flexible is one reason for its :ess. High school pupils are continually under the strain of being time at every one of the seven hundred-twenty recitations per year. With the average high school girl there are about thirty times a day when she should be prompt, one hundred and fifty time* in five days, or two thousand seven hundred in a school year of one hu.i- Cid eighty days. Promptness is a good habit to form, but the usurl man nature enjoys a little variety. Consideration of the following features of the plan will lead a student of human nature to see why girls usually like it. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">344 rhey are not compelled to take it unless they wish to. They take algebra, English, botany, etc., but they may choose this, are not marked down or scolded if they miss a class. They may even go to the same instructor along with another class. They are not required to practice a certain number of hours per day. They may even wait until summer and do all their practice at a time when it will release mother and let her have a needed rest from her strenu - ous life. They do not even have to complete the course in order to graduate from the high school unless they choose, for they can easily carry the full regular work and this too. They may even com - plete this course after they have graduated from the high school and receive their certificates or diplomas for this special work. After trying a recipe they may discard it and follow their own wishes — * precious privilege to any one. What a privilege, too, it is to leave the school room before school is out and be trusted to walk across the town, enter the home of a friend and be welcomed by one who cares enough for them to turn aside from her personal affairs and help them along a line in which they are keenly interested. The girls do not forget that these in - structors are not paid for the services. That has been shown many times by the girls planning various treats for their benefactors. Graduation. Two of the schools where the Crete Plan is used, Crete and DeWitt, perhaps others, arrange for occasional special graduation of those. who have completed the domestic science course. At Crete it was planned to have such graduation onre in three years when all who have finished will receive a certificate or diploma as evidence of their work. The plan of graduation is briefly as fol - lows: All who are to graduate from the course and those still in the course furnish a banquet for certain invited guests. This is done as evidence to the guests that the members of the class have earned a right to the recognition to be conferred upon them. Before or at the close of the banquet there is a short program of music, furnished from any source, a talk along the lines of domestic science or industrial education, preferably by home talent, and a closing talk by one of the instructors if possible. Some may prefer to secure speakers from abroad. This graduation emphasizes the value of the work and opens the way for generous public recognition. Domestic Science Instructors. The instructors may form a simple organization by electing each year a president and secretary. The simpler the organization the better. There is seldom any business to transact that needs recording and the less cumbersome the business the better. Usually commit - tttf are appointed for a special purpose and when that purpose Is </seg>
            <seg id="p384">345 -EjXpCHflOa The Crete Plan calls for no expense on the part of the school hoard. Instructors are not necessarily put to any expense as the articles prepared in giving lessons are used in the families of the instructors, who are receiving the great benefit are furnished material at home for the results of their efforts are usually welcomed by their family and their parents are usually much pleased to have them become skillful in cookery. tThis is in strong contrast with the five to eight hundred dollars .rly expense in a school where a special teacher gives all her timo domestic science instruction. Results. E Besides the results naturally expected from domestic science in way of helping girls to some knowledge of the culinary art there some features connected with the Crete Plan which, to those who in position to judge, appear to be very useful. A few of I jres are given here. Study Interiors. PThe girls see the interiors of many of the best homes. Arrange - s of dining rooms, sitting rooms, pictures, styles of furniture, innumerable other items are theirs to inspect and compare. Th^y carry the impression and pictures in their memories, talk with each other about them and build many air castles furnished with what appeals to them as most beautiful and useful. Proud of Their Ability. It is found that girls in the Crete Plan are proud of their ability to make a good loaf of bread, roast a fowl, or prepare a dainty dessert. They talk with one another about their accomplishments and delight in being known as a good cook. As a result many of them are found at the proper time in the kitchen or dining room while their mothers are entertaining callers in the parlor. Influence in the Home. As a result of seeing the older sisters interested in cooking, the younger sisters and often even the brothers are found imitating them much to the advantage of the younger ones. A taste for useful em - ployment must be formed early or it is likely never to be formed. Many mothers drive their children into idleness by refusing to let them help about the housework. A selfish mother will be heard ex - claiming to her children: "Run away and play. I would rather wasb the dishes than have you pottering about." Better Material Furnished. Many parents have said that after their girls had entered the do - mestic science class, better material and greater variety found place in their homes. The girls wish to try the recipes the instructors had given them with just such material as had been recomm. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">346 Ein greater variety without increasing the cost, ealed strongly to the father who is often found he plan.

            <seg id="p386">347 Culinary Results. Because the girls from the start do this cooking for a family they are learning to meet the various little problems that enter into real home experience. They are therefore growing into practical cooks who can and do take full charge of the house-work during vacations, summer time, and when emergencies arise. That cooking is taught practically under the Crete Plan is not doubted by those who have seen the prizes and premiums won by girls trained under this method. The entire scheme tends to develop resourcefulness and keen judg - ment, two essential characteristics in a good cook. Influence of the Women The unconscious influence of the instructors upon the girls is quite noticeable. It could not be otherwise. All these women know the girls personally and are their friends. Wherever they meet the girls, on the street, in social circles, at church, they have a kindly greeting for them. The girls feel that they have real friends in their instructors who are helping them without any pecuniary remuneration. Kffeot I'pon Instructors. It is well known that association with young enthusiastic life hao a strong influence over maturer life to keep it more optimistic. The ladies who meet these girls find them enthusiastic, responsive to their touch. It is natural to desire appreciation and this the ladies get from the girls. The desire to shape things to conform to our ideas is a divine instinct to us all. Here the women have the opportunity of shaping, to some extent, the most precious material — humanity. tno wonder that instructors often say that "The work is a pleasure that they would regret very much if the time should come whin would have to give up their girls of the domestic science classes." Permanent i'. Rie reason why this plan has proved so permanent in the towns tried is because its vitality depends so largely upon mature sible women of the community. Teachers in public schools and go, they are not a self perpetuating body. The domestic i instructors have a standing and the members are influential community. If an instructor leaves the work, another is selected se who know the needs of the case. AH the machinery, equip - ment and methods of the whole p'an are ready for use in a few hours' notice. The whole plant may be closed for a month or a year and no jar or lost energy will result. If any woman in the community thinks she can do better than one of the instructors, she may be added to the faculty at once and set to work. Some one has said: "It is the most democratic plan of cooperation and most scientifically devised method of philanthropy yet discovered." </seg>
            <seg id="p387">348 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Opening for Club Women. The majority of the instructors in this plan are, as might be guessed, club women. Many women in clubs and those not in clubs, who have a little leisure are glad to be useful to their friends an1 neighbors. They do not care to spend all their energies on Browning Lin devising some method of beautifying the streets of their town, dable as these objects may be. Plere is an opening that may be worth investigating. The club a of Crete who are engaged in this work deem it one of their pleasurable efforts, not only because of the work with the girls, but some of them because of the help they have given other towns where they have been invited to present the Crete Plan to other clubs, and interested organizations. Suggestions Wanted. Eiy suggestions for the betterment of this plan, any device oi - ls that have proved permanantly successful and easily operated t equipment or expense to school boards will be welcomed by te superintendent. The largest and most important field, the one that should receive the greatest encouragement and help along industrial culture is found in our towns, villages and rural communities. The immediate aid. however, must come through the active philanthropy of the practi.-al </seg>
            <seg id="p388">JENNIE B. ADAMS, State Department of Education. The Nebraska Education Directory came into being in a unpretentious fashion. In the fall of 1890 State Superintendent Cloudy issued a little four page folder, listing the names of 125 towns, with number of teachers employed, the name of the superintendent or principal, and the secretary of the school board. As the years have passed and the educational system of the state has developed, the directory has grown into a bulletin of 7 2 pages and cover, still preserving, however, the size of the original folder, 3% x 6 inches, with the printed page 3 x 5 Vfe inches. With the increased usefulness and demand for the directory came the idea of binding it in something more substantial than paper, and in 1901 a few copies were bound in red morocco. Such was the demand for the "leather" bound directories that the number of copies bo bound was soon increased sufficiently to furnish one copy to each person furnishing data for the publication. It is the aim of the State Department to include in the directory such information concerning the public schools of the state as is most desired on the part of school people and others interested. No pains are spared to make it complete and valuable. It may be of interest to many to recall the names of some •who were teaching in Nebraska twenty-two years ago. We give heiv the names of thirty-five school men listed in the directory of 1890 - 1891, with location at time of compiling this report. May, 1912.

The only important change being the addition of it ion relative to the Nebraska State Teachers' Association. The directory for 1894-1895, contained no special changes or additions The publication for 1895-1896 was compiled by Superintendent H. R. Corbett. The State Department as listed therein included in addi - tion to the superintendent, F. A. Barton, deputy; Virginia Corbett, stenographer and secretary; Alex. Bentley, assistant; W. H.

In - stead of listing county superintendents and city superintendents and principals separately, all information concerning the schools of the state was given by counties. The names of the counties appeared in bold faced type, and directly below appeared the name and address of the county superintendent, with salary, total number of teachers in the county, and average monthly salary of all the teachers in the county. Then followed the. towns and cities of the county in alphabetical order, with the name of the principal or superintendent, salary, total number of teachers, number of special or substitute teachers, average monthly salary of teachers in that town or city, the number of years of high school work for which the school was approved, the school census for the current year, the enrollment for the preceding year, the number of months of school taught during the year, the name of the director or secretary and his salary for the year. In case a school district had one or more ward schools, similar information was included for them. </seg>

Walter Pate, Upland (City superintendent Alliance). EThis issue of the directory also gave the names of the various ct associations with the time and place of meeting for that year, the names and addresses of the officers. Announcement was made of the Superintendents' and Principals' Association. PThe directory for 1896-1897 was compiled by the state superin - ient, but published by J. H. Miller and sold for fifteen cents 1. In this issue the names and addresses of county superinten - ts were listed separately, by counties. Marks of reference were use.! indicate the term for which superintendents may have been re - elected. The graded schools were again listed alphabetically, irrespective of counties, and the number of credits for which the high school Ks approved was given rather than the number of years of high ool work carried. Pi 1897-1898 the State Department of Education consisted of the ing members: W. R. Jackson, state superintendent; C. F. deputy; Alex Bentley, assistant: Jennie B. Adams, stenographer; Munro, Sara L. Garrett, N. M. Graham, state board of examiners. No important change was made in the directory, but it was compiled and published by the state superintendent, and distributad by him free of charge, as in former years. The number of university credits to which high schools were entitled was omitted from the directory. The issue for 1898-1899 followed the same general plan as the one for the preceding year with but one addition of note — a column with figures indicating the number of years the superintendent or principal had occupied that given position. In 1899-1900 there was no special change, neither was there a change in 1900-1901. The directory for 1901-1902 recorded the following persons in the State Department of Education: W. K. Fowler, state super - intendent; J. L. McBrien, deputy; L. C. Harnly, assistant; Jennie B. Adams, stenographer; A. O. Thomas, D. C. O'Connor, Geo. E. Condra, state board of examiners.

A column was also added indi - cating under what subdivision the school district was organized. In the back of the directory v.as a small map of Nebraska, by counties, each county identified by number. Following this map was a table giving counties arranged consecutively by number assigned on map, name of county seat, and location of county as to congres - sional district, judicial district, senatorial district, and representative district. A few copies of this directory were bound in red morocco for special use. Ee directory for 1902-1903 contained no change other than the kind of special teachers in the graded schools in place of ng the number of special teachers. In 1903-1904 a list of the state officers was added. No changes were made in 1904-1905. EThe 1905-1906 education directory listed as members of the e Department, J. L.

A calendar for the current year was placed in the front of the directory, and a large political map of the state was folded and tipped in the back o' the leather bound directories. Enough copies were bound in red morocco to supply all superintendents and principals. The directory was made to pay for itself by inserting a number of pages of advertising from educational institutions and publishing houses. R 1906-1907, the table of county superintendents included a indicating the number of teachers required in the county. E 1907-1908, a table was inserted giving names and addresses state superintendents. The table of county superintendents larged by adding the number of districts in each county. No sing matter was included. In 1908-1909 the normal training high schools were indicated by an asterisk. In 1909-1910 the members of the State Department were changed to read: E. C. Bishop, state suptenntendent; Frank S. Perdue, deputy; W. D. Redmond, assistant; G. A. Gregory, normal training inspector; Jennie B. Adams, secretary; Martha C. Brandt, Elizabeth </seg>

LOne important addition was made to the table of graded school tistics by inserting a column giving the number of years of high school work for which the school was accredited at the University of Nebraska, or in case the school was not accredited, the number of years of high school work for which the school was approved by the State Department of Education under the free high school EIn 1910-1911 information was included concerning rural graded jols; and announcement of the first session of the Wayne State mal School was made, U. S. Conn, president, and including the ;r faculty members. In 1911-1912 the State Department of Education listed the following persons: Jas. E. Delzell, state superintendent; Rob't I. Elliott, deputy; Anna V. Day, assistant superintendent; G. A. Gregory, normal training inspector; C. M. Penney, examiner; Jennie B. Adams, secretary; Effie D. Hulbert, Helen G. Mathewson, Doris M.

Oaviness, Elizabeth Bettcher, Alice Florer, board of examiners for city certificates. Superintendent J. W. Crabtree served as state superintendent from January, 1911, to October 15, 1911, between the issues of the directory for 1910-1911 and 1911-1912. His resignation to accept the presidency of the state normal school at River Falls, Wisconsin, in October 1911, advanced the deputy, Jas. E. Delzell, on appoint - ment of the Governor, to the superintendency. No changes of note were made in the directory for 1911-1912. but it was financially self-supporting. The Chadron State Nor - mal school was added to the list of state normal schools and faculty members listed. Joseph Sparks was the first president. Since seven is regarded as the perfect number, it seems that every school district which has retained its superintendent, principal, or high school principal, and every superintendent and principal who has remained in any given position seven or more years should be placed on the roll of honor. According to the information as gathered in May, 1912, from the education directories issued since the beginning of the school year 1898-1899, the following 68 schools appear on the roll, the length of term for which any one or more superintendent or principal served being indicated by the figures following the name of the town: Albion, Atkinson, 8.

In an article in the Nebraska Teacher for April, 1912, Mr. \V K. Fowler said: "From the Nebraska Education Directory for the current school year we have taken the following information. Omitting ward prin - cipals and all special supervisors, we find there are in Nebraska 686 men and women holding city and town superintendencies, village and high school principalships. — A total of twenty persons or three per cent have served seven years or more in their present positions. There are 13, or two per cent of the 686, who are serving their sixth year; 21 or three per cent are serving their fifth year; 43, or six per cent are serving their fourth year; 79, or twelve per cent, are serving their third year; 182, or twenty-six per cent, may be termed at least biennials, for they are serving their second year; while the annuals, those who are serving their first year, number 326, or forty-eight per cent." Kfar as our records go, we know of but one who has taught in the jsition thirty years; three who have held their positions fifteen e years but less than twenty; twenty-three ten or more but less than fifteen; fifty-seven seven or more years but less than ten; a total of eighty-four who have served the same school district seven or more years. It will be seen that Supt. R. J. Barr heads the list with thirty yean' service in the Grand Island schools. So far as our reco .1 show, this 1s the longest term of service of any one person in any school. And Superintendent Barr is still at the helm in Grand Island. His able assistant is Principal John F. Matthews, now serving his fifteenth year in the high school. In the list of those now teaching, Sr. M. Benetta is now serving her fourteenth year as principal at Jackson: Miss Kathleen G. Hearn her thirteenth year as principal of the high school at Aurora; Supt. A. L. Caviness his twelfth year at Fair - bury; Supt. John Speedie his eleventh year at Benson; Supt. E. Clippinger his tenth year at Sutton. This makes a total of seven persons who are now serving ten or more years in their present positions. To this list may be added two superintendents who are now serving their ninth years in their present positions: Supt. W. L. Stephens, Lincoln, and Supt. W. W. Stoner, York; three who are serving their eighth years: Supt. P. P. Bentley, Alma; Supt. P. M. Whitehead, Gothenburg; and Supt. C. A.

"Were we to go into the records of ward principals, we would find many notable examples of long, faithful and valuable service, particularly in the cities of Omaha, South Omaha, Lincoln, and several d the socalled "third" cities of the state. For instance Omaha naa pensioned over twenty teachers who had served thirty-five years in her schools, several of them as principals for more than a score of years without a change of building.

Com bination Plan. At the meeting of the Reading Circle Board held April 17, 1909, it was decided to adopt a new plan for the work of 1909-1910. Instead of adopting one required book and one or more optional books as in the past, a combination of three books put up in a pasteboard box and neatly labeled, was adopted. By this combination plan excellent terms were secured for the teachers of the state, as will be seen by comparison of the list prices of the books and the combination rate secured. The books adopted are very timely since they deal with topics now receiving much attention. Interest in picture study has been gradually developing among our teachers, so much so that there seemed to be a demand for a book along that line. This demand has been, we believe, very satisfactorily met in the picture </seg>
            <seg id="p405">365 study book adopted. At present there is considerable agitation over the subject of public playgrounds. This is leading teachers to direct their attention to the educative value of plays and games for child - ren.

ENDORSEMENTS. The Nebraska Teacher and the Nebraska School Review endorsed as the official organs of the board for the year 1909-1910 on condition that they maintain a regular reading circle department. Items of interest to members of Nebraska teachers' reading circles Cll appear in the Reading Circle Department from month to &gt;nth. The World's Chronicle and Our Times were endorsed for sup - plementary reading in the schools. These weekly news magazines, especially prepared for school use, may be secured at very reasonable rates in combination with The Nebraska Teacher and the Nebraska School Review, respectively. THE THEORY OF TEACHING. Ehe THEORY OF TEACHING, by Dr. Albert Salisbury, President State Normal School at Whitewater, Wisconsin, is the study for this year. It is a book especially designed for beginners i study of educational psychology and pedagogy. Its purpose lay a foundation for such study, to open up the subject and </seg>
            <seg id="p406">366 tthe student a clear, broad, working view of the field of pedagogical Jht. PThis volume is the outgrowth of twenty years' experience in hing the elements of pedagogical theory and its application to the T work of the teacher. It contains a clear, well-proportioned and [era exposition of the fundamental principles of teaching. As Leonard says in the Journal of Pedagogy, - — -"From first to laat the book is noticeable for clearness of statement, aptness of illus - tration and freshness of treatment. To cause the student to compre - hend the full meaning of the statement that the laws of mental growth are laws of teaching requires the skill of a master. Dr. Salisbury displays this skill, and it deserves to be said that in making clear the relation between the principles of psychology and the laws of teaching he has been notably successful. In presenting the psychological truths which afford guidance to the teacher, and in tracing out the unquestioned application of these principles to the work of the school, the author's treatment of his subjects shows a distinct advance on other books of this nature. Although of neces - sity the author's discussion of his subject is condensed, there is vitality in every page of the book. Dr. Salisbury has performed useful service in writing it. The work is divided into three parts. The first part serves as a general introduction and takes up such topics as the meaning of theory, the nature and end of education, the teachers' material, that is, mind, treated in a concise and attractive manner. Part second is given up to elementary physiological psychology and logic. The author holds that a proper introduction to the principles of teaching involves considerable familiarity with the nervous system as a necessary preliminary to the comprehension and application of pedagogical laws. It also involves some acquaintance with elementary logic, t truth too often overlooked in the training of teachers. Psy - ology rests back on physiology and leads forward into logic and ethics. Part three sets forth the principles of teaching, and each is discussed under "applications" to the daily work of the teacher in the school room. This part is unusually attractive and instructive, and will prove invaluable to the working teacher. In the words of tWinship, — "It is a working book for working teachers by one of m." PICTURE STUDY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, Picture Study in Elementary Schools by Mrs. L. L. Wilson, Ph. D., Philadelphia Normal School, is desired to aid teachers in imparting to children a true appreciation of, and love for, the paintings by the world's great masters. Pictures of famous and beau - tiful paintings are already becoming widely used in elementary schools, and it is proposed to shape a course in picture study which shall carry the pupil through the chief schools of painting. </seg>
            <seg id="p407">367 The arrangement of the book is such that each school is represent - ed by four or five of its most famous examples, which will be studied with a view to the appropriateness of their subjects to the months of the school year. With each painter represented is a good biography, a bibliography of works of reference about him and his school, together with criticisms by famous men who have made his works their study. Suggestions as to the method to be pursued by the teacher are printed with each picture. "Picture study should be taken seriously. The effort is not for amusement, entertainment, or decoration alone; it has an aim and a purpose larger, broader, and more dignified than any of these. Picture study is with us, if yre read the times aright, because the influence of art reproduction is a vital power in our daily life. W« should be doing only half our duty by the boys and girls if we withheld from them this art life, which is in very truth their legiti - mate inheritance. Those who admit that gems of literature belong by right to the public school scholar, will have difficulty in arguing tha: pictures, the world's gems of art, shall not also find their place in the school-room." — Address by James Frederick Hopkins, Director of Drawing in Public Schools, Boston, in Perry Magazine. EDUCATION* BY PLAYS AXD (JAM is. Education by plays and games suggests the kind of aetivi'v 1-articularly adapted to children at different periods and the advantages to be derived from various kinds of play. The games, suggesting mental as well as physical development, must inevitably increase the effectiveness of the study period. They are analyzed to show what muscular and mental activities are called into play and to what ex - tent they stimulate or fix a knowledge of certain subjects, as mathe - matics, language, history, geography, etc. The author, Geor-je Ellsworth Johnson, who is now Superintendent of Play Grounds. Rp - Ei Parks, and Vacation Schools in Pittsburg. has dt years to the study of this work and is acknowledged a leading ity in America on this particular subject. (From the Journal of Education, Oct. 31, 1907): P)ne of the great educational movements of the day is that "f ounds in municipal life. The Journal of Education has had to say regarding the National Play-ground Association, witn which its editor is identified but the one thing it has never been able to say it can say now: 'There is an entirely satisfactory book on Education by plays and Games.' Mr. Johnson is the one man to write such a book. His interest dates back fourteen years, when he was a student at Clark University; his experience has been as superintendent of rural and suburban schools in Massachusetts, and he is now superin - tendent of playgrouds, recreation parks, and vacation schools of Pittsburg. His address at the meeting of the National Play-ground </seg>
            <seg id="p408">368 session. Out of his studies and experiences he has produced this eminently satisfactory book for the use of teachers and superinten - dents." (From J. F. Daniels, Chrm. The Colorado Teachers' Reading Circle Committee, March 6, 1909): "As a long-time member of the Colorado Teachers' Reading Circle Committee, I am often asked why we adopt certain books, and I have never been able to give more reasons with more pleasure than in the case of Education by Plays and Games by Johnson. PPhe educational interests in the book may be listed in a partial of subject matter as follows: — physical education, social tion, applied child study, moral training, education of delinquents defectives, play ground education, manual {training, vacation schools, significant transitions in administration and curriculum, the doctrine of interest in new applications, contributions toward the solution of problems in athletics, the boy problem, outdoor life, and many things that denote new tendencies in education. EThe positive value of a book of this kind is in the v'viil and pathetic application of current educational thought and action to e definite and specific field in which something is actually being &gt;, the results of which are not at all speculative. For reading e work the book is ideal because it is authoritative, is not incon - ent and academic, is scholarly, scientific and popular.'' READING CIRCLE &lt; RKIHTS. GRADES ADDED TO COUNTY CERTIFICATES. X'pon the approval and request of the proper county superint n - dent a credit of five per cent may be added to the grade earned on mi examination in theory and art before September 1, 1910, for satis - factory work done during the school year from September 1, 190», to June 1, 1910. in Salisbury's The Theory of Teaching. El credit of five percent may be added to the grade in drawing itisfactory work in both Wilson's Picture Study in Klementitrv Is and Johnson's Education by Plays and (lames.

            <seg id="p409">369 Pr such requirements as may be imposed by the state superintendent ublic instruction for the pursuance of and completion of reaJ - circle work, and attendance at teachers' associations and the county institute. The state superintendent has prescribed the following conditions governing re-issuance: "Holders of 'With Credit' or'With Honor' certificates who shall do the required amount of reading circle work and who shall meet the requirements of the county superintendent in attendance at institute E county associations will be entitled to the re-issuance of th'-ir ificates without examination. This makes such certificates, in ;t, permanent, or life certificates.'" HOW TO MAKE THE WORK A Kl'Ct'EHtt. r There should be a reading circle established in every village, town, city school in the state. Let the rural teachers meet with the teachers in the village and town schools when convenient. But some rural teachers will find it impossible to meet with the sections In the towns and villages. Therefore, we recommend the use of i ies - tions to be sent out by the county superintendents, on which a written review may be made once a month on the work for the month, or a general test on each book at the close of the year. Then two or three times during the year the rural teachers should be asked for papers on some professional topic treated of in the proscribed coi.rse. The same care should be demanded in the preparati M of this paper that the teacher would make in writing a production to be read before a teachers' association. Teachers should be given the privilege of con - sulting the books of the course or any other book that will give them information in the preparation of their papers. The papers thus prepared should be graded with the same care as that exercis. grading any examination papers. This means work for both te and superintendent. It likewise means intellectual and professional growth for both. )&gt;UTY OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT It is expected that each county superintendent will distribute copies of this circular at the institute, and secure as large a reading circle membership as possible. He should set apart a suitable time in his program for a discussion of the purpose and plan of the rea 1 - ing circle, and should make recommendations relative to home study for Ear. For the convienience of teachers, and to save time at the m- I he should arrange to have a supply of the books on hand beginning of the session. The county superintendent should report to the publishing houses at the close of the institute the number of books sold and remit for those copies for which cash has been received. Thereafter the </seg>
            <seg id="p410">370 county superintendent should report on or before December 1 of each rear the number of books sold and remit cash received. Final settle - ment should be made on or before March 1 of each year. CKRTIFICATES AND DIPLOMAS. PEach teacher taking up the work of the reading circle should the enrollment blank furnished therewith and return it to county superintendent. At the close of the year the county superintendent should satisfy himself, by examination or otherwise, that the work has been well done, fill out the Certificate of Credit on reverse side of the blank, and return it to the teacher. When the teacher has secured four certificates of credit for satisfactory work done, he should present them to the county superintendent, who will secure the diploma for him from the manager, the state superintendent. 1910-1911.

EThe Practical Pedagogy by S. M. Barrett, Professor of Pedagogy, :ral State Normal School, Edmund, Oklahoma, is designed to pr*&gt; - in a brief, concise manner the leading principles and rules of hing and to discuss their application to methods and management ic public schools. Only such rules and principles are presentei as the author has been able to apply successfully year after year in actual classroom work. EThis work, as its name implies, is a brief practical treats - ubjects presented and contains all the essentials in such a compass the average teacher can read ani understand without requiring Bervices of an interpreter. Be'ng born of experience, written t easy, interesting style, and vitalized by the true teaching spir-t. &gt;uld prove of the greatest value to the average teacher. Particular attention is given to the ethics of teaching, to the teacher's personal habits, neatness, appearance, and tactfulness, to industry, integrity, and cheerfulness, and to the important bearing these qualities have on the conduct of the school, and their influence on the young as well as the old. IVhile this book is of special interest and importance to the and inexperienced teacher, it covers the whole field of the teach - •ork in such a comprehensive manner as to make it invaluable classes of common school instructors.

Allen, Secretary of the Bureau of Municipal Research; formerly secretary of the New York Committee on the Physical Welfare of School Children. Civics and Health is a call to efficient citizenship, making individ - ual health and sanitary living a civic duty, and showing how to obtain the greatest efficiency in the school and the community, by establishing the best physical conditions. I. It shows the teacher that the causes of much poor work in the schoolroom, — inattention, nervousness, ill-nature,— are largely physical and preventable. Eye strain, adenoids, lack of knowledge or care in regard to eating, ventilation, exercise, and personal cleanli - ness are shown to be often responsible for what is regarded as a weak mind or surly disposition. II. It shows what is being done and what ev^ry teacher can a&gt; to overcome or improve the conditions referred to. EIII. It emphasizes the fact that better health means greater ciency and that co-operation is necessary to obtain it. No other book has covered just this field. Mr. Allen, the author, has had long experience as Secretary of the New York Committee on the Physical Welfare of School Children, and is thoroughly posted on to the result of the latest investigation and the most accurate scientirt knowledge on the subject upon which he writes. Moreover, he writes forcibly and clearly and succeeds in imparting his enthusiasm to the reader. It is emphatically a book for "getting things done." Sixteen state reading circles have already adopted this book, al - though it has been published but about a year. The adoptions in - clude Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, North Dakota, Soutn Dakota. Washington, Oklahoma, -New Mexico. Arizona, Wyoming, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Missouri. Letter on Civics and Health from Dean C. A. Fulmer, Nebraska Wesleyan University, University Place, Nebraska: "I have read Allen's Civics and Health through and parts of it several times through. It is the best book on the subject I ever saw. In fact there is no other book like it at all. Every teacher in this country ought to read it and then follow out its suggestions in so far as she may be able. It seems to me that this book teaches a gospel that every Nebraska teacher ought to take up and spread throughout her Kt. Its suggestions if carried out would revolutionize present on school sanitation and hygiene entertained by the majority of re and people." January 7, 1910. THE EVOLUTION OF DODD. By William Hawley Smith. EThe Evolution of Dodd we have one of the best inspirational along pedagogical lines ever written. As told, this story is a treatment of the development and growth of a boy's character. </seg>
            <seg id="p413">373 This boy, a characteristic type of that great class of individuals which constitutes so complex a problem for society, either of the home, the school, or the state, affords just the material needed for a full an&lt;l broad study of human nature. In this evolution the influence and the importance of the public school system is clearly set forth. The author, keenly alive to the situation and wholly master of his subject, has told in a graphic and forceful way the experiences and struggles of Dodd. This realistic delineation of the development of a boy's character will, we believe, not only interest teachers and parents, but will also prove exceedingly helpful to them. Six months devoted to a thought - ful study of this book, a study supplemented by questions which will lead to a live discussion of the many important points involved, cannot fail to appeal to all teachers and bring about a more profound 'lnderstanding of the great aim and true purpose of all education. •School is not a preparation for life — it is life." The life presented in this work divides naturally into four parts: Part I covers the first six years of Dodd's life, skillfully setting forth the influences already at work and showing clearly the verv early appearance of strong traits and tendences. Part II treats of his life during the period spent in the gm showing how open to influence and suggestion is the child mind at this Ert ill deals with the high school period. This is the time for -the hero-worshiping age — where the need for the guiiai: g personality is keenly felt.

READING CIRCLE AHD CERTIFICATION g ginning in November, 1911, from two to five of the examina - estions on theory will be based upon the reading circle work ed in Colgrove's The Teacher and the School, and at the end school year one full set of puestions on theory will be baaed on this reading circle book. The rules and regulations for the city state certificate when com - plete and put in definite form will provide for elementary history of education, the history of education, and moral training as subjects for certain forms of city certificates, making it mean something to rural, village and town teachers to take the reading circle work in Winship's E American Educators, and the city teachers to take the reading work in Hoyt's Studies in the History of Modern Education, and teachers to take the work in Cabot's Ethics for Children. It is believed that making the reading circle work more of a factor in the certification of teachers will not only add interest to to the reading circle work itself, but will aid teachers in equipping themselves for the most efficient work.

KKAIHXG CI!tri,E CliKDITS The state superintendent and the reading circle board recommend that the county superintendent award each year a credit of three per ci nt a book to any pupil in the seventh or eighth grades who shall read from one to five of the books recommended by the reading circle board for the grammar grades, and shall submit to the county super - intendent a satisfactory review of the same. Such credits may be ap - plied by the county superintendent, at his discretion, to the grades earned by the pupil in reading, geography, grammar, history, and phy - siology, in the examination for the eighth grade diploma; provided, that not more than fifteen credits may be earned in any one year; and provided further, that in no case shall more than five credits be applied on any one of the subjects named. ■Seventh and eighth grade pupils should preserve their reading &gt; certificates and present them to the county superintendent whan register for the eighth grade examination. ■The county superintendent is urged To purchase for the use of &gt;upils In his county the pupils' reading circle certificates prepared le reading circle board. PUPILS' KKAIHNG t'UM'LK ( KRTIFK'ATKS I The Reading Circle Board has prepared a form of pupil's library Scate, to be awarded to pupils above the third grade for the eare - eading of each book and submission of a satisfactory written re - of the same. The number of library certificates granted a pupil ig a year is limited to five. The regular pupils' reading circle le is planned for three years, but arrangement is made for g t for continuing the work for two additional years. BChe plan in brief, is this: The county superintendent supplies teacher in his county with a book of blank pupil's library certi - s. When any pupil above the third grade has read any book imended by the Reading Circle Board for school library purposes Credits Added to Kighth Grade Kxaniination* &lt;ira&lt;l«'s </seg>
            <seg id="p424">384 Eany year), the teacher will give such pupil a blank certificate he may prepare the written review called for on the reverse side of certificate, and fill out the face of the certificate as directed. The her then fills out the stub, signs the certificate and gives It to the rt'hen the pupil has secured five of these certificates, on applica - the county superintendent will issue him a library certificate in which to bind the five certificates earned. The county sup - erintendent will make proper record of the issuance of the library C:ifleate cover, both in his office and on the certificate cover for the efit of the pupil. During the second year, when five additional books have been read and reviewed, on application, the county superintendent will at - tach a blue seal to the certificate cover. The county superintendent keeps a record of this in his office, and also makes proper record on the library certificate cover. Likewise, for reading and reviewing five additional books, the third year, a gold seal will be awarded, and proper record made. State Record and Permanent Binding. — If the pupil so desires. he may at the close of the third year of reading send his fifteen library certificates and cover, with fifteen cents in postage (to cover actual cost), to the state superintendent who will make the proper record in his office and on the certificate cover, place such certificate and cover in a leather binding, and return to the pupil, who will then have a permanent record of the fifteen books read and reviewed during the three-year course. Ethe pupil cares to continue his reading during the one or two before he completes the eighth grade, he may earn five addi - certificates each year, and secure additional seals from the superintendent. Byou have not seen these pupils' library certificates write to te superintendent for sample. RrXX&gt;M*IKI)KI) LIST OK HOOKS FOR SCHOOL LIKKARIKS AM» ITIMI.S' HUHM CIRCLE COURSES. Pit is suggested by the Reading Circle Board that books purchased year from school library funds include first the books recom - mended for school year 1912-1913. Additional purchases may include the books recommended for previous years. We print in this year's bulletin the lists of books approved for school library purposes. We give with the title and author of each book the name of the publisher, the price at which the book is listed by the publisher, and the net price at which the book will be furnished by the University </seg>
            <seg id="p425">385 Lincoln Depository. The University Publishing Company also agrees to prepay tha freight to any station in Nebraska on all orders of books amounting to $5.00 or more. On orders amounting to less than $5.00, the purchaser must pay the transportation charges from Lincoln only. Books may be ordered from any or all the approved lists of books. SCHOOL LIBRAKIKS Ordering Books. ▲ record of all books ordered should be kept by the teach;r. She should make two copies of the list, or better still, she can use a sheet of carbon paper, write her order with an indelible pencil, and make a duplicate of it to keep. In writing the order she should see that the address is quite plain, that the shipping station is given, and she should specify whether the books are to be sent by express or freight. Freight will be prepaid by the University Publishing Company, Lincoln, on all orders amounting to $5.00 or more. PVhen the books arrive check off the bill as you unpack them. ' mistake has been made in filling the order, this is the time 10 f it. Send back any book which is defective, or which is not you ordered. Accessioning. It is evident that there must be some record kept of the books in the library. The simplest form is what is called the accessian record. This is a numerical record of all the books in the library, giving such items of information about the book as author, title, pub - lisher, and price. Accession books, ruled for proper entry, with instructions for use, containing space for 1,000 volumes, can be bought of the Library Bureau, 156 Wabash Ave., Chicago, for $1.00. Follow exactly the directions given in the introduction to the accession book. Be sure to give a line to each volume. Be sure to write the number in the book, on the first right hand page following the title page. If an accession book cannot be obtained, get a square, cloth - bound notebook, and rule the left hand page in columns for accession number, author, and title, and the right hand page in columns for lcpeated accession number, publisher, name of dealer, cost. anJ volume. Number the lines consecutively, beginning with 1. Use one line for each volume. The number of the line and the accession number will then be the same. The school should own a rubber stamp reading: School Library No. Distrct No Ac. No </seg>
            <seg id="p426">386 P These stamps will cost in the neighborhood of 25 cents. This srship stamp should be used on the title page of the book, and accession number written in as soon as the book is entered in accession record. Preparing the Book* for the Shelves. When the books have been entered in the accession record, the next step is to provide them with book pockets and book cards. The imprinted book pockets may be bought from the Library Bureau for 25 cents per hundred, and the cards for 13 cents per hundred. Or the book pockets may be made out of heavy manila paper. We give here cut showing pattern and dimensions. Make exactly according to dimensions given, which will make the pocket four times the siie of the cut. Fold A over B on dotted lines a b. Fold edges A over back on B on dotted lines c d. Paste back of B with folded-over sections on inside front cover of borfk. Stamp the name of the school and the access'on number of the book across it, using the rubber stamp suggested above. The pocket is now ready for the book card. This book card may be made from plain card board, and should be exactly 2% x 4% inches. On the top line write the surname of the author, on the line below the title, and in the upper right hand corner the accession number. The card is then placed in the pocket, and whenever the book is in the library the card is in the book pocket. Charging the Books.

            <seg id="p427">387 teacher removes the book card from the pocket, writes on it the date and the child's name, gives him the book and retains the book card. At the end of the day she arranges the book cards alphabet - ically by author, and sorts them in with the book cards of other books previously given out. When the pupil brings the book back, she looks under the author's name in the fit? of book cards at her desk, finds the card for the book returned, removes it from the file and puts it back in the book pocket. The book is then dis - karged, and when it has been looked through to see that it is in od condition, it can be put on the shelves. Care of the School Library. Satisfactory book cases for the school room can be made of almost any lumber, stained or painted. Doors are preferred, but not absolutely necessary. The shelves should be 8 inches wide; the bottom shelf should be 6 inches from the floor, and there should be supports at least every three feet. If the shelves are not mov - able, the bottom one should be 14 inches from the one above it tallow space for the big books; the space between the others should 10 inches. Ele careful not to crowd the books on the shelves. The boo.ts [ be* kept upright. Satisfactory supports can be made by cover - ricks with denim or any heavy cloth. Metal book supports s bought for 10 or 15 cents apiece. Bie following suggestions on the care of books are taken from rmal School quarterly: "Do not crowd the books on the shelves or allow them to lean over; both methods injure them. Never hold a book tight when opening it, and never bend the covers backward; either is likely to break the back. The following are the directions for opening a new book, or a newly bound one: F'Hold the book with its back on a smooth table; let the fro.it down, then the other, holding the leaves in one hand while open a few leaves at the back, then a few at the front, and so on, alternately opening back and front, gently pressing open the sections till you reach the middle of the volume. Do this two or three times and you will obtain the best results. Cut the leaves with a flat paper knife having a smooth, blunt edge, being care - ful to cut well into the joint. "Never turn the leaves with moist or soiled fingers. Do not turn them in any way that might tear, soil, or crumple them. Be careful not to close the book in such a way as to crease the leaves. The injury to the leaves of large dictionaries and atlases is entirely from careless handling. Keep them on tables from which they are not to be moved, and then make a point of teaching the child - ren how to handle them DroDerly </seg>
            <seg id="p428">388 K Never pile open books on top of each other, or lay them face rard or write on them. "Never turn down leaves, use book marks. "Never close a book on anything thicker than a thin card. "Do not mark any book that you do not personally own. "Heavy books should never be rested on the fore edges for any length of time, and very large ones should always be shelved on their sides. "Never let books fall; it injures the covers, and loosens the biiidiiiKS- "Heat is injurious to the bindings and sunlight fades them. Bin mending books never use mucilage or glue, and use paste Biy. Library paste may be made from the following recipe and kept in a fruit jar: 1 tablespoon of alum. % pint of flour 1 quart of water. Oil of cloves. Mix the flour with a small quantity of the water, stir in'o a cream; cook for 20 minutes. Dissolve the alum in the rest of the water, bring it to a boil, stir in the cream 3 minutes before it is through cooking. Stir while cooking. Add 20 drops of oil of cloves when you take it off. Keep in a closed jar. "The library should be cleaned once a year. Carry the books to the open window where the air draws outward, and take a book firmly in each hand strike the two together two or three times and finish by dusting lightly all over. Holding the book firmly during the process prevents the blows from loosening the binding. Always dust away from the hinge, and do nothing that might brush the dust in between the leaves. Taking care of the books according to these directions preserves them longer. EKeep the books in good repair. When they come loose in the ; put them aside for rebinding. A rebound book lasts longer &amp; book in trade binding and it is economy to rebind a book rty cents instead of replacing it later for 75 cents or a dollar." </seg>

            <seg id="p443">The opinion still obtains that Nebraska has the best free text book law in the United States. No changes have been made in the law or in the rulings and decisions relative to its operation for a number ot years. The exposition of the free text book law given in Superin - tendent J. L. McBrien's biennial report, 1908, is so complete that I am pleased to give herewith an EXCERPT FROM THK TWENTIETH BIENNIAL REPORT. FThe argument which State Superintendent Thompson made in his biennial report, 1878, for free text books was a voice crying in wilderness to prepare the way for our splendid free text-book law passed by the legislature of 1891 under the administration of State Superintendent A. K. Goudy, to whom the law will always stand as a monument. Hear the argument advanced by Superintendent Thompson in behalf of free text-books: Ee plan of furnishing text-books by the d strict as other school b of instruction is furnished, is rapidly growing into favcr in t and west. For this plan is claimed: P"l. The necessary books are ready at the beginning of the term no pupil is kept back by waiting unt'l he can send to the store his books. "2. Every pupil has the right 'kind of books and enough cf th^m. ■3. Absolute uniformity is secured at once and can be kept up it difficulty. ■ 4. Needed changes in books (an be made without additional since when one lot is worn out a different kind can be bought ut additional expense above what the same kind would cost. KMore pupi's come to school where books are free, and thus efits of the school are extended to a larger number. Pupils stay in school where they do not have to buy books. "6. It is much cheaper. The books can be bought in quantities at wholesale, at a reduction of from 20 to 40 per cent below retail prices. Also, experience show that books last longer when owned by the district than when they are the property of individual pupils, partly because they are kept in the school house and free from the wear and tear of home use, and of carriage to and fro; and partly because the books are used until worn out, being used by several pupils in succession. A careful collation of several hundred experiments shows that when the books are furnished by the district, the whole Epense for books for a series of years will be less than half what it tuld have been under the plan of individual ownership. "7. Where free text-books are furnished, if a man moves into the district his children can go into the school at once, without addi- </seg>
            <seg id="p444">404 Pil expense, and when be leaves for a different locality he does carry with him a large number of text-books for which he will no use in his new place of residence. "These and other things are claimed by the friends of free text-books, and I must say that the experience of districts that have tried the plan in this state, goes far to confirm them. "In the report for 1877, sixty districts were returned as having this plan on trial. As nearly as can be ascertained at the present time, about seventy-five districts are furnishing free text-books. In the month of May a circular of inquiry was addressed to a number of these districts, asking the following questions: "1. How long have you been furnishing free text-books? "2. What reduction from retail prices did you get when you purchased your books? "3. What is the average cost to the district per annum, per pupil? "4. How does the plan work? "5. What difficulties do you meet "To the first question the answers varied from 'one' to 'five years.' Ko the second question, the answers show that an average on from retail prices was made; of about 25 per cent; but some i 40 per cent off. "To the third question, the answers varied from 50 cents per pupil, per year, to $1.25. gro the fourth question, one reports ' a failure,' another 'badly,' naining eighteen of the twenty rrporting, speak of the plan as g 'admirably,' 'well,' 'popular with teachers,' 'not opposed by g,' 'great advantage,' 'works very satisfactorily,' perfect success,' not have had a school without it,' etc., etc. "To the fifth query, one answers, 'pupils do not like soiled books, and do not take care of them;' others answer, 'no serious difficulty,' 'principal difficulty is the choice of books, and perhaps the total de - pravity of some pupils,' 'to induce teachers to feel responsible for the care of the books; this ought to be stipulated in the contract,' 'id difficulties,' etc., etc. E'Of the two districts that report 'failure and dissatisfaction,' furnished books only to those too poor to buy them; and are unable to tell the expense of the experiment, showing that matter was not carefully managed. As it is, 90 per cent of all -lets reporting are highly pleased with the plan. E Suggestions. — (1) Districts that now furnish or contemplate ling free text books, should present the question at the annual g, and have a tax voted for the purpose. E"(2) Buy all books needed at the same time and from the same sr, and thus get the best reduction from retail prices possible; this Id not be less than 25 per cent, and in some cases may be more. K(3) Provide a strong book case or closet in the school house. at can be locked and in which the books can be stored for safe </seg>

SUPERINTENDENT H. R. CORBETT. In the Fourteenth Biennial Report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to the Governor of Nebraska (1895-6), Superin - tendent H. R. Corbett gives the result of a special investigation of the results and popularity of the Free Textbook Law. I give herewith a few of the questions submitted by him to the county and city superintendents, principals, and country school teachers, and the Elies received thereto. In some cases I include comments made by lerintendent Corbett in his report. Is the average condition and care of books better or worse than it was* in the same schools under individual ownership? Of the 164 </seg>
            <seg id="p448">408 twers received, eighty-six indicate •"tetter," thirty-five "worse," and y-three indicate no difference. Does the free text-book system lead to any increase in school en - rollment? Of the 172 answers, 129 say "yes," thirty-seven "no," and six are doubtful. Does it promote regular attendance? Of the 161 answers, eighty - nine answer "yes," fifty-eight "no," and fourteen are doubtful. Is there any marked decrease in entire cost of books to the com - munity as a whole?" Of the 168 answers, 128 are "yes," thirty-throe no," and seven are doubtful. Do school boards as a rule furnish books more promptly and in sufficient quantities? Is the supply more full and prompt and satis - factory than when pupils furnish the books? Of the 176 answers. 161 are "yes," twelve are "no," and thiee are doubtful. Ehat means are employed for securing good care of books? the significant answers to this question are the following: ar inspections, books being inspected and their condition being recorded by the teacher." (This is one of the most effective means, and if systematically done requires but little time.) "Books num - bered and charged to pupils in text-book register." "Tact and care on the part of the teacher." (This suggestion gives the key to the situation.) "Pupils required to purchase books lost or carelessly in - jured." (A requirement eminently proper under the law.) "The covering of books." (A fresh new paper cover at the beginning of the term will go a long way toward making the books uniform and attractive.) "Careful use of bookcases." "Care insisted upon by Kiool boards." "Talks to teachers in institutes and associations." ircular to teachers." In conclusion, Superintendent Corbett says: "I have taken pains in compiling the answers received to report favorable and unfavorable replies with equal fairness. My desire has been to enable the reader of this summary to gain from it in brief fmpass an accurate idea of the esteem in which the law is held by o school people of the state. "These are its advantages, briefly stated: It is a logical sequence to the free school idea, diminishing still further the barrier between rich and poor, removing an obstacle which stands in the way of attend - ance of the very class the common schools are designed to reach; it reduces largely the cost of books to the community as a whole; it enables the management of the school to secure a more satisfactory and seasonable supply of books and materials; when properly administered ft freely permits the use of books that are needed for study at home and helps the teacher to inculcate habits of neatness and care in the use of books. "The chief objections to the system come from two sources : (1) </seg>
            <seg id="p449">409 Ees where carelessness in the administration of the law has resulted unnecessary destruction of books, and in careless habits on the t of the pupils." "I consider it safe to affirm that wherever proper attention has been paid to the administration of the law, the results have been highly gratifying to school authorities, teachers and patrons. It is furthermore safe to assume that having once come to understand the advantages of this logical extension of the free school idea, the people of Nebraska will not willingly go back to the system formerly in use." SUPERINTENDENT W. R. JACKSON". Bthe Fifteenth Biennial Report (1897-8) Superintendent \V. R. n gives the result of his inquiries and observations as follows: The free text-book law has been in operation in this state since 1891. Of the 6,703 school districts in Nebraska, 5773 own and fur - nish text-books to the pupils free of cost. In many districts it is mutually agreed among the patrons of the school not to take advantage of the provisions of the law. While ill within the district arc satisfied with this plan, they may. of course, furnish the books individually, or the district may plan to secure books at contract price and sell to pupils at cost, but if anyone living within the district demands frae text-books for his children who attend school, the law not only "em- Ewers" the school board to furnish them, but makes it "their duty purchase all text-books necessary (or the schools of such districts." One of the features which commends our present law to the favorable consideration of the taxpayers is the provision regulating the cost of books as follows: "That the contract price of such books shall not exceed the lowest price then granted to any dealer, state, county, township, school district, or ether individual or corporation in' the United States, to be determined as hereinafter provided; and provided further, that such contract shall guarantee to such districts any further reduction that may be granted elsewhere during the life of such contract." It will be seen by the above extract that school districts in this state, regardless of siz3 or financial ability, may obtain text-books on as favorable terms as the largest and most influential district or corporation in the United States. Another strong feature may be roted. The law does not restrict the district from purchasing books from one firm or company. This gives great latitude in the selection of books and is a very desirable feature. The law as a whole is a good one, perhaps one of the best found in any state, and scarcely needs any amendments. About twenty of the leading book companies of the United States have filed bends, together with sworn statements of their lowest contract prices for books. Some districts have contracts with five or six of these companies and thus are </seg>
            <seg id="p450">410 The advantages and arguments in favor of free text-books may be summed up in the following: Reports having reached this office that our present free text-bcok law is not giving satisfaction, it was thought expedient to canvass the views of the people generally throughout the state for the purpose of ascertaining the exact status of this matter, thus enabling me to recommend such measures for the consideration of the legislature as might be best for the educational interests of the state. For this pur - pose the following questions were submitted to school officers, prin - cipals, and superintendents throughout the state. PI. In your judgment, has this law had the effect of improving school work in your community? 2. Are the people of your community satisfied with it? 3. Has it in your judgment, had the effect of reducing the cost of school books? 4. Would you favor a change in the law? If so, in what respect? B5. Would you favor a repeal of the law altogether and a return le old plan of the individual purchase; that is, where the pupils hase the books themselves? 6. Additional remarks and suggestions. PI have received replies from over 3,000 persons. Of this number, 5 out of 132 town and city superintendents favor a repeal of the ent law. But one or two county superintendents are opposed to law as it stands, and a vast majority of school officers reporting for their districts say they are in favor of the present law. Eighty Ecent of the school officers answer the first question in the affirm - re; 83 per cent are satisfied with present conditions; 76 per cent srm me that the present law results in a reduction in the cost of books; 28 per cent favor some change in the law, but the changes pro - posed are almost as numerous as the persons suggesting mem, many fggesting points already covered by the law; while 18 per cent favor repeal of the law altogether, the reason given by the major portion that "individual ownership would result in better care of books." Under "additional remarks and suggestions," the statements made Euld indicate that in some districts roo little care is taken in the care text-books; while on the whole these remarks would indicate that the isent law is about as satisfactory as it would be possible to make it. kit the end of another two years, in the Sixteenth Biennial Report •-1900), Superintendent Jackson says, relative to the free text - law: Kie law enacted in 1891 providing that the text-books for use in blic schools of the state shall be furnished free to the pupils is force and effect. It has not been amended in any way. The purpose of the law is to secure to the people of each district the widest latitude in the management of their schools. The object of the law in authorizing the school district to contract for the needed </seg>
            <seg id="p451">411 text-books was two-fold. 1st, to insure to the district the right to purchase the books at the lowest wholesale rates offered on such books anywhere In the United States, thus securing to the district the benefit of universal competition throughout the country, and 2nd, to protect the people of the district against the expense incident to too frequent changes. Preparatory to entering into a contract under the law, the pub - lishers must first have with the State Superintendent of Public In - struction a sworn statement of their lowest wholesale prices of books, and must be willing to execute a bond for the protection of school dis - tricts contracting for same. By this provision of the law, ' each district secures not only the benefit of competition in this state, but in all other states where said publisher's books are used. The pro - tection of the people of a district aeainst too frequent changes in text-books is sought to be secured by the provision of the law author - izing school boards to enter into contracts with their publishers for their books for a term of years. I might add that experience has shown that teachers moving from one district to another frequently feel it incumbent upon them to discard some of the text-books in use for others of the same kind but of different authorship. This disposition often exists where there is a large supply of the text it is proposed to throw out in good condition; and where the change is made, under such circumstances particularly, it results in large expense to the people of the district. The correct procedure for any school board, in my opinion, is to exercise discrim - inating care in making its first selection of books; being solicitous to get the best the market affords at the lowest obtainable price, then to keep its teachers informed from year to year as to the names of the books selected in the different grades, so that when handing in their requisition to the school officer charged with keeping up the supplies, none but the regularly adopted books will be called for. Of course, this suggestion is not intended to apply where new studies are added to the course, or where the books in use need to be supplemented in t judgment of the teacher, acting with the board, in order to secure best results. DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT AND OFFICIAL DECIS Damage to. — If any person shall wilfully and maliciously injure or deface any church edifice, school house, dwelling house, or other building, its fixtures, or books, or appurtenances, or shall commit any nuisance therein, or shall purposely and maliciously commit any tres - pass upon the enclosed grounds attached thereto, or any fixtures placed thereon, or any enclosure or sidewalk about the same, such person shall be fined in any sum not exceeding one hundred dollars. — Section ■Chapter XIV, Criminal Code, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for </seg>
            <seg id="p452">412 Must Furnish. — Subdivision 18 of the School Laws is mandatory, and it is not within the authority of the annual district meeting to vote not to furnish text-books; under this law any patron of the district, by the proper legal proceedings could compel the district board to furnish his chHdren, pupils in the school, the necessary text-books, notwithstanding any action or failure to act on the part of the district meeting. Some patron of the district should apply to the district court in behalf of the district for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to furnish to the children of the district the necessary text-books. See the case of Ambrose Affholder et al. v. State of Nebraska ex rel. Peter MrMullen, 51 Nebr. 91. In this case, in the district court of Burt county, Peter McMullen made application for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel Ambrose Affholder and others, consisting of the school board of district No. 58 of said county, to purchase and furn M to the children of school age of said district the necessary text-books in accordance with the free text-book law. An alternative writ was issued, and for a return thereto the school board interposed the defense that said act was unconstitutional. The writ was issued as prayed, and the school board appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court sustained the district court. A writ of mandamus will not issue where it is not witnin the power of the respondent lawfully to comply, or where it would otherwise be unavailing. 46 P'umls for Purchase. — Text-books may be paid for out of any funds nd belonging to the general fund, to the incidental fund, or to a especially provided for this purpose. Includes Supplies.- — In passing upon the constitutionality of the free text-book law, in discussing the word "supplies," the following language is used by the Judge rendering the decision: "We do not think the term 'text-books' should oe given a technical meaning, but that it is comprehensive enough and does include globes, maps, charts, pens, ink, paper, etc., and all other apparatus and appliances which are proper to be used in the school in instructing the youth, and we conclude, therefore, that the act under consideration is not broader than its title, and the term 'school supplies' found in the tenth section of the act is not foreign to the term 'text-books' found in the title of the act, but is germane to and comprehended and included within the term 'text-books.' " Leaning Books. — The law provides that text-books shall be loaned tc pupils while pursuing a course of study in the schools. It is the duty of the board of education to place books at the disposal of pupils who need to study in the evenings. If, however, in the judgment of the teacher and the board, pupils of certain classes cannot study profitably outside of school hours, it is proper to place reasonable restrictions upon the use of books at home by such pupils or classes. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">413 Kare the property of the district, to be used in schools held the district. Pupils Responsible for. — Section &amp;, subdivision 18 of the School Laws, provides that all books purchased by the district beard shall be held as the property of the district and loaned to pupils of the school while pursuing a course of study therein, free of charge: but the district board shall hold such pupils responsible for any damage to. loss of, or failure to return such books at the time and to the person that may be designated by the board at such district. SUPERINTENDENT \V. K. FOWLEK. A bill was introduced into the legislature of 1903 to repeal the free text-book law. After a brief discussion in a committee the bill was reported for indefinite postponement. Experience proves that, where proper care is exercised by the school board and the teacher, this law is popular and satisfactory; but it becomes a detriment and a nusiance whenever pupils carelessly soil, mark, deface, or destroy these books. See that teachers appeal to the pride of their pupils; that they insist on habits of neatness and cleanliness; that they make a regular inspection of the books at least once a month — no other agency is more effective than a regular book inspection. Teachers should also hold pupils responsible for preserving and returning books in good condition by a proper use of the Permanent Text-Book Record. School boards should also furnish each school room with a book-case. We urge upon school officers the importance of furnish - ing their schools with up-to-date text-books. You should no mire expect pupils and teachers to work with text-books that are behind the times than you should think of throwing aside the self-binder and checkrower to return to the implements used by your fathers. Modern text-books are as necessary as modern farming implements. Relative to the difference in cost of text-books, when purchased by parents individually and by the district as a whole, I will say tbat under normal conditions the average cost per child (including children from the kindergarten to tha end of the high school course i for books when purchased by the individual parent would not be less than two dollars per year. Figuring on the enrollment in the schools of tiie state for the past five years and the amount expended for text-books and pupils' supplies for the same time, an average of sixty - four cents per child per year is the cost under the plan of district purchase. The number of districts in the state is 6666; the number of dis - tricts furnishing free text-books is 6066. The 600 districts not now furnishing free text-books could be compelled to do so upon complaint by any one tax payer in each of said districts, provided it is within the power of the district to furnish said books. </seg>
            <seg id="p454">414 PRESENT STATUS PThe free text-book law still stands with but one amendment •eto, carrying its provisions to metropolitan cities which the original failed to do. Let it be said, however, that Omaha, the only metropolitan school district in the state, long before the enactment of our free text-book law, found the free text-book system a policy- Ill behalf of public economy. la the last legislature a bill was introduced proposing to change but one word in the law, making the law optional rather than mandatory. The legislative committee of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association, consisting of one member from each congressional district and three members at large, speaking through its chairman, the Rev. L. P. Ludden, appealed to the legislature March 14, 1907, for the indefinite postponement of this bill in the following language: Eiis committee with all members present at its meeting Febru - 1907, in the office of the state superintendent at Lincoln, d the following resolution: Eolved. That it be the sense of this committee that Nebraska best free text-book law in th« United States, and that we are illy and unqualifiedly opposed to any amendment thereto.. Ei view of the foregoing facts, we appeal to your honorable to Indefinitely postpone H. R. 409, just reported on the first ; list. ■ gave this appeal by said committee my official endorsement in words: Gentlemen of the House of Representatives I was present at the meeting above referred to and gave the above resolution my official endorsement. I hand you herewith a copy of our present free text-book law with the opinions of three of my predecessors in support of this law. Note what State Superin - tendents Corbett, Jackson and Fowler said in behalf of this law Note also the decisions of the Supreme Court as to when districts must furnish free text-books and when they are exempt, pages 6 and 7 of said circular. Ki it said to the wisdom of the members of the House of Repre - ves that said bill was indefinitely postponed by a vote of ninety - &gt; one. Supt. H. R. Corbett was the first state superintendent to make an extensive study of the workings of the free text-book law, which was continued by Superintendents Jackson and Fowler. To Mr. Corbett belongs the honor of urging upon teachers, school officers and IiupiU a proper care of school property, and especially of text-bocks. </seg>

            <seg id="p456">FREE TEXT BOOKS 415 CARE OF TEXT-BOOKS "Under our present text-book law this subject is one of the greatest possible importance in every school. Reports show that where proper care is exercised by ths school board and teacher (es - peccially by the latter) the free text-book law is popular and satis - actory; but it becomes a detriment and a nuisance wherever pupils are carelessly allowed to soil, mark, deface, or destroy the books. If the law is a failure, it is probably the fault of the teachers or the board. "The conditions are not the same in all schools. The methods to be employed must, therefore, be determined by the teacher's judg - ment and tact. The following suggestions will probably be found helpful: "1. Appeal to the Pride of the Pupils. — Say they do not want tbe superintendent and visitors to find them more careless, dirty, destructive, etc., than other schools. Such visitors might wrongly conclude that they were not well taught at home. This would reflect upon their parents and their homes, of which they are so proud, etc. Tact and ingenuity will find many -vays of reaching pupils. If the teacher can once secure a sentiment in favor of good care of books, the work is half done. "2. Book Inspections. — Every school should have a regular in - spection of books monthly, or at some other stated period. Make t systematic, but arrange so as to suit the teacher's convenience. It need not take long, and can be done before or after school, at recesses r.r noon, or in part at least, durng school hours, as most satisfactory. (For method of recording, see "Use of Text-Book Record.") No other agency is more effective than the regular book inspection. It offers the teacher the best means of knowing the condition of all books; but its chief use is to keep the children reminded of their duty in this matter. The teacher should often allude incidentally to the next inspection. Of course all this requires a little thought and time, but not much, after all, when results are considered. "3. New Books. — If, unfortunately, books in your school are in a bad condition, make it a special point to preserve the new books purchased; then as the old ones wtar out a better condition of things will be brought about in tfme. "4. Habits of Neatness. — It is as important to teach children neatnees in their habits as to teach them reading and arithmetic, nor are they too young to learn about duty to the public and the responsibility involved in the use of public property. The free text - book plan gives the teacher better opportunities for this kind of culture than does individual ownership. Is not this a nobler motive than simply the selfish interests of pupils and parents to protect their own property? Yet the principal objection to the law is that it takes 15 </seg>
            <seg id="p457">416 away this selfish interest; and where teachers and school bcarda are so careless as to remove the better motive, it is no doubt true that the selfish motive is better than none. Show that in your school and under your influence the better method is more effective. "5. Covering Books. — Advantages. — First, saving of books; second, greater cleanliness; third, uniformity of appearance — pupils Ci likely to complain that books are eld and worn. The cover should renewed whenever a different pupil begins using it. "Do not allow pupils to deface covers. Allow no marks except name of pupil and name of book. "Material. — All books should be covered with strong, smooth paper. In the smaller cities and towns suitable material can usually be secured best at a good hardware store. It is cheap and should be provided by the director in sufficient quantities. k"Size of Sheet. — Length, about one and two-thirds times the dth of the book when opened wide; width about twice the length of e book. (Exact dimensions not essential, — best size can be deter - ned by a little experimenting. ) "Directions. — There is only one good way to fold and apply covers. No stitching or pasting is necessary, and a perfect cover can be made with a little practice. Lay sheet on table with longer edge toward you ; fold further edge down toward you and lower edge up from you and crease, making the folded sheet slightly wider than the length of the book. Then fold right hand end of this folded sheet over to the left, and left hand end ov.t to the right and crease, making the length of the folded sheet a little more than the width of the book when opened wide. The cover is now ready to insert the book. Bend the stiff covers of the book back; insert one of them in one side of paper cover and the other in the other side. A little practice will </seg>

FA conference of representatives of the University of Nebraska, state normal schools, and of institutions granting certificates on basis of the state institutions, was held in the office of the state superintendent, Saturday, January, 14, 1911, with the following persons present: Dean Charles Fordyce, Dr. G. W. A. Luckey and Inspect jr A. A. Reed, University of Nebraska; Pres. D. W. Hayes, Peru; Pres. Joseph Sparks, Chadron; Dean R. C. Calder, Bellevue College; Prof. J. A.

Schell, York College; Superintendents Bodwell of Beatrice, and Water - l'ouse of Fremont, members of the State Board of Insepctors; Sta;c Supt. Crabtree. Some time was devoted to a discussion of the general proposition of requiring an examination for all grades of certificates, attention being cited to the resolution adopted by the chief state school officers in the conference at Salt Lake City in November, when it was agreed to accept all grades of 80 per cent or more eVrned before a sta r e examining board; and to the resolution passed by the county superin - tendents' section in their meeting of January 13 in which it was recommended that candidates for elementary (second grade) state certificates take the examination in the five easentials. Dr. Lackey </seg>
            <seg id="p468">427 Ed attention to the fact that by recent legislation, there is issued one grade of certificate for the elementary schools in England and is, and that after 1914 no one can teach in those schools unless )lds that certificate. It was moved by Dr. Beattie and seconded by Pres. Sparks that it be the sense of this conference that after September 1, 1911. the candidate for the elementary (second grade) state certificate, in addition to the completion of the course as now outlined, be re - quired to show state uniform grades of 80 or more in the five essentials, viz., reading, arithmetic, geography, grammar, and histor/. Motion carried. The conference then discussed the matter of institutions accept - ing credits earned at another institution or other source, the discussion arising from the consideration o'f subject matter on page 29 of bulletin No. 2, Series III. Dr. Luckey reported that the university does not accept any credits until carefully checked; that work in the history of education psychology, and other professional work coming in junior and senior years at the state normal schools (this work corresponding to freshman and sophomore work of the University) will iv general credit at the University toward graduation, but not towar.i the University teachers certificate. Credits for this certificate must be of a distinctly higher grade than those for the college degree, in the former a standing of 80 per cent is required and the work should not be attempted by those of less maturity than that of juniors and seniors. Inspector Waterhouse reported on the condition of the teachers college high school as found by recent inspection of the board: the board found a most admirable system there; seniors teaching in that high school doing a splendid work for schools out in the state to which they must go as teachers; seniors working under excellent super - vision; suggests that colleges having academies under supervision of regular college teaching force put their candidates for certificates into teaching work in such academies under supervision of regular instructors, requiring the student teacher to make careful plans, which arrangement might be a matter of economy to the institution, a gain to the student teachers, and a gain to the high schools who are to receive these teachers. IThen followed a discussion on the proper sequence of subjects. pecially the professional work. Professional work should not be ven earlier than the junior and senior years, when student is prepared to learn how to apply knowledge. The student must fir3t learn the subject, and afterward know the mind of the studeir. the psychology of the student. A student is not ready for applied Ktion before he is a senior. It seemed to be the consensus of n that all institutions should endeavor to follow what seems a national pedagogical thought, — that professional work should during the last two years of a college course and in the </seg>

It is suggested that one semester be devoted to observation of expert teaching ami at least four weeks to practice under criticism. The state boarj of inspectors are to use their judgment in passing upon the work wherever done, since it is difficult for institutions granting certificates on the basis of the university and also on. the bas : s of the state normal schools to follow a strict sequence of subjects. It was also agreed that the state board of inspectors are to exercise freedom with regard to equivalents for physical and military science, as well as with regard to all points in which approved in - stitutions should measure up to the state institutions. The state board of inspectors announced that it would be their policy to deal with all institutions in a spirit of equity and justice. Iie point was made that students coming into an institution non-accredited high school must be examined in the subjects d for entrance and the papers kept on file. President Hayes somewhat detailed statement of the plan followed at Peru observation and conference work, also the practice teaching, as d on pages 17 and 1 8 of the bulletin.

The programs published in the former manual have been slightly modified in accordance with suggestions made by the members of the School of Superintendence held jointly by the University and the State Department of Education. They were prepared originally after a careful study of existing programs, and are the outcome of a natural evolution. They afford an articulation which renders it easy for pupils to be transfered from one district to another of higher grade, in accordance with the free high-school law. They provide practical uni - formity in the first two years, and designate the place in the program that elective subjects shall occupy in the last years. They include the subjects required for entrance to normal school, college and uni - versity, and yet they afford enough elasticity to serve the ends of those not recognizing such claims. They offer a well-balanced group of courses that form the foundation of a liberal education. Foundation studies should be such as to inspire the individual to go farther and to assist him should he wish to go on. Generally, the subjects that best fit the individual for life are the ones that best prepare him for the next step in his education. Any subject is practical that stimulates the individual to a broader life and a more sympathetic touch with human interests. Each superintendent or principal in charge of a high school should study carefully its needs and resources, and should guide the school board in selecting such groups of courses as local conditions will warrant. The smaller schools should have a single curriculum. This should be followed by all pupils. It is better to permit a pupil to drop a subject when it has become evident that it cannot be carried to advantage, rather than to scatter the energies of the teaching force over too wide a range of courses. The larger school should arrange for such extra groups as may be within their needs and resources. By following the order of the official Program of Studie-.. sufficient uniformity will result to serve all important ends. School authorities may safely work toward this program, without fear of radical changes in the future. </seg>

            <seg id="p477">436 Schools with four years of secondary work that are unable to meet in full the conditions for the four-year list may be placed upon the Junior list to receive a maximum of twenty-eight points. LThe conditions on which a school is placed on the accredited list s follows: 1. The program of studies should be well balanced in language, mathematics, science, rhetoric, literature, and history. E2. Sciences should be taught with adequate laboratory equip - t, and with a course of study that provides for recitation periods laboratory or field work. The proportion of time should be approx - ely three periods a week for recitation purposes and two double &gt;ds a week for laboratory and field work. BThe library should be supplied with sufficient supplementary ference books for the courses in literature, history and science. 4. The recitation periods should be standard (40 minutest, at least in the subjects required for admission to college. 5. The superintendent (or principal) should have time for supervising the work of the teachers. 6. The teaching force in number, scholarship and professional training should be up to the standard set by the experience of good schools. Instructors should have four years of training beyond a four-year high-school course, including special preparation in the subjects in which they are to give instruction, or its equivalent, in determining the qualifications the ratio of two years of successful experience as a high-school instructor may be accepted as equivalent to one year of higher training. EA11 schools are asked to make a detailed report in September, information necessary for bringing the condition of the schools • the committee. Schools that have been previously accredited and that have not made much change in the teaclrng force, may be Ki upon the accredited list for the current year immediately, applicants and schools that have made material changes in the Ing force will not be accredited until after a visit of inspection. E There must be at least two instructors in Junior Accredite-1 giving their time to secondary school work. It is recom - 1 that at least one of the instructors meet fully the standard ifications applying to fully accredited schools. Should a school approximate this standard. the High-School Manual and a statistical blank for information will be sent. If the reply is satisfactory, an inspector will visit the school, and the com - mittee on accredited schools will take such action as his report may SOME ADVANTAGES OF ACCREDITMENT.

            <seg id="p481">440 UKXEKAL SUGGESTIONS. NECESSARY LIMITATIONS OF COURSES. Ambitious principals and school boards naturally desire that their graduates receive the highest possible number of credits. Though commendable in itself, this has produced unfortunate results. It is not unsual to find a district attempting to carry too many years of high - school work. The limit should be the number of years that can be handled well by the high-school instructors that a district ran afford to employ after providing properly for the lower grades. No high school can be permanently strong unless supported by efficient work in the grades. Not only should the number of years be limited, but the num - ber of courses offered should not be increased merely to secure more credit points. Optional courses increase the number of recitationa. unnecessarily reduce the size of classes, diminish the time the teacher can give to each class, and prevent the most thorough and efficient work. Variety of courses may be desirable, but thorough and skil - ful teaching is far more important. Where students' tastes and tal - ents require it, one study may occasionally be substituted for another, even in small schools. As a rule, however, until classes are of such sice as to require a division for efficiency in instruction, the board should adopt a single, carefully selected curriculum and lei the un - divided energy of teachers and students be given to the pursuit of it. Especially is this true in the earlier years of the high-school. Later there may be a differentiation, but there should be the require - ment that classes be of an economical size. UNITING CLASSES Bt is often immaterial which of two subjects comes first in order luence. Where classes are small, it is possible to make conibina - that serve the ends of economy as well as improve the character 1 instruction. Thus, physics and chemistry can be made to alter - only one of them being taught in any year. Much time is required for preparing experiments in these sciences and for properly arranging the work for any class taught with enthusiasm and success. The plan here suggested enables the teacher to concentrate effort upon a fall number of subjects. It has been thoroughly tested in a number high schools and found to work admirably. ■his suggestion is not intended for the largest high schools, yet are few schools in the state which may not make some applica - 'it. P'he union of classes may render proper other useful variations the program outlined in this manual. TEXT-BOOKS The subject of text-books should engage the careful attention </seg>
            <seg id="p482">441 factory texts are the most essential elements in securing good results from school work. Not all the publications of any publishing hout&gt;e are equally good. It is folly to choose a work simply because it is published under certain auspices. It is equally fallacious to suppose that what is satisfactory in one place will be equally so in another. Like the length of courses, equipment, and other circumstances, school books must be adapted to particular environments. LIBRARIES. A good school library is very desirable. The character of the books selected is of great importance. When funds are abundant it is not difficult to purchase, but with only fifty dollars to begin the work it is not easy to make a judicious selection. For those who must make each dollar count, a few suggestions may not be out of place. 1. Buy books as a carpenter buys tools — not in sets, not because others have them, but each for a specific purpose. Distinguish between books for use from the laboratory and reference point of view and books for general reading. Have some of each sort. The books for reference and fornn.1 supplementary reading broaden the mental horizon, permit com - parison of authorities, and awaken and stimulate new interest in work. The books for general reading should be chosen for interest and distinct literary value, and should have no immediate connection with studies. Ee reading habit should be formed with the study habit. To and fix the reading habit fully half of the library should of well-chosen books which do not in the least smack of ool room. 3. With only fifty dollars to spend, concentrate on some one subject and secure material for first-class work in this limited sphere. Fit up a complete shelf for Roman history, civics, American history, literature, or some other limited branch or portion of a subject. Next year do the same thing for another subject and continue this polio . Fifty dollars a year for twenty years scattered promiscuously, a book here and a book there, will not build up a serviceable work'ng library or stimulate instructors to use such. Many a library seems to have books in plenty, when in reality either there are not enough on any one subject to render collateral work practicable, or they are not of the right kind. 4. Remarks on libraries for the high school apply with equM force to books for the grades. Bach room should have access to in up-to-date library. ■ &gt;. A wide acquaintance with juvenile literature is helpful hi selecting to advantage. There is no use in buying what students do not read, and it is criminal to buy books without point or literarr flavor. Students do not read books that are stupidly or ponderously </seg>
            <seg id="p483">442 written, but they are quite capable of reading with zest and profit much literature that is thought by some to be above them. EThe librarian of the University is glad at all times to help T8 in the selection of books, to send "best books" lists on any t, or to furnish data as to prices and editions. One of the tvry best lists of good books for school libraries and arranged by grades from the first to the twelfth grade is issued by the Nebraska Public Library Commission and may be had free by addressing the Secretary Lthe Commission at Lincoln. It gives prices at which reputable as sell the books and full directions for ordering. Reference Books. The following titles are suggested as the minimum list of refer- ence books for the high school, and the purchase of them would V&gt;e perhaps the most profitable expenditure of $100 for this purpose: Atlas Universal Atlas of the World. Rand. McNally, $6. Imperial Atlas of the World; same firm. About $1.25. The Century Atlas, $12.50. E-y. New International Dictionary, G. &amp; C. Merriam, $12. : edition with supplement.

COIRSKS OF STUDY The following courses of study in the subjects for which entrance credit is granted have been prepared or revised by committees appointed jointly by the University of Nebraska, the State Department of Education, and the Superintendents and Principals' Association. They aim to specify in each subject the quantity, quality and method of work that will produce the greatest possible educational value, and that will permit evaluation in a scheme of course units. It is, how - ever, to be borne in mind that no department in the University of Nebraska discriminates against pupils enter. ng upon its work who Sbeen trained in methods differing from those favored by the rtment. Power, mentality, the ability to take up and success - carry forward university work — this rather than acquaintance any particular method, is the chief requirement for matricula- AGIUCILTIKK The recently adopted entrance requirements of the University make possible a great change in the course of study in agriculture in the high schools of the state. Fomerly not more than one credit point was possible in this subject. Under the new requirements, subjects which local conditions demand may constitute twelve of the thirty required entrance points if such subjects be well taught, with proper -equipment and well-trained teachers. In most high schools in Nebraska, local conditions demand that agriculture be the element of vocational training to be introduced into the high schools and united with the cultural element in the course of study. Where th^» high school does the work it should in the community, functioning as a finishing as well as a preparatory school (for it must always be a fin - ishing school for a great majority of its students), it should devote about one-fourth of its time to vocational work. In Nebraska this means that one five hour subject each year should be agriculture in a large proportion of the high schools. It is apparent, however, that this cannot be accomplished at once. Most high schools will find it necessary to put in two years or even only one year of agriculture work. The outlines herewith, however, provide first for a four-year course, then a two-year course, and a one-year course. For high schools which find it necessary to continue the one-semester course, the former outline in the old Manual will suffice. Very few high schools can at present adopt the complete four-year course. However, it should be the ideal toward which every high schoil in an agricultural community should work. The two-year course wiil </seg>
            <seg id="p485">444 Ethe one-year course. These latter courses are merely suggestive. It is strongly recommended that high schools adopt for the sub - matter of the two-year and one-year course such subjects outlined le four-year course as local conditions make most profitable. TEACHER OF AGRICULTIRE. The first requisite in the successful teaching of this fundament 1 1 subject is a specially trained man. a graduate of an agriculture! college if possible. He should be a man who can work with the farmers uf the community and secure their confidence and cooperation. He should be large enough in his views not to assume that he knows all there is to know about agriculture and that the practice and experi - ence of the farmers with whose children he is working counts for nothing. Instead of taking an attitude of authority on all agricultural subjects, he should take the attitude of the true student — that of the leader of a class of learners, himself a seeker after knowledge. It is only by so doing that he will be given the confidence and the cooperation of his farmer constituency. Eery frequently schools wishing to begin agricultural con ot be able to secure college graduates in agriculture to take of the work. In such cases a man thoroly in sympathy with farm life, with practical experinece on the farm, who has had a thon training in botany, chemistry, and physics, should be secured. H-&gt; should immediately get all the agricultural training possible in summer sessions at the University and from agricultural extension courses. Quite effective courses may thus be begun in schools where the necessity of waiting for a technically trained man would make their introduc - tion for a long time impossible. The has's of success in cases of this kind will be the ability of the teacher of agriculture to cooperate with the farmer constituency of the school. DEMONSTRATION FARM. In Minnesota the Putman Act provides for a state appropriation, to be paid to a certain number of high schools which maintain approved courses in agriculture and home economics. Each of thest - high schools must have a demonstration farm of not less than five acres. The Nebraska high schools which teach agriculture should have demonstration farms of not less than five acres. Holdrege and Tecumseh high schools have led the way in this very important matter, and in the establishment of ther new courses in agriculture have begun with demonstration plots of twelve and seven acres, respectively. Where it is impossible for a school to buy or rent such a plot of ground, vacant town lots, which frequently grow up in weeds, can often be secured through the cooperation of progressive citizens or through the commercial club of the town. </seg>
            <seg id="p486">445 LIBRARY AND TEXT-BOOKS Eie agricultural library should consist of a few very usabl - technical reference books. A few good books ami bulletins are used bring much larger results than shelves of tec hnio.il usable references. Special text-books in each of the subjects which constitute agri - cultural instruction, rather than a general text, should be used. Bulletins of the Nebraska Experiment Station can be had free, and likewise the Farmers' Bulletins of thp I'nited States Department if Agriculture. These should be constantly made use of. LABORATORY. Much of the laboratory work in agriculture will of necessity b-e upon the demonstration plot, in the home garden and experimental plots, and with live stock and machinery on the neighboring farms, but some additions to the regular laboratory equipment of the high school as indicated under the outlines for the various topics will be necessary. The outlay for this equipment, however, will not be Laboratory periods should be the same as in other laboratory subjects, — chemistry, physics, etc.; that is, a double period I a week.

Equipment and Material: Access to Animals — Until the high schools can own their own live stock, it will be necessary to take the class In Animal Husbandry to farms where good, pure-bred stock of the various types and breeds can be seen. When the judging is begun, the class should be given the privilege of scoring dv use of the official score cards some of the best specimens of each type which tha community affords. Almost all breeders of pure-bre 1 animals will gladly cooperate with school superintendents and principals in granting the use of their stock for this purpose. Charts and Drawings — Class interest is greatly stimulated if good drawings taken from Experiment Station Bul- Iletins, showing the points to be observed in stock judging, are used in preparing the class to use the score cards. These charts can be easily made on chart cloth with crayon or ink. Score Cards — Official score cards as use'd by the Animal and Dairy Husbandry Department of the University of Nebraska should be used in all the judging. Schools may obtain free samples of these cards by writing to the School of Agriculture of the University of Nebraska. Supplies for student use can then be printed from these.

Bulletins on Dairying from Nebraska Experiment Sta- tion. The Committee wishes to recommend to superintendents and principals the largest liberty in the inauguaration of new courses in agriculture in their respective high schools. Accordingly the preceding rather extensive four-year course has been suggested. Principals and superintendents should feel at liberty to change the order of subjects where there are good reasons for it and where such change would make the course more effective. The course in agri - culture should, above all things, be adapted to local needs. In some high schools where there is a large rural element in the student body, it may be wise to make the course in agriculture cover two years, with two agricultural studies each semester. The whole four-year course as recommended above could then be completed by farm boys in two years. The order of the course would be as follows: First Year. First Semester. Second Semester English English Algebra Algebra Soils and Farm Crops Animal Husbandry, 6 weeks Husbandry Soils and Farm Crops, 12 week Horticulture, 12 weeks Plant and Animal Improve- ment, 6 weeks Second Year. English English Geometry Geometry The Farmstead The Farmstead, 6 weeks Soil Fertility and Permanent Farm Machinery and Motors.

            <seg id="p496">455 Many schools may desire to start a two-year course with one agriculture subject each semester. In such a course the subject should be taken up much as suggested in the outlines in the four-year course, but naturally not so exhaustively. The same equipment and material, references, etc., are necessary. First Year Animal Husbandry, 18 weeks Farm Crops. 18 weeks. Second Year rneral Agriculture, 36 weeks. General Agriculture should include: (1) Horticulture. (2) The Farmstead. (3) Farm Machinery and Farm Motors. (4) Plant and Animal Improvement. (5) Soil Fertility and Per- manent Agriculture. (6) Dairying. (See outline in four-year course.) Kr schools desiring a one-year course only, the following plan isted : First Semester. Animal Husbandry, 9 weeks. Soils and Farm Crops, 9 weeks. Second Semester. General Agriculture, 18 weeks. ■This course should take up briefly the same subjects as suggested outline in the two-year course in General Agriculture.) ASTKOXOMV. Astronomy is a difficult subject to teach in the high school. It is an inherently mathematical subject. Not that it should involve many problems or formulae; it is better to leave these mainly for more advanced work. Yet, inevitably, astronomy is full of geometrii-.il conceptions which we can not avoid: real motions in space and the resulting apparent motions on the sphere must be clearly compre - hended and correlated. The pupil must learn to infer the real from the apparent, the apparent from the real. The teacher of astronomy should be able to discover and remove the pupil's difficulties, especially that of passing from the real to the apparent and from the apparent to the real To meet this need, two lines of collateral study are almost in - dispensable, a frequent use of the celestial globe and considerable observational work in the sky itself. The pupil should know the princi - pal constellations; should observe and chart on star maps the motions of planets; should determine by observation, however roughly, th * latitude of his town. Such laboratory manuals as Wilson's "Laboratory Astronomy" (Ginn &amp; Co.), Sweaey's "Practical Exercises in -Astro - nomy" (Appleton), or Byrd's "Laboratory Manual in Astronomy (Ginn </seg>
            <seg id="p497">456 on astronomy give a few suggestions of the sort especially ComstoeVs "A Text-Book of Astronomy" (Appleton). and Todd's "New Astro - onomy" (American Book Co.). Both are excellent texts. R&gt; school should undertake astromony without having in the some star atlases, in the laboratory a celestial globe, and teacher's chair some one who knows how to use them. Uptou's Ulas" (Glnn &amp; Co.), or Klein's "Star Atlas" (Young &amp; Co., NVw are good. Less elaborate maps, but probably more useful for dinners, are given in Swezey's "Manual" and in Young's "Les- Astronomy," but as a textbook Young's "Manual of Astronomy" er than his "Lessons in Astronomy." "The American Ephermeris and Nautical Almanac," publishc! by the Nautical Almanac Office, Washington, at one dollar a year, will prove a great fund of exact information about the actual positions and motions of the heavenly bodies. "Popular Astronomy," a monthly maga - zine published at Northfield. Minn., ($3.50 a year), will give much in - teresting reading and current information about the heavens and about astronomical work. The following books of a popular sort would be valuable for collateral reading: Ball. The Story of the Heavens. Cassell &amp; Co., $ Gore. The Visible Universe. Macmillan, $3.75. Langley.

Time — Preferably one year should be given to botany. It is better to begin with the opening of a fall term and continue as a fuii study to the end of the school year, covering two credit points. Whan It is impossible to give this much time to botany, the work may alt&gt; r - nate with some other subject, and one point may be covered. Even in such case it is better to begin the study in the fall. Here as elsewhere, a "credit point" must include not less than three class periods per week, for recitations, lectures, quizzes, etc., and four periods (preferably two double periods) per week for the lab - oratory work. The Laboratory — Modern botany requires a properly equfpp&lt;&gt;&lt;! laboratory. This must be well lighted, preferably from the north </seg>
            <seg id="p498">457 sky, and should be provided with firm tables. 27 or 28 inches hign, and needful shelves and cases at sides of the room. The nii&lt;-mN&lt;'u|M*K should be from some good maker, so as to secure good results. Each miscroscope should have two objectives (low and high powers), and at least a fine adjustment. Coarse adjustment by rack-and-pinion, and double nose-pieces while convenient are not in - dispensable. It is a waste of money to purchase "immersion objec - tives" or "mechanical stages" for the use of high-school pupils. It is quite desirable that there should be one or more simple eye-piece micrometers in the laboratory to enable the pupils to make measure - ments of objects. E Microscopes such as are here recommended may be purchased of rican makers (as Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Company, Rochester. '., or Spencer Lens Company, Buffalo, X. Y. &gt; for about %-' 1 German makers (as Leitz, Reichert, or Zeiss) for a little less i imported free of duty. It is recommended that in all cases the liases should be made directly from the makers so as to avoid pay - commissions to middlemen. There should be provided with each miscroscope a set of dissecting instruments. Good dissecting sets are made by the firms mentioned above, each containing a scalpel, forceps, scissors, needles, and pipette, and sold for about $1. The usual glass slips, cover-glasses, alcohol, reagents, etc., should be freely supplied. These need not cost more than $1 for each microscope. Some work may be done by the class under the direction of the well-prepared teacher, with but one microscope and the other appliances but as soon as possible there should be in every high school M microscopes, each with its accessories. There should be at least one-fifth Eoy microscopes as there are students in the class. Of course, it is itood that in each laboratory exercise each pupil has the exclusive one microscope. It is very desirable that every botanical laboratory should have a School Herbarium which contains authentically named specimens of all the plants of the region, and it should be the ambition of the classes in botany to add to this each year. The University will be glad to aid its accredited schools in this matter. The Laboratory Work — The aim is to give the student a general outline of modern botany, including a fair knowledge of the principal types of plants and the modifications they have undergone. For this purpose the teacher should have an abundance of material properly prepared for class use. Some of it may be preserved in alcohol per cent) or formalin (4 per cent), while much more may be in the form of dried herbarium specimens. As far as possible, however, it is better to have fresh material, which should be kept growing in the laboratory, or brought in at frequent intervals. The standard coarse of thirty-six weeks' work should be some - thing like the following: </seg>

Ehere but one semester can be given to the work, those topics 1 with an asterisk (•) should still be included, but those from 20 nay be considerably shortened without omitting any. Drawings — At every stage the student should be required to make careful drawings in his notebook accompanied by concise descriptions cf essential characters. Laboratory Material — The Department of Botany of the University will supply laboratory material to the accredited schools for cost of collection, preparation and postage. Field Work aiul Herbarium — Each student should have some prac- </seg>
            <seg id="p500">459 the art of herborization by actual field work, and should have enough practice in the drying, mounting, and labeling of specimens to do the work satisfactorily. Where theie is little or no such systematically arranged laboratory work as is outlined above, each student should prepare, as a result of his Held work, a herbarium of at least one hun - dred species, mounted on standard herbarium sheets ( 1 1 Vi by 16 Vi inches), and properly labeled. Such paper of the proper weight and already cut to the exact size may be bought at a reasonable figure from the Nebraska School Supply House in Lincoln. B Where the student performs the laboratory work indicated above, sufficient to prepare thirty-five specimens. The specimens should 1st of representatives of each of the larger groups of the vegetable doni. Warning — Teachers are warned that tilling pages of "blanks" (found in so-called "herbariums") is not only unnecessary but wholly unscientific. No botanist uses such blanks in preparing his descriptions, and pupils certainly should not be required to do so. On the label (about 2 by 4 inches in size) should be written (1 ) the scientific name, (21 the common name. (3) habitat, (4) locality, (.i) date, (6) col - lector's name. This is far better than to fill perfunctorily a "blank" with unnecessary data and inconsequential remarks. The Itotanical Library — Each accredited school should have a carefully selected library of botanical books to which students may have access under proper restrictions. The following list will be help - ful in the selection of books, those starred being recommended as valu - able for use as text-books or manuals: Arthur &amp; MacDougal.

Useful for supplementary readings by young pils. the foregoing should be added a subscription for the botanical journal. "The American Botanist,"" which is published at Joliet, Illinois. A general magaine, "The Guide to Nature," published at Sound Beach, Conn., contains a good deal of elementary botariy, as well as much about nature in general. t Teachers are urged to secure the bulletins relating to plants issued of charge by the United States Department of Agriculture, Wash - in, D. C, the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station at Lin- Nebr., and those issued by the experiment stations of other states. CHEMISTRY If the student is to cover with reasonable thoroughness the gen - erally accepted elementary course, he should spend at least seventy hours in lectures and recitations and ninety hours in the laboratory. This means practically that the class should meet for lecture or recita - tion three periods (forty minutes each) a week each semester, with two double periods a week in the laboratory throughout the year, or for class-room work six periods, and for laboratory four double periods a week for one semester. If the teaching is efficient, the equipment suf - ficient, and the work of the student satisfactory, the two-point require - ment of the University for entrance is satisfied. Lectures with good demonstrations of difficult and striking ex - periments and oral quizzes should be made about equally important portions of the class-room. The teacher's work should be based upon </seg>
            <seg id="p502">461 a good text-book. The laboratory work is the most important element in acquiring a good knowledge of the subject, either elementary or ad - vanced, and should be given more time than is usually devoted to it in the high school. It should be based upon a good laboratory manual and should include experiments illustrating chemical truths, the char - acteristic properties of typical non-metals and metals, and, if possible, a little rough quantitative work, and a brief study of a few of the com - monest compounds of carbon. The most important factor in securing efficient results from the study of the sciences in high schools is the teacher. A teacher insuf - ficiently trained in science can not be expected to do good work even with unlimited funds. But the best of teachers should not be expected to teach without at least a certain amount of money for the purchase of equipment and chemicals. Furthermore, those who have the finances in charge must realize that each student in science will use up or de - stror a certain amount of the laboratory supplies and that consequently the teacher must be allowed a sum each year for the replacement of the equipment thus used. Especially is this true in chemistry, where from three to five dollars a year (according to the condition of the original equipment ( will be needed to replace what the student will necessarily Tin- laboratory — The necessary laboratory furnishing need net be very expensive. Good light, solid tables, gas connection for every stu - dent if gas is to be had (otherwise good alcohol lamps), water boti&gt; distilled and ordinary, and a sink not too far from the students' tables, plenty of case room for chemicals and apparatus, and a hooi witl Iraft are the only essentials. The tables should be about forty inches high and, if possible, should be built with one shelf above for the com - mon reagents, and with drawers and cupboards below so thpt ea. ' dent may have his own set of apparatus, lock it up, and be rosro: Apparatus and Chemicals — The amount and cost of chemicals and apparatus needed for the above mentioned work and based upon a cer - tain number of students are given with a fair degree of accuracy in a number of laboratory manuals. For a class of ten students the cost of these materials need not be more than about $100. Among the more reliable laboratory supply houses are the following: E. H. Sargent &amp; Co., Chicago, Illinois. Entral Scientific Company, Chicago, Illinois, nver Fire Clay Company, Denver, Colorado Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Company, Rochester, New York. Scientific Materials Company. Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Elmer &amp; Amend, Xew York City. If the school can afford to buy apparatus and chemicals in some quantity, say, to the amount of $300 or $400, it will pay to have the n:aterial imported from abroad. Under United States law it may be imported free of duty for teaching purposes by any educational institu- </seg>
            <seg id="p503">462 EA very considerable saving may be thereby effected. The im - ing may be done direct or through some responsible house such as e mentiond. PHie library — Every high school should have a well-selected, even all, chemical library. Students should have access to the books be encouraged to consult them.

When sufficient time is devoted to the study, the historical growth of each institution should be included. ( 1 ) In general, the origin, provisions, and interpretation of the Constitution of the United States, in broad outline, should be fairly wall mastered. Attention to the struggle for a stronger national gov - ernment, during the so-called critical period preceding the convention cf 1787 will greatly add to the interest. Careful attention should be given to the actual workings of the Federal Government; while the origin and organization of political parties should be considered. The character and purpose of the Australian ballot, the direct primary, and the movement for proportional representation should be thorougnly understood. In like manner, the evils of the "spoils system" and the benefits of the "merit system" should be explained. (2) The same general plan may be adopted in the study of the state constitution. Here, however, the work may be made more crete; and it may be developed more from observation of actual gov - ernment. In some schools "field work" in the form of conferences public officers may be required. Often it may be found more practical to have copies of statistics from the tax collector, assessor, or other official than to ask a personal interview. Provision should be made for putting into each pupil's hands copies of ordinances passed by his governing body, sections of state or federal laws, legal forms of wills, mortgages, notes, abstracts of title, contracts, and the like. So far as practicable the student should come into personal contact with the </seg>
            <seg id="p505">464 EiU8 departments of the state government, legislative, executive, and rial. Especial attention should be given to the provision made by state for the poor, the unfortunate, the criminal and delinquent ies. and for the restriction of child-labor. (3) The local government should be studied in detail, with some attention to the origin of the three types of local organization existing i'l the I'nited States. Beginning with the school district, the work : u ay be extended to the township, county, village, arid city. The chief evils :n American niunici;al government, with the more important remedies suggested, should be pointed out. In particular the nature and purpose of the initiative and referendum should be explained. About two - thirds of the time should be devoted to local government. M&lt; ihod — A text-book may be placed in the hands of the class, bat it ought to be supplemented by library readings, and when practicable, by some field work. A number of reference books is essential. Writ - ten examinations should be held frequently; and, where sunicient time is assigned to civics, carefully prepared special papers may be required. Each student should keep a notebook. The present tendency to raise civics and American history to the twelfth grade should be encouraged. Studies so essential as a training for good citizenship should be taker. m when the nrnd of the pupil is most mature. It is highly desirable, for the same reason, that more time should be given to the subject. A separate fun course in political science, as such, ought to finJ place in ■ -y four-year high school.

A goo, I ,leal of in - tion in this subject can be given in connection with work in En| geography, history and civics, but it is probable that a regular cou-se in economics should be given in the twelfth grade, and as early in the year as possible.

Accordingly it exercises many faculties, but above sll develops the power of observation. Since things geological surround and become a part of the daily experience of every man, a little training i:. geology is a desirable part of everyone's early training. Whether it be im ks, soils, or crops nourished by them, the rain, or any of the many associated conditions. — it is all geological, and everyone, no matter v. hat his walk in life is to be, is the better for a little knowledge of the i ommoner and simpler laws governing such matters.

(■eology must necessarily be taught in an elementary way in the s&lt;-cond«ry schools . but it should not be omitted entirely from the course of study. The best work which the teacher of geology can do is to train the students to notice such universal geological work as the action of the wind, rain, frost, stream, fide. etc. Such work demands no tools or apparatus, entails little loss of time and involves no expense. Send the students into the field, for it is the best laboratory. In mak - ing short excursions either alone or accompantei by an ins:r ;, Nd student should carry a stout knife, garden trowel, or light pi- k to dig with, and some sort of hammer, preferably a geological rier.

GKKMAN The Status of Modern l.anuuatfe Teadiiim: I'resent-Haj Ideal* Of late years the study of (ierman in our high schools has gained so much ground that it seems advisable to state concisely and definitely what should be the aims and objects to be kept in view by both teachers and students of the language. Much thought and investigation have been expended on language teaching by psychologists, teachers, authorities, and text-book makers. The old-time memoriter mefm.'?. conning paradigms, reciting long lists of prepositions, as well a deadening dictionary translation exerc'sts have largely vanished. Stuff such as was offered to the students of German, even as late as 187.', by the author of a "German Grammar on Mnemonic Principles," is nowadays utterly out of the question. There, e. g., we read (p. J02 : : "With bitten and ratlien, befehlen, command The infinitive after an object may stand; But after to wish, think, assert or to know The infinitive only — no object — can go. or again, (p. 195) : "A partitive governs the genitive case. Or takes von. uiiter. hus, which must come in its place With pronouns; as jeder v&lt;m Ihnen of you. die Meisten von uns, and witli numerals too." It is a far cry from this text-book to those within command of the learner of the present day. The text-book makers vie with each other to present publications adjusted to modern notions o* language study. Not that there is not even now a considerable diversity of method and procedure, not that it is immaterial which grammar or what reading Mat are made the basis of instruction, still, all along the line there is a «'8ire to be abreast with sane and effective educational ideals. The gnificant feature of all really modern text-books is the stress they ace upon the actual, vital, practical use and usages of the language. German is taught to enable the pupil to come into intimate and ready contact with the thoughts and lives, the civilization and culture of the German people. The student has texts treating of the manners, cus- </seg>

Tlie Teacher (Today more than at any time previous do school authorities realize the teacher — the teacher of language as well as those of other ects — must be a specialist. The teacher must have a fair mastery not of the subject matter of his specialty, but also of the best and st niehods of presenting his subject to the learner. To this end l.eliranit.skamliilat must pursue technical courses in the pedagogy of his major subject. Thus every ttacher of German owes it to h : and to his pupils to prepare for his calling by taking special M in phonetics, composition, conversation, and the history of the lan- Bge. In the teachers' training schools such courses are offered &lt; erally. The best of these likewise maintain j&gt;ractice schoi ch the first efforts of the young teacher can be watched and dir a sympathetic supervisor of training and experience. Occasionally young teachers make the financial sacrifice of a considerable stay abroad. This practice is most &lt; onimendable. i: cid world (where such residence abroad is a detiinite «.ine iiua iion r teaching the languages) government or city aid is often given to enable Eidate to pome into immediate touch with the foreign people by ice among them. We probably cannot do this as yet, an considerable number of the Nebraska teachers of German have , year or more in res Jenee abroad. From what has been said so far about the teacher and his qu.ili - f.'-ations. it is manifest that only those capable of strenuous ap, tiun and decided aptitude and devotion to their calling should asp be language teachers. The teacher must have faith in his work, must be earnest an 1 enthusiastic in his labors. Enthusiasm 's catching; the '■\\ erdenden," as Goethe called the young, are especially susceptible to its influence. Knthusiasm is the fly-wheel that often helps both the er and the class past "dead centers." The teacher of German cannot dispense with it. He will utterly refuse to accede to the not 'on — sometimes encountered — that the cultural and disciplinary value of German, when properly taught, is not equal to that of any other subject in the curriculum. The (la.ss-rooin : Special Activities The German classes should have a room to themselves. Th'8 should be provided with a large (Kiepert) map of Germany, with pic - tures of some of Germany's great soldiers, poets, composers, rulers, and scientists. Likewise there should be pictures of German landscapes. cities, "Volksleben." German mottoes on banner or wall also add at - tractiveness and interest to the surroundings. </seg>
            <seg id="p511">470 Any of the larger schools can maintain a German "Verein," where the beautiful German folk-songs can be practiced, where occasional recitations, short scenes from larger plays, or (shorter) whole plays can be rendered. This, of course, must be done sparingly, since out - side interests are only too apt to cut in upon the student's time and energy. At Christmas a suitable program can be given with all the accessories of the "Weihnachtsbaum." A few English books on German life and customs, such as Wylie's "The Germans," Mrs. Sidgwick's "Home Life in Germany," Dawson's "German Life in Town and Country," Schauffler's "Romantic Ger - many " should be on the teacher's desk and within easy reach of every pupil. Larger schools could make an excellent use of a stereopticon or a reflectoscope in order to illustrate German life from lantern-slides or postcards. The Two-Year Gorman Course Most of our Nebraska high schools maintain only a two-year course in German; a few favored ones, a three-year course. This limited time le not adequate to reach the most satisfactory results. If the foreign language were begun (as it should be, and as it is done, as a matter of fact, in the old world), in a much lower grade, say, the sixth or seventh, and if it were studied for five or six years, the result would be vastly more valuable. But the time has not yet come in our Anieri - ran schools to stress linguistic studies as is done in the German Real - schule and Gymnasium. It is then for us to make the most of our situation. Usually when but two years are given to the German, the pupil has had the advantage of one or even two years of training in Latin. This, in a way, is an advantage, since he is more or less accus - tomed to grammatical notions and terminology. In another way, how - ever, it is a disadvantage, since with every year of life the child becomes more self-conscious and less free and spontaneous, with imitative facul - ess keen, vocal organs less adaptable to new sounds, and verbal memory less tenacious. However, we must adjust ourselves to the actual situation and do what can be done in the best manner possible. A. The First Year 1. Pronunciation. Extraordinary care must be taken to insure a correct and ready pronounciation. This includes not only the proper articulation of single sounds or comb nations of sounds, but it must include a fairly fluent and ready natural modulation of the parts of the sentence or paragraph. The monotone often heard in the class - room is distressing. The pupils should be held to read in as natural a tone when reading a foreign tongue as when using their own. Cf. Hagster-Collins' Chapter on Pronunciation in his "German in the Sec - ondary Schools." The teacher with preliminary phonetic training will have a decided advantage in teaching pronunciation and reading over one who has to rely entirely upon the imitative method. It is worth while to acquaint </seg>
            <seg id="p512">471 one's self with the main principles of the science of phonetics. Bvaa home study is better than no acquaintance with the subject.* The first few weeks of instruction in German should be carried on purely orally; that is, no books should be put into the learner's hands; above all he should not be required to study pronunciation by himself. Rather should he be trained from the very start to distinguish and to Eiitate sounds closely, to discriminate between similar sounds, to mbine unfamiliar ones, to exercise his vocal organs and modulate his ice, and to become conscious of lip and tongue position in forming Terent sounds. Considerable time can profitably be put upon these vocal gymnastics. It is beat at first not to put the written sign or symbol before the student, since with many, e. g., z, v, w, sp, st, etc., be associates entirely different sounds in his mother tongue. But even when the text-book can no longer be dispensed with, the instructor must not fail to go carefully and repeatedly over every new vocable Kth the class if he would prevent gross erfors and bad habits of pro - nciation. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." 2. Systematic Grammar Stu&lt;li*». The so-called "natural method" has long since proved its short-comings and weaknesses. While as much German should be used in the i -lass-room as can be useil profit - ably, and while systematic grammar should be studied as a means to an end, rather than as an end in itself, experience has proved that only by keeping a firm hold on the life-line of systematic; grammar can the student keep afloat upon the turbulent linguistic sea. Without that life-line he is sure to be engulfed as soon as he ventures out of the shallows. Hence great emphasis is to be placed upon a thorough stu'ly of the following grammatical categories: (a) Forms and uses of haben, sein, werden. Ib) Forms and uses of articles and demonstratives, (c) Case endings of nouns: for - mation of plurals. (d) Inflections of the adjective and the conditions upon which the inflection depends. (e) Forms and conjugation of "weak" and "strong" verbs, (f) Meanings, forms and uses of modal auxiliaries, (g) The more common prepositions and the cases gov - erned by them. Ih) The "kennen" type of verbs. (i) Pronouns as to form and function. (j) The main principles of tense formation, (k) Forms and more obvious meanings and uses of the subjunctive mood. (1) Formation and use of the passive voice; equivalents of the same, e. g., man sr.jjt.

(n) A good king vocabulary.* A mere glance at the above enumeration shows that the learner must master an exceedingly large field, so large indeed that he cannot do it in two semesters. If these subjects are taught in a live, sane, interesting way. and if the material is made to yield its contents fully and connectedly, the student ie not likely to chafe under its systematic presentation, no matter how much time is required. Forms and para - digms must be mastered. But forms and paradigms should be applied, their utility being made to appear in their application and use. Hap - pily most modern grammars recognize this principle thoroughly. In- Eof the disconnected illustrative sentence, modern pedagogy m - upon using forms, paradigms and construction in as connected a ,s possible. Under certain conditions it is well to commence reading simple. connected texts as early as the second semester. For example, the first pages of "Gluck auf" are thoroughly within reach of pupils of that advancement. Some parts of im Vaterland" could be so used. But whether the class take up a special reading text or not. the student should get a firm and vital grip upon form and contents of the language - material with which he deals. The importance of a good working vocabulary is ordinarily not appreciated sufficiently. To learn and acquire a vocabulary, to make the foreign words and phrases a part of one's consciousness is of the utmost importance to progress. To have a large vocabulary is com - parable to having money in a bank. It can be drawn on, it is ready for use. It may be suggested that the teacher can be of great aid to the student in making himself master of a large working vocabulary. He can do this by requiring pupils to look for associated forms and ideas, e. g., to link noun and verb forms, to connect countless derivative groups, to master and fix groups like: Vater, Mutter; Bruder, Schwes - ter; Stadt, band; alt, neu; nasz, trocken; hoch, niedrig; Stunde, Tag. Xacht, Woche, Monat, Jahr; etc. Again, types such as Pall, fallen; Schusz. schieszen; Gang, gehen; or kurz, Kurze; schwach. Schwache; 'Among the grammars more particularly adapted to high school use the following seem to have tested ouf well: Bacon's German Grammar. Allyn and Bacon, Chicago. Vos' Essentials of German.

            <seg id="p514">473 kalt, Kalte. and many other associational groupings can be made to serve the memory. But when all is said and done there must be a great deal of honest, persistent, hard application of memory-work to the task in hand. The ready command of a vocabulary is worth all it Ee English-German exercises found in all our grammars, even, ritten in the spirit of the reformers, are a necessary evil. The - ly, it would seem a pedagogical blunder to require the learner to change from one language to another, instead of immersing him in the foreign idiom. But aside from the fact that to do this is exceed - ingly difficult, it is questionable whether, even if it could be done, it would be an equally effective means of checking up the student's work. An oral working over of the English-German exercise should precede written work, especially in the first few months of study. To reverse this process is to give the student the most favorable opportunity to impress upon his mind serious defects in form and substance. "Rcd - 6k" teaching has ever been and ever will be nerve-racking and in - 'icacious. B. The Second Year Grammar, Reading, Composition 1. General Considerations as to Objects and Methods. It is true that "Die Lekture steht im Mittelpunkt des heusprachlichen Unter - richts" — "Reading is the central feature of modern language instruc - tion." However, this dictum of educational authorities is to be under - stood quite differently from what is too often done. It is not a mere turning of a certain number of lines of good German into halting, more or less faulty English. It means that the reading lesson is to be made the occasion for bringing out specific points of matter and form and that it affords a laboratory period in which the teacher presents to the class an interesting bit of narration, description, poem, characteriza - tion, or anecdote in a connected, natural, and suggestive way. Gram - mar studies begun in the previous year must be continued. For ex - ample, the many intricate questions relating to the subjunctive, the modal auxiliaries, impersonal, reflexive, and separable verbs, the word - order, the more obvious principles of word-derivation. — all should re - ceive the most careful and systematic attention. This can be done only by setting aside deflinite class periods for grammar studies. It is only thus that the "kennen" is transformed into a "konnen." 2. Reading proper: Translation. If all our German teachers were experts, if all commanded the language as they do their English, and if more time were available, a large part of the translation feature of teaching might be dispensed with. As it is, much of the material must be translated. As more difficult texts are taken up, or as more difficult passages occur in the simpler texts, translating becomes well nigh indispensable. Two considerations may well guide the teacher </seg>
            <seg id="p515">474 to get along without it. To require a child to say: "Die ist mein Vater," "This 1b my father," is nonsense and is deadening to both teacher and taught. (2) Translate a word, phrase, sentence, para - graph, only when there is a valid reason for thinking that clearness de - mands it. Translation should be simply a method of testing and con - trolling the student's work, and should be resorted to only when ab- Etely necessary to master the material. Experience teaches that should not dispense with it. The most a competent teacher can do o minimize its use. Cf. Bagster-Collins, "German in Secondary jols." Chapters 8 and 9. Rne other practical consideration is the order of procedure. Shall be translation first, and reading the German afterwards, or the e? One in sympathy with this report will have no difficulty in agreeing to the proposition that the final step should be the reading of the German — i. e., taking in the original and lodging it in the -,iupU's consciousness. This reading and translating should not be sentence for sentence ,or passage for passage, but rather paragraph for paragraph, or even page for page. Reading in concert is at times ad - tble, though ordinarily the teacher can correct faulty pronunciation voice modulation better by working with the individual. 3. Some KugKrated Texts; Amount to be Heart. There is at pres - ent a large number of available texts for second-year reading. Among these are: Bacon's "1m Vaterland," Allen's '"Herein," Baumbach's "Der Schwiegersohn," Wildenbruch'a "Das edle Blut," Gertacker's "Germelshausen," Bluthgen's "Das Peterle von Nurnberg," Seidel's "Leberecht Huhnchen," Schrakamp's "Ernstes und Heiteres," Hauff's "Das Kalte Hen," Storm's "In St. Jurgen," Mosher's "Willkommen in l'eutgchland," Hillern's "Hoher als die Kirche," Benedix's "Der Pro - teas" (comedy), and Moser's "Kopnicker Strasze No. 120" (Lustspiel). From these texts, or others of the same grade, the teacher should make a selection of some 150 or 200 pages which, together with the grammar studies necessarily left unfiinished in the first year, should constitute the substance of the second year's work. The teacher may well select those with which he is most familiar, those which in substance and form appeal most to h's taste, and which he can handle with greater freedom and directness. The material should be distinctly and characteristically German in form and spirit. There should be no attempt at studying literature the second year. C. The Third Year The work in the third year should incidentally review and apply the work of the first two years. To this end frequent composition ex - ercises .based upon the text read, should be a vital part of the course. Ground that has once been gained should never be given up. Inci - dentally the bearing of German on English grammar or usage may occasionally be brought home to the student. The study of German. </seg>
            <seg id="p516">475 riculum, finds additional justification in the illuminating sidelight whi h it throws upon the structure and characteristics of the Kngl'uh tongue. Nevertheless, the teacher of German must not go too tar afield to teach English grammar. His own domain is quite vast enough to demand Ms attention. I The outcome of the third-year study of the language should be i acquisition of enough power and familiar'ty with average textual d grammatical peculiarities to make the understanding of moderately difficult Herman a possible undertaking. The texts read and studied should put the student in touch with German thought and life, with German traditions and ideals. They should afford glimpses of '.he Fatherland and its people, their characteristics and civilization. If possible, the student should get a little taste of the German literature and have his finer sensibilities quickened and his appreciation of the worthy and beautiful cultivated. Among others the following texts may be suggested as providing suitable third-year reading material: Thiergen's Am deutschen Herd," Riehl's "Burg Neideck," Niese"s "'Aus danischer Zeit." Ebner- Esrhenbach's "Die Fre herren von Geniperlein," Rosegger's "Wald - heimat," Freytag's "Die Journalisten." Hatfleld's "Lyrics and Ballads," Schiller's "Tell" or "Jungfrau von Orleans," Meyer-Foerster's Karl Heinrich," and Suderman's "Frau Sorge" (novel). I The average third-year class, in addition to the grammar review d composition work, should be able to work over some SM to 3."&gt;o ges of suitable texts. Narrative prose should predominate.

Constant practice in reading aloud is strongly recom - mended, since this aids greatly in the treatment of Creek as a living language. Practice in the reading of unprepared passages (sight trans - lation) is recommended during the second and third years. This en - ables the teacher to discern the difficulties which the student may have in translating a new sentence, and gives the student readiness and con - rence in the language. Rapid reading should be judiciously combined th exact translation and with constant practice in writing Greek. Students who may not have been able to secure Greek in the high school can begin the study of the language at the I'niversity. Those who have had even a minimum amount can continue the study from any point they may have reached in the high school. In either case full college credit is given for the elementary Greek carried at the Uni - versity, if the student has the necessary number of entrance credits in other subjects.

Teacher — To be effectively taught, history demands just as highly specialized and thoroughly prepared teachers as do the other subjects of the curriculum. No teacher of history should be expected to carry more branches or hours than does the teacher of any other specialised high school subject. Profitable work in history depends more upon a competent, well-prepared teacher than upon any other, one. factor. The idea that- 'anyone can teach history" is responsible for a large share of the poor results obtained from history work in some of our schools. History is one of the most practicable and valuable of present secondary subjects for training future citizens; but much of this value is being lost through the work of unprepared and unqualified teachers. Kquipnient — Modern history teaching demands more than a text - book. In addition to one of the standard text-books, each pupil should each day consult at least one library or reference book. On the fol - lowing pages are suggested desirable books for such use. Besides these, each school should possess at least one good set of historical wall-maps or wall-charts. In a school just beginning work in history, the use of geographical or present-day maps may be excused; but no school pretending to be up-to-date in its history teaching will long be without an equipment of historical maps (see list). Pictures and other illustrative material may be made profitable use of by a properly pre - pared teacher; but in the hands of unskilled teachers such material is apt to be used to little purpose or profit. Method — The most generally used method of history teaching to - day by progressive teachers is some form of the library or topical method. An outline or text furnishes the assignment and reading ref - erences for each day's work of the class. Preparation for recitation consists in the study of the text and supplementary reading in as many reference books as the remaining preparation time permits. Notes on readings may be required; but if the teainer is thoroughly in control of the subject matter of her reference books, the class recitation may be used for cheeking up on the readings as well as for covering the day's lesson. Recitation ordinarily consists of oral questions, intelli - gently designed to bring out the main trend of the day's assignment, its relation to preceding lessons, its most important details, and the varying interpretations and judgments found in the different authori - ties. When especially good subject matter offers, intensive secondary or source studies may profitably be made, and will help to relieve the monotony of any one method of carrying on the recitation. At appro - priate points, the making of maps may be assigned as part or all of the preparation for a given day, and the recitation devoted to explani - tinn And criticism of the miD </seg>
            <seg id="p520">NEBRASKA HIGH SCHOOL MANUAL 479 1 KeTietvs — One of the most valuable results of history work will be lost to the teacher who slights periodic reviews. Such re 1 . should not be automatically set, but should be made whenever a dis - tinct period or movement, covered in several days or weeks of class work, has been finished. Review questions should not be for the pur - pose-of bringing out details, but for showing development and rela - tionships. Not only should the movement within each period be clearly brought out; but also each period should be clearly connected with the ones that have preceded it. Understanding is the greatest of all aids to memory. If the pupil really understands any period the facts of that period will be remembered without particular effort. Even where the main object of the course is prepar ng for the county or state examina - tions, this will be found one of the most profitable methods of study.

HISTORY — ElKOPEAX t Course of Study — The four-year course in history, generally re&gt; - mended by the history teachers' association of the country, consists of one year of Greek and Roman history, one year of medieval and modern nistory, one year of English Irstory, and one year of American history, arranged in the above order. Where less than four year* are devoted to history, it is well to arrange the work so that it can 1 veloped into the approved course. For instance, if but one year i&amp; given, let it be Greek and Roman history, if but two years, add a year of English history; for a third year, bring in American history, and for the fourth, medieval and modern. The old one-year course in general Kory does not meet with the approval of good history teachers anj - ire. Material — A good narrative text and some source material form the indispensable equipment of the class. Fortunately the market is well supplied with good narratives. For Greek and Roman history any of the following are satisfactory: Botsford, Myers, Morey, Sheldon, West. Wolfson. t For the full title of these works and for collateral material, consisting of sources and secondary works, see "A Histor; Syllabus for Secondary Schools" [Heath &amp; Co., Boston, 1904, $1 .20 J This work is the publication of the New England History Teachers' Association and should be in the private library and on the desk of every teacher of history. It contains suggestions on the teaching of history; list of books for libraries, with prices; outlines with exact ref - erences for pupils, and other helpful material.) Some collateral read - ing should be done in the sources and sufficient time g'ven to then: in the class so that the pupil will have at least a faint idea of what evidence means. (For the list of eource-material suitable for such work, see "Historical Sources in the Schools" ( Macmillan, 1902, 50 cents).

            <seg id="p524">483 MetluMls — .Methods are determined by the ends aimed at, of which there should be at least two — a knowledge of the historical develop - ment and of the process by which we get at historical truth. TL riod studied should be treated as a whole. Each new topic should be bound to all the preceding topics by oral anJ written review — outlines and narratives, with a few dates — and when the work of the semester is finished, the pupil should be able to give a rapid survey of the whole subject. The advance work should be studied by means of questijns set upon the material, calling for written answers and class-room dis - cussion. When the study of the topic is complete, the results should be presented in outline form and this, at times, should be followed by a narrative. In the supplementary reading, the pupil should be taught to read a paragraph or a page and to write down in clear English the substance of what has been read. The second end can be attained by frequent questions upon the sources of information — meaning by that real sources, not modern writers: Herodotus, Thucydides, Plutarch, etc., and not Botsford, West, Myers or Wolfson — that the pupil may learn what they are, what they are worth, and how unreliable much of our so-called history is. Historical geography should receive constant attention, and much interest can be aroused by the use of the Perry pictures of Greek and Roman buildings and statuary. At the end of a year's work in history a pupil should have a &lt; lear outline of the period covered. He should have a working knowledge of the principal sources of information, of how to make an outline, of how to read a book and give the substance oY what he has read in good English, and last, of how to study two successive historical maps and explain the changes that have taken place. Every pupil should know these things, whether he is to go to the University or not. If he does not know them when he enters the University he is handicapped in his liATIX Rn teaching Latin syntax it has been the custom not to differentiate ently between constructions occurring often and those that are found in the early readings. The result is that the work has been so overcrowded that it cannot be done thoroughly. It would be I to emphasize the often occurring constructions at first and leave the rare ones to be mastered later. As a help in this direction the differentia - tion below is offered.

The student should ac - quire the ability to read metrically Latin hexameters at sight. Figures of speech should be studied and lists of passages made illustrating the different figures.

There should be a definite review each year of forms, and of the constructions learned the preceding year. Kroughout the second, third and fourth years the finest passages be written out in the best English possible. Schools whose Latin are less than four years should complete an author as far us and not read a part of each. Khe Roman pronunciation should be used. Great care should be to train the students in accurate and ready pronunciation, which •lp them to appreciate the dignity and earnestness of the Roman ter. For a pupil to study the Latin without discovering its state - is to lose an important element of it. The purpose of prose composition is to give students a renuy knowledge of the forms and constructions. They are often lamentably deficient in these. Many times they give a so-called translation that ll a mere assemblage of words with no meaning. They should be led to understand that they are dealing with the thought of the author and that a translation that does not express his thought is no translation, (hie cannot get an author's meaning without a knowledge of the con- </seg>

After a pupil has read a passage in class and translated it, he should be questioned on the construction of every word which he is liable not to understand. The composition should be interspersed throughout the reading of Caesar and Cicero and under no circumstances should it be left to be done after the class is through with those authors. It should be made a help to the reading. In all written exercises the long vowels should be marked. EThe ultimate aim of the study should be an ability to translate ac - tely, to construe all ordinary passages, a broadening of the knowl - of English words by a constant reference to words derived from the Latin, and an ability to hold many details in the mind at the same time and to do enough original thinking to divine the author's thought and turn it into the best English.

The path of a point moving so as to be equidistant from two fix*.i points, or from the sides of an angle. What angles are equal when a line outs two parallels The angle-sum for a triangle. The measures of central and inscribed angles The conditions for similarity of triangles. The way in which a right triangle is divided by a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle upon the long side. The Pythagorean proposition. The areas of rectangles, parallelograms, triangles and circles. Around these the rest or plane geometry can be logically grouped as shown in the report of the Committee of Fifteen on a Geometry Syllabus. There is thus a start for those who go on. But what is far more important, those who do not go on get a nucleus of interesting and important facts. That they have been learned by observation and experiment rather than through a severe and dry process of logic is altogether a good thing. For thus did the race first learn geometry and then from geometry, arithmetic and algebra and logic and all the abstract brood. Indeed, only in the past fifty years and by the com - bined labors of the greater mathematicians, has some approach to a rigid logic been made. But we have long had geometry; for "geometry is the science of the eye." It is certainly uphill work to teach close reasoning about matters concerning which the pupil has had no chance to acquire clear an'. definite conceptions. Much can be done by an observational exercise of even once a week. Matters apparently forgotten leave vestiges that render the second learning more easy and direct. The work of the various semesters will be as follows: &lt;&gt;rade I.\ Semester I, Algebra. Exercises in passing from ordi - nary to algebraic language and back again, with zealous regard to pre - cision of statement in both languages. Especially should loose use of the equality symbol be guarded against. Technical terms should he used only sparingly; never unless the ideas that go with them have been made plain. Equations of the first degree in one unknown, with accompanying problems, can hardly be too early introduced. The U\e;i of negative quantity can wait. Exercises with the balance clear up th&lt;&gt; usual difficulties with the equation. Some of the problems can well involve simple geometric conceptions, e. g.. the angle-sum of a triangle. Other matters that can be brought into this semester are the four rul^s </seg>

The four rules for fractions. The prop - erties of fractions and their equalities usually given under the name of ratio and proportion. Illustrations from similar triangles and from drawing to scale.

Positions concerning straight P. angles, triangles, quadrilaterals, circles, chords, tangents, inscrib - ngles. There should be constant insistance upon clear conceptions accurate statements. It is possible, in this first semester and cover - ing very little of the text, to initiate a class into the spirit of geometrical thinking, to get them bo that they insist on seeing things for themselves, or recall seeing them. To this end the class should be put upon exercises from the very start. Mere book-work can always be profitably sacrifice 1 thereto. Let the student have a syllabus before him, as .ioinething to work with, not something to memorize. But insist on time, patience, determination. It is good for a pupil to hang on to a problem for a week, a month, a year, or even longer. But elusive coiu-ppUi.iis ae incommensurables and limits should not, at this stage, be dwelt upon. They are refinements that the high-school pupil can hardly grasp. All through this semester, make haste slowly. (•rade X, Semester 2. The theory of proportion and similarity with review of the algebraic treatment. Areas of polygon-, and trans - formation of polygons into equivalent triangles and square*.

About 200 exercises and constructions should be performed, among P should be a number of calculations of heights and distan sible objects by means of triangles measured by the pupils. First ometrie conceptions should be formed, then the necessary cal - ns should be symbolized algebraically, finally the computation be carried out. Measurement of careful drawings to scale will serve as a verification. Even the formula for the area of a circle can be tested. It is a matter of counting the squares enclosed by a circle 1 1 1 2 1 1 :: I 1 1 4 6 4 1 10 1( 0 I </seg>

There should be plenty of numerical illustrations, the simpler the better, both of these meanings and of the laws governing operations upon quantities affected by ex - ponents. The transition from exponents to logarithms, with numerical exercises in which all the quantities involved are rational. Plotting of the logarithmic curve on a fairly large scale. A very large one hung on the wall of the schoolroom could be helpful. The use of four-place table. Practice once a week in logarithmic computation. The theory of radicals. Solution of the quadratic by factoring. Problems in - volving quadratics. Plotting of easy quadratic equations in two un - knowns. Solution of the system, a quadratic and a linear equation. Solution of simple pairs of quadratics. Wlmi the equations are not too complicated they should be plotted. Some of the problems shoul.l deal with the preceding year's geometry. Grade XI, Semester 2. Solid geometry. Many students have dii - ficulty in understanding outline drawings of space figures; especially is this true in the drawings in the first book of soi'.u geometry. The best help here is actual outline drawing by the students of drawir.L.s they themselves have made. Let this be accompanied by observation of the simple forms of the surrounding world, its surfaces and direc - tions, its angles, plane, solid and dihedral, its distances, shadows and perspectives. By this means the pupils will get one important element in the understanding of all pictures. It might be easily proved to the 1 that every picture is properly viewed from but one distance. The theorems in mensuration can be easily used to keep up the student's algebra. For example, let the student trace the connection between the theorem on the volume of the frustrum of a pyramid in terms of the volumes of three pyramids, and the algebraic identity giving the quotient of the difference of the cubes of two quantities by the dif - ference of the quantities. Again, let him get a formula giving the volume of a sphere in terms of the surface only. The geometry of the sphere should be studied with the help of a good globe, a spherical blackboard, and with observation by day and night of the blue sphere in which we live. On any globe a stretched string quickly and ac - curately gives a great circle.

A course based upon text-book work alone is entirely inadequate. The text should serve as a guide in systematically directing the course. It cannot supplant the other lines of study. Kany good text-books have been published in recent years. With them excellent work is possible, so it is not thought necessary nit a list of acceptable texts. Laboratory work is essential. As far as possible the laboratory exercises should correlate with the text and reference readings.

Fifty exercises are included. If this note-book is used, at least twenty exercises should be worked and a larger number is advisable. I exercises should be distributed topically as follows: General earth studies, 2; materials of the land — minerals, rocks and soils. 6: topog - raphy of land forms, 6; atmosphere, 6. There are several manuals published with which acceptable work can be done. In amount, how - ever, the equivalent of that outlined above must be performed. Teachers should, as far as possible, correlate the reading an 1 laboratory work with the physiographic environs of the school, the principal aim being to acquaint the pupil with the processes acting in and through the atmosphere hydrosphere, and lithosphere. The work of each process is to be studied in its relation to the form result - ing. The life forms are best treated in relation to their geographic environments. Suggestive outlines for field work are included in the note-book manual referred to, and nearly all the manuals now in us • contain valuable suggesfons. Material for doing the work is not ing.

PHYSICS Schools with proper equipment for class-room demonstrations and laboratory work are able to complete the course in one year. The time should be divided about equally between class-room and laboratory. Three periods of class work and two double periods of laboratory work each week throughout the year should suffice. When less than this amount of time is available it should be devoted to* the completion of some part of the subject matter thoroughly, rather than the whole of the subject in a manner necessarily superficial. It should be borne in mind that the expenditure of time and effort required by a teacher to prepare for class and experimental demonstrations, and to conduct the class exercise with laboratory work, is necessarily greater than that required for a simple recitation or lecture. Hence in the school pro- </seg>

Especially is iTiis true in schools inadequate or defective equipment leads to a heavy demand upon me of the teacher in providing apparatus. Fewer class periods ; be assigned the science teacher. I he laboratory part of the course should comprise at least thirty merits of a quantitative nature. Many excellent laboratory I re published whence to choose such experiments. As far as :he custom of having a group of pupils perform a single fxpeii - should be dispensed with. Let each student V&gt; thrown upoi. esources and be forced to rely upon his cwn iudfment am! ions in performing an experiment. Aside from the qualitative experiments ].erformed by the v during the class period to illustrate and enforce the teaching, many simple experiments of a qualitative character should be performed oy the pupils themselves preparatory to the discussion of the topics of the next succeeding class period. There is secured in this way a very defi - nite understanding of the meaning of terms to be employed by teacher and Uxt-book. a first-hand knowledge of the phenomena to be dis - cussed, and an appreciative attitude toward such instruction. The quantitative experiments follow class discussions, constituting an ap - plication of the instructions given. Experiments which possess an intrin8 ; c practical significance are preferable. Simple experiments which lack the elements of precision of manipulation, such as the in - clined plane, siphon, etc., should not displace experiments of g - value as laboratory exercises in the development of manipulative skill and habits of precision. Ee metric system should be used in all measurements, and de&lt; inial is in all calculations.

There should be curtains for darkening the room as well as a device for reflecting sunlight to the lecture table. The lecture table should be lower than the level of the pupils' eyes when seated in class-room, in - stead of being elevated upon a rostrum as is too commonly the case. Portraits of noted scientists are recommended for the walls of the class-room, such decorations being more inspiring and instruct ve than bare walls.

Bracke t shelves on walls are very satisfactory for many experiments, if the building is free from serious jarring. A water supply and sink are essential in the laboratory. When a water system is not available, a two or three-barrel tank, located near the class-room, should be con - nected with the lecture table. There should be a case for supplies and apparatus. A small work bench and tools should be provided for con - struction work and repair of apparatus. Where classes are not large, and where other conditions permit, a double period every day in physics would give time for lesson prep - aration under supervision as well as for the laboratory work and class work. The physics teacher would thus have fullest freedom in use of this time for experiments or other laboratory exercises, for class work, or for lesson preparation according as the nature of the work in hand might make desirable. Difficulties in the make-up of the general school program due to the double period for laboratory work on certain days only would thus disappear. The same room could be used for both laboratory, class and study purposes very satisfactorily. A large, well-filled case of reference books should be conveniently near for the pupils' use. One or two of the general scientific periodicals are recommended for the reading table.

            <seg id="p536">495 Apparatus In many experiments simple apparatus is quite as efficient as more elaborate and expensive instruments. If funds are limited sufficient apparatus of the simple kind should be secured rather than a few ex - pensive pieces. Yet one should not sacrifice effectiveness to cheapness. Apparatus should be capable of giving reasonably reliable quantitive Among the things requisite are glass tubing, files, a soldering clamp and ring stands, test tubes, flasks, wire, rubber stoppers, metric rules, rubber tubing, calipers, micrometer screw, a balance (not a plat - form balance), a clock with a seronds pendulum, thermometers. etc The equipment required is of two sorts: (1) apparatus for class-room demonstrations, by means of which experiments of qualitative nature can be performed by the teacher in connection with the rlass work; (2) apparatus for individual laboratory practice by pupils themselves, which Kives training in manipulation, develops habits of precision and ac - curacy, and secures intelligent observation of the phenomena of nature. Schools of limited means will do well to omit the purchase of the more expensive demonstration apparatus, for example. Atwood's Machine. Holtz machines, large air pumps. X-ray and wireless telegraphy out - fits, etc.. until a fairly thorough equipment of the more essential ap - paratus has been obtained. A wise expenditure of a hundred dollars for many relatively inexpensive pieces of apparatus ha\yng a wide range of use, goes far towards providing a satisfactory working outfit to be - gin with. High schools are entitled to duty-free entry of apparatus and sup - plies purchased abroad, and the economy of buying a large bill of supplies of foreign make is frequently quite considerable. Especially is btrue of thermometers, glassware, balances, and weights. Among lumerous supply houses dealing in material for the physical lab - try may be mentioned: The Scientific Shop (Importing Jobber), Chicago. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co. (Optical and General).

A mere review of repetition of the work ordinarily given in the grades will not entitle the student to entrance credit. The course should em - brace facts and principles derived, not from physiology alone, but also </seg>
            <seg id="p537">496 physics, psychology, hygiene, etc., which, taken together, will serve to inculcate proper habits of mind and body and to train pupils in an ap - preciation of the value of right living and thinning. The preeminent value in the study of physiology lies in its relation to hygiene. Too much stress can not be laid upon the value of daily ubjtcIm (both mental and physical), bathing, proper diet, sleep, ventilation, etc., and upon public hygiene and sanitation. In addition to this intrinsic worth, the subject possesses a cultural value equal to that of any other natural science, if properly taught it cultivates the powers of observation; as a result of laboratory work, it gives skill in manipulation; through the drawing of conclusions from experimental work and through the prac - tical application of things learned, it increases the ability to reason. Following the recommendation of the National Education Association, the course should be placed in the eleventh or twelfth grade. The study at that time of the human body as a living thing can not fail to be of the greatest advantage to the pupil in later life. I order to indicate more clearly the ground to be covered, teach - advised to use as Cm basis of the course some standard text - uch as the Human Mechanism of Hough and Sedgwick. Parti - ress should be laid upon demonstrations and laboratory work, mer should be accessible to each student for sketching and study, ere demonstrations shown by an instructor to the class, without ig individual examination and note-taking, are of little value. L Since an intelligent appreciation of function is greatly aided by elementary knowledge of structure, it 's very desirable that at leaM one compound microscope be used to demonstrate the finer structure of the principal tissues cf the body and the organisms producing disease. Typical mounted sli-Jes for this purpose can be procured at cost price by addressing the physiological department of the University. The laboratory work should include experiments of a more strictly physiological character, the extent of which will be determined by the equipment available, although no school need be prevented from at - tempting such on account of the cost of the apparatus. Many of the bodily functions can be illustrated by experiments carried out by the students on themselves and by means of home-made apparatus. Recent text-books in physiology are full of directions and suggestions in this Et. Vivisection in high schools is undesirable and a consideration morbid changes and pathological lesions is unnecessary, except •r as required by the laws of the state. Many text-books contain suggestions for teachers, which should all be considered. Text-books differ so widely in the ground covered and in the emphasis laid upon special portions of the subject that the teacher is obliged to form an acquaintance with a large number of texts and to make a judicious selection of what is good in them, to add, by verbal instruction or otherwise, to that which is taught in the text used.

An exposition of this idea, together with much valuable and excellent information, is to be found in The Teaching of Biology in the Swond*ry School by Lloyd and Bigelow I Longmans, Green &amp; Co.. I a volume indi*i ensable to all progressive teachers of physiology. EThe prime consideration in the acceptation of a high school course ihysiology for credit is that the teacher shall have had a special ning in the teaching of physiology in a college, normal school or rersity where such courses for teachers are offered.

No study surpasses zoology in cultivating power of ob - ation, description, analysis and reasoning. The regular laboratory work should cover the study of a limited number of carefully selected types, and should be accompanied by notes and drawings in all cases. A series of typical forms should be mastered rather than a superficial study made of a larger number of animals. </seg>
            <seg id="p539">498 Fphasis shoulJ be laid upon animal activities rather than upon the ite detail of structure. The course should begin preferably with lower, simpler forms and proceed gradually to those more compli - cated. This plan should be followed when the course is in the eleventh or twelfth grade; if it is offered earlier the teacher may find it better to begin with an introductory study of a few familiar animals such as the frog and the locust, and to follow this with a closer study of type forms in their logical order. A collection of local animals should be made by teachers and pu - pils, not only because these forms are of value as demonstration mate - rial, but also because the collecting will sustain and stimulate interest. The teacher should plan to repress the spirit of indiscriminate collec - tion or destruction of animal life. To add to local forms a collection illustrating the great groups of animal life, especially those not repre - sented in the region, will be of real value to the school and will mate - rially assist in giving the pupils correct ideas regarding the forms of which they read. Some time should be given to excursion and study in the laboratory of nature. Such work must be laid out very definitely to prevent its becoming desultory and losing its educational value. It is wise to se - lect a unit of environment and to subject it to careful study rather than to attempt to cover much territory. PThe economic side of the subject should be brought to the at - tion of the class. The life history of insects is interesting, easily studied, and of great importance in an agricultural state. The knowl - edge of birds should also be carefully considered, and the relations of animals, such as flies and mosquitoes, in carrying disease should be clearly illustrated. Such problems are naturally studied in connection with field work and should be fixed in the minds of pupils by actual examples. When directed by a teacher of thorough preparation in the subject the course in zoology will be one of the most valuable and attractive in the entire curriculum. The department of zoology will gladly advise regarding equipment, material, and details of the course. Texts Jordan, Kellogg, and Heath. Animal Studies. Appleton. Kellogg, V. L. Elementary Zoology.

It is a fact that a large per cent of the fires in this country arise from preventable causes, and is usually the result of carelessness or neglect in handling this very useful servant of mankind. The authorities of different states have recognized the necessity of the reduction of fire waste, and to that end proclamations have been issued by executives of cities and states setting forth the necessity of some concerted action to focus public attention on this subject and set - ting apart days to be known as "Fire Days." Other states, through their legislatures, have enacted laws pro - viding for the observance of Fire Day, and have also created the office of Fire Marshal for the purpose of carrying on a campaign of education, and reduction of fire waste. The state of Nebraska is in the vanguard, in so far as legislation is concerned, along this line.

If the people of the country can be brought to realize the enormous and unnecessary loss that the nation suffers every year, every day, and every hour, they would look aghast at the figures and be frightened as the knowledge of it dawned upon them. The stupendous fire waste suffered in this country each year has been justly termed our National Folly. The annual per capita fire waste in the In ted States is esti - mated at $2.51, and in Europe only :!3 cents. In France there is a law. dating from the time of Napoleon, which provides that if a fire stat your house or property and damages the property of your neighbor. </seg>
            <seg id="p543">502 you are liable to the owner thereof. If a law similar to tfiis were passed in this country, there is no doubt but that fire losses would be mate - rially reduced; as over half of the fires that occur could be avoided if proper care were exercised in the handling of explosives and not per - mitting rubbish and other inflammable material to accumulate in and about buildings. This is an age of progress and 1 know of no better field for ad - vancement than in the education of the present generation along the lines of Fire Prevention, and there is no subject that can be made more interesting and profitable and that will have a more lasting effect and will be the means of saving the lives and property of the people than the study of Explosives, Dangerous and Careless Practices, and How to Prevent Disaster by Fire. It will not be possible to cover every phase of the subject in this one publication, but we hope to inaugurate in some small degree a system that will improve conditions and in a meas - ure fulfill the intention of the law under which this book is published.

INTRODUCTION To School Boards and Teachers of Nebraska: Pt the thirty-second session of the legislature of Nebraska a law lacted establishing a "Fire Day," and provisions were made for tervance. In compliance with this law the Chief Deputy Fire issioner has arranged this book of instruction on the subject of Dangers." Ee loss of life and property has been so great the past few years iny states have made laws regulating the use of inflamnia!&gt;l&lt; - ces which tend to lessen the disasters caused by fire. Nebraska akened to the fact that to reach the highest efficiency in any iking the children of the state must be aroused to see the need movement contemplated. The law requires that thirty minutes be devoted to the subject of fire dangers each month. The plan of this text-book is such that every school may be teaching a similar subject at the same time, thus making a uniform crusade against "Fire Dangers." The "State Fire Day" as fixed by law is the first Friday in Novem - ber, and there shall be appropriate exercises for the day on the subject. Fire drills are recommended as a part of the special day program. We suggest that the program be arranged to arouse an interest in the law and in its enforcement. Each teacher should select appropriate songs and recitations suitable for the day. Have compositions written on some of the fire dangers. Teachers should have pupils clip from papers all notices about fires </seg>
            <seg id="p544">503 B should be made on the clippings for the information of , rents. Be trust school boards, teachers, parents, and pupils will so in - themselves in the study of "Fire Dangers" and in the "S ay" program that excellent reports may be made on the results combined efforts to lessen fire disasters. .IAS.

As the lectures, of necessity, had to be abbreviated, it will be necessary for you to make some pre - vious study and preparation, in order to successfully present them 10 your pupils. Efe have prepared a pledge that we are very anxious to have you on the blackboard, and have the children copy it with pen and d take it home so their parents will become interested. We also request you to loan this book to the clergymen of your school district, and request them to prepare and deliver a sermon a some Sunday in October on the subjects in general, and also to deliver a sermon on the December subject in December, and the May suoject in May. The clergymen of this state are the conservators of moral and spiritual life of a community, and will certainly assist their people to conserve their property by advising them to take pre - cautionary measures to protect and preserve their lives and property. The first Friday in November has been designated by law as State Fire Day. It will devolve upon you to make these exercises as interesting as possible. You can prepare a program that will be very interesting and profitable, by having several of the children write com - positions on the subjects we have taken up in the book. Appropriate songs should be sung, and a general discussion by the children of the. tauses and dangers of fires, and the great loss of life and property from fire. etc. Be sure and invite the fathers and mothers of your pupils I attend the Fire Day exercises; we want them to become interested, least once each month have a fire drill; see how quickly you can rch the children out in order. PWe trust that you will catch the spirit and enter into this work great interest, and the inculcating of knowledge and habits into minds of the children under your tutorship will have a lasting effect, and will be a means of spreading a knowledge, not only to the present, but future generations, that will conserve and protect life and property, and you will have the satisfaction of having had an im - portant part in this great work which is being installed in the schools of several of the states of the Union.

            <seg id="p551">510 HKK: ITS ORIGIN AND DANUKKK Since the foundation of the world fire has been considered the greatest agency for the comfort and use of mankind of any of the great forces. Fire is the agency that furnishes artificial light; it also furnishes the heat for the preparation of food and for the heating of the homes of the people of the entire world. There is no country where it is not necessary for cooking and lighting, and but very few climates whern it s not necessary for heating. It is not strange that an element in such general use by all classes of people becomes, when carlessty handled, a dangerous element, and that great damage to property and loss of life result from it. During the past few years inventive genius in the manufacture of explosives has largely increased the dangers from fire. Owing to this fact there has been a greatly increased number of disastrous fires and greater loss of life. Before the advent of kerosene oil, gasoline, acetylene, and other dangerous oils and minerals used for lighting and heating purposes. the danger to life and property by fire was very small, as the light used he tallow candle or animal grease with a cotton wick in a dish, and the only fuel used was wood or coal. Of late years, since the advent of kerosene, gasoline, naptha, and calcium carbide, which are used for illuminating, heating, cooking, and power, the dangers have been great - ly increased and the loss of life and property have reached such appall - ing figures that it has become necessary to forcibly impress the people with the great responsibility that rests upon each citizen in the hand - ling of these dangerous fire agencies. During the past five years the average annual fire loss in the United States was over $200,000,000; there wag $500 worth of proper - ty destroyed every minute of the day and night. A very large part of these fires was caused either through ignorance or rarelessness and could have been avoided if proper care and judgment had been a- NOTE. — Teachers will please read the above aloud to pupils. SKITKMHKK I.KSSOX LKCTUKK. MATCHES The match is a very useful but dangerous article. It is the source of nearly every fire that occurs, whether by legitimate use or by care - lessness. Every year hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of prop - erty is destroyed and hundreds of lives are lost through the careless use of the match. Our foiefathers had.no matches. When they desired to start a fire they used a flint stone and a piece of rough steel and held some tow close to the flint so that the sparks made by striking the flint with the steel would ignite the tow. By blowing upon it they would fan it in- </seg>
            <seg id="p552">FIRE PREVENTION. 511 IS to a flame and in that way started a fire. It was no uncommon thing for neighbors to borrow fire of each other, and when a fire was well started it was covered with ashes at night in order to preserve it from day to day. The first matches were invented in 1H27 and were very i rude Since that time a great many improvements have been made in the match. The matches in use today will produce a blaze much more readily than the old style, and owing to that fact they have become much more dangerous, as it takes less friction to explode them. A great many of the matches manufactured now will explode if they are stepped upon or if they come in contact with the least amount of fric - tion. Owing to this fact great care should be exercised that matches are not carelessly thrown upon the floor or left where children can obtain them, or where rats and mice can bite them. Very often people are burned by stepping on matches and their clothing catching fire. Matches have been known to ignite the clothing of people who carried them in their pocket. The slight friction of the matches rubbing to- gether was sufficient to ignite them, set the clothing on fire and severely burn the person carrying them. Matches should always be kept in metal boxes. Children, under no circumstances, should be permitted to use matches; especially little girls, because their clothing is of such an inflammable nature that the flame from a match may set fire to it and burn or disfigure them for life, if it does not kill them outright. Never light a match in a closet or attic where clothes are kept. The head of the match may fly off and set the clothing on fire. A great many fires that occur, where thousands of dollars worth of property is destroyed, are caused by children playing with matches. Some children amuse themselves by starting bonfires in rubbish and brush, the fire gets beyond their control, spreads and destroys houses, barns and other buildings, and sometimes the lives of the children themselves. OCTOBKK I,KSSOX LECTURE. CHIMNEYS AND FLUES. One of the principal causes of the destruction of the home by fire is the defective flue. There is ordinarily too little attention paid to construction of the chimney or flues especially in private houses. Chimneys are usually constructed of brick and mortar and are only four inches thick. They are exposed to the elements above the roof and the action of the rain and wind upon the mortar causes it to crumble and wash out from between the brick, leaving a space that permits of smoke and fire coming out. As the smoke is hot it dries the roof boards and shingles so that they are liable to catch fire. The annual property loss caused by defective chimneys in the United States is over $40,000,000. This is an age of improvement </seg>
            <seg id="p553">512 along the line of architecture and in the construction of buildings, but there is- no place where great care can be as profitably exercised as in the construction of the chimneys. Where it is possible to do so chimneys should be built from the basement up through the build - ing to a point at least four feet above the highest point of the same. The foundation should be of brick or stone, laid in cement mortar; there should be a clean-out hole in the base of the chimney so that all soot and sediment can be removed. The chimney should be so constructed that no woodwork is connected to it, so that if the chimney should settle it will not be supported by the woodwork and cause an opening in the chimney between the brick. There should be a fire-clay or terra-cotta lining in the chimney, so that in case the action of the wind on the house causes the house to vibrate and break the mortar joints of the chimney the lining will prevent any fire or smoke passing through between the bricks. The fire-clay lining is the better lining for chimneys as it costs less and will stand more heat than terra-cotta. All joints and cracks around the lining should be slushed with good cement or fire-clay mortar, so that the chimney will be solid from the ground to the top. There should be a stone or cement cap placed on the top of the chimney, of at least one inch larger size than the chimney, so that the rain will not run down the side of the chimney and wash, out the mortar. Chimney thimbles should be placed as far from the ceiling and the woodwork of the house as possible and great care should be taken in placing them firmly in the chimney. Fire-clay mortar should be used in fastening them in their place. Where it is not possible to extend the chimney into the basement, it should at least go below the floor line of the second story and rest upon a substantial platform placed in the center of the partition, so that the weight of the chimney will rest directly upon the studding. No chimney should be placed upon a side bracket, as the weight of the chimney will cause it to lean out into the room and open the seams, thus permitting the smoke and heat to escape and set the building on fire. No stovepipe should be permitted to pass through the floor or ceiling, if there is a possible way of avoiding it, and there are very few cases when a house is constructed but what it can be so arranged. When it cannot be avoided, a large metal venti - lator should be used. Bvery chimney should be thoroughly cleaned out at least twin to prevent the accumulated soot from catching fire and throw - e sparks out onto the dry roof and setting the house on fire. One of the great aggravations is a chimney that does not have sufficient draft, causing the stove to smoke and poisonous gases to be emitted through the house. If a chimney is built with a large flue and straight and to extend at least three or tour feet above the high - est point of the house, and then is cleaned out occasionally, there will be sufficient draft to carry off all smoke and gases .and there will </seg>
            <seg id="p554">513 ■ inconveniences and trouble from this ■— wtt. Every chimney be carefully inspected at least twice a year, and no chimney pass through an attic where there is no access to it for tli f inspection. Do not forget the old adage that "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," and that a little time spent in inspecting the chimney may prevent the destruction of your home ;ui&lt;l pi - the loss of life. \o\ KMUKIt I.KSSON LKfTlRK. STOVES AND STOVEPIPES Eiere is no economy in the purchase and use of a cheap and constructed stove or heatias; apparatus. Especially is this the cook stove, which is used almost continuously every day year. A well constructed stove or heating apparatus is less liable to cause a fire that will destroy the home, if it is properly installed, is much more economical in the amount of fuel used to produce the heat necessary for warming the house or for cooking, and will oat - last the cheap and poorly constructed article. Thousands of dollars worth of property is destroyed every year by '"overheated stoves." One of the principal reasons for overheating is the purchasing of too small a stove for the work, and it bei omes necessary in order to obtain the requisite amount of heat to open all drafts and fill the stove completely with fuel. If a larger stove were used the fire would not have to be forced, the stove would not be overheated, this danger would be averted, and there would be a great saving of fuel. r Every stove should have a stove board covered with metal, or asbestos metal-covered sheet placed under it so that the floor underneath the stove will not be overheated and take fire. A great many fires are caused and a large amount of property is destroyed each year by neglecting this simple precaution. Stovepipes should fit tightly upon the stove, should be securely fastened together and wired substantially, and a tightfitting metal collar should be placed upon the pipe next to the chimney. One of the reasons why stoves do not draw better sometimes is because the pipe-joints are open and the draft of the stove is affected. If all stovepipe joints are airtight and the chimney of sufficient size, the draft of the stove will be perfect, which is necessary for good servit • frequent intervals stovepipes should be examined carefully, as the steam from fuel and the sulphur and salt fumes from coal have a deteriorating effect upon the metal in the pipes and will cause them to nnt on the inside.

            <seg id="p555">514 Great care should be taken to see that the wall paper does not come in contact with the stovepipe.

DECKMIIEK LESSON" LECTURE. CHRISTMAS. PWe all look forward with great expectancy and pleasure to the tmas-time. To the young it means happiness by the receiving giving of presents on the holiday they enjoy from their school and other duties, and the feasting upon good things provided by their parents and friends. To the older people it is a reminder of the birth of the Savior of mankind who came upon earth to bring peace and good will and whose life has been and always will be an inspira - tion for better living. Nothing should occur upon Christmas eve or at any of the exercises being held in commemoration of the day to mar the happiness and pleasure attending it. f Christmas-tree exercises are very common in this country and are in a great many instances very dangerously arranged. In : to represent snow, which is typical of the Christmas-time, the is sometimes surrounded by cotton, and ornamented with cotton, mmable ornaments and tinsel to represent snow and frost. The presents for the children are hung upon the tree, a large number of little candles are fastened to the branches and lighted in order to give the tree a bright and pleasing effect. A spark of fire from one of these little candles ni'ght ignite the cotton upon or under the tree and cause a conflagration that would destroy the building and cause a great loss of life. E Christmas-trees are all right and the children ought to be given opportunity to enjoy them, but cotton or other inflammable material uld never be placed on or around a Christmas-tree. A ( hristnias-tree without a Santa Claus. to the average child, does not fulfil its mission and it is a common practice for some - one to impersonate the character. Usually a gray fur coat, a long cotton wig and beard are used, and Santa Claus is the one that takes the presents from the tree and hands them to the children. His fur coat and cotton trimmings, long beard and wig are placed in close proximity to the lighted candles, and" not only Santa Claus, but the children who usually congregate around him in the expectancy of re - ceiving gifts are in a most dangerous position.

RLBBISH AND ASHES. An accumulation of rubbish in and around buildings is dangerous. Rubbish becomes dry and is easily ignited by a spark from a chimney or by children playing with matches. It is of no account, and should not be permitted to accumulate. It is very little trouble to destroy each day's accumulation of old papers, rags, etc.. and if every one will follow this practice fires from this source will cease. Greasy rags and waste, as well as other combustible materials, when allowed to accumulate in piles in buildings, closets, and alleys, will become decomposed and heated and cause spontaneous combus - tion which destroys property. Bit is not convenient to burn the rubbish each day, a metal cle with cover should be provided and all paper, rags, and other 188 trash should be put into it. carted away occasionally and where there will be no danger of destroying other property. Ashes thrown out in streets, alleys and back yards, or put in open or wooden receptacles, are dangerous from a fire standpoint and are a nuisance. Hardly a day passes but what we read of disastrous fires from ashes. Of course, the person throwing them out thinks there is no fire left in them, but perhaps there is just enough to come to life when fanned by the wind and set everything around on fire. There is another good reason why ashes should not be thrown out where the wind can blow and scatter them. We all like to breathe pure air. but air filled with ashes is by no means pure and the dust fills our eyes and lungs and injures our sight and health, and also fills our clothes with dust that is very hard to clean off. Ashes should be put in a metal can with a tight cover and emptied where they will not injure health or property. KKBRl'AKY L.KSSOX LKCTURK. KEROSENE. Kerosene is the refined product of mineral oil known as petroleum. The oil is pumped from the ground through deep-bored wells and is usually found in coal-producing districts. The oil as it comes from the </seg>
            <seg id="p557">516 End looks like tar or molasses. The raw product is put through process of refining and from it is derived kerosene, gasoline and ha, and several other products which are lubricants and not mmable oil. The improved process used in refining the kerosene oil has made it much less inflammable, as the dangerous gases are extracted and form the gasoline and naptha product. Kerosene oil is used for illuminating purpose's principally, but there are several makes of kerosene stoves, both for heating and cooking. The principal danger from kerosene oil is in permitting the oil to become old and stale in the lamp and to attain a large amount of impurities by reason of the lighter oil being taken up by the flame and leaving the heavier and more dangerous part of the oil in the lamp. This will also cause a bad odor from the lamp when it is burning. All this sediment should be emptied frequently so that this accumulation of impure and danger - ous oil will be destroyed. The burners should be throughly washed and cleaned in soap-suds, so that the little air flue leading into the lamp at the side of the wick will always be open to allow the gases that accumulate to escape. A lamp turned down low should never be left burning. This is a common practice where people desire to have a limited amount of light, and is very dangerous. It is liable to cause a lamp to explode by reason of the draft of the lamp not being sufficient to draw off the accumulating gases from the oil through the little tube that is open by the side of the wick. As the gas is not consumed, it is thrown out into the room and poisons the air and is not only dangerous -but is very unhealthy. Where a small amount of light is desired a small lamp should be used and permitted to burn to its fullest capacity. A lamp should never be filled when lit, or by artificial light, other than electric, nor should a lamp be extinguished by blow - ing down a chimney, as a strong draft of breath might cause the blaze t follow the wick down into the oil and gas below the burner cause an explosion. When you want to extinguish the lamp. 1 it down slowly until it goes out. The kerosene-oil stove used for heating and cooking works on the same principle as the lamp and should be treated in the same manner, as the stove and the lamp both use burners and wicks of the same construction, but the volume of oil used in the stove is so much greater that the accumulation of heavy oil in the receptacle should be changed more frequently and the wicks should never be allowed to become foul from the accumulation of soot and greasy substances that may have boiled over when cooking on the stove. PUways keep lamp and oil stove burners clean and never allow a to become soaked with foul oil or sediment. It is a common practice to start fires in stoves by pouring kerosene oil on kindling and cobs after they are placed in the </seg>
            <seg id="p558">517 worth of property destroyed and hundreds of lives lost every year by this practice. If you desire to use kerosene to start a (ire, put your kindling wood or cobs in a metal receptacle, pour the kerosene onto the kindling or cobs out of doors and then put it in the stove with your wood or coal and there will be no danger of an explosion from this source. Leave your can outside away from the stove. Knot throw water on flame*.: which start from kerosene oil. tends to spread the blaze. Smother the flames with a carpet, heavy clothing. MARCH LKSSOX LECTIKK. GASOLINE AND NAPTHA Gasoline and naptha are derived from the refining of petroleum oil. They are used for the manufacture of gas for illuminating, cook - ing, and power purposes, and also for cleaning clothes. They are very dangerous fluids and are the means of destroying more property and lives than any other of the explosives now in use. In the United States every year over three thousand homes are burned and- about $3,000,000 in other property- destroyed, while nearly 5,000 persons are badly scarred and at least 1,000 lose their lives, as the result of the careless use and handling of gasoline. A gasoline stove makes work easy for the cook, but it is danger - ous to have in your home unless every precaution is taken in the handling of the gasoline and the managing of the stove. A gasoline stove should never be filled when lit or by artifical light as the vapor of the gasoline will reach the blaze and an explosion will follow. The tank on a gasoline stove should never be filled completely fall, as when the gasoline warms it expands and the pressure on the tank might open the seams. Never keep a gasoline can in the kitchen; in fact, it should never be kept anywhere in the house. There should be a place provided for it on the outside, away from fire and artificial light. Gasoline should be kept in tightly closed cans, and. under the laws of this state, no one is permitted to keep it in anything that is not painted a vermillion red. Gasoline vapor takes up 1M times as much space as the gasoline from which it comes. This vapor in the air forms a deadly explosive gas which will take fire from a blaze or flame and explode. It is from this vapor that automobiles and gasoline engines get their power. Gasoline is the cheapest fuel for running small engines and automobiles that can be procured and when handled carefully out in the open they are not as dangerous E gasoline stoves or lamps, as they are usually handled by expe - persons. The only fire danger from them is in having the oline about. One of the most dangerous uses of gasoline ife the cleaning of clothes. Every week there are from fifteen to twenty persons burned </seg>
            <seg id="p559">518 dollars worth of property destroyed. Gasoline should be used for cleaning out of doors only, and away from all buildings. Gasoline should never be thrown into a sink, cess-pool or sewer, but should be carried away and emptied out on soft ground in the open air. Pring the past winter in Lincoln in one of the clothes cleaning hments the clothes were washed in gasoline out in the open after the gasoline had been wrung out the clothes were hung over a steam radiator in the store to dry. The warm air from the radiator and the gas from the clothes formed such a volume of gas that when the proprietor struck a match to light a gas stove an explosion took place, which did $5.00(1 in damage and nearly cost three lives-'. Windows were broken across a 100-foot street and the building was completely wrecked. The most dangerous way of lighting is by gasoline. There is no such thing made as a safe gasoline lamp. Some may be safer than others, but gasoline or gasoline gas is just as dangerous when com - ing from a well-made receptacle as from a poor one. If the receptacle holding the gasoline and the carbureter are on the outside, away from the building, the danger of an explosion is somewhat reduced. eis any other way possible in which to obtain light, the gasoline should not be used except in a large city plant where the ir System" can be employed. APRIL LK88ON I-KCTl'RE. CALCIUM CARBIDE AND ACETYLENE GAS Calcium carbide is a product manufactured from quick lime and coke, ground and baked together in an electric arc furnace at a heat of about 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit. After it is cooled it is crushed and screened and packed in metal cans of various sizes to be used for the manufacturing of calcium and acetylene light. The flame from acetylene makes a bright and colorless light and the flame gives off less heat and less poison than any other illuminating gas. y*retylene gas is more dangerous than gasoline gas, as a flame led to explode gasoline vapor, while a soldering iron, or other it metal, a pipe or glowing coal will explode acetylene gas. n carbide in itself will not cause an explosion, but when it in contact with water the gas is generated and the gas when by artifical light will cause an explosion. E Acetylene gas has such a decidedly offensive smell that its odor give notice of its presence, and an artificial light should never sed in a room, basement or building where the odor of acetylene can be detecfed. The volume of gas that passes through the holes in the burner </seg>
            <seg id="p560">519 is ignited, as the holes in the burner are so fine that there is not enough of the gas to cause an explosion and it is entirely consumed by the flame as fast as it escapes through the holes. I would advise that an acetylene machine should not be placed in the cellar or basement underneath a house, for the reason that when the machine is being flushed and cleaned it emits an offensive, filthy odor which passes all through the house, and in case of a leak in the machine the gas will fill the basement and pass through the house and come in contact with the fire or artificial light and is liable to cause a disastrous explosion. During the last few months in this state several people have been killed and a number of buildings wrecked by people hunting leaks in acetylene machines and pipes or the escaping gas coming in contact with artificial light. The safest way to install an acetylene gas machine is to place it away from the house or building in which the gas it to be used, in an underground cave where the water will not freeze in the machine. In case there is a leak in the machine or pipes they should be repaired by daylight, and no artificial light should ever be used near the machine or pipes. Ecave should be so constructed that sufficient natural light will furnished to fill, clean and repair the machine, and should be iciently provided with ventilators to carry off all escaping gas. The cans of carbide used for filling the generator should always be kept in a dry place away from the house and should be kept sealed, both air and water tight. If air comes in contact with the carbide, it will air-slack and become worthless; and if water comes in con - tact with it, it will generate a gas in the cans which will explode if it comes in contact with artificial light. MAY LESSOX LECTURK. INDEPENDENCE DAY. Blie Fourth of July is looked forward to by both young and a day in which to celebrate the birth of the greatest nation world. Patriotism on that day is usually aroused to the highest and there seem to be many different ways of showing one's iation of the freedom and liberty that we enjoy. RThe most common way to arouse enthusiasm among the young and girls seems to be the use of the firecracker, the torpedo. oy pistol, roman candle, sky rocket, and other ways of making id noise or bright light. Usually the boys and girls in whose hands these deadly articles are placed have no idea of the danger that attends them and it is not until after the deadly work has been accomplished that they realize they have been playing with death and destruction. On July Fourth, 1910, there were 2,923 persons injured in the United States, and of this number 131 died; 67 deaths were due to tetanus or lock-jaw and 19 were caused outright by firearms, 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p561">520 Bvances; there were 72 cases of lock-jaw; 40 people lost their 26 lost arms, legs or hands; 141 lost fingers, while 26, mostly girls, were burned to death by fire from fireworks. This is a start - ling showing, but it has been materially reduced since 1903. when there were nearly double the number injured and four times as many lives lost. The reduction in injuries and fatalities has been brought about largely by the education of the fathers and mothers and children, and also by the dealers in these deadly explosives discontinuing the sale of them. I recently saw a picture and underneath it was inscribed "The Day After the Fourth." Reclining upon a couch was a little boy about ten years old; a bandage was over his eyes; his mother kneeling beside the couch; her prostrate body was thrown across the body of her boy; she was crying bitterly, while the father and the doctor stood by gazing upon the little sufferer with a look upon their faces that depicted despair. Only the day before this little boy started out to celebrate Independence Day, just as you boys and girls will start out on the coming Fourth of July. He had spent the money that was given him to celebrate Independence Day for dangerous explosives; he touched them off and his eyes paid the penalty. During all of his after life he must grope his way in darkness; the beauties of nature were closed to him forever. This is a sad but true picture, and yet is only one of hundreds of cases that occur each year as Independence Day comes around. Children, read over the description of this picture, commit it to memory and impart it to others and then use your influence to see that every effort is put forth to avoid an occurrence of this kind. We should all be happy and joyous, and show our appreciation of the rvileges and liberty that we enjoy by reason of the efforts put th by our forefathers in fighting for and obtaining their indepen - dence, which has "been preserved and handed down to us by the patrio - tism and loyalty of the citizens of this Republic, but let us so observe the day that it will forcibly remind us that we must do our share in the preserving and upholding of the dignity and freedom of American institutions and show our intelligence by observing Independence Day in a Safe and Sane manner. JUNE LESSON LECTURE. FIRE INSURANCE. Fire insurance is a voluntary t&amp;K paid through different agencies. or companies, for the purpose of distributing over the entire community the great financial loss and distress caused by the destruction of property by fire, thereby avoiding ruin and disaster to individuals. Fire insurance does not and cannot replace the destroyed property. Every fire, no matter whether large or small, takes from the wealth </seg>
            <seg id="p562">521 ing or property, valued at $10,000, is fully insured does not alter the circunistanre8 and the community is $10,000 poorer than before the fire. The owner who first suffered the loss on account of the fire, can take the money received from the insurance company and replace the property, but a large number of people, through their contri - bution to the fund that paid the loss, are out their proportionate share of the money. So on through the years, those who avail themselves of the protection of fire insurance continue contributing to those who lose by tire. All losses by fires are not made good by insurance, or. to state it better, are not distributed by insurance. As the tax by which the money is raised is voluntary, in order for a person to participate in the benefits it is necessary to contract to help to pay the losses of others. Such a contract is called a policy of insurance, and the peculiar province of such a contract is shown by the following accepted defini - tion: A fire insurance insurance policy is a contract to indemnify t holder thereof for actual destruction, by a certain immediate &gt;. namely, fire, of value appertaining to certain specific prop - owned by him. P Analyzing the definition it will be found that insurance is for lal loss sustained. This is so that no profit may come to an ividual at the expense of the community through the destruction property. A policy is limited in its terms to a certain amount, and the holder cannot recover to exceed that sum under any circum - stances; but if the value of the property destroyed does not equal L limit of the policy, the person holding a policy can recover only he value destroyed by the fire. Again our definition embraces the matter of value and means the worth in money, or what is known as market value. No account is taken of the sentimental or the personal value of the property to the assured. The property insured may be an article such as a piece of furniture with which the owner would not part for hundreds of dollars, but which has a market value or exchange value of only one Ellar. As the community is making good to the individual only the is to the community, actual value is the basis of the indemnity. Kien. too, insurance reimburses only for value at the time of the hether that value be more or less than the original cost of the ty destroyed. En the definition, "immediate result of fire" means that the ince would pay not only for property actually consumed by but also for loss or damage to remaining property caused by imoke, and water or other process of putting out fire. A policy of insurance does not follow the property insured. It is a personal contract and insures the holder, not the property. This means that no person who does not have an interest in the property or does not own it can be paid for its destruction by fire from the insurance funds. The property to be insured must be specified in </seg>
            <seg id="p563">522 the contract; that is, the description must set forth every article insured or be written in terms broad enough to include the property, or every - thing intended to be Insured. The insurance arrangement is also affected for a defnite period of time, called the term. This is also stated definitely in the policy, and is a material part of the agreement. The location of the property is important another fact, having a decisive effect upon the insur - ance. All contracts, to be binding, must have a consideration. In the case of insurance this consideration is called the premium and the rate of premium or the amount charged varies necessarily with different localities and on different kinds of property, for some sections are ob - viously more liable to fire than others and certain kinds of property are much more subject to destruction by fire than other kinds. At the first glance a policy of insurance seems to be an extremely technical and involved contract. When, however, the great number of contingencies against which it must provide are taken into considera - tion this is found not to be the case. That a general understanding may be possible, most states have adopted what is known as a "Stand - ard Policy;" that is, the provisions and wording of all policies of insur - ance are made identical, no matter what company issues the contract. </seg>

Huntington of the Nebraska Wesleyan University, President D. B. Perry of Doane College, .anil Examiner Clifford M. Penney of this department, — it is fitting that the biennial report of the state superintendent contain a brief state - ment of each of these five men who have stood out so prominently among the school men of Nebraska. Each by his perseverance and personality left an impress that will not be forgotten. Those who knew these men intimately have nothing but words of praise for the work done by them. Each one was unselfish in his duties. Sacrifice of time, money and health was a special trait of each. They gave largely of all they possessed of this world's goods — not that they might reap a reward, but that the "cause of humanity" might be uplifted and that the Master's work might be advanced. t Following are a few short statements of the lives and characters these five honored and respected men who were so recently in r midst. JAMES E. DELZELL, State Superintendent WILLIAM ROBERTS JACKSOX. State Superintendent of Nebraska 1897-1901. Born at Marengo, McHenry county, Illinois, May. 17, 1860; died at University Place, Nebraska, January 9, 1912. When the word was passed around on Tuesday that Professor W. It. Jackson had departed this life at ten o'clock that morning, there was universal sorrow and deep sense of loss. The community has lost one of its most public spirited and progressive citizens, the church a stalwart son, and the state a man who has been a large factor in civic righteous - ness, and heaviest of all, his family has lost a devoted husband and ■&gt;id we not believe that his tireless activities have been but trans - to a more transcendent field the pain would be keen to endure. Professor Jackson has been in broken health for more than eigh - teen months. Several times within that period he has been bedfast for weeks. His boundless energy had, however, kept him abroad much of the time when he should have been husbanding his strength; particu- </seg>

He always had a marvelous capacity for work and could not give up unless abso - lutely without strength to net aLu.ut. He was last away from his home (,n December l.'.th when he attended a meeting of the Board of Educa - tion, of which he was a valuable member. He was deeply interested in the projected new high school building, and attended to business con - nected with the bond election when his strength had almost ebbed. His last intelligible words were concerning the school bonds on the morning of his death. Until a few hours before his passing he remained con - fident that he would recover. Professor Jaskson was born at Marengo, 111., in 1860. He was educated in the rural schools, the Marengo high school and Evansville seminary. He was an ambitiors student to th ■ day of his death stantly plying his work in the courses of the state university, where, at the time of his death, his work was almost i^npMfi for h"'s Ph. O. Last In* he celebrated the twenty-nfth anniversary of his mar - riage to Miss Hernice Thompson, and the friends who were with them at that time will not soon forget the tender words of appreciation he spoke of his beloved companion. Five children are left for the mother's comfort, a heritage of the happy years spent together. In 1888 Mr. and MrB. Jackson came to Nebraska, engaging in school work as sin tendent of the high school at Kwing, which position he held for six years until his election as superintendent of Holt county schools, where he served until 1896, when he was elected state superintendent of schools for Nebraska. In 189S he was re-elected to this position, and held this place until the close of his term when he became i onn with the Nebraska Wesleyan I'niversity as the head of the Teacher's College. There are scores of teachers throughout this and other states who revere his memory today, and who bless him, not alone for the Eogical training they have received from him. but for the example pgrity, sweetness of spirit and strength of character he has given Ehen Governor Aldrich was installed as governor he estal&gt; (dent for which he received much commendation, when he ap- Mr. Jackson, of opposite political faith, who had not himself made application for the place, to the position of Pure Food Commis - sioner. If any man doubted the wisdom of the governor's choice, his fears have long since been allayed, for a better administration has never been given the state of Nebraska. He was as was his wont, quiet and unassuming, but possessed of strong convictions and indefatigable and determined activities, he has been a powerful factor for pure foods in oar state.

Mr. \V. R. Jackson was one of God's noblemen, kind and obliging to a fault. He had exceptionally high ideals and was absolutely trust - worthy in all his dealings. Though anticipated for some time, the news of his death was a great shock and pained like that of a brother. H!s disposition was such that it may be truthfully said, if he did not love you he did not know you. He represented in his life the truest idea K Christian service, strong, pure, able, willing. The State will miss i and search long for his equal. For ten years past he has been a student in the X'niversity of Ne - braska and I had come to know him and admire him. He was ambitious and a true student until the last. At the time of his death he was work - ing on a thesis for the doctor's degree. In serving others he neglected himself and his own. G. W. A. LUCKILY •THE FRIEND OF ALL El have known Professor W. R. Jackson about fifteen years, and for greater part of that time somewhat intimately. It is no exaggera - to say that he possessed in rare number and measure those char - acteristics which won for him the high respect and admiration of all who knew him. kHe was one of the most unselfish of men, always forgetting him - f in his efforts to help others. His time and energy were always at ? command of those who needed assistance. His spirit was kindly to - irde the erring; he enjoyed the happiness of others. His opponents were never regarded as enemies; his successors were honored and con- E'ated. At the same time his conscientiousness was as inflexible as ?rnal hills. He was the friend of all but the tool of none. With uty and right were decisions from which there was no appeal. Mr. Jackson was an indomitable worker. He never spared himself when something was to be done. Sleep and meals gave way before any - thing pressing in his work. His willingness to work multiplied the calls upon his service. Not alone the University, but the community and the various activities of the church of which he was a member all bui hands upon his time and energy. Few men die of over work, provided they work without worry or artificial stimulants,' though many are credited with that honor whose neighbors had never thought them in </seg>

In the years ".».:. ':u and "»J Mr. Jackson and I worked together in North Nebraska, at the district meetings and oratorical contests, held at Fremont, Columbus and Norfolk. Some trials beset us, and we tried compromise, but when compromise spelled aught but the right, Mr Jackson was unwavering, even though the straight and narrow way promised disaster for his school or his contestant. E^hen I succeeded Mr. Jackson in office in 1901, there again I that the conduct of that office hail been along lines of the strict - tegrity and faithfulness, the most honorable dealing, and right, always the right, unflinchingly, unswervingly. There was no Bcension and no fawning. His dealings were as man to man. Mr. Jackson loved the schoolroom, but he loved his church and his home too. If homes like his were the rule rather than the exception, many of the civic and sociological problems which now confront us vould be solved.

The career of the late Professor \V. R. Jackson shows the real value of character and industry in tarrying a man forward in th's lift-. He was a man without the aggressiveness that is often assumed to be necessary to success in politics. He was quiet, gentle, and modest al - most to the point of self effacement. Without commanding ability to draw friends to push him forward, he filled several important position* He was state superintendent of public instruction and at the time of his death occupied the important office of food commissioner. He was chosen to all of these places because people had confidence in his in - tegrity. He was considered a safe man, one who could be trusted to do the r'ght thing as he saw it. These qualities enabled him to pass many a more brilliant and showy man. — Nebraska State Journal. WILLIAM R. JACKSON. Ke three most prominent elements of character in the life and of William R. Jackson, in my estimate of him, were integrity, y and charity. I His integrity was recognized by Governor Aldrich who appointed m food commissioner — a position second to none under our State Government. Professor Jackson was a candidate on the Democratic ticket for the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction (a position which he had filled with honor to himself for two terms some years before ) , in the same campaign when Governor Aldrich was selected as the chief executive of the state on the Republican ticket. Such an appointment is without precedent in the political history of Nebraska, but Governor Aldrich wanted a man whom the interests could neither bribe nor intimidate and so the selection was made on merit alone, fitness being the supreme test. It is regretted that the untimely death of Professor Jackson has deprived the people of t state of a service second only to that of Doctor Harvey W. Wiley he nation. His administration as state superintendent of public instruction stands second to none in the educational history of the state. It was during Superintendent W. R. Jackson's administration •( 1899) that he </seg>
            <seg id="p571">529 Handed down his famous decision relative to the reading uf the BIMa in the public schools. This case was carried through the district court to the Supreme Court, and was finally passed upon by our highest judi - i ial tribunal during Superintendent Fowler's first term, sustaining Mr .iack»«n's ruling on every point. The controversy on this question and the ultimate decision of the court gave Mr. Jackson a national n among the educators of the United States. I He was an untiring worker.

W. H. GARDNER. Committee of County Superintend Lincoln, Nebraska, January 16. 1912. CLIFFORD M. PENNEY This last month* Nebraska lost one of its staunchest and best young men. Clifford Penney had devoted his life to this state. He grew up here. He did his first teaching and all of his teaching here. 'August 12, 1912. RESOLUTIONS </seg>
            <seg id="p572">530 He got his education in the schools of this state, in the state normal school at Peru, and in the State University, of both of which institutions he was a graduate. He had impressed himself upon the educational system of the state as few young men have done. He had done excellent service in rural schools. He was a most effective county superintendent in Boone county. He was a very successful superintendent of schools at Oakland, and an unusually effi - cient high school principal at Blair. At the time of his death he was at the head of the examining board in the state superintendent's office, to which position he was appointed two years ago by State Super - intendent Crabtree. Mr. Penney had qualities not usually combined in one man. He had thorough scholarship. He was a debater and speaker of unusual quality. He was a hard-working, genuinely efficient man at whatever he undertook. He had the best of judgment in handling school prob - lems and always the sympathetic touch in dealing with pupils and with teachers. He had just started on his years of greatest usefulness, and had be been allowed to live out the usual alloted time he would have taken a place at the very head of his chosen profession. His qualities of sincerity, honesty, truthfulness, and genuine loyalty were such as always bring success, when as in his case, they are combined with scholarship and unusual ability. — Nebraska Teacher. •NEBRASKA'S LOSS Kis with sincere regret and deep sorrow that I am called upon to you of the death of Mr. C. M. Penney, who has served as state er in this office for the past eighteen months. Mr. Penney was always courteous, considerate, unassuming, — a true Christian gentleman in every sense of the word. He served the office and the county superintendents faithfully and well, and we shall all miss him from his post of duty. He held a warm place in the hearts of the entire teaching force of the state, having come into close contact with them in the examining department. He was personally known by the alumni of the State University and the Peru State Normal School, always taking an active interest in all matters that tended to promote the best interests of these institutions. Mr. Penney spoke before many of the teacher's associations of the state, at high school commencement exercises, and was well received wherever he went. His life was devoted to his family and to the teach - ing profession. k Words of condolence have been received from all parts of the by both Mrs. Penney and this department, which show the high m in which he was held in the state as an educator.

            <seg id="p575">531 ♦TRUE TO THE COKE I became acquainted with Mr. Penney in 1904 and have known him intimately since that time. I had an opportunity to know him through and through, having known him as: a student in my own school and being consulted often by him during his years in the State Univer - sity and during the time he was principal, superintendent and state examiner. He did not apply for the position he held at the time of his death in the state department. He was one of the most genuine men 1 have ever known. He was faithful and efficient in every position in which he served, and he was true to the core in his relation to his superiors and subordinates alike. In his death an exceptional career is ended and Nebraska loses one of her best educators. J. W. CRABTKEK. DAVID liKAINKKD PKKItY Born March 7, 183» — Died May 21, 1U12. RXfter a severe illness lasting almost throughout the year. Dr. David erd Perry, President of Doane College, is dead. Dr. Perry started all on a trip to the East on business for the college. He got only r as the home of his son in Grand Rapids, where he was taken ill with pneumonia. He weathered the stress of this severe illness only to be taken away a few days ago by a complication of diseases which came as a result of his weakened condition and the long struggle with the first severe illness. Dr. Perry had spent practically his whole life in college work in Nebraska. Immediately after his graduation from Yale, where he took high honors as a student in his under-graduate courses, and where later he took both the Master's Degree and the Degree of Doctor of Divinity, he came to Nebraska because of his health and accepted a frontier assignment at Aurora. A short time later Doane College was founded at Crete and young Dr. Perry was its first teacher and first president. This year is the fortieth anniversary of Doane College and the fortieth anniversary of Dr. Perry's presidency of that institution. Here is truly a remarkable record. Doane College has come to be one of the strong - est and most respected of the small colleges of the West. The plant of the college is now worth about one-half million dollars and there is a large productive endowment in addition to this. All of these things are tgely the result of the devotion, energy and wisdom of one man, Pre« - nt Perry. At the meeting of the Schoolmasters' Club at Lincoln, February 2 of this year. Dr. Perry and Chancellor E. Benjamin Andrews were placed upon the honorary list of the Club. And it was planned at that time to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of Dr. Perry's presidency at Doane at the next meeting of the Club, to be held in May. The program 'The Nebraska Teacher. </seg>
            <seg id="p576">532 for this celebration was all arranged and nine members of the Club had prepared tributes to President Perry's service to education in this state. These tributes were never delivered. When the time cam* - for the May meeting of the Schoolmasters' Club Dr. Perry was not suffi - ciency recovered to attend. It was therefore determined by the Clul&gt; to have these tributes printed and bound and presented to Dr. Perry at the Doane College commencement in June. These tributes are now printed in book form, each tribute being personally signed by its author and the book bound in full Levant. It will be presented to his family as a token of the high esteem in which the father was held by his associates and co-workers in Nebraska. It is impossible to pay proper and deterred tribute to such a man. Doaue College stands as a monument to his memory. There is a large body of devoted alumni to mourn his loss. There is a strong organiza - tion, a devoted faculty, a substantial endowment to continue the work which Dr. Perry has begun so well. His life of service has been his best reward and his memory will be cherished long by those who have known Kd appreciated him, as one of the truest and wisest and best of Ne - iskii's teachers. — The Nebraska Teacher. ON THE DEATH OF PRES. D. B. PERRY. He lived for God — with vision clear To see and do his duty well. To stand for right whate'er befell, And leave a shining pathway here. He lived for men — unselfishly He gave and toiled and suffered pain, Enduring loss for others' gain — Self sacrifice for you and me. He is not dead, but lives again — In others' lives he helped to mould. In many blessed in ways untold, Still walks he with the sons of men. lie is not dead, nor far away; He only rests, his labors done, His race complete, his crown well won. Waiting the Resurrection Day. </seg>

Ft w acts of my life give me greater pleasure than the part I am privileged to take in honoring my dear colleague, friend and brother. President Perry. Me is the greatest schoolmaster in Nebraska. I proudly hail him as Nebraska's Commodore Perry, the head of our edu - cational fleet. Under his command we sail forth, meet our enemies, and they are ours. President Perry and Doane College have, from the first, stood in - flexibly for thorough scholarship and the Christian ideal in education. No language could exaggerate the effect of this, their attitude, upon edu - cation in this growing state. El take it for granted that President Perry has no idea of retiring many a year to come. I certainly hope not. Let our recognition of invaluable service and of his lofty type and ideals of nianhcod help o inspire him that the future of hs pn Kidency shall be even more tful and triumphant than the past! E.

The founder gave his money to establish a Christian college, for the education of generations to come; the builder, through forty years of service, has given his thought, his strength, his life, to the attainment of the founder's ideals. Be has builded patiently, courageously, wisely. Mis mark may be printed indelibly, upon every brick and stone in the buildings, very tree and shrub about the beautiful campus, and upon thou - of lives whom his life has touched.

Yet I esteem it a personal privilege to speak a few words from my heart to this man while we are yet face to face. PA group of tourists visited the studio of Hofmann, with the artist self as a guide. They were shown the dozen or more studies through h the artist reached the child face in his masterpiece, Christ and Doctors. One remarked, as they were leaving, how much the face of the artist was like the idealized face on the canvas — only older grown. All agreed. EWhen one lives close to an ideal he unconsciously approaches that 1 in thought and living, and this finally molds his features. The y of the Great Stone Face is repeated in every community and ev - profession, more especially in those professions where the idealistic lominates over the materialistic. When the discussions in this Club have been too deep for my limited comprehension, or when we have quibbed over a tweedle-dee or a tweedle-dum, in meditative mood, I have feasted my soul upon some faces that sit about this board. Four of these have impressed me deeply. Three are still seen among us, and the most helpful ef these has been the kindly, inspiring, spiritual face of Dr. Perry. And when, looking into that face, I have heard his sweet, sympathetic voice counsel tl have thought what a wonderful thing it is to be a teacher, lly a Christian teacher with life dedicated to boys and girls of days. ■r.

For ten years he was the honored chancellor of University and for three and one-half years the no less honored icellor emeritus and professor of Knglish Bible. 11 1898, at the age of sixty-five, he came into the office of chancellor ime when, because of financial distress and mismanagement, the ition required the leadership of a wise and courageous man. He von the confidence of Nebraska Methodism, liquidated the debts, pbuilt the Nebraska Wesleyan from the very foundation stones, xacter, prestige and destiny. He was a great teacher. His classes were always crowded with students who, realizing the uncerta'nty of life in one of such adv.: years, were desirous of receiving instruction from him before his call should come. k Thousands of young men and women have come under the quick - 5 influence of his personality — a personality that somehow filled with determination to make the most possible out of themselves. Although almost eighty-two years of ago. he was strong in body and mind — an inspiring leader for youth. He never grew old. He finished the semester's work, dismissed his classes, closed the books, and. in full possession of his powers to the very last, slipped quietly away to an - other world where, as he expressed it, "He might pursue his study and work with fewer limitations and greater resources at his command." </seg>
            <seg id="p580">536 Dr. Huntington was a familiar figure in all the educational gather - ings of the state where his genial disposition, never failing sense of humor, and his brief but scholarly utterances always charmed the friends to whom he spoke .

The weight of his influence induced me to leave public school work and come to Wesleyan, and since coming he has been my counselor, friend, and chum, if it would not seem irreverent to use that word. His presence was a benediction everywhere. When in chapel the annoucement of his death was made there followed a silence for a brief moment and then a sob from the entire student body. With bowed heads the students walked from the chapel and went to their rooms as though joy and laughter had fled from their lives forever. </seg>

After considerable experience in teaching in the public schools. Professor Davisson accepted a call to the New Mexico Agricultural Col - lege as professor of Latin and principal of the preparatory department. Resigning this position in 1896, he was made instructor in mathen and head master of our newly organized school of agriculture, at the same time carrying university studies which led to his being awarded the degree of A.

Immediately after graduation he was made director of the School of Agriculture, and since this time rapidly received the various academic promotions till his rank was that of a head professor in the University.

A large per cent of the rural teachers an - graduates of four high schools or have hai the equivalent in train - ing. For the past year only two third grade certificates hava in force. Teachers" salaries have shown a marked increase in the past two or three years. The demand fir efficient teachers has ex - ceeded the supply. School officers are offering: more money for let - ter teachers. Efficiency of the teacher is coming to be the ba - regulation of salaries. Considerable emphasis has been placed on industrial work in the county each year since 1908, with the exception of one year. Th« - interest exhibited by both parents and pupils has been most encourag - ing. Many of the rural schools of the coiinty arc devoting some tim» - on Friday afternoons to this work. However, not much tim from the regular work for this, but rather have the teachers dtn the work of the pupils at home, having them report at school as to their success. To further this line of work an industrial institute hag been planned for the teachers for this year, at which agriculture, manual training and domestic economy will be the subjects of; The important topics under each subject will be emphas'zed. The will be done by lectures and demonstrations. The work will be ofl ■inder the direction of experts in each line. The industrial work is not being offered with the idea in mind of revolutionizing the course of study for the rural schools, but rather to enrich it. A larger interest is being taken in the physical surrounli the rural schools. Where new buildings are needed the patrons are anxious to have the best and most modern buildings to be had. This interest is largely due to the improvement in rural farm homes. The contrast becomes so great that it proves to be embarrassing to the Hverage American. Within the next few years a number of new buildings will be erected and in each instance the patrons of th&gt; !rict will be alive to the needs of the district. Bach year sees a nn of Smith heating and ventilating plants added to the rural schools. Practically all of the schools of the county are supplied with sanitary drinking apparatus. Considerable stress has been placed on the thorough teaching of the common branches, especially reading, writing, mental arithmetic It must be conceded that we are attempting to cover too much ground in our rural schools. By the elimination of the non-essentials and a thorough mastery of the essentials, the work of the rural schools will </seg>
            <seg id="p586">540 be grtatly enhanced. Practically every teai-her in the county has been doing the reading circle work as outlined by the state reading circle board, or at least a part of it. This coming year one book in addition to those adopted by the board will be used. We expect to direct the work of the children in the matter of schorl gardens, the work being done at home during the next summer. The same thing will be done along the line of do - mestic science with the girls. We hcpe in this way to create ■ larsm interest in farm and farm life on the part of the boys and girls.

The Oakdale new school, built at a cost u; $20,000, is a credit to the educational advancement of this section of the state. The handsome new brick building at Royal is being com - pleted. This district is formed under the consolidated school laws of the state. Three districts united in forming this consolidated district Tenth grade work will be taken up in this school, of which the people of Royal can justly feel proud. At the institute held Aug. 5-10 last, with the exception of three, all the teachers of the rural schools were present.

Among the special work taken up by several of the teachers in the rural schools is letter-writing, rapid figuring, penmanship and spelling. That we might be of some aid in this work, we are offering to the student who can add 100 figures per minute when the county mi perin ten dent visits the school, a nice dictionary.

A penmanship contest is also being conducted. In the fall a "Copy Day" is set and specimens of Ech student's work is sent in. These are held until spring, when a nilar copy is taken. Both copies are then sent to Lincoln, where ey are judged. The student in each school who has made the great - est improvement receives a prize, the school that has made the greatest improvement receives a banner. We also give out some penmanship work as we visit each school. So far as we know, at the present time every teacher in the county is master of the entire situation existing in his or her dis - trict, the teacher not only fits the school, but she is the teacher for the district in and out of school. D. M. MURPHY. County Superintendent. BANNER COUNTY Although the work of our schools has not been just what we planned and hoped for, each year shows some advancement. A spe - cial effort has been made to grade the rural schools, using the course of study prescribed by the state superintendent. Although the prog - ress made during the last two years is very noticeable, it will require several years more to properly classify our schools. tThe Rational Method in Reading, the Webb and Ware system of rawing and the Palmer Method in Penmanship are required to be ught in all schools of the county, and the improvement in these sub - cts is very encouraging. The greatest need of Banner County is resident teachers. We have not enough teachers to supply our schools and must depend on outside teachers, and therefore change too frequently. We have some who expect to begin teaching this fall and will have more home teachers than formerly. The county contains six reading circle districts and the teachers &gt;se the note books and attend reading circle meetings as regularly as possible. At each county teachers' meeting the work is taken up and discussed. On account of the severe winter and deep snow it was difficult to attend meetings of any kind, here where everybody nust go so far. The boys' and girls' club work this year is based on Bulletins No. 4 and No. 5, issued by the State X'niversity. Tne county board made no provision for this work and on account of shortage of funds we could not plan extensively this year.

There were one hundred and forty-seven high school admission certificates issued to students of the rural districts which secured free tuition at any high school for the year 1912-13. One hundred sixty-one eighth grade diplomas were issu&lt; June, 1912, by the county superintendent. The library enthusiasm has not died yet. Every school has some sort of library. Two new rural school houses have been built during the last both are good, but one is modern of the latest type. J. S. ELLIOTT. County Superintendent BUKT COUNTY Hurt county schools are provided with well qualified teachers so far as certification is an index. The previous county superintendents of this county seem to have made it their aim to put in charge of the schools only teachers who seemed fit. Sixteen of our rural teachers in 1911-12 hold elementary state or first grade county certificates. Only five have taught under third grade certificates, some of these being normal training graduates who lacked a grade in one second grade subject. The normal training high school graduates who teach in our schools, as a rule, have made good. With three normal training high schools in the county, all under the care of first-rate school men, we fear no shortage of qualified beginning teachers. We are glad to use the graduates of these schools and to give them preference over other beginning teachers, as we know the instruction they have had. and the character of the training they have received from the competent su - perintendents of the town high schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p592">544 P Salaries in the cornty have been fairly good, averaging in tne 1 schools $48.50. One rural district pad $65 in 1911-11 and will the same teacher $7") a month for the year 1912-!:',. Four districts have paid $60 and only one has paid as low as $3.~&gt;, and that for a part of the year only. The great majority pay around the average amount. One meeting in the interest of consolidation of schools was hell in the .spring. Prof. Fred Hunter of the School of Agriculture p roused some enthusiasm, which we hope will bear fruit shortly. Two cf our rural districts have two-room school buildings, and provide instruction beyond the eighth grade. One provides one year in ad - vance of the eighth grade, and the other, two. Three districts have arranged for the instruction of their pupils in the schools of nearby towns. One of these transports its pupils in a van. The majority of the people in this distr ct see the advantages of Uansportation and instruction in graded schools, but there is some opposition on the part of a few. Much of their ground for complaint might be removed by Home definite state regulation of transpartation. providing for the bonding of drivers. The first question to arise when consolidation is suggested is the matter of transportation. About 24 0 wrote in the eighth grade examinations in 1 a 1 2. Some of these were seventh grade pupils who tried one or more of the examinations. Of the entire number about 160 were successful. In 1911 more than IM free high school certificates were issued, and about 110 of these were used by rural pupils who attended some high school. From present indications, a larger number of certificates will be is - sued and used next year. The feeling in behalf of better school grounds and buildings is growing. Several new buildings have been erected in recent years p.nd at least four districts are laying their plans for new buildings in the near future. The new buildings are of modern type, and are at - tractive in design. Seven schools have installed room-heating plants and others are considering the matter serioirsly. Sanitary water jars :md individual drinking cups are growing in favor. We are trying to cultivate ameng teachers and patrons a sentiment in favor of at - tractive and sanitary school surroundings. The aim of the present '•ounty superintendent will be to continue the policy of hi3 predectns jtb in providing for the schools only qualified teachers, who will put forth their best efforts in behalf of the children, and in insisting upon the most helpful and healthful conditions under which school work is to be done.

F A. BTBCH, County Superintendent. (ASS (XHNTV. Since the last biennial report, in addition to keeping up our work to the required standard, we have lai-.l special stress \ipon our work in mental arithmetic and in spelling. 1 found my eighth grade pupils rather weak in those subjects, so devised the following plan to stimulate an interest along those lines: At the beginning of the bcbool year 1910-1911. I sent out a letter to the tea&lt; iiers designating the amount of work, in mental arithmetic, that should be done during the year by pupils in the 6th, Tth and Itk grades At the end of th« third month, mental arithmetic contests were held in every siliool in the county, and the pupils who won in those contests, were the who entered the township contests, which were hel:i at the ei the first six months. The township contests were personally fond by the county superintendent and in mest of the town w hools, pat day was held on the dav of the contest. At the clr;e of the • year we held our county contest, the contestants being those pupils who had won out in the township contests. In 1911-1912, we continued our work in nienuil arithmeti' in addition to that, we conducted a similar line of work in spell he. using Crabtree's Content Speller as our text. For the year 191 2-1 913 we have planned to continue the spelling contests and take up the work for reading contests. ■ the year 191 1. the first county eighth grade MUMMMtll » .is Prior to that time local graduation exercises ha i been the and in many localities but little interest had been ;hown. The county commencement and county (onte'sts were held on the same day — contests in the forenoon an 1 the graduation exercises in the afternoon. The attendance was large, and keen interest was shown. </seg>
            <seg id="p594">546 In 1911, there were 157 graduates and in 1912, there were 179 grad - uates. The crowd was so large at the last commencement that many people were not able to get near the building in which the exercises were held. Since holding county graduation exercises, I have found that the attendance of pupils in the eighth grade has been greatly im - proved, and a much larger per cent of applicants for eighth grade diplomas succeed in passing the examinations. CIn 1910, there were 145 applicants for free high school tuition and 912, there were 252, although the school population of the county decreased more than 200 in the last two years. Enew $16,000 building at Elrnwood has been the only school g erected in the county since the last biennial report. A num - school houses have been repaired and newly furnished with text - maps, globes and heating and ventilating plants. Eiring the year 1911-1912, three high schools added the twelfth and normal training was placed in one of those schools. We ve three normal training high schools in the county. E Steps have been taken toward establishing a rural high school, at town of Murray, but we will not have that for another year or aps another biennium. MARY E. FOSTER, County Superintendent. CHASK COUNTY F Chase county has experienced a shortage of teachers for a num - of years. There is little increase in the number of qualified teach - from year to year. McCook is the nearest school having teachers training. It &gt;~eems impossible to many of our young people who might teach, to attend a training school. We have some energetic boys and girls who, after finishing eighth grade, succeed by home study in se - curing a third grade certificate. They tea&lt; h a year and usually take training in summer school. Some are very young. They live in the county and understand conditions in the sparoely settled country. Their work in the small isolated schools is much more satisfactory than that of the teachers who are older and have better educations who come from the more populous part of the state. The general trend of qualification; and efficiency is upward, although we find it necessary to issue some emergencies each year. Keople are beginning to understand the significance of pupils ;ting the eighth grade. The number of pupils graduating each ! not large. This year there are twenty-nine. It is the lar re have had in the county. Throughout the schools pupils of lower grades are working more systematically and looking forward to the time when they will com - plete the eighth grade.

Some have added the convenience of coat rcoms or halls at entrance. The teachers' association has shown more general interest since organized and conducted by teachers. Last year the need of a public library was felt. Under the management of the teachers' association a Teachers' County Library Association was organized. The library la to be kept at the office of the county superintendent and the county superintendent, by virtue of the office, is made librarian. The object is "to bring into the reach of teacher and pupils reference books and the best literature." bThe professional spirit among teachers is good.

This year has seen the teachers better qualified for their work than in previous years. All high school teachers meet the legal require - ments, many of them being college graduates. Our rural teachers are earnestly striving to advance and are willing to attend summer school in order to raise the standard of their certificates. b Eighth grade examinations are held on the dates assigned by tin - department, and during the past two years we have had one red graduates, many of whom have gone on to high school. ■i'e use the Nebraska course of study and find it of inestimable to us. Our rural schools are able to prepare pupils for gradua - om the eighth grade with as good grades as the town pupils. All of our rural schools have some library books and many have splendid libraries, which are enjoyed by parents as well as pupils. During the past year, the bodge Pole district had tried transporting pupils who are more than two miles from school, and has found it to be a splendid idea. Fifteen or twenty pupils thus have the advantage of nine months of school. This district as well as the Potter district. and one rural district, have found it necessary to erect a second school house in the distant parts of the districts to accommodate pupils who otherwise would be tco far from school to attend during the winter. The state aid to weak districts has helped our schools wonder - fully, and our only regret '.? that the amount is not greater.

County Superintendent. rhAY roiXTV The rural teachers in this county are neariy all, high school xraa - uates. Some have had additional training in normal schools. They hold first and second grade county certificates. It has been the policy of the office of county superintendent to refur;e to issue third graJe certificates so long as better qualified teachers could be found. Many of tin- teach - ers in the town schools are normal school graduates. . The Nebraska course of study is used in all schools. Teachers are urged to follow these outlines, and some attention has been given on how to use the tourse of study in the county institutes. The daily pro - gram a&lt;i suggested in the course of study is recomruen Jed. In visiting rural schools the plan has betn to see how nearly the course of study has been followed. Quarterly review questions are sent regularly to all rural teachers. Every school in the county has a pupils' library. A number have libraries of one hundred volumes or more. Books recommended by the Nebraska State Teachers' Reading Circle Board have been bought quite extensively throughout the county. The pupils are doing reading circle work as outlined by the reading circle board. E Teachers' reading circles have been maintained in all the towns ie county and in most of the villages. Most of these circle; have rural members. All the Uathers of the county, who hold county ficates have carried on the reading circle work the past year. During the bienniuni one consolidation meeting has been held, superintendent James E. Delzell addressed this meeting. Bt the school exhibit held in connection with the County Fair, pre - &gt; are offered upon industrial work. Clay county has four normal training high schools and the teich - &lt; rs from these schools rank among the best rural teachers of the county. The per cent of failures of those completing normal training work in the high school is much lower than those who have not had such train - ing. </seg>
            <seg id="p598">550 b Teachers are urged to observe special days. Suggestive outlines pecial day exercises have been placed in all the schools of the ty. This past year the flag salute was taught in all the schools. t There is one rural school building in the county which is strictly dern. Quite a large number have installed heating and ventilating tems within the past two years. Most of the schools are quite well equipped as to seats, maps, globes and books. A campaign for closed water receptacles and individual drinking cups was started two years ago and nearly every school in the county has made the change for more sanitary drinking facilities. Eight rural schools have erected windmills on the school grounds during the past two years. A further campaign was started for good pictures and most of the schools have at least one well framed picture upon the walls. During the biennium there has been considerable improvement in decoration and cleanliness. There is an active teachers' organization in the county. One dis - trict meeting is held annually in Harvard, Sutton, Edgar and Fairfleld. A general county meeting is held each year in May at Clay Center. Superintendent Wm. M. Davidson, formerly of Omaha, and Dr. I. F. Roach have addressed the last two meetings. There has been a good deal of interest among the teachers in the county in regard to the regular state meetings. Most of the districts have been allowing their teachers time to attend this annual meeting without lofo of pay to the teachers. Almost sixty-five per cent of the teachers of the county attended the meeting in Omaha in 1911. The attendance at the district meetings has not been large. This is due to the great stress that has been placed upon the state meeting. A few teachers each year attend the national association. During the bienhium special emphasis has been placed upon spell - ing and reading. In 1910 spelling contests were held in all the town - ships of the county and these township winners met at the county seat to contest for county honors. At each contest judges were se - lected from outside the township. These contests were financed by a ten-cent door fee. Medals were presented first and second winners in both county and township contests. During the p«Bt year a similar plan has been followed with reading as a basis rather than spelling. Prizes for the reading contests have been standard works of fiction for township prizes and dictionaries for county prizes. The result of these contests has been a general improvement in reading and spelling throughout the county. The eighth grade graduates usually number a few afore than one hundred each year. A regular promotion exercise is held early in June, where all the graduates of the county participate. The speakers dur - ing the biennium have been Dr. J. A. Beattie of Cotner University and Prof. E. L. Rouse of Peru. EDITH A. LATHROP, County Superintendent. </seg>

On an average, better grades of certificates are now held by teach - ers and more teachers have attended our meetings and Tiave done the professional and reading circle work this year than ever before. The high enrollment and average attendance is largely due to the teachers' professional interest, to better school buildings and better equipment. F. J. VOGLTANCE. County Superintendent. ( I MING COUNTY The school spirit in Cuming county is one of co-operation. School officers and patrons want good schools, well qualified teachers, are quite willing to furnish all necessary supplies and need not for any reason be embarrassed financially. However, the word "necessar rt large enough- to include all that is best in the way of surroundings the education of the child. PWe have reason to feel encouraged in the awakening to this fact irts of the county. Four new buildings have been erected during »ast year.

The remaining two are an improvement on the old style building. ■lore attention has been paid, too, to the cleanliness of the school evidenced In clean painted or papered walls, oiled floors, water - ndividual drinking cups and cleanliness in general.

            <seg id="p600">552 have been organized during the past year. Though we are looking for - ward to the time of better organization and consolidation of schools, we realize that there are a number of steps that will need to be taken be - fore this can be accomplished. Not least among these, that of good roads for the transportation of children, is the most necessary. We can - not afford to neglect the education of the present generation of school children because of the improved opportunities which will materialize in the future. The average salary during the past school year, rural districts only included, was (47, the average length of term eight months, show - ing an increase amounting to nearly fifteen dollars in salary per month and an addition of one month of school to the average term within th - period of ten years. We note, tco, that more rural pupils are taking advantage of the high school privileges or aim to attend the state agricultural school. Eighth grade pupils look forward to the graduation time with a great deal of pride, seventy of last years' class receiving diplomas. Fifty - eight applications were filed for high school admission. Most of these pupils take the normal training work. Cuming county has at present Eber of teachers teaching in the country schools, who love the y because it has always been their home, and who are ambitious rove the conditions as they exist today in the country schools. In our reading circle work the county is divided into four sec - tions. We aim to have three meetings in each town and a final meet - ing, which is the annual county convention. Teachers are supplied with reading circle note books, which are sent to the superintendent's office at stated times. We do not look on the reading circle work as an imposed task, but enjoy the meetings, appreciating the help and a general knowledge of educational affairs as they are or should be carried on where more ideal conditions have been attained. The teachers in general are conscientiously striving to do their best for the pupils under their charge, trying to arouse at the same time a more progressive sentiment in favor of education. Much credit is due to our loyal corps ot teachers. We feel the need of more literature reaching directly to the patrons of our schools, keeping them in touch with wnat is being accom - plished along the line of modern buildings, equipment, school gardens, manual training, elementary agriculture and industrial clubs elsewhere, thus assisting in creating a general public sentiment in favor of what is best for the rural schools, making it possible for each school board to feel at liberty to accomplish more along these lines in the home district.

During the past year one hundred and six teachers were employed in the schools of the county. Sixteen teachers held either life or first grade state certificates, eight held first and forty-four held second grade county certificates. We still find it necessary to issue third grade cer - tificates in order to supply all of our schools with teachers. The state course of study is in every school, and more and more the teachers are seeing the necessity of such a course. A number of the schools are now quite well graded and by continued emphasis on this feature of the work we hope to see much improvement within the next year. Quarterly tests based on the course of study are sent out from the superintendent's office, and the eighth grade takes the state ex - amination on the completion of the course.

Great care is taken i»i the selection of these books that the money may not be invested in books that are of no value to the schools. In several schools the pupils' read - ing circle work for this year was completed.

This seemed I y on account of existing conditions in the communities where these tricts were formed. In one case a district six miles long and three miles wide, was divided, making two districts, each three miles square. On account of the extreme hilliness of the land in the community, di - vision seemed to be the only means of giving school advantages to many of the children of the neighborhood. In both the other cases, the petitions for the divisions were eo strong as to compel favorable action on the part of the county superintendent.

In Dawson county, the minimum grades for county certificates, loth as to average and the minimum on any subject, is live per cent above that required by the state department; and third grade certifi - cates are issued only when a sufficient number of teachers holding first and second grade certificates cannot be secured. Our teachers are making good records in the reading circle work and in all other professional requirements. Our county association meetings are well intended, and are proving to be of great value to the school work of the county. The enrollment of teachers in our annual county institute last August was 132, and the session was one of the most interesting and profitable we have held in the past nine years. The subjects most strongly emphasized at the institute were reading and penmanship. though several other subjects received the best attention of some of the ablest instructors in the state. Teachers" salaries in Dawson county have kept pace with the in - crease apparent throughout the state. In the rural schools, the sal - aries range from $40 to $6"&gt; per month, the prevailing rate being about though several teachers receive $60 per month each, and three are receiving $65 per month. The equipment of our schools has greatly improved in the last few years. There are email libraries in at least three-fourths of the rural schools, and most of these schools are supplied with maps and globes. Very few sanitary water fountains are supplied, but throughout the valley portion of the county, there are good wells on the school grounds, and the pupils use individual drinking cups. Some progress has been made during the past three or four years in the erection of new school buildings. During the present school year and the one just preceding, nine new rural school houses have been built. Of these, six are modern in plan, being up-to-date in the matter of lighting, and having gooo cloak rooms and commodious teachers' rooms. Nearly all are heated by means of the modern heater and ven - tilator. In district No. 2."&gt;, the new school house, which is nearing completion, has a basement room which will be neatly finished with cement floor and plastered walls. It will be completely furnished with </seg>

The cost of this building will be about $2,200.00. E Instruction in- agriculture is receiving some attention, being given he eighth grade pupils as supplementary to the geography work, boys' and girls' clubs have been organized, but several of our boys sr corn each year for the state corn contest at Lincoln. A county test will be held in December of this year, in which there will be a iber of entries in the acre and other classes. A number of enter the state Boys' Acre Corn Growing contest. City and Milage School*. Daw son county has one district, — Lexington, — organized under sub-division fourteen, and four. — Gothenburg, Cozad, Overton. and Farnam — under sub-division six. Eddyville and Sumner are organised under sub-division three, but both schools are accredited as high schools under the free high school law. Thus we have seven schools in the county that may legally receive pupils under the free high school lav. Four of our high schools. — Lexington. Gothenburg, Cozad, and Ovt rton. — are accredited to the university, each for four years' work. Three of our high schools, — Lexington. Gothenburg and Cozad, — nre normal training high schools. Cozad has just this year added nor - mal training. Normal training in the high schools has been beneficial to the schools in Uawson county in that it has supplied a greater num - ber of teachers and in many cases, the teachers thus supplied have proven to be efficient. ETsimally. we believe the efficiency of normal training in the ■hool eoulj be greatly increased by extending the scope of the giving more time to some of the subjects of the course, and by ng the element that gives normal trainers an advantage over in securing certificates without complete examination in all d subjects. Eithin the past two years Lexington and Gothenburg liav. splendid new high school buildings. In both schools there is the nodern equipment, including gymnasia, manual training, and ic science. The Lexington school maintains a well equipped commercial department, in which many young people are prepared for Es life. The Gothenburg school has a play park which is being ed with the most modern play equipment. Much of the ap - for this park has very recently been installed. Our various high schools have strong faculties and rank with the best high schools in the state. The question of district consolidation has been largely discussed in certain communities and while there have been no consolidations effected, the growing consolidation sentiment warrants the prediction that the work will be begun in the near future. </seg>

There is one feature of Nebraska money appropriations which has been a supreme blessing to our poor districts.

This I do know, that one school with an enrollment of eighteen pupils thrr, was pro - vided with six months' instruction under an intelligent, energetic teacher that otherwise would have been left with closed doors and empty We are trying out a consolidation plan in two sections of our county.

            <seg id="p607">559 Kes. The number holding state or county first grade certificates more than doubled in the past two years. But a few third grade certificate? are issued, and these upon the grades required for a second grade certificate. It would be hard to find an equal number of teachers with better professional spirit. Our last three institutes have eac-h enrolled more teachers than are required for all the schools in the county. Prac - tically every teacher completes the reading circle work each year by submitting written reviews. The county is always well represented at &gt;itate and district meetings. The number of eight grade graduates from the country schools is about doubling each year, and the character of the papers submitted by the pupils is evidence of much better work in the rural schools. Practically all of these graduates take advantage of the free high school law or enter normal schools. The large number entering the normal schooV, proves the wisdom of admitting such pupils to our state nor - mals. These pupils from the country schools make most desirable rural teachers on account of their ability to "fit in" with rural con - ditions. We are also pleased to note that a number of these boys are taking advantage of the courses at the school of agriculture. EThe district libraries now have about 8,000 volumes with good k cases and a uniform system of library records. An encouraging ture of this work is the increasing use of the books provided for the ilts in the district. A number of country schools are doing excellent work in sewing, rooking and agriculture. Some excellent school fairs were held last fall with exhibits of farm products and industrial work and programs by the pupils. Some of these exhibits were sent to the state contest in January and numerous prizes were won. A short course for these boys and girls will be held in connection with the 1912 institute. B'e now have three normal training high schools in the county id that their graduates make excellent teachers. They would be equipped for rural teaching, and may I add, for life, if the courses ed more industrial work. Dixon county has ten thoroughly modern country school houses, with two new ones under construction, and three receiving the modern touch via remodeling. Grand Central district set a new precedent last year by remodeling their old building, changing the windows to the left and rear, building cloak rooms and installing a heating and ventilating system. About half the rural schools have either furnaces or room heaters. Oakdale is a country school with a modern school plant. They employ two teachers and do some high school work. The bow have their baseball team and the girls their basketball team. There is no dearth of big boys and girls in this school. Last year their eighth graue numbered eleven.

Since my report to you two years ago, Dodge county has made a few improvements in the way of school buildings. North Bend has t recteJ a new building costing about $35,000. District No. 4 has built a modern rural school house at a cost of $1,500. Fremont has voted $125,000 bonds for a new high school building. Dodge has also voted $30,000 bone'.; for a modern ten-room building. District No. 7 is now erecting a $1,500 rural school building. A great deal has been done in improving old school plants. In carrying on the reading circle work the county has been di - vided into seven sections, the superintendents and principals of the town schools acting as local managers. Four meetings are held each rear and teachers are furnished with note books in which they outline their work. These meetings have been well attended and good work has been done. The Nebraska- course of study is being followed and examination riustions in all subjects for the eight grades are mailed every two months to teachers. These question.; are based on the course. During the past year each rural teacher was furnished a weekly plan book, in which she outlined in advance each week's work. Copies of these plane were sent to this office. Every school in the county has a library. As an incentive to pupiM to rt ad library books, library certificates and diplomas are is - sued. I During the past two years the normal training high schools have duated sixty-two students. A number of these have taught in the nty an J with a few exceptions have made good teachers. Our teachers are well qualified. All of our beginners are either high school normal training graduates or have had normal training in some normal school. It hF.s been our policy not to issue third grade and emergency certificates. Quite a number of our teachers are grad - uates of colleges and universities and several hold professional life certificates. During the biennium 319 eighth grade pupils took the final ex - aminations. Of this number 274 passed and received diplomat.

DOKil.AS COrXTY fin addition to the two large schools in the county. Omaha and h Omaha, we have seven schools, each doing from two to four s of high school work. We have eight schools employing from two ine teachers each, that attempt no work above the eighth grade; largest of these eight employs seven regular and two special fa The remainder are schools of one teacher each. During the last twenty years the school population of the county has increased nearly thirty per cent, the most remarkable in&lt; I'finK in Benson, where the school census has increased from one hun - dred to more than one thousand. It is gratifying to note that, during this time when a number of the towns and cities have increase I their population, the strictly rural communities, on the whole, have at least held their own, and there is probably no immediate danger of the rural communities of Douglas county becoming depopulated. The free high school law has increased the interest in eighth Krade work, and the number now completing the elementary &lt; ourse is very gratifying. High school attendance on the part of both town and country pupils has greatly increased. By virtue of the free high m lew, more thorough inspection, increased requirements of high ;-• leachers and schools doing high school work, the finality of done has greatly improved. Two of our last year's three year s&lt; hools have now added the fourth year's work. Bily three or four of our districts have less than nine months of Nearly all our teachers have had some normal training. The year (not the term) is considered the time unit for tlM ■nt of teachers. These are a few of the conditions that make e the accomplishment of certain desirable results in the inspec - id supervision of schools of the county. Certainly the "call" or "visit" of the county sui&gt;erintendent can be of no material val the teacher or the school if not made until the closing weeks of the school year. It occurs to me that rural school inspection must continue to be inadequate until the inspector or inspectors in each county shall be able to visit each school and make at least a second call whenever necessary during the early part of the year, say within the first tw.i months. This has never been accomplished in Douglas county, but I consider it desirable for every county in the state. The supervision accorded rural schools of Nebraska certainly does not exceed from </seg>
            <seg id="p610">562 twelfth to one-sixth that of the city schools. Some argue that teachers in city schools are sometimes "over supervised." Granting that tins may be true, it must be admitted that rural school supervision must long continue to march in the direction it is now heading before it comes within gun shot of the danger line. Much interest has been aroused in the erection of better school buildings, the questions of heating, lighting, and ventilation receiving proper consideration. However, one handicap still noticeable is the fact that contractors and architects do not yet know as much about rural as about city school buildings, for the very reason that less attention has been devoted to the former than to the latter. School boards may wish to make certain variations from a plan used in another district. This is perfectly proper, for a reasonable degree of individuality is desirable. However, in making such variations in the plans, architects sometimes unwittingly make serious blunders affecting the amount of blackboard space, hall space, etc. Perhaps no one should be seriously Dlamed for this, and it probably indicates a stage in our development, but it Is a fact that should be noted if we would profit by it. The Eton of our present State Department in inaugurating a state wide vement for better school buildings promises to accomplish more ng this line than could be accomplished by any other force. The encouragement of industrial work during the last few years has produced good results. Bulletins recently procured from the State Agriculture College have been put into all schools and are proving very helpful to teachers and pupils. The most recent special effort along this line was a short industrial course given by Mr. H. J. Gramlich of the State Farm. Tljis work was given at various places and was thus accessible from all points in the county. 1 believe the most import - ant result of the industrial effort is the fact that a keener and saner interest has been aroused in the tangible things about us — those things with which we have most to do. W. A. YODER, County Superintendent. HUXDY COUNTY District No. 1 9 in Dundy county was formed by the consolidation of districts No. 19, 20 and 34.

We are well supplied ■achers of home training and these are given the preference when iea occur. The number of failures in our eighth grade examinati &gt;ns is fir too great. This year we had one hundred and sixty-uight aopli and only sixty-five received diplomas. We are hoping to mrcoMi this in a measure by requiring a monthly plan in the eighth grade work from every rural teacher, thus insuring preparation on her part and making the work throughout the county more nearly uniform. 6 early all of these who received diplomas will continue work in chools next fall. Our city are doing much to te interest along this line by inviting the rural eighth grade to participate in the town eighth grade exercises.

KRAXKMX COIXTY Franklin county contains seventy-five school districts in good financial standing and employs one hundred and eight teachers. Geo - graphically the county is divided into a north and south half, making it necessary always to hold two general meetings if we desire to meet with any degree of success. Two associations have been held each year, making a total of four. Superintendent Delzoil r.nd Professor N A. Bengtson have been the speakers selected the past year. ■he general meetings have been excellent, but the local circles were well attended on account of intensely cold weather. Sixty note have been sent to this office. EOne hundred and thirty-five boys and girls were promoted to the h grade this year. Seventy-five per cent of those applying passed examination. This certainly speaks very well for Franklin county hers. Out of the one hundred and thirty-five eighth grade grad - «, one hundred and twenty-five were present at the county «xer - i and received their diplomas. Eiutlines of the course of study have been printed, given to each W, and carefully discussed each day during institute. This has ed in a much more uniform standard of work. Erhe school libraries in general have been poorly selected. H &gt;w- Bome good is resulting therefrom. Several of the districts are din - ig consolidation and in certain parts of the county township Is could be a success. Ehe greatest effort of thte office is to help promote the efficiency teaching force of our county. First we are encouraging our home o qualify, asking them to begin examination the ySar previous to teaching. We also urge them to attend summer school N&gt; grade certificates are issued to those who do not attend summer . Over half the teachers who expect to teach in county are in at - lce at one of our normals. Large classes of normal training students graduate from the Hloomington and Franklin high schools each year .thus swelling the ranks in the teaching profession, until during the past two years plenty of home teachers are available — a condition which has not existed for several years. ' The teachers' institute of this county is the greatest ins|.iri&lt; gathering of the county. Practically all county teachers attend. Only Eines of work are emphasized. Last year reading, phonics and aphy were given special attention; this year numbers and arith - language and grammar, together with two periods of model </seg>
            <seg id="p613">565 will be furnished for teachers to make the seta of phonic carJs. Mr. Rouse and Mrs. Crawford are engaged for instructors. The boys' and girto' short course work has not been organized cwing to lack of time, but three delegates were sent to the State Short Course in Lincoln and gave their report at the county eighth grade grad - uating exerciser. B lough much has and is being done to advance the schools of our , we feel that until more definite supervision is given conditions vance slowly. RUTH ERFMAX. County Superintendent Fl'RXAS COl'XTY The standard of qualification for teachers Is the same as thai «&gt;r the state board of examiners for county certificates, except, agriculture and theory and art, are required for a third grade certificate, minimum *»5 per cent. Our normal training schools are doing much to raise the standard of qualification of teachers, and the third grade certificate is almost entirely eliminated. The county now has a surplus of excel - lent teachers. The number of "with credit" and "with honor" lertifi - rates Is being increased, as thi.i class of teachers are in demand. Review questions have been sent out each quarter for the use of the teacher, and we find them very beneficial. Eighth grade examina are conducted by the different high school principals of the eight towns of the county .thus making it quite convenient for all pupils wishing to take the examination. Emphas'i is laid on the importance of thor - oughly mastering the eighth grade before entering the high school. Th.&gt; requirements are 6-*&gt; per cent minimum, with a general average I E.asc year a class of 194 graduated from the eighth gia.le. thta 80. Graduating exercises are conducted at the cjuuty seat.

This law is a benefit and does 1 to increase the educational advantages of the rural pupils and ulates them to pass the eighth grade examination. Special work v, given at the teachers' institute on the course of ?tudy. and all teachers are instructed to follow it that there may be uniform work through the county. The institute attendance is among the largest in the state. Each teacher is required to formulate a daily program and send a copy to the county superintendent at the close of the second week of school. School libraries are emphasized and most schools have them and are adding to the same, being careful of the selection of books to be placed in the hands of the boys and girls. </seg>
            <seg id="p614">566 The pupils' reading circle work is conducted by the teachers. After a pupil reads a book he is required to write a book review, and when six reviews are completed they are Gent to the county superintendent, who issues a neat certificate of award for the work. This has been very stimulating and a good many excellent book reviews have been rtVe find the reading circle work very helpful to the teachers and, rule, each teacher is eager to do the work for the benefit she re - ceives and not because it is required. The teachers of the towns hold sectional meetings, while the rural teachers prepare note books which show the careful work they are doing along professional lines. Consolidation of districts wherever possible is urged that they may be thereby able to pay better wages and receive the best instruction with longer terms of school. A number of districts furnish transpor - tation for the pupils, thus giving them the advantage of better schools. In some instances they are enabled to attend in the town. Several of our town schools have science clubs and are doing splendid work. Letters have been sent over the county for the boys pnd girls' clubs and the corn growing contest. We hope it will result in a good many responses, but the dry years here have made things Aery discouraging along these lines. A short course in domestic science and agriculture was held in March, with Mtiss Gertrude Rowan and Mr. Gramlich as instructors. Over one hundred girls and boys were in attendance, making it a splen - did success. Much enthusiasm was exhibited in the work. We are particularly fortunate in having four strong normal train - ing schools and cannot speak in too glowing terms of their work. They have prepared rcome excellent teachers, who go into the rural schools with a fresh knowledge of the subjects to be taught and a realization of the immensity of the work. ■eachers are urged to observe all special days, thereby teaching ildren patriotism and reverence for our forefathers, our state and lion. Eiistricts are urged to furnish the best possible equipment, to dec - the school rooms and beautify the grounds also, furnish modern for ventilating and heating. Edison has a new modern school The teachers of Furnas county as a whole, show strong professional interest. Two rousing county teachers' associations are held each year. During the past year State Superintendent Jas. E. Delzell addressed one of the meetings and Prof. Clark of Kearney Normal the other. A number of our teachers attended the State Association at Omaha and the county was largely represented at the district association at McCook. The school boards heartily co-operate in these associations by giving the teachers leave of absence without loss of time. Spelling contests were held in the precincts and county during the </seg>
            <seg id="p615">567 The eighth grade pupils in the towns pass the state examination for promotion into the high schools the same as the rural pupils. The teachers find this a stimulant for better eighth grade work. The booklets were sent out and the teachers were requested to ob - serve "fire day" with appropriate exercises and instruction in the dan - gers from the careless use of fire. The teachers will gladly comply with the request to have the children prepare work for the county fair. C. F. STILWELL, County Superintendent. GOSPER COUNTY Pie majority of teachers in the county hold only second grade ates. Every year there are three or four state certificates reg - in the county. Beginners are permitted to teach on a third - grade certificate. No emergency certificates or permits are issued. For the last two years the enrollment for the eighth grade exami - nations have been about 130, of which number something like fifty receive diplomas, but only about half of these ever enter the high schools. The Nebraska Course of Study instead of being an aid to the rural teacher of the county seems to be an actual hindrai. With two exceptions every school in the county nas a library. Keading circle work is optional with all teachers holding plain 5 grade certificates. Ke have not yet arrived at the point where consolidation and Ttation of pupils is popular enough to be put into practice. There are no boys' and girls' clubs in the county. No state aid is required by the schools of this county Teachens from normal training high schools seem to do nearly as well as other teachers.

Four pupils represented Hall county at the Short Courses in Lincoln, Jan - uary. 1911, and January. 1912. kThe teachers of the rural schools were asked to combine their enth and eighth grade claeies this year (1911-12) and teach geo - phy, reading, history, spelling and physiology as outlined in the Nebraska course of study for the eighth year. Next year these sub - jects will be taught to the seventh and eighth grades as outlined for the seventh year. Arithmetic and Grammar are not alternate.!, but are to be taught each year as outlined. Minor subjects were alternated in the lower grades. This plan has worked very well so far, and has been followed in at least two of the graded schools as well as a nia - tity of the rural school;. The main difficulty which might arise I prevent its ultimate success, is the possibility of teachers not vlng a complete record of the grade work which pupils have fln - ■i. Since the library law was modified by the recent legislature a large percentage of the districts have not purchased library books. We are trying to encourage reading among the children by taking up the pupils' reading circle work as outlined in the bulletin and are providing the necessary book reviews and binders for the same. E lading contests were held in practically all the schools of the ty, March 8. April 5, the town and township contests were held, finals will be held in connection with the eighth grade commence- Outside judges were secured in most cases and not only the teacher and pupils, but also the patrons have become interested in better reading. In the spring of 1911, districts 14 and 24 were consolidated into one district upon petitions presented by the voters of the districts. Later on, two other districts were added, thus making a consolidated district containing 30 3-8 square miles and having a valuation of $198,500. The total number on the school census is 175.

County Superintendent HAMILTON COl'XTY This year Hamilton county was favored by having the Central Nebraska Teachers' Association held in Aurora. There was a large attendance present from the county and all took a great interest in the program. Most of the school boards allowed their teachers to at - tend, thus putting the teacher in touch with new ideas and plans so that the teachers returned to their schools with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

MATTIENK BRA' County Superintendent. Notwithstanding the financial straits of two years, &lt; auseJ by par - tial crop failure, several of the school districts have paid their indebt - edness and maintain school for sufficient length of time to share in the state apportionment. However, many of the school districts should have state aid another biennial. The amendment of the law regarding l'ormal training in high schools by the last legislature, so as to giv. the etate superintendent power to designate lower grade schools for giving such training was a wise provision. Under this section of law Hayes Center public echool has been recognized. It means more for Hayej county than I can tell. Teachers trained on the groun ! the best satisfaction as they understand the peculiar conditions in Hayes county. In fact, school board*; will hardly hire any one from the eastern part of the state. EJne sad feature of school work in this county is the nuinli. ind girls who finish the eighth grade and are unable to attend a school, as so many of the districts are exempt by law from f free high school privileges. These boys and girlrs without ex - m make good when they do enter the high school. rln schools where there is time ninth grade subjects are U in a regular school this is impossible.

MILLER, County Superintendent JOHNSON COUNTY Ehnson county is one of the smallest counties of the state, hav - area of only 378 square miles, this territory being divided into ricts employing 118 teachers. The school census of the county is 3,r&gt;37. We have three twelv. - grade accredited schools in the county and three ten-grade uhoolt Two of the twelve-grade schools, the one at Tecumseh and the one at Sterling, give normal training. The combined enrollment of the normal training classes in these schools for the year 1911-12 was more than 85. About 40 per cent of our present rural school teachers Shad normal training in one of these high schools, and there never been a time when we have had better Qualifle.l teachers in the I schools than at present. This year the supply of teachers is iu w of the demand, and we can spare more than twenty-five teach - most of them teachers who have had normal training. I The eighth grade graduating class this year contained seventy - rural school pupils, a large number of whom will attend high ol next year. The free high school law has been very satisfactory pt in the small districts containing a village school. In these ito - i, in order to receive credit for the work done, they must have necessary teaching force and equipment. After the pupils have finished the teuth grade of these schools they usually go to some other B school in order to take advantage of a full twelve-year course, ise of the small valuation of these district.; they are paying, some ;m, the maximum of school tax and with the tuition of the free ichool students to pay, the school tax &lt;s very high. The TecuniBeh high school has an enrollment of 190 students, about ninety of this number being non-resident. The enrollment next year promises to par.; the 200 mark. The board of education of Tecum - seh has purchased twelve acres of land adjoining tne school campus This tract has some fine, large trees upon it and is already- equipped with some playground apparatus. A part of the ground will very probably be used in experimental work in agriculture. The Crete plan of domestic science is being followed and the results have been highly </seg>

A few of the schools have good libraries, but rule the "library law" did not find favor in the rural districts. ■Jnsolidation has not been tried in this county, but a number cf it has been brought up in connection with some of the village k From past records of the eighth grade examinations we found that more pupils failed in spelling, mental arithmetic, writing and reading than in any of the other subjects, therefore in order to try to overcome some of the failures we planned a mental arithmetic contest, using problen . very similar to those used in the eighth grade examination questions sent out by the state. On April 19th each school in the county held a contest to chose a delegate to go to the nearest town on May 17th. there to compete with the delegates from the neighboring districts. The contests in the several town schools were held under the leadership of the principal of the schools, and the !&gt;robltn)8 were furnished from the office of the county superintendent. At these town contests the best two pupils were chosen to come to Tecumseh on May 24th to compete for a gold medal. The contest was a lively one from beginning to end. The results were highly pleasing and we shall endeavor to use the same plan next year, n &gt;t only for mental arithmetic, but also -for spelling and reading We feel that it is high time to devote attention to the rural schools and that the best is none too good for our country boys and girls. L. C. Kl'STER. County Superintendent KKAKXKV COl XTV. For the past two years we have been making a campaign aljnts the line of sanitation and ventilation in our schools. While the results have not been as good as they ought to have been yet much has been accomplished. First, the common drinking pail and cu |&gt; &lt;vere attacked. Now nearly every school in the county has abolished the common water pail and in its place has fountains or covered water iars with a faucet. Some of the schools have adopted individual drinking cups. Next we began to urge school beards to put in heating and ventilating plants that were up-to-date and in keeping wttk present day ideas. Twelve such plants have been installed in the county and we hope that several mare will be before the rtaM &lt;&gt;f Mm -&lt; hool year. The campaign along this line is to be (ontinued. We are now also urging school boards and teachers to put playground apparatus on the school ground. Two of the city or </seg>
            <seg id="p622">574 E schools and three rural schools have already taken action in natter and others are contemplating doing so in the near future. Minden schools have especially taken advance steps in this having expended some three hundred and fifty dollars in play - id apparatus. Another line in which Minden has taken a decided step in advance is in the introduction of manual training, domestic science, and business training in the curriculum of their schools. Manual training is now in its second year in the Minden schools and the work that is being done is certainly very creditable. This year domestic science and a commercial course have been introduced and are in opera - tion. We trust that many more schools in the county will follow their vise lead in this line of progress. The county is now beginning to reap a general benefit of the •tree high school law from students who graduate as normal training students. The free high school tuition law is gaining in favor and I believe is fully established. 1 now seldom hear any objection to the law and districts that refuse to take advantage of the law at first are now doing so and have received the benefit mentioned above. Last year one hundred and eleven free high school tuition certificates -.*ere issued and this year one hundred and thirty-four such certificates were issued. Since normal training was introduced in the high schools forty students from the county have graduated in that course. (The Minden high schools is the only one in the county offering the course.) A large number of these students are those who have taken advantage of the free high school law. Out of the forty students completing the normal training course, thirty-eight have taught in the county. And almost without an exception have made good. This is a very important factor in showing the rural schools that the free high school tuition law is not only a benefit to the few and the high school of the county. One rural high school organized under subdivision 6. sections :' — 18, of the school laws of Nebraska, has been established this y»&gt;ar. Districts Xo. 2 and No. 67, of Kearney county, located u]) in the Tlatt valley, voted at the last annual meeting to unite for high school purposes. The school is now in operation and is known as the Lowell Rural High School. We hope that others will follow, and this ;n turn will only be a step leading to the consolidation of the schools in all their work as well as the grades above the eight.

Less difficulty was found in securing teachers, in fact, it was the 'irst year that we have been able to get teachers as we needed them. The present indications are that we will have more teachers than schools this year. A number of our young folks are preparing to teach. Attendance at summer schools, will be large. This is true each year. as our teachers show the progressive spirit, those who have had years of experience along with the beginners. We expect to issu. ■mexgency certificates, and fewer third grades than ever before. One-fifth of the teachers then at work attended the &lt;1 association at Kearney, in March. The distance is about 140 miles. Pome teachers attend the state meeting each year and a few have attended the national associations at Denver and San Francisco. We have had the pleasure of seeing eight students graduated from he twelth grade who received their eight grade diplomas from the writer. A number have graduated from the tenth grade at I'axton. where the school meets the approval of the state department for ten grades of work. Forty-five pupils graduated from the eighth grade this year. ( In 1911 there were forty-one.) Each year a greater percent of those who write, pass the examination; this is due to the use of the Course of Study and the quarterly test and review questions: also to the gr - interest taken by parents, children, and teachers in getting scholars to complete the grade. Practically all of our eight grade graduates go into the ninth grade. An interesting experiment has been made this year in carrying on the ninth grade in rural schools. The teachers followed the course ae given in the Ogalalla school, where the high school faculty was kind enough to supply test questions as given to the pupils, which were sent out by the county superintendents. The pupils came in for their semester and final examinations. The credits made went on record in the school just the same as if they had done all of the work in Ogalalla. These pupils came out with from one to seven noints tc their credit. As a means of education for pareata aad teachers this has been valuable. Greater care will be used in selecting teachers v.ho know what ninth grade work is, and who know how to teach it. The time has not been lost by the students even those who made only a few points for some of them would not have been in school at all, had they not gone in their own districts. They have become interested end will go on to high school. A great step in advance is made by getting Normal Training in our high school here in Ogalalla. Among our very best teachers for rural schools are those who have had normal training in high schools. We hope to see the time when every one who receives a certificate shall have had normal training. </seg>
            <seg id="p624">576 tA number of pupils have carried on the reading circle work. Our ool libraries suffered a severe blow when the law was changed from uat" to "May." In this country it would be better if districts were ipelled to buy library books. State aid to weak districts has been a wonderful help to the few districts who have received aid. It will be needed for some time to come as tuere is little chance of some of our sand hill districts having sufficient revenue from taxes to hold five months of school. (We the apprppriation could be increased enough to allow seven n'ontlvs of school and pay high school tuition for scholars.) In order to provide schools for our increasing school population we have had to divide some of our large districts. While our districts aver - age more than twenty sections of land it will be seen that consolidation does not interest us to any great extent. (Mrs.) GEXEVIEVE RICHMOND. County Superintendent. KEYA PAHA COVXTY. The qualifications of the teachers of Keya Paha county are not as good as they should be. Owing to the fact that we have no normal training high school in the county and are a long distance from any normal college we are at a great disadvantage in securing normal trained teachers. The majority of the schools are being taught by teachers who have had no normal training at all. There are very few districts in the county that are able to have nine months of school, so the free high school law does not affect us much, and on that account we do not have as many eighth grade grad - uates as we should have. K["he course of study is being followed very closely in most of the Is. The financial condition of meet of the schools limits the y books to a very few. Ehere are several consolidated districts in this county and tht-y ving very good satisfaction. The only transportation that is done in this county is where the district builds a barn at the house and the scholars furnish their own conveyances. Most of the districts that receive state aid are very much in debt. In order to get the state aid they must have five months of school each year. The amount received from state aid added to their income will not pay for the five months of school, and thus they are continually increasing their indebtedness. A. BOSHART, County Superintendent.

            <seg id="p625">577 so that the roads were next to impassable for two months or more. This works a great hardship in this western country, where the aver - rge distance of the pupils from the school house is almost three miles. In spite of this fact the attendance was remarkably good. FThe county has benefitted by the strong corps of teachers it has the past year. With only two exceptions, all the teachers finished their schools. Some of the western counties reported a shortage of teachers, but Kimball county had every position filled. One reason for this is the fact that the districts are very large and so can pay pretty good wages. The county enjoyed the benefits of the traveling libraries fur - nished by the state. As no permanent library of any size is located in the county, the people appreciated the opportunity of reading good books and patronized the library as often as they could get to town. It is the purpose during the coining year to place books in the outlying corners of the county, where the people are so fai from town that they can not come in very often. The county high school made good advances this year. While the enrollment is still small, the teaching force is considerable above the average in ability and experience. There are three teachers in the high school and their average salary is $94.00 per month. For the coming year the average salary will be $97.00. Considering the small enrollment, this insures that the school will get only the very best teachers. CLAUDE L. ALDEN. County Superintendent KXOX COUXTY PWith the thought in mind, "As the teacher, so is the school," we doing out utmost to secure better teachers. Third grade teachers almost a thing of the past. It is thought that the task in taking charge of from eighteen to forty children, coming from varied home trainings, is one in which experience and educational qualifications are absolutely essential. Ee wages paid to the Knox county teachers are fair and the teach - )loyed are of better grade than heretofore. Better wages have t about the employment of better trainel teachers, the niini - tlary being from $50.00 to $6r&gt;.00 per month. E3ur schools are turning out an honest product, keeping wlttaii s provided. But with better teachers and better supplies, we can the county in corresponding degree, more satisfactory service. Ris year two new school districts have been formed. Tw houses have been built. The apparatus userl in the ;e schools the best in Knox county. There are many districts whicli should be consolidated, for we could provide much better schools because fewer teachers would be needed, and a better grade can be secured, ami supervision inaugurated. It is by the consolidation of these country schools that they !&gt;» </seg>
            <seg id="p626">578 equal to the city schools — and still within reach of the farm homes. By means of consolidation the health of our children is protected, the boys and girls kept under the protecting care of the parents and the cost of an education lessened. I speak from experience when I say f.t all arguments for such a change will be in favor of consolidation many of the schools of this county. Knox county employs 204 teachers. The state course of study ie used in every school. Eighth grade state examination.; have conducted and out of :'.~&gt;o applicants examined, 147 were awarded high school admission certificates and diplomas. Erly every school has its library, and pupils' reading circle being promoted. Library certificates and diplomas are being , and grades added to eighth grade work. The reading circle work is being done by a number of our teach - ers, but we feel that it is not reaching the rues who need it most. Almost invariably, the teacher who keeps well up in her work is the one to do satisfactory work in this line, while the sluggard remains behind, and then asks the favors of the superintendent. We have much to do in the matter of compelling the attendance of pupils at school. We have here the proposition of securing the at - tendance of many Indian children. This is being looked after, and the tuition collected from the government. During the next year Bloomfleld will probably become a city with a well equipped city school system. Creighton will also soon claim this right, while Niobrara. Verdigre and Winnetoon have made some much needed improvements by adding extra teachers and extra grades to their schools. Euch pride is taken in the normal training classes of this county, ber of excellent teachers have gone out from our schools and the classes are istill larger tlian before. ABBIA If. XEWBERRY.

            <seg id="p627">579 Among the noticeable improvements in rural school conditions ■are the improvements in school buildings and grounds, and the installing of heating and ventilating systems.

Our teachers are making a reasonable use of the state course of study, placing emphasis upon the essential parts, are making the leading circle work a means of growth, and are cooperating with the school boards and the superintendent in trying to have first class schools which there is the right attitude toward the school work. A live teachers' institute suited to the needs of rural teachers and iewhat closer supervision are two factors for making better schools. We believe that a longer tenure of service would improve our Only one-half of the teachers of Lancaster county rural schools were teaching in the county last year. \V. H. GARDNER, County Superintendent. LINCOLN COUNTY. Different sections of Lincoln county vary greatly in productiveness. causing our school districts to vary in valuation from $."&gt;.4::n $103,159.00. This condition calls for a variety of teachers. During the past year rural teachers in our county held ajl classes of certifi - cates, including emergencies and professional life. Each year we are having to issue fewer permits to teachers who have not qualified. The normal training in the high school, together with the junior normal, is helping us to reduce the number of this class of teachers. If either of these schools were to be discontinued it would cripple our teaching force to a great extent. Our school buildings are as varied as our teachers. In one dav's ride one might see a log, a sod, a frame, a cement, and a brick rural school house. The Platte Valley School, a cut of which we present herewith, will be thoroughly modern in every respect, when completed. It has a basement with hot air furnace, play room, and two toilet room.;. There are two large school rooms, well lighted, with the light from the left and the rear, and plenty of blackboard space; teachers closet and book closet built into the wall, and spacious cloak rooms off from each room. The two school rooms are separated by a sliding partition so that they may be thrown together for large gatherings. The water system for the toilet rooms and for the two drinking fountains in the school rooms, is supplied by windmill and pressure tank. It is intended to use these for watering trees, lawn. etc. The sewer outlet is to &amp; regular cement reduction tank which in turn empties into an </seg>
            <seg id="p628">580 fensive cinder bed for nitrification. The building is of Dressed brick 1 was erected at a cost of $6000.00. It is used as a social center the community. The two little hollow tile and stucco school buildings just south of North Platte, in Dist. Xo. 127, will be thoroughly modern when conpleted. There is a hot air furnace, and two toilet rooms in the basement. A windmill and pressure tank will supply the water for the toilet rooms and the drinking fountains. The school room is about 24 x 28 with a seating capacity of about thirty. Light is on the rear and left. Small windows in front throw light to the celling. The cloak room is all along one side of the room. These two buildings were erected at a cost of $1800.00 each, and it is estimated when the plumb- Ing and water system is in, the cost will not exceed $2200.00. In all of these buildings the architect has endevored to get the best of ventilation possible, to have the light just right for both teacher and pupils, and to have as much blackboard space as possible. We have more than two hundred in our eight grade graduation class this year. Many of these have applied for free high school privileges. Many more would be in school next year if it were not that they were forty miles or more from a high school. Even when they cau afford it the parents hesitate to send the children so far at such a tender age. Consolidation is being discussed in two different parts of the county. If they are successful a rural high school will be organized. The great need of this county is to strengthen the rural schools so that the older boys and girls of the country can get a practical education at home. CL.EO R. CHAPPELL, County Superintendent IX)IP COVXTY During the past year we had plenty of applications from qualified teachers for the schools and it was necessary to issue but four temporary permits, and these were issued to teachers who had held good F^cond grade certificates. A goodly number of our progressive teachers attend the normal during the summer months and return infused with new ideas and more fully prepared for their school work. RBut few pupils of this county have been benefited by the free school law, as nearly all of the districts are exempt from the high il tax. All of the schools have been provided with the course of study and &lt;&gt;-ir progressive teachers are following the course as outlined with but variations. One great hinderance to good school work is the irregular attendance, caused principally by the great distance some of the children are compelled to travel. It is no uncommon thing to see i hildren from six to sixteen years old walking from two and a half to three and a half miles to school over the sand hills. In many places some ride or drive five or six miles. In bad weather many of these are </seg>
            <seg id="p629">581 .ates to the pupils bag been of great assistance toward improving the attendance. BVbout two-thirds of the teachers of Loup County have been doing fading circle work this year. Owing to poor roads and the schools far apart, the teachers who were unable to attend the met - once each month have submitted note books covering the work up at the meetings. Loup County being one of those counties where most of the land is Kinkaid homesteads, many of the districts have but littlt' taxable property and would be unable to maintain but very little school were it not for the "State Aid." A few districts that are very worthy ar. entitled to receive any of this funJ lawfully as they have been unable to procure the required twenty sections of land for the district In a few cases of this kind they are unable to hold any school. EOne district in the county is nine miles long and six miles school is held in a dwelling near one corner of the district. There a number of districts that contain thirty-six sections. M ■y district in the county votes the maxium tax levy each year. Bo school in the county carries work above the eighth grade ex - le Taylor school, which has the ninth and tenth grades There are a number of sod school houses in the county, but as soon as the settlers make proof on their homesteads and the revenue increas - es these will be replaced by frame buildings. There are no ni school buildings either in the town or rural districts. In many of the schools the old uncomfortable, straight-backed, home made seats been replaced by those of modern construction. There are but fev tricts that do not furnish text books and but few that do not have some library books. Most of the schools have maps, globes and many have an organ. I am happy to nay that the majority of our teachers are able to play and the opening exercises in many schools consists of music and singing. MABEL McKIMMKY. County Superintendent.

About one-half of the teachers of the county are graduates from the normal training work, and in but few instances the work that they do shows a marked difference over that done by teachers who have not had this training or its equivalent. There are no districts which have had to have state aid, the taxes in every case being high enough to meet the needs of the district. E&gt;wing to the financial condition of the county itself, we have been e to have any of the industrial work for the county as a whole. 1 some districts the teachers have done some very interesting along that line. Most of the schools of the county observe the special days with appropriate exercises and much interest has been displayed in the schools by reason of this. There has been a great improvement in the past year in the equipment and condition of the various schools. Many of them have installed the Waterbury system of heating and ventilating, the sani - tary water cooler, and many other things. The buildings themselves have been repaired and the school grounds improved. EIn the matter of county associations of teachers, excellent at - iance hac been the rule.

Special stress has been put on the teachers' supervision of the noontime luncheon period and the playground periods. We have received excellent results along this line and are sure if thes* periods are properly conducted, the school hours will be devoted to instruction and study periods, and cases of discipline during school hours will be a thing of the past. Emphasis has been placed on teach - ers' daily preparation of all leeeons to be taught. The teacher's plan is written and placed on her desk for reference through the day and her afBigrunents are definite, which saves much time.

MCKOLLS COIXTY. The schools of Nuckolls county have a high standard at present, and it is my hope and desire to continue raising that standard. I am especially interested in the so-called industrial work, boys of the county have entered the Nebraska corn growing contest for this year. Next year we will make it fourteen if possible and con - tinue to increase the number year by year. This is the first yemr Eckolls county has had any success in organizing a Hoys' and girls' b. The teachers' reading circle has been very successful and a great deal of good has been accomplished by it. There have been eight local meetings and two county meetings. A number attended the di - and state associations. The teachers have been very faithful in doing the reading circle work. The note books show careful study of the books and are very neatly written. There was only one third grade certificate issued in Nuckolls county last year. Wages for rural teachers ranged from $40 ' $60.00. Two teachers have contracted for their schools this year, re - ceiving $65.00 per month. The indications are that no district will pay less than $50.00. The supply of teachers about evenly meets the Five schools of the county have voted to build new school build - ings, one of which will become a twelve grade school, at Hardy. I am sure it will be well enough equipped and the teachers sufficiently qualified to make it another four-year accredited high school. This will make Nuckolls county the possessor of four accredited high schools, two ten grade schools, and three nine grade schools. The other four school buildings are to be built in our rural districts. One of these districts has been recently formed. The school boards of thene districts are progressive and will see to it that the best and newest eprovements will be used and that they will be properly equipped th books, seats, light and ventilation. Consolidation is being considered at different places over the county and in some places transportation is provided to other districts where much better advantages are given for learning. We expect to see the work of consolidation working its way into our school system before many years, where the schools will be equipped to afford ad - vantages that will more properly meet the practical industrial life of the county. </seg>

For 19 in. eighth grade graduates numbered 32, applications for free tuition lit For 1911, eighth grade graduates numbered 85, applications for free eition 140. For 1912, eight grade graduates 100, application - &gt;e tuition 160. Before closing this report let me speak a word in favor of our normal training in the high schools. We have three schools that fur - nish the county teachers each year from this work and we are looking for another such a school. This is certainly a step in the right direc - tion. It prepare* tbe student for a chosen work second to none other offered and brings such opportunity nearer the door of our children's homes. It prepares the pupil who enters this' railing to do something of practical worth for himaelf and others. It brings with it the niaii principle for which all education should strive to impart, a prepara - tion for life. In talking with members of school boards and others in - tested in the education of their children, I find them of the opinion t more practical courses should be added to our high schools, such the normal training. ■.

A great y of our teachers have "With Credit" and "With Honor" o 3 and there seems to be keen desire amonx the teachers to ■ higher grade of county, city and state certificates. Most of our nning teachers have had normal training in some high school or state normal before entering the profession, which makes their work more proficient from the beginning. We have very few third Cde certificates and no emergency certificates are issued in this nty. Be have two normal training high schools in Ctoe county and rnieh many of our most successful teachers. In the state eighth grade examinations 136 pupils successfully passed, and tbe greater per cent of them have made application for free high school tuition for next year. One hundred and seventy - eight pupils took advantage of the free high school law In this county the past year, one district having eleven students and another district nine students for which to pay tuit'on. But there seems to be no complaints against the law, and in general it is thought to be very sat - isfactory.

A period is given each day at our county teachers' institute to the study and application of the course of study. EThe reading circle work is carried on in this county by means of note book system, which seems to be very satisfactory.

Marked progress has been made during the past bienniuin In the schools of Pawnee County in several respects. School boards have endeavored to carry out the plan of working in uniform textbooks in schools thruout the county, and this has resulted in greatly improved work on the part of both teachers and pupils. Texts have been chosen that are so arranged as to conform nicely with the course of study, teachers are required to follow out each month's work care - fully, quarterly tests are sent out, and a close check kept upon all the work. In this way we have greatly increased the percentage of eighth grade graduates. Teachers have endevored to improve their standings in certifica - tion, all have been faithful in attendance at teacher's meetings, and have met all requirements in regard to reading circle work. POne hundred and fifty-one pupils completed the eighth grade ex - ations this year, and a large number of these have made applica - for free high school privileges. In all 152 free high school certi - ficates have been issued this summer for the coming year's work. Owing to the great inconvenience in the matter of train service but three general teachers' meetings are held during the year. The programs are Bo arranged that much real benefit comes to the teachers from these meetings. The reading circle books form the basis of the forenoon session, and the afternoon session is always marked by a lecture from some prominent educator. Kages have increased during the past year, $40 being the lowest aid in any school, while several country schools pay $55 and $60. CThe county superintendent has published a monthly paper in the rest of the schools of the county during the past seven years. The ?r is known as Pawnee County Schools, and has a circulation of nearly five hundred. This publication serves as a good medium in Eching teachers and school officers and keeps all informed and in ge touch with the work being emphasized in the various schools. During the past biennium special stress has been placed upon reading, mental arithmetic, writing and spelling. Contests have been held, and school boards have given prizes as special incentives in their districts, which has added much to the interest and progress in these very essential branches.

Owing to extremely dry weather the boys have not e usual success in their growing of corn. A number of new heating plants have been installed in both the rural and village schools. Nearly every school has an organ, good pictures, libraries, sanitary water tanks and individual drinking cups. The majority of the schools have wells on the school grounds. The normal training course has afforded us many teachers that are doing excellent work. However, there is a decided lack in practical training to especially fit teachers to an understanding and appreciation or rural conditions and environmei.t. We certainly need teachers prac - tically trained to meet conditions as they exist, to comprehend those conditions, and thus better them. We cannot hope to have our rural schools provide the kind of education needed by the farmer's son and tghter.to fit them for better, fuller and happier living. to lead them to appreciation of their environment and its possibilities, so long as rural school course is arranged .with the sole purpose of fitting &lt;e same sons and daughters for the high school, when only about per cent of them ever get any education beyond that afforded them, he country school.

During the past two years ten new modern school houses have been built in the city and rui«l districts of Flatte County. In the building of each of these ten school houses a practical architect was employed to draw the plans and superintend the construction. These schools are modern in every respect and the pride of the community Although Platte County is making rapid strides in the erection of new school homes for our boys and girls, we still have several school build - ings that are far from being sanitary in light, heat and ventilation. About fifty per cent of the rural schools of Platte County are •■quipped with a system of heating and ventilating. The first plant of this kind was installed over four years ago. In no instance have teach - ers, pupils or patrons complained as to any defects in these systems, but all are enthusiastic as to practical and hygienic results being ob - tained. The Nebraska course of study is doing much for the uniformity of work in the rural schools of Platte County. It is a worthy guide to the experienced teacher and indispensable to the teacher who is teach - ing her first term: Platte County schools are in much better con - dition as to grades and progress in class work, since an effort has been made to comply with the work outlined as near as conditions will per - mit.

Comparing the reports of beginning teachers who have had normal training in high school, with the reports of those who have not, shows plainly the value and advantage of normal training.

In the northern part along the Niobrara river, the soil is rich and quite solid, while in the southern part, or Kinkaid section are the sand hills. Here the soil is loose and sandy and the region is adapted to stock raising and grazing more than to farming; yet most of the settlers raise grain enough for their own use. This condition of soil affects the schools In two principal ways: Elrst. it makes the districts vary in area from four to forty «ec - and, second, it makes the teaching of agriculture in the rural i a difficult proposition; for, methods cf soil culture that may practical in one vicinity may fail in another. Besides, we have t book adequate for the condition. The large size of many of the districts in the sand hills greatly inconveniences many of the children, for the distance to the school house (three or four miles) is so great that it is impossible for small children to attend regularly in bad weather, and almost impossible, at times, for the older ones. Efhere are. in the county two towns, Hassett and Newport, and has a high school. At Hassett the pupils may take eleventh grade , while Newport maintains the ninth- and tenth grades. tis a lamentable fact that conditions are such that most of our j are compelled to begin teaching on a third grade certificate and them, thus far, have succeeded in obtaining first grade certifi- However, the last year there were three professional life certifi - i force in the county and one first grade state certificate and another applicant is now seeking a professional certificate. In order to furnish an incentive for the teachers to spend their vacations in the summer schools and to induce them to better qualify themselves, I have asked the school boards to grade the wages according to the grade of certificate held. I have asked them to fix the wages as follows: An emergency, $25 to $30 per month; a third grade, $30 to $35 per month; tcond grade, $35 to $45 per month; and a first grade, $45 or more month. The Rock county teachers' association convenes twice a year. In the autumn they meet at Bassett and in the spring at Newport.

Our junior industrial exposition last year was decidedly a success. needle work and manual training exhibits being much in the major- Last year was the first time our schools took up manual training and it was indeed surprising the way the boys became interested in this work. Models of windmills, farm buildings, school houses, farm im - plements, wheelbarrows, hay stackers, etc., were made with the great - est care in workmanship and operated to perfection. The manual training exhibits attracted so much attention that a portion of them were later exhibited at- two farmers' institutes in the county. Many of our boys now have tools and are spending their vacation in useful E School rooms, buildings and grounds have been receiving consid - e attention in Sarpy county. School boards and teachers never get rest until school rooms are made sanitary, furnished with suit - pictures and equipment and the school grounds are made beautiful trees. Some members of school boards who are slow to action Hy get on the other side of the street when they see the county rintendent in town. Fortunately we have but few members of kind and the number is growing smaller. EOur modern rural school buildings are evolutioniztng, each receiv - some Improvement over the last. One is now being constructed I hope to illustrate in the next annual report. Two of our populous school districts recently formed a rural high school consolidation and will establish a full four year high school at liellevue. The districts are large, both having six school buildings and fourteen teachers, so it was thought advisable to consolidate for high school purposes only. The plan is to arrange manual training and do - mestic science departments and make the course of study the most practical possible. Our plan in Sarpy is not to educate the few at the expense of the many, but to educate all for real service in life. H. A .COLLINS, County Superintendent. SALXDERS COUXTV. Saunders county, on account of its agricultural possibilities, its location between the metropolis and the capital, and its splendid class of people, ranks high among the counties of Nebraska. Educational advancement is being made, especially along lines of agriculture, man - ual training, and domestic science. The Wahoo schools added to their course of study for last year both manual training and domestic </seg>
            <seg id="p645">597 departments proved successful in that they awaken new interest, gave students an opportunity to obtain practical knowledge, and induced a larger number to remain in the high school. About seventy-five pupils from the rural eighth grades entered the Wahoo high school. b&gt; many more that attended the other high schools of the county. This county has two twelve year schools and Prague is planning to add the twelfth year. We have ;it present five schools having eleven grades, and several others having one or two years of work above the eighth grade. In all, we had seventeen schools having all or part of the high school grades during last year. A class of fifty-four was graduated from the Wahoo school and twenty-three from Ashland. A large number of these took the teachers' training course and are now equipped with certificates for teaching. ■he rural eighth grade promotion exercises that are held each year 1910 in the opera house in Wahoo. act as an incentive to keep in the country schools until they have finished the eight grade*. This year there were one hundred in the class, not including any from the accredited schools. E Teachers of the county are, as a rule, working for higher grades •ertifiiates and many of them are taking one or two years in a nal school after finishing the high school course. Others are roving by taking normal work during the summer term offered by schools. Kiere is a demand for teachers who have had experience or those ve taken a course beyond the high school. Eit year there was a surplus of teachers in the county and this e supply is even greater. Many of those who cannot secure will enter one of the .Normal schools and enter upon the i course. Khe Quarterly Questions were used for the first time last year and ound very helpful in following the course of study. There wu a tble improvement in the manuscripts of eighth graders who took lation. We shall use these quarterly questions next year. K&gt;achers of the county are for the most part taking the reading work. They think the books of this year and of last to be ting and helpful. Considerable improvement in the way of new school buildings. new furnishings, etc., are being made. Ceresco built a fine brick echool house of four rooms last year, Prague remodeled and added more rooms, Dist. No. 6 built a fine new school house, and district 3 and district 65 are planning to build soon. The Ashland .schools are very prosperous and have taken special interest in athletics and debating. They have the best equipped play- ground in the county. Institute, held each year in connection with Chautauqua, ia well attended. Last year we had an enrollment of two hundred three. </seg>
            <seg id="p646">598 This was twenty more than the number of teachers required for the schools of the county. Our Saturday associations are well attended and enjoyed. Eiis year we hope to have a school board meeting in January, hool officers of the various districts are, many of them, wide to the advancement of public school interests and a round table 5 of this kind might be helpful. E. B. O. WILLIAMS, County Superintendent SKWAU1) COUNTY A school board association was formed in this county several ago and has been of great benefit in improving school conditions. The meetings were held in June in connection with the teachers ite. This time of meeting came when most school board members busiest on their farms and so it was decided to try a mid-winter ng. Our first meeting was held in February with an attendance nt ninety members. The meeting was a success for it came at a time vxhen men were not engrossed in their work and were willing to discuss school improvement. Although the weather and roads were bad last year we had an attendance of sixty-five interested members. • member of the state department has always been present at these meetings to aid in the discussion and suggest needed improve - ments. But much of the good in these programs comes from the members comparing notes, telling cf improvements made or to be made. The right kind of school officers feel a pride in their school r.nd will keep its standard as high as that of the surrounding districts, of the districts are paying the members for their time and expenses when they attend. This is a step in the right direction and I hope the time is near when all districts will do so. B'ward is centrally located in the county and the three yearly gs of the Seward county teachers' association are held here, ogram usually consists of papers and discussions and often some tent educator addresses the teachers. Ehe reading circle work is carried on by eight monthly meetings n each of the eight towns of the county. These meetings are t-ted by a local manager usually the principal or superintendent town school. Most of the teachers are doing satisfactory work t is very evident that those who are keeping up this work, are who are getting the best positions and the best salaries. During the past two years four new buildings have been erected. These buildings are modern in heating, lighting, ventilating and equip - ment. Several other districts are getting ready to build by raising their levy to create a building fund. Many of the buildings have been built thirty years and will soon have to be replaced, and with a little care in their supervision the boards are more than willing to make them </seg>
            <seg id="p647">599 The Seward and Beaver Crossing normal training high schools fur - nish us with a number of good teachers each year. The normal train - ing high school is doing more for the rural schools than any other one thing. Our "Normal Schools" have been unable to furnish teachers for even the city positions and so most of our rural teachers without professional training. The normal training high schools have been supplying teachers who have an idea of method and a desire to become proficient teachers. Superintendent E. C. Bishop and Miss Rowan came out in the spring of 1910 and helped to organize the boys 'and girls' clubs and in December of the same year we held our first corn show and educa - tional exhibit. Much of the work exhibited at this show was work that the pupils had done under the instructions sent out from the state department that year. In connection with the exhibit a short course for the boys and girls was provided and Professor K. \Y. Hunt. Mr. Nelson, and Superintendent Bishop addressed afternoon meetings for the parents. This work was such an inspiration to the work in agri - culture and domestic science that it has been continued. The exhibit work gives pupils and teachers a chance to compare their work with that of other schools and is either a satisfaction when their work compares favorably or a spur to greater effort if their work is not up to the standard. This exhibit and short course has been made a success by the loyalty and earnest effort of pupils and teachers, and by the willing contribution of school districts and the Seward Com - mercial Club. An effort is being made to have a general improvement of school grounds. Several school boards are planting trees and raring for them in the proper manner. It is really not a question of planting trees, but the proper care afterward that insures succe&gt; schools are adding play ground equipment, some have added swings and see-saws and one a "giant-stride." In some schools teachers have tlone much for the community by securing a traveling library and en - couraged all kinds of industrial work and manual training. One dis - trict holds a district corn show, prior to the county corn show each year, which the patrons attend with interest. Teachers are planting bushes and shrubs on the grounds, vines about the porches and making the schools appear more like a home. With school grounds and build - ings made more attractive and homelike, with playground equipment. and with teachers' salaries sufficient so that only well qualified teach - ers and teachers in sympathy with child life may be employed, our rural schools will become so interesting that parents will be unable to pupils at home; anl we will have no further need of a compulsory at - tendance law. \V.

            <seg id="p648">600 SHKIillt A X COUNTY. f Sheridan County has 113 school districts and employs about 110 •hers. During the past two years, six school districts have complet - their organization and have built school houses. Generally, there been considerable improvement in buildings and equipment throughout the country. While much remains which ought to be done, the expenditure within the last two years of over $25,000 on school buildings, furniture, books and apparatus, indicates a gratifying better - ment in material conditions. LThe situation in the recently settled parts of the county presented a time a very difficult problem. The problem was how to provide school facilities for the children of settlers who had come into the funty and taken up government land. A rather sudden influx of [migration placed a widely scattered school population in unorganised territory. The property subject to taxation was small. Every thing seemed to be in a more or less chaotic state. I am happy to report that this situation has been relieved to some extent. District boundaries have been adjusted to suit the needs and convenience of the people, as far as this is possible in a newly homo - steaded country. School houses have been located at points most accessible to people that have children of school age. The state aid for weak districts has been a great help to these districts. The amount of state aid needed will gradually diminish as more of the real property becomes subject to taxation. The teachers of this country are loyal, energetic, and are animated by a truly professional spirit. Every year we have a number of beginners; but I believe that, in a constantly increasing degree, the beginners enter the work of teaching with more special preparation. Our higher schools have contributed to this result. The Gordon high school added normal training to its course last fall. Seven students received teachers certificates last spring. The Hay Springs high school has strengthened its work. Rushville built a $14,000 addition to its school building last summer. The Northwestern State Normal at Chadrcn is making its influence felt mightly in lifting the qualifica - tions of our teachers to a higher plane. Tdese schools are giving ns teachers who are fitted for their work and who are accustomed to conditions in this country. The reading circle work has been done chiefly by note book and correspondence. Our work has been limited almost wholly to the notebook because of the great distance which teachers would have to travel to attend meetings at central points. Realizing the value and importance of meetings and discussions, I am of the opinion, neverthe - less, that the teachers are getting no inconsiderable good from the work as it is now carried on. The Nebraska course of study has been placed in the hands of • </seg>
            <seg id="p649">601 been insisted upon. The course of study has helped greatly in grading the schools of the county. The quarterly test questions are also used. Short terms, beginning at different times of the year, make it hard in many instances, to follow closely the course of study and to use the test questions in the regular order; but careful thought and a thorough knowledge of the course of study have done much to enable the teachers t adapt these aide to their own situation and to make a real use of m. PAn effort has been made to put into the rural schools some forms dustrial work. Local conditions seem to render the organization carrying out of the work of Boys' and Girls' Clubs exceedingly difficult. Our attempts have been made along less ambitious lines. Teachers are supplied with practical helps, which consist principally of simple direction and exercises in the home and industrial arts and the teachers are urged to put these helps to the best possible use in their school room. Since most of the terms of the school in the country are too short for the pupils to cover even the common branches, the amount of industrial work accomplished is necessarily meager. Yet most schools doing this work have done fairly well. bOur efforts are being put forth mainly in the following directions: ater thoroughness in the essentials and increased ability to make ctical use of what is learned. C. P. KELLEY County Superintendent SIOUX (OIXTV. Progress of Sioux county schools is steadily advancing, materially as well as intellectually. New districts are constantly being formed from parts of old districts originally too large to accommodate all pupils, within the districts, with school privileges. The dividing of dis - tricts is largely due to rapid settlement of the country. ■ State aid is given to about one-third of the districts &lt; and makes it possible for a number of children to enjoy school !ges who otherwise would not have any. There is very much encouragement aroused in Northwestern Ne - braska through the three-year homestead law. It is hoped that it will hasten the increase of tax, which will rescue many districts from of needful improvements and necessary means te^^ccomplish good work in the country school. Qualified teachers are in demand. About one-fifth of the teach - ers, who are teaching at the present time, hold either an enier - certificate or permit. School officers are urged to. do their part in hiring qualified teachers. The Chadron normal will be one of the chief factors in abandoning the issuance of emergency certificates. But as soon as all who are interested in school matters will co-operate schools will be greatly improved. This is gradually being done. </seg>
            <seg id="p650">602 PPhe use of the course of study is doing much for the schools. lers, who make it a point to study the course, are teaching school commendable manner. The library law is far from being com - plied with, but there is some progress in that line. The neglect of getting libraries is due to financial conditions. Many schools money for library purposes by means of giving entertainments. tThe eighth grade examination and free high school attendance have reased interest that will continue to grow. Last year there were eteen eighth grade pupils who received diplomas. Eight are ending high school under free attendance law. Er'hile the teachers' association is not very active, from two to county meetings are held every year. The county is large and teachers do not attend on account of the far distance they have to come. EresK is put on improving school houses. A few are not com - s and may be improved so that it is possible to keep them san- Most of them are in good shape and a number of them are what up to date schools. In general the teachers are earnest and strive to do good work In the school room. Progress may seem very slow unless records are investigated. At this writing there is here a good school spirit and progress doubtless will advance from year to year. MARY J. FEXSKE. County Superintendent. STAXTOX COUNTY. The eighth grade examinations have not been so popular in tn's county in the past as they have been in some other places. They are becoming more and more popular. Last year seventy-four applicants wrote on the examinations, forty-seven writing the entire examination. Twenty-seven of these passed and were issued diplomas. All but two are now in some high school. PTwo regular county teachers' meetings are held during the year h are well attended. These with the district meeting at Norfolk the annual institute make up our list of meetings. Local teachers superintendents and one outside speaker each time make up the talent for the county meetings. Fifty-two of our seventy-two teachers are carrying the reading circle work. No certificate is renewed under the minimum require - ments unless reading circle work has been done according to county regulations. EVo new rural school houses have been built during the last three . We have no thoroughly modern rural schools in the county. Wt oping that a great awakening may come soon.

            <seg id="p651">603 good work in making it possible to secure normal trained teachers for the rural schools in this way. Normal training graduates show a marked superiority as beginning teachers over the purely academically trained student. The first great cause for laek^of progress in our rural schools is lack of trained teachers. Ty normal training materially lessens this evil. Another crying evil in our educational system hindering the progress of our rural schools is lack of s 1 ision. The undersigned feels that the supervision he is able to give I.i8 schools amounts to but little as compared to that of the city sui tendent, who has (in general) a more efficient corps of teachers, who need less personal supervision. average salary of female teachers in the county is forty-eight liars and two cents, for males sixty-nine dollars and tklrty-MYen c The average salary for female teachers has increased about three collars per month and for males about ten dollars per month in the last two years. The highest salaried position in the county - saperintendency of the Stanton schools, which pays fifteen hundrf:l dollars per year. The annual salary of the county superintendent is thirteen hundred dollars with an allowance of thirty-five dollars to defray the expenses of the eight grade examinations. We are urging full compliance with compulsory attendance law and the employment of better trained and more experienced teachers. « Forty per cent of our rural teachers are teaching their first term this year.) We recommend a uniform list of text books for the use of the rural schools. ARCHER I.. BIRXHAM. County Superintendent. THAYKR COUNTY Thayer County has ninety-eight school districts. It requires one hundred and forty-eight teachers to supply the districts. We have three twelfth grade, one eleventh grade, and six tenth grade high schools. Two of the twelfth graie high schools (Hebron and I' port) give normal training. Eighth grade commencement exercises were held on June 1, 1912. at which time eighty-five pupils received their diploma?. The whole day was taken for these exercises. The forenoon program consisted of the commencement address, presentation of diplomas, musical selec- Sons and readings. The noon hour was spent in the club room of the &gt;urt house where all took part in a picnic dinner. In the afternoon an itertainment was given by the National Concert Company. Six of the eleven towns in Thayer County have, within the past few years, built new brick high school buildings. A number of new rural school houses have been erected and plans for more are being made. Two teachers' meetings were held. One in February, Professor </seg>
            <seg id="p652">604 University, addressing the teachers at this meeting. The other was held in May. Deputy State Superintendent, Robert I. Elliott, gave the address at this time. Both meetings were well attended. The reading circle work of this county has been well done. Most of the teachers Kve gone to summer schools to spend their vacation and better them - [ves for their profession. A. T. HOLTZEN, County Superintendent. THOMAS COUNTY Thomas County in the sand hill region is still what we might say, young in regard to* school conditions, some pupils having to go as far as five or six miles to school, others being too far away to attend at all; but a number of new school houses are being erected and I think there will be no children without school privileges. The dis - tricts are all large and in several instances there is more than one &gt;ol hosue in a district. One district maintains seven schools. It is not thought advisable to cut them up in smaller districts as they are supported to a great extent by the railroad tax. The rural school buildings are comfortable but not modern. INEZ OAKES. County Superintendent. THURHTOX (Wl'XTY While we do not have ideal conditions in all respects in this county, yet, on the whole, our teaching force is" progressive. The following is the schedule of certificates held by our teachers: Life, 12; state first, 3; state second, 1; county first, 2; county second, 36; county third, 3; county superintendents permit, 4; total, 61. Fifty-seven applicants registered for the eighth grade examina - tions. Of these, thirty-three were successful. E Applications for free high school privileges for the ninth grade are follows: males, seven; females ten; total, 17. For tenth grade, [es, two; females, none; total, two. Total applications, 19. We are sorry that the course of study has not been followed as closely as it might have been, but we hope to do better another year. Many eighth grade failures are due to this one thing. It seems to be as essential to follow the course as it is to have a daily program to follow. School libraries are in their infancy in this county. It seems that little care has been taken in the selection of books suited to the needs of the children.' Some teachers have little conception as to what books are best adapted to children in the lower grades. For instance, the county superintendent visited a school and listened to the teacher reading to the children from The Professor at the Breakfast Table. This was immediately after the noon hour. At the close of the reading, which continued for half an hour, all were asleep, except two or three </seg>
            <seg id="p653">605 mischievous boys. Many good books are not appreciated by the chil - dren simply because the teacher has failed to properly direct the pupils' reading. Districts No. 7, 11 and 12 have consolidated and built a handsome brick building in the village of Rosalie. District No. 27 has outgrown its old quarters and has erected a splendid frame structure. Kis county is placing great emphasis upon teachers' organiza - id upon more thorough work in such subjects as spelling, read - ithmetic and agriculture. JOHN \Y LANG. County Superintendent. VALLJEY COINTY E Because of the new laws on certification the teachers of this county much better trained and qualified. The normal training in the high school has helped to provide us with more and better teachers Many students are taking advantage of the free high school law Byear. Our three high schools in the county are crowded and a number of our rural schools are doing ninth grade work. Each he number of students taking the eighth grade examination in - s until this year we had over a hundred rural students taking tests. P revival in education has brought about quite a different condi - i this county. The interest manifests itself in the erection of and more modern school buildings. These are in good condition Also the pupils' exhibit display at the county fair has been an - other means of showing the interest felt by the patrons of the county. These exhibits include the industrial work. We have tried to especially emphasize this phase of education; making it as practical as possible. This year was introduced the junior short course which was a d&gt; success in every way. The lack of funds retards the progress along ihese lines, but what is accomplished seems to be generally appreciated The interest in our county association is increasing. Not many teachers attend the district association as it requires too much leave of absence if they attend the state association, and each year our delegation to .that meeting is larger. EVA B. SHUMAN, County Superintendent. r WASHINGTON COUNTY. In the past two years special attention has been given grading of the rural schools.

Eree all-day meetings were held during the school year 1911-1912, ich the reading circle work was taken up in the forenoon — various ers acting as leaders of the sessions. The afternoon sessions of county meetings were devoted to joint programs by Ua ichool officers. All meetings were well attended. In addition to making the reading circle work the basis of the county meetings, note books were submitted each month covering the work in Colgrove's "The Teacher and the School." All the districts have libraries most of which were secured by the efforts of the teachers in giving socials and entertainments. The Nebraska course of study is followed, slight changes only being made to meet local conditions. The daily program is submitted to the county superintendent two weeks after school starts and must meet his approval. If it is uneat'sfactory the teacher is helped to make a suitable program.

The teachers have found Cabot's Ethics of practical value, have enjoyed Winship's Great American Educators, and have liked Col - grove's The Teacher and the School for the help that they have gained No consolidation has ,as yet, been effected .though there has been considerable agitation to that end. One district has transported the mipils to the Guide Rock schools for several years. This has proven satisfactory. Two additional districts expect to follow the same )&gt;lai for the coming year. Industrial work has not been emphasized in this county. There are no boys' and girls' clubs organized. We hope to give special at - tention to this work next year. Special work will be given at the teachers' institute preparatory for it. E&gt;achers who have taken the normal training course in the high are giving excellent satisfaction.

Each district in the county has a course of study and the county superintendent is making every effort to get the county work graded as nearly as may be. This year the teachers have been supplied with the uniform state review questions and in a majority of cases the questions have been used greatly to the benefit of the pupils.

The lighting, heating, and ventilating are excep - tionally One. The physical and chemical apparatus and library are gradually being added to and bid fair for a healthy future. Our high school is accredited and contains a normal training depart - ment for teachers. The young people of Adams and vicinity have taken advantage of the normal training and have done and are doing good work as teachers in the rural schools. We consider the normal department a strong factor in our schools, and it should receive the encouragement and support of all people interested in the cause of education. This year we graduated a class of eight girls and six boys from the high school, and all but one were members of tlie normal training class. We had two literary societies in the high school dur - ing the last year. Each society gave one program each month. "Thoroughness'" is our motto. At this we aim. Prospects for the coming year are quite flattering. A strong corps of teachers has been selected, and we are looking forward to a prosperous and successful school year. C. P.

The building is 68 x 76 feet, two story with basement. With two exceptions the partitions are of solid mas - onry from the foundation up through the entire building. It is • quipped with the gravity system of ventilation, steam heat, and drink - ing fountains. To this equipment was added later electric light and shower bath. There are ten rooms in the building for school purposes besides the gymnasium. The four rooms on the first floor are occupied by the grades up to the eighth. The eighth grade occupies one of the rooms on the second floor. The other four rooms are used by the high school. One of these rooms is a well equipped laboratory, another a large class room and across the entire east side is the assembly room, which, with a rolling partition in the south end sets off another large (lass room. Leaving this partition up the assembly room will sect tut 250 people. The program is so arranged that no regular recita - s are heard in the assembly room. The gymnasium has been the most popular room in the building. Though it is not equipped, it has been used as a place of recreation at times when the weather would not permit outside play. It is 29 V4 x 64 feet. By the opening of the next school year it will be much better equipped and will be used to better advantage. Normal training was added to the course this year. Fourteen en - rolled for the work, seven seniors and seven juriors. Thirteen of these are young ladies. The degree of enthusiasm and interest shown by these students for the normal training is most pleasing. Part of the practice work has been done by the senior class with pupils taken from the fourth and fifth grades, in which department the enrollment is too large for one teacher. A number of pupils are taken for two weeks end the trainers assigned different subjects to teach during that time. At the end of two weeks a change is made in pupils and a change in assignment of work with the training class. The pupils were seated in the room in charge of the eighth grade teacher and taken to another room for their recitation. Each teacher is required to make her plans for every recitation.

Tne science equipment is at a minimum at present, but the board f education has planned to spend a limited amount each year so as o build up a full up-to-date equipped laboratory. With a school so arge in proportion to size of district the lack of funds greatly handi - ape the progress which might be made. In order to overcome this andicap the board hires only thoroughly qualified and prepared eachers. The lowest requirement which will be considered is normal chool graduation, or the equivalent. ?The school is now a full four year accredited high school grant - ng thirty-two University credits, thirty points being required for graduation. Thus far three classes have been graduated with this standing, this year's class being one of six boys and one girl.

This is the only course offered aside from the straight academic course. Plans are afoot to add domestic acimmt* ;&gt;nd manual training in the future, but it will be some time before these may be accomplished. The principal student organization in the high school is the Boys' Booster Club, which meets monthly. At all regular meeting. - « ne hour is spent in discussing real boy problems, (and these are dis - cussed by the boys! and one hour in social time. Tht6e meetings vary in every way so as to break up any monotony that might occur and furnish interest for all. This club has for its motto "Dan't be a quitter." It also has full charge of boys' athletics and it is needl&gt; add that failure is not in the boys' vocabularies. As superintend, in 1 can say that this method of handling boys' athletics has been a sourct - of pleasure and all the unpleasantness which might creep in has been eliminated. The high school men realize that should they over hounds, their fellow school mates will, as they say, "Put the tixin's to them." Girls' athletics have not been so systematically worked out, but by no means have been forgotten. Interest is awakening and the&gt; look forward with much enthusiasm to their coming contests. Through the grades, we have stuck close to the state course ot study, demanding intensive study and giving strict attention to the physical development and health of the child. During the past year Palmer's Method of penmanship was adopted for three years and the Kleanor Smith music was put in under the supervision of Miss Emma Meservey. Both have proven a success.

            <seg id="p670">620 A departmental section has been established in the graded schools of our city during the past three years, which includes the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, all work being done by departments similar to that followed in a high school curriculum. This scheme is proving to be a correct step in helping to bridge over the 'gap" between the grades and the high school. In connection with the departmental section, (lerman has been introduced into the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, the teaching of which is closely correlated with the teaching of Eng - lish. Thirty minutes daily are given to German work in each of the above grades. Normal training has made a decided advancement insomuch as the standard of requirements for completing the course has been ma - terially raised. Students that take the normal training course are required to be in possession of at least a second grade county teacher's certificate when they graduate from the high school. The commercial course is proving, to be one of the most practical phases of school work in our city. Twelve typewriters are kept in constant use. and more could be profitably used were they in our possession. Nothing has been spared in equipping the commercial department, and a two year course in commercial branches is now a part of the high school curriculum. Home economics and manual training are taking a prominent place in meeting the needs of pupils who could not be induced to remain in school, were not some line of industrial work carried on. At least one hundred high school pupils avail themselves of the opportunity of these courses each year. The sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, are privileged to take the more elementary work. E distinctive kindergarten school has been established in the city building. Eighty pupils are enrolled in the kindergarten de - mt, under two well trained teachers. The enrollment in the high school is the largest in the history of the school, numbering 220 pupils in the various courses. A new ward school building is needed under present conditions and will undoubtedly be built within two years. The number of teachers has increased in two years from 19 to 25. A. E. FISHER. City Superintendent. HATTLE CREEK The year 1910 found our school classed along with the eleventh grade schools of the state with five teachers in the grades and two in the high school, including the superintendent.

Application for normal training was made to the state superin - tendent of instruction and the inspector was soon on the grounds and inspected the work. Everything was found to be very satisfactory and the school was placed upon the normal training list, with Mrs. J. tidenb'rg in charge of the normal trainers. Eortly after school began the boys were organized into a mil - jmpany, with the superintendent as drill master. During the veral campfires were held on the banks of the Elkhorn in regular tyle. Suppers were cooked by the boys and all seemed to ;hly enjoy themselves. The girls, however, were not overlooked entirely. They were or - ganized into a domestic science class on the Crete Plan, with about sixteen ladies as instructors. At first a meeting of the ladies wu held in the high schooJ building and the plans were laid before them. Each one seemed to be very much interested in the plan and as a result all the ladies that were present, with the exception of two, vol - unteered to lend their assistance. A four years course was outlined and every girl in the high school enrolled for the work. At the next meeting of the school board the matter of credits was presented and the board voted unanimously to give the girls an txtra credit point • ilM)n the completion of the course. Since then the ladies have been organized into a Ladies Auxiliary for the advancement of the school. Their object is to work for the betterment of the school in every way and to get the patrons more deeply interested in the school. Near the - (lose of the school a contest will be held and the girl presenting the best work will be awarded a prize. Bhe high school course of study has been slightly mo lified for ming year.

An adJition of five new rooms, consisting of a primary rcom. store room, science laboratory, large class room, and an office and library, has been added to the building. A Moline Vacuum Heating System has been substituted for the stoves so that the building is now liniformly heated throughout. In the place of the old toilet and coal building, two separate toilet rooms have been arranged for the boys; one for the boys in the lower grades and one for the older boys. New books have been added to the library and a systematic reading course has been arranged thruout the grades. A pupil by summarizing for his teacher the content* of a library book may obtain credit for the same if he has read carefully and thoroly. If the book is historical in nature the grade is added to his history grade. Likewise standings in geography or in reading may be raised by systematic reading along those lines. In this way a practical effort has been made to check </seg>

Statistics kept at the superin - tt ndenfs office show a remarkable increase in the number of b read and the class work shows an increase in general information on the part of the pupils.

Ten boys are enrolled in this class. The boys do the work in their own gardens, beginning in May and working through the summer. Credit is given for the work if done satisfactorily. This is a new undertaking and a desirable one. This movement is strongly supported by the board of education. The school graduated six from the normal training work. All will teach in this county. The school supports a literary society and a debit - ing team. Also a boy's self-improvement club which meets in conjunc - tion with the domestic science class. The club discusses the vital problems of a boy's life; the danger-points; and how to meet ami overcome them. This organization is a great force for laising the moral ideals of the boys. G.

The city itself has made a steady and whol* - some growth in population and the schools have fully kept the pace with the town. The school census shows an increase from 784 to 816, the high school has grown in enrollment from 155 to 185, and the gradts liave made a similar growth. There is every indication that the preaent year will surpass ail previous years in number of students in attendance. The new high school building begun in the last biennium has been occupied for a year and a half. Of this structure the people of Broken ISow feel justly proud. It is thoroughly modern with ample provision ror light, heat and ventilation. It has well equipped laboratory, good library, large recitation rooms and commodious gymnasium. This </seg>
            <seg id="p680">628 building, planned to give room for about two hundred students, will probably be taxed to its capacity within the next two years. P Owing to the crowded condition of the South Side school a new i school will be required in the near future. Ground has already i purchased for this purpose and steps will be taken to provide for building as soon as funds ran be raised. A new commercial department was opened in the second semester of the year 1911-1912. Typewriters were purchased and a special teacher employed for the work. This course, though practical, is still cultural and is fully equal to the other courses of the high school. The enrollment more than met the expectations of the most sangum. More than a hundred different students were found in the different At , the opening of the year 1912-1913 a domestic science lab - oratory is being fitted up for the large class of girls enrolled for the work. The course will be limited to cooking and sewing at first, but will be extended as the department grows. EUhletics have been in charge of a special teacher for some time This plan will be continued and, in addition, special classes are organized in physical culture. All students are required to take work for short periods fcNjr times a week. To conserve the l of the younger children, supervised play and outdoor classes eing tried out with some siit-ness. The normal training course is a popular one in Broken bow. Fourteen students were graduated from this course last spring im-I htarly all of these have secured positions.

Nothing unusual m accomplished during the year but good steady work was done. F. K. MORROW Supcrintei ( I..W CKXTKH Clay Center, located in the rich farming country of Clay County, and made famous by The Old Trusty Incubator, is an ideal school town. The fact that the town has no saloons adds to the environment. The twelve hundred inhabitants .stand for the highest things in the moral and educational lines. To this end they have built a modern brick build - ing of eight rooms. All of these have been scientifically planned. The building is heated by steam, and has the most modern lighting and ventilation. A well equipped laboratory furnishes ample opportunity for the study of the sciences. Eight teachers are employed for the instruction of the three hun - dred and seventeen pupils. Three teachers are employed in the high school and five in the grades. The twelve grades offering thirty-two points prepare pup!ls for the university. Clay Center is the home of the Clay County Athletic association. The annual meet is held on the fair grounds each spring the next day after school is out, and usually entertains about 2,500 people. Besides this, the school has the track team, baseball team, and boys and girls </seg>
            <seg id="p682">630 t pupils to meet on a common play ground. The patrons are firm vers in the three-fold development of the individual. Enthusiastic as the school is over its athletics, all of the energy is not consumed in that way. The Van Dyke Literary Society furnishes an arena for the training in mental athletics. The high school band of over twenty pieces makes the school lawn a favorite resort during the long pleasant evenings of spring. But more than this, Clay Center can boast of one of the largest and beet school orchestras in the state. Thirty-five instruments, each one selected for its particular place, and under the direction of the superintendent, create the center of attrac - tion during the school year. Hardly an entertainment of any kind pmrn but what the orchestra is called upon to play. The parents are proud of it, while the pupils find much pleasure and profit in the prac - tice and recitals. Much of the success of the school is due to Mr. Geo. Allen who has been president of the school board for great many years. He has been there to build and watch the school grow. Being interested in school work he is always there to aid with his tact and good judgment. Why do so many school districts think that it is necessary to change officers every year? Why not get a good man educated for the place and then keep him? I believe that this question can be asked about the entire educational system. T. E. SPENCKK, City Superintendent.

It is no&gt;v a very attractive and convenient high school building. The roomg are convenient and commodious. The assembly room is said to be one of the finest in the state. Besides the manual tiaining re im and gymnasium, this building has four large, well furnished labora - tories, thoroughly equipped with all necessary apparatus for the teach - ing of the subjects for which these rooms are respectively intended, viz. chemistry, physic--, botany and domestic science. Interest in the industrial work of the grades and high school has been kept up. A course in manual training is provided for every boy and girl in the grades from the kindergarten to the high school. Here, the work is required of all pupils. In the high school, an elective course of two years is given in the ninth and tenth grades. The ninth grade </seg>
            <seg id="p683">631 girls have cooking one semester and sewing the next. The tenth grade girls have cooking the entire year. The ninth grade boys have a semester each for bench work and mechanical drawing. The tenth grade boys have a semester each of lathe work and forge work. Bhe schools have maintained a normal training class each year he law went into effect. While the classes have not been large, &gt;ave been increasing in size each year, until in 1912 the class ■&lt;1 twenty-five members. Although constant effort has been put f3rth to enforce the compulsory attendance law, we do not feel that the results are entirely satisfactory. The "in and out" pupils furnish the most difficult cases to deal with. Truant officers do not like to go frequently to the house for delinquents. Our local authorities rule that legal action can !&gt;«• taken only after the county superintendent has given a week's no - ■ writing to the person who has violated the provisions of the law. Columbus teachers have done the reading circle work in a very creditable manner, having completed, (luring the past year, the study of two of the leading books. — "The Teacher and The School." and "History of Education." In this work, the ti achcrs have shown a marked professional spirit. Salaries have increased gradually. A new salary schedule, adopted this year means an aggregate annual increase of $1 $•• in teachers' wages. Eie school library contains about Il'ihi volumes, largely of a ref - charapter. It has been the aim to encourage pupils to use the library largely for their general reading. Some progress has been made along hygienic lines also. Sanitary drinking fountains have been installed in all buildings equipped with »ater. Sanitary towels have taken the place of the linen towel and sanitary dust cloths have displaced the feather duster. Medical inspec - tion has been employed for two years with good results. Records are kept of the physical condition of each pupil. Parents of children need - ing treatment are notified and asked to consult their family physician So far, the work has been done by physicians who very generously and willingly give their services. Inspection will, however, be more efficient when the board feels justified in providing a paid medical inspector. The chief advantage to be derived from paid service is the right of school authorities to call the physician whenever needed. R M. CAMPBELL.

City Superintendent CIXBERTSOX Conditions in southwestern Nebraska are greatly different in many ways from central and eastern parts of the state. What we find to be true in that regard is likewise true in school work as well. Culbertson differs from any schools in this part of the state because of local conditions. Our attendance is largely foreign in element, and these soon drop out in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades, leav - ing us but a few in the high school. Out of a total enrollment of 260 to 280, we have but 40 in the high school. The two first months la the fall and the last two months in spring are marked by the absence of many of the pupils from the grades, due to the gathering and planting of sugar beets at those times. Our free high school record shows up very small, yet on the other hand we have a goodly number from outside districts attending our high school, and paying their own tuition, due to the fact that many Ey districts cannot pay such tuition, and this is in turn due to the s of crops for the past four years, yet the parents are willing the tuition themselves, that the children may secure schooling. rn spite of these things the school has steadily grown in numbers last few years, having in 1906 but six teachers, and eleven grades, </seg>
            <seg id="p685">633 while at the present time we give instruction in a four year accredited high school and have a teaching force of eight. The past year the board of education caused to be built an addition to the old building, which has doubled our teaching room, giving place for 5 grade rooms, high school assembly room, two recitation rooms, .two eating rooms, and a laboratory for sciences. A double boiler system for steam heating was installed at a cost of $1,150.00, making a grand total of $9,9' for improvements to the building the past year. Our Library has nearly 300 volumes in it, consisting of books of fiction, travel, information, reference and pedagogical subjects. The course of study is in line with the most progressive schools of the state. Our normal training class was organized last fall and has done Kood work in that line. At the present writing it very much looks as twe shall have a class in manual training beginning next fall, is done, it will simply be the forerunner of a domestic science Our chief pride is our laboratory, which we make out to be the most complete in southwestern Nebraska. Our school course provides for a year's work each of chemistry and physics, and in our laboratory we have all apparatus necessary to demonstrate the phenomena studied in elementary physics and chemistry. A conservative estimate would ;&gt;lace a value of $400.00 on the apparatus alone, and another ISM "" on equipment, as tables, desks, and cabinets. Botany has its share in this apparatus, and agriculture and physical geography as well. The new experimental station will be a great help to the class in agricul- Our high school has as organizations, two literary societies and and orchestra. These literary societies give one program a month each, on alternate Friday evenings, from October to March. This has aroused the best school spirit in the community that has ever existed, for the meetings are open 'to the public and about everybody comes. So far our meetings have been held in the assembly room of the high school, but it may be found necessary to move next fall to some other place of meet* ing because of lack of room to accomodate the visitors. GEORGE E. LEE. City Superintendent. The enrollment in the David City public schools has had but a slight increase in the past two years.

An instructor was employed who spends one and one - half days each week giving instruction and directing the work. A piano was purchased and paid for by the high school pupils. The intro - duction of music into the school has had a noticeable effect upon a cer - tain class of boys of this community; a number of young men who were regarded as "toughs" a few years ago now occupy places in some of the church choirs.

Much lis has been purchased witnin the last two years. The high school enrollment this year is forty-tive per cent above that of last year. There are prospects for a similar increase next year. The enrollment in the grades shows a marked increase also. Many children from the rural schools are taking advantage of the oppor - tunities ocered. JOHN L. Z1NK. City Superintendent. KXKTKU. The attendance at the Exeter public schools has not materially increased during the past two years, except in the high school, where the attendance has increased from about thirty-five to about fifty-five, this increase coming chiefly from nan-resident pupils, of whom in the past year there were twenty-four enrolled. The number in the grades is much less than might be expected from our population, owing to there being a parochial school here enrolling from sixty to eighty pupils.

Another teacher is added this year to the high school force, making three regular teachers in the high school exclusive of the superintendent and music teacher, and we expect to put in a more « xtensive business course and to add argumentation to our English course. On the whole we feel that we are making very satisfactory prog - ress, our only serious drawback being the need of an ui&gt;-to-date venient school house. Our lack of laboratory room has made it im - i'OBsible to put in the same improvements in the way of equipment that otherwise we could and should have done. H.

All the requirements of the North Central Association of Colleges and idary Schools were complied with and our school was placed upon the accredited list of that association, the smallest city in the state to receive such recognition. For the past two years four of the high school teachers have been graduates of the University of Nebraska and the fifth teacher a graduate of a standard college in this state.

Siough the general population of Grand Island has increased very illy during the past two years, the school population has not. hool census of 1911 showed a school population of 2,676 2,652 for 1909, an increase of but 24. The enrollment for 1911-12 is 2,258, and the average daily at - tendance is 1 706, an increase of 256 and 182, respectively, over that of 1909. E'he enrollment should and would be much greater but for the e and parochial schools, of which there are five in the city. As however, there is not room to properly accommodate the pupils. ti two new brick two-room buildings with modern heating, light - • ntilation. drinking fountains and other sanitary accommoda - were provided for the opening of the schools in September. ■'hough there are now eight school buildings, all but one of brick one, containing from one to fourteen rooms, there should be two rooms added to each of three small buildings. Kie free high school attendance is but thirty-one, a much smaller r than would be but for the fact that there are three other high i in the county. During the past two years the Grand Island schools have not only maintained, but have increased their efficiency in the lines of work that they undertake, which are purely academical. Though domestic Hcience and manual training have been frequently urged, the author - ities have not seen their way clear to put them in. There is, however, &lt;.IS\\I&gt; ISLAM) </seg>

In the high school there six courses of study aimed to give as broad as possible a founda - for whatever the student may wish to follow aa a life occupa- courses offered are English. German, Latin, College Prepara y. Normal Training, and Business, all four year courses. The courses are well equipped for work. Particularly is this true in the sciences and business departments.

In the high school library of more than a thousand volumes the pupils have splendid opportunities for better preparation than can be had from the regular text. The high school has but one student organization, the Y. W. I'. \. under the direction of Miss Josephine Brown, one of the teachers. In athletics we have teams in basket ball, base ball, and foot ball. It is not the policy of the school, however, to make any point of win - ning so-called championships in any line. We don't believe in them. They are not good for the game or the pupils. The high school does not issue a school paper. It does, however, i)iu out an annual which would be a credit to any school. The great organization pertaining to the schools is the high school alumni association, which is probably the largest in the state. The r.nnual meeting, with banquet, at which not less than 175 are in attend - ance, is held on the evening of the last Friday in the school year. The association is a great factor in maintaining an excellent school ■.8 a corps our teachers are exceptionally strong, and the policy of ■&gt;ard of education in securing the best teachers available and ing them has had much to do with the efficiency of the schools.

EOur first normal training class has a membership of twenty. Six these have taken the examination for teachers' certificates and set to teach the coming year.

Practice has been fine and a good team has been developed. So far only one match game has been played, but our girls are anxious to try their luck on the court. Al'DUBON NEFF, City Superintendent. HASTINGS. The Hastings schools in the past year made but one departure from the established courses of the past few years. By action of the Hoard of Education a night school was established which continued through the winter months from November to April, three nights per week, a total of fifty-eight sessions. Our state law requires that all children under sixteen years shall be regularly enrolled in day school or shall be satisfactorily instructed Bt home. There is but one legal excuse for non-attendance, that in the support of the home the assistance of the child is required during school hours, provided, however, the child has reached his fourteenth birthday. In the enforcement of this compulsory attendance law the superintendent discovered seventeen instances in which the exemption could be lawfully claimed by parent or guardian. — these being found in the home, telegraph office, barber shop, creamery, laundry and cigar shop. A few others claimed exemption, but in test cases brought in county court the judge decided that the evidence did not warrant </seg>
            <seg id="p697">645 The law further provides that children employed between the ages of fourteen and sixteen shall attend night school, their i&gt;ar»-in» nnd employers being required to see that this attendance be regular. On the other hand the statutes do not provide for the establishment of such night schools except at theoptionof the district officers. The plan followed heretofore was to issue a working permit, requiring the 'nipil to sign a statement that he would attend night school wli - directed. In each of the above seventeen cases with one exception, the child, parent and employer were very willing to comply with the law la case the night school was organized. In addition to this number ti.ere were many working boys and girls ab &gt;\v sixteen who inquired about such schools, expressing a desire to take up some f:&gt;rni of ing study. The homes of nearly all these were located almost entirely I] district where smaller houses and cheaper rents prevailed. For reason the school was established in the school building of that ward, three rooms and two halls being first wired for lights. Later two other rooms were lighted. The opening of the school was an - nounced for Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights, 7 to 9 o'clock: no restrictions being made as to who should attend other than the legal ■nendance on the part of the seventeen under sixteen years of age. The first evening there were thirty-one, the smallest number attend - ing any evening, although there were three severely stormy nights with the thermometer registering from 3 to 10 degrees below zero Ot the opening hour. In all there were 87 pupils who attended at least one week, three nights, the average attendance for the •"* nights Deing II. These S7 seemed to fall naturally into four groups: g Those between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, the i y* attendance group, children of widows or cases in which the or mother had satisfied the authorities that the support of the was in part dependent upon the child's earnings. In most cases &gt;verty was evident. B. A group of boys and girls whose attendance at day school bad always been very irregular, they having been kept out to assist parents who do not value school. In most instances they wer. children of beet workers who take their families to the fields in April or early May, returning in the late fall. In most cases the parents own Their own property and have ample means of support, often with considerable sums at interest. In many such cases the father nothing except when with his family in the fields in the summer. As these children come to find themselves from three to seven years be - hind their room mates their sense of pride overcomes their desire for C.

            <seg id="p698">646 of regular attendance and failure to keep up with their fellows. In some cases the pupils, parents and teachers were questioned as to how they came to fall back year after year until hopelessly distanced and finally classed with little children, a fact that caused them no little shame, the answers in most cases being hopelessly unintelligent. The pupils of these last groups took up the second and third readers with the simplest work in arithmetic, geography, spelling etc., in small classes without the least embarrassment, due perhaps to the fact that tliey were among equals in the matter of age as well as backwardness in subject matter. EJ&gt; A group of young men and women, one a man past middle age, had come from a foreign land within recent years, anxious for a wledge of English sufficient for their every day needs. Pnong practically all of the first three groups, the children of age, there was a clearly defined desire to earn money. Whether lack of "spending money" or from an over development of that native tit-sire in all wholesome boys and girls to be independent and self-reliant, they bad been drawn willingly into employment, subor - dinating school to wages, yet clinging in a measure to a desire to get further on in books. A fifth group should be mentioned, though not accepted in the school, perhaps thirty having applied for admission. These were the day school boys, attracted by the brightly lighted build - ing, the informal discussions, the stereopticon talks on history, geo - graphy and travel, the occasional common place talks by teachers and invited guests, etc. . There would have been a hundred or more if room could have been made for them. Without doubt a large work could be done by establishing a room for library reading, as well as one for games and conversation permitting all who cared to be present *t the general exercises referred to above. Four teachers were employed regularly. There were two rooms given to regular school work, a lower and an upper division. One instructor had two classes in sewing, each for an hour per evening, the girls taking regular class work the other hour. The fourth in - structor had an elementary commercial department, offering arithmetic, writing, spelling, bookkeeping and typewriting. This department was greatly appreciated, many of the young men and women planning to complete a course in future years if opportunity offered, two since hav - ing enrolled in business college. These instructors were from the legular day school force, the sewing and commercial teachers not hav - ing heavy day work, while the teachers of-the regular school branches !&lt;-lt free to change off at the close of any month. Each received T.'i cents per hour for the wark. During the present summer a number of the night school pupils have inquired whether school is to open again in November. The first year has proven some theories, and brought up many interesting ques - tions which may not be considered here. To those of us who receive 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p699">647 our education from nine to four any other arrangement of time seems illogical and unnecessary, but after a careful study of the needs of the individual boy and girl we realize that to confine school opportunities &lt;o these hours works a serious injustice to many. Night school is not -i charity, but a right which the child may demand from the city. It is but an imperfect machine: it is only better than no school at all: it takes the child after a long day's work; it brings added ejre - strain; it robs him of some sleep and play time: it tries to do in a few hours what can be done only in many. There will come a time when night schools are no longer needed for young children, but only when the day school more intelligently fits for life's duties and when the world's burdens are lifted from the shoulders of the child. ('. M. BARR. City Superintendent HKItKON. The high school building at Hebron was destroyed by a storm Aug. IN, 1911. Cratles four to twelve were thus deprived of their looms. Vp to that time the second floor of the two-years' old Lin - 'oln building had never been needed. After the storm it was imme - diately finished and prepared for housing grades five, six, seven and eight. By having only half-day sessions for each division of the first grade all pupils below the high school were cared for in the Lincoln building. A temporary structure was erected on the Lincoln grounds for the high school. This was a flat-roofed, frame structure fou feet high, with ship-lap for siding, and heavy paper and ship-lap in lieu of lath and plaster. A mistake was made in making the floor of common sheating instead of ship-lap: the cracks in the floor per - mitted cold air to enter the rooms and was the source of the only di» - &lt; omf ort throughout the year. So well did a furnace heat the four rooms that the students' anticipated holidays, due to cold weather, never resulted. To school districts needing temporary quarters the Hebron plan is recommended as having superior advantages over the &gt;f store buildings, as is customary, even though the expense is enater. The Hebron district will sell the temporary building at about ene-half the cost of the material, thus reducing the original cost. With insurance money and twenty thousand dollars of bond issue f modern fire-proof building is being built on the old site. It will houee the high school, seventh and eighth grades. It contains well equipped laboratories, sanitary, roomy recitation rooms, and a large assembly room. The basement will be used for large manual training and domestic science rooms. The building will be ready for use early In the school year 1912-1913. Hebron is so well provided with mod - ern equipment and buildings that with the addition of a music super - visor for all grades and one high school teacher in 1912 the prospect i.? quite encouraging to taxpayers and teachers.

            <seg id="p700">648 For years Holdrege has had a strong school system. This is due to the fact that the people of the community demand it and are willing to pay what it costs. The best men are placed on the board of education. They hire the most efficient teachers, give them living wages, stand by them loyally in everything, and demand the best there is in them. Twenty-one teachers are employed, eight in addition to the superintendent being in the high school. The average monthly salary is nearly $70. The buildings are all brick, in perfect repair, equipped with sanitary closets, ventilating systems, drinking fountains, and everything available to protect and promote the health of the chil - dren. The school grounds are beautiful, shady, well-kept, amply equipped with playground apparatus. The ent're enrollment for this year is 700, which is slight! than usual, due to the unfavorable crop conditions. The high school enrollment has grown steadily during the past six years. In 1906-7 it was 130; in 1907-8, 157; in 1908-9, 180; in 1909-10, 208; in 1910-11. 215; in 1911-12, 230; in 1912-13, 208. The falling off this r*w is due to the periodic small entering class that is found in every school. The school graduated 41 pupils in 1911, 35 in 1912, and the pn class numbers 56. The course of study is largely elective. In addition to the usual subjects, courses are offering for credit in domestic science, music, manual training, physical culture, elocution, and agriculture. Holdrege has taken the lead in Nebraska in the establishment of a department of agriculture with a school farm in connection. The school manages and operates a twenty acre tract for the benefit of Us pupils and the tmmunity in general. Part of the farm is devoted to an atiiiet; Id and playground, the remainder to the raising of crops, adapted to this region. This farm and the agricultural work is in the hands of an experienced man, a graduate of Ames Agricultural College, who is employed for eleven months of the year at a salary of $1,200 per year. This work is in line with the latest ideas of industrial education and must succeed in Nebraska, for the basis of all our prosperity is in the farm. It also demonstrates what towns may ds without state aid. most striking thing about the school system of Holdrege is the intelligent, noble class of young people, not the superior quality of teaching, not the almost ideal community, not the excellent equipment and appointments of the plant, though it has all these, but the school spirit, which is so essential to first class work.

In l»10 it had a total enrollment of 24 4 «"ud an average attendance of 199. In 1910 the total enrollment jump&lt;&lt;l 10 26:: with an average attendance of 211. The present year, 1911 - 1912, shows a total enrollment of 289 and an average attendan 261. This gradual inrrease both in total enrollment and average attendance is not caused by unusually large freshmen classes or by non - resident students. The explanation lies m the fact that fewer stu - rients have been leaving school before graduation. Rvicence of this it apparent in the size of the graduating class of 1912. Four years ago this class entered the high school with 121 members and 70 will receive diplomas on May 31 of this year. More than that, twenty-one of those who have left the 19 12 class for various reasons will grad - uate from other high schools this year. E'he board of education employs a truant officer to look after under sixteen years of age who should be in school. When a is absent from school more than a day or two the officer is id and he at once visits the home. Usually one visit is sufficient, ly two cases has it been necessary to resort to the courts to parents to send their children to school regularly. E Manual training is taught to the boys of the seventh and eighth ;s and to high school boys who desire to take the work. A well iped shop is maintained at the high school building. The gram - grade boys come into this shop once each week for an hour and a The high school boys work every day in the shop. A trained uctor is in charge of the manual training. Einal training, penmanship, elocution and physical training are lines of work pursued in the high school besides the regular s. The teachers of these branches are specialists in their tive lines. B Kearney high school attempts to appeal to its students tli sough ry possible agency. A glee club and an orchestra are kept up as manent organizations. They are used to furnish music for many high school entertainments. A boys' club with sixty-five members is in Ence. They meet every Tuesday evening at the high school for ur's discussion of problems which concern the life of the average The Longfellow building, which is the home of the high school, is a beautiful structure costing about $60 000. It is, however, too small to accommodate the growing number of students and a new wing is low being completed which will almost double the size of the pres - ent building. An excellent system of heating and ventilation is being installed in both the new and old parts of the building. The assembly room in the new wing will seat 400 students and the gymnasium in the basement is one of the largest and best in the state. The high school </seg>
            <seg id="p702">650 athletic association has about $300 with which to equip this gymnasium with apparatus. When the city of Kearney was very young some wise heads con - ceived the idea of buying a large campus for the high school. This cam - pug contains more than six acres of ground and is now a beautiful park with plenty of trees and blue grass. Kearney has six of these school parks and they are all kept in perfect condition the year round. It is only reasonable to expect that with relief from crowded con - ditions, with a wider range of subjects in her course of study and with her splendid equipment the Kearney high school will continue to grow in numbers steadily and will keep up her usual high standard of school work. HARRY E. BRADFORD, City Superintendent. LAWKKNCK. The Lawrence public school grounds and adjoining park consist nf about five acres of land well planted with trees. The present build - ing, a seven-room frame, has been well equipped with furniture and upparatus. Lawrence is probably the smallest accredited twelfth grade school in the state, and competent judges have stated it also one of the best equipped of the smaller schools. The growth has been steady though at a moderate rate. A few years ago the high school had one teacher with tenth grade work. Four years ago the present superintendent and the principal of the high school took charge. The development just previously begun with Principal Perrigo continued and accreditment for three years of high school work was followed by a third teacher in the high school and two additional rooms built. Accreditment of the twelfth grade last year has been followed by normal training this year with a class of fourteen members. h Nearly half of the high school are non-resident pupils, the ining being received in about equal numbers from the parochial 1 and our own grades. Ertie student organisations consist of the Girls' Tri-Club, the club, and athletic teams in base ball, track, basket ball, and some r gymnasium work under the instruction of the teachers. Last two programs given by the school allowed us to invest about |7S od pictures for the rooms. This year by similar means we have Jed considerable playground apparatus. Ctur library of about 800 volumes is largely of reference books, ear the accessions were mostly along the line of normal training Els year all pupils were tested by an optometrist and a number i with glasses with noticeable improvement in school work. ar the work is planned to be extended.

            <seg id="p703">651 LKXIXGTOX. The citizens of Lexington are justly proud of her three ward build - ings and her magnificent high school building. K'he buildings are well equipped. The high school building is n in every sense of the word. Jt is well lighted, heated and ven - 1 by the most modern methods. It has fine class rooms, large bly room and good gymnasium. In addition to the regular four year high school course a complete i ommercial course is offered, also a course in manual training and domestic science. These departments are fully equipped with the latest equipment. In the domestic science kitchen electric stoves are used and are proving very successful. Kver one-third of the high school enrollment are non-re - ts. The high school course is so broad that individual choice i had regarding work taken. Lexington is the only school in Dawson county organized under sub-division 14. The board of education recently raised the qualifica - tion of the teachers and with it advanced the salaries. Preparations are being made to establish an extensive agricultural course and a small tract of land near the school will be acquired. The future of the Lexington schools looks exceedingly bright C. E. BENSON. City Superintended LINCOLN. New Buildings. The development of the Lincoln schools during the pa - years has consisted largely of an organized effort to enlarge the : cal equipment to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing enrollment to adjust the curriculum and the activities of the schools t&gt; the i'e - mands of modern life. The contract has been let for a magnifiren' high school building to cost approximately $400, (Mio oO. A new grade I building for the Bancroft district, to cost $115,000.00 ha&lt;- also been contracted for. These two splendid additions to the buililiit; equipment have been intended to supply the immediate need of the greatly in - creased enrollment and for the proper housing of the high school in addition to initiate a program for the replacing of old unsanitary building? with modern and efficiently equipped structures. Organized Play. During the past year a supervisor of physical training in the ele - mentary schools has been added to the supervisory force. The course in physical training in the elementary grades and the organization of h system of play for the playgrounds during the school year as well as the summer months come directly under his charge. During the sum- </seg>
            <seg id="p704">652 mer he will likewise have charge of the home garden and yard im provement contest. Night School EThe night school has been greatly enlarged as to the scope of i covered and the teaching force. A corresponding increase has Ited. The teaching force consists of a principal and six teachers, ions are held in three of the buildings from 7:30 to 9:00 o'clock evenings in the week. EFor foreigners instruction is given in reading, writing, and speak - English. elementary arithmetic, and civics. A large class in busi - —shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping — is also conducted for the benefit of the young people of high school age who cannot attend the regular commercial course at the high school. Another large class i onsists of boys and girls between the. ages of 14 and 16, who have been granted work permits unJer the child labor law. Bie enrollment in all these classes to date is 218. Of these 95 ult foreigners. Industrial flashes Lincoln has a well organized and fairly well equipped system of manual training and domestic science. Its purpose in the course, how - ever, is generally educational and not specifically industrial and voca - tional. To meet the very evident need of a more specific industrial training Saturday classes have been organized in four of the manual training shops. Any one fourteen years of age or over is admitted to these classes whether otherwise connected with the schools or not. Each class devotes itself specifically to the working out of some partic - ular industry or industries. The lines of work taken up are book bind - ing, basketry, pottery, cabinet making, metal working in brass and copper, and wood work. FRED M. HUNTER, City Superintendent. LYONS. During the past two years, Lyons schools can be said not to have gone back in any way. We have been pushing ahead in the following In order to live up to the spirit as well as the letter of the rules about teaching physical geography and agriculture with a laboratory course, we have had to enlarge and equip our laboratories more fully. We have added about $300 worth of apparatus for the better teaching of botany and for the laboratory work in physical geography and agri - culture. The results have fully justified the trouble and expense, and have shown the wisdom of the state authorities in demanding a labora - tory course for these two much-abused subjects. The pupils' knowl - edge of them has been more definite, more exact and much more com- </seg>
            <seg id="p705">653 plete than any text-book course could give. Not only hav attempted to do the specified laboratory work, but have visited the creamery, the mills, the pumping-station, the barns, and other places of interest to prospective agriculturists. We are fully convinced that the time taken far this gives more abundant and satisfactory results than though it were spent studying about these things in the text Then wi&gt; have added a teacher and put in the normal training course. The normal training schools have reached a stage when they do not need to be boosted. .My own county superintendent, Mr. Poucher. an excellent school man and a thorough student of the needs of the country schools— has just written to me that there is an unusual demand for experienced teachers. And only about sixty per if these demands (as nearly as I can remember) can be supplied. A normal training student on graduation is an experienced teacher, and is coming to be recognized as such, by our school boa of them fail because they have been trained for success. The third, and the last that I will mention, of our ad\a has been along the line of music and rhetoricals. We have found that both of these derive an irresistable enthusiasm from the fact that they are to be presented in public. The public will not come to our t-rhools. We wish the patrons would visit us. but they will not. ti&gt; any extent. In order that they may have any interest in our work, it is necessary that we go to them. Besides our own entertainments given at school about every month, we have established a custom of giving an entertainment with the Relief Corps and the (!. A. R. all this a Patriotic Program and it is always a musicale or mixed program of a patriotic nature. The G. A. R. and W. R. ('. pay the • xpenses and furnish a few numbers. The programs are free. It is needless to add that we have a large and enthusiastic audience. In music the grades give a cantata and the high school gives a public operetta every spring. Some parts of these are begun as early a? the previous fall. Last year the grades gave "The Stars and Sti and the high school gave "Sylvia." The expenses of the books and necessary costumes and programs, etc., makes it imperative that we charge an admission fee for these. This, however, does not seem to make the crowds any smaller. For a good production, every one is willing to pay. Last year our actual expenses of giving "Sylvia" were over fifty dollars. Still we came out considerable to' the good, and the pupils were highly pleased with themselves, and their parents and friends were delighted with them. Uf course, I do not recommend these things solely as a means of bringing the school before the public The standpoint is the same as in all school work, — the pupil. Bur here are two things in which the girls are often luke-warn and the hoys are wholly uninterested. But when it is known that all this is to be given in public, a girl will spend morning, noon and evening </seg>
            <seg id="p706">654 ■well in her part, and a good soloist will often be developed out Dy who will tell you with sincerity that he cannot sing any tune th. Sir aim in giving these things thus explicitly, is not to pull for :le school nor claim attention to ourselves; but that it may be of t and use to fellow teachers. DELL GIBSON, City Superintendent. MiCOOK. Among the distinctice features that might be mentioned in regard to the McCook schools, the following are worthy of notice. eie board of education has spent no little time and pains in the grounds and buildings of their school system pleasing to and appealing to the best taste in an architectural sense. Of the three school sites of the city, two of them include a full block of ground. The central and east ward buildings are each sur - rounded by a half block of beautiful lawn, dotted with .arge shade trees. These lawns are carefully maintained by the generous use of water. The added expense for water alone averages about $300.00 per year, although the cost of city water is very moderate. In fact, visitors to the city are universally impressed by the beautiful, well kept lawns and shade trees maintained by almost all the people. The west ward has recently been provided with cement walks, the ground graded and a lawn will be started there in the spring of 1913. The plans of Superintendent Davis for a commercial course have been approved by the board of education and the course will be installed the second semester of the year 1912-13. By the beginning of the school year 1913-14 a thoroughly organized and complete course will be offered, backed up by the most complete apparatus desired for a modern course in commerce. A parent-teachers' association has been formed for the purpose of bringing the home and the school into a more effective co-operation. Meetings are held each month. Parents and teachers united in the discussion of such questions as: "What are the best books for my boy to read?" Mrs. Oeo. Willets is president of the organization and her effective leadership assures its success. A play ground association, with Superintendent Davis as president, has also been, organized. This association managed to impress the town board with the need of play ground apparatus to such an extent that they appropriated $100.00 for the work. The apparatus is now being installed. Pl home talent entertainment recently given netted the parent - ;rs' association $177.00, and this will probably be used for the purpose. Perhaps it might be said that the most distinctive and hopeful tendency to be noticed in our community at the present time in regard </seg>

Such organizations as have been mentioned — organization for Crete Plan of domestic science. ground association, and parent-teachers' club are some of the ressions of this sentiment. A splendid and progressive board of education is working har - moniously to the same end and the outlook for educational pr&lt;- - at McCaok is excellent. W. T. DAVIS. City Superintendent MINDKX I The Minden schools are gradually growing both in numbers and provements. The enrollment this year in the high school exi t by thirty pupils. The free high school law still does its work — about fifty students taking advantage of it and in most cases hard working pupils. The course of study is much the same as in other places except that Latin is not made a requirement for graduation. Neither is (ierman one must be elected. The tobacco law has been lived up to. No one even above the ge limit is allowed on any athletic team. In my judgment the law s defective in one respect — it should apply (which it does not i o all boys in the high school. As it is it does not reach all of the eniors. who. as a rule, even without exemptions are sufficiently doni - neering. but now may parade as objects excused or favored by the aw. This kind of an effect, not only on themselves, but especially on nwer grades, is obvious. The debating library has been materially increased and it is partly due to this fact that Minden won the district championship in debate. Manual training was put in last fall in the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth grades, compulsory in the grades, but optional in the high school. Sewing is also taught in the seventh and eighth grades. Domestic science is to go in next fall. A business course is planned for the winter so as to accommodate those from the country who seek a business education in larger towns at considerable expense.. Three '.aindred and fifty dollars worth of play ground apparatus was p the school grounds last summer for the use of children, and this has proved very useful and beneficial. Musical organizations such as an orchestra, quartets, choruses, etc., have their share of attention in school life. H. \V. WENDLANI). City Superintendent.

PThe enrollment in the high school has increased steadily for some ; years past. Last year's total enrollment reached two hundred thirty-eight and the present year's enrollment will far exceed that. Normal training was introduced last year and is rapidly taking a leading place among the courses of study. Two teachers have been added to the corps and a semester's work in mechanical drawing is now presented by the supervisor of drawing. Chorus work in music is presented three days in each week by the supervisor of music. Special attention is being given to physical culture for girls. A class meets twice a week under the supervision of the principal, who gives a practical course of instruction. A high school orchestra has been or - ganised and is taking a leading place among the commendable activities of the school. BPhe work of the grade schools is being more closely organized and orps is gradually becoming stronger. The grade and high school ers work together harmoniously, thus making the teaching forte t. E Numerous improvements are made each year in the sanitary ipment of the grade buildings. It is the desire of the board of cation to modernize the entire plant as rapidly as finances will Kis gratifying to note that in both curricula and equipment, the of the child Is being placed first. So long as this continues, the for public school work will be good. GEO. E. MARTIN. City Superintendent. NKI.K.H. During the two years I have been connected with the Neligh schools the growth in numbers has been gradual. Such has been the rase for a number of years past. The total enrollment at the close of the year 1910-1911 was 4 32. At the present time it exceeds 480 and will very nearly reach the 500 mark by the close of the school year. This increase is quite generally distributed throughout the grades. The attendance in the high school has been very satisfactory, es - pecially during the past year. At one time there were six more pupils enrolled than there were seats. With a large incoming ninth grade next year it Is necessary to provide more room.

As now situated there is plenty of light and good ventilation. A new laboratory bench has been installed. Previous to this, experimentation in chemistry and physics mis done on an ordinary kitchen table.

Not only is the high school crowded, but Bber of the grade rooms as well. The problem of more and bet - mi is one the patrons of this school will soon have to solve. During the spring of 1911 Neligh became a city school district. The affairs of the district are administered by a board of intelligent, fair minded men, each of whom has the interests of the school much at heart. The funds of the district are not expended in a manner, nor is the board penurious. Any expenditure that is for the good of the school is freely made. With such a board of edm in control the outlook for 1912-11 is exceedingly bright. CHAS. A. MOHR.MAN. City Superintendent.

THOMPSON City Superintendent NKUMAN GKOVK BThe school iu Newman drove has enjoyed an unusual growth ng the past two years. This has been due to three factors: First, g growth in the population of the town; second, normal training. estic science, and manual training and their influence in bringing in students; third, the keeping of the boys and girls in school through athletics and other school activities which keep up interest in school attendance. Two years ago the enrollment in the grades was two hundred ten and now it has increased to two hundred elgnty; :n the high school from forty-seven to seventy-seven ; and nex year the enrollment bide fair to reach ninety-five, an increase of o\. r one hundred per cent. Perhaps, the most notable fact in connection with this attendance is that in reporting to the county superintendent this Cng there was not a single case of tobacco using in school, nor a of non-attendance in the district. A new building costing approximately $25,000 was erected three years ago. Modern in every respect it has facilitated rapid growth and has furnished room for many country students. At the present time, many of the rural districts surrounding town are sending pupils to our school and 33%% of our high school are country students who are taking advantage of the free high school attendance law. Advertising matter is sent out to prospective students each spring and every effort is being made to get country students into the high school. Perhaps the most valuable asset along this line is the school paper edited and </seg>

Eall starts in domestic science and manual training have been id as the school grows regular courses will be instituted for all s. At present it is elective and those who take the course pay their own expenses.

            <seg id="p716">663 The chief interest in the Oakdale schools has been the building of a new school building, which will be ready in September. As to school work, it was found necessary to add another teacher. The graduates each received ,i'2 points credit by State Iniversity and • member of our eighth grade (eighteen in number ( received a county diploma. We are to put in normal training. City Superintendent. OHIOWA. The schools here have had a slightly increase;! attendance, enough to fill all the rooms and to demonstrate the pressing need of a new and larger building which has been strongly advocated for some time. The board has been accumulating a building fund for several years. Ki"or its size, the schools are well equipped with text, refer. brary books, and have sufficient laboratory apparatus for a pr of the sciences. P Nature study was taken up systematically by each room in the es and the high school course of study was altered to admit a laboratory course in agriculture and in physiology. ■'wo domestic science classes were organized on the Crete plan, much enthusiasm and good results. The high school had a ng class and joined the state league for the first time in the his - &gt;f the school. ■lone in the class had ever heard a debate and were defeated in contest, but all of them declared that it had been a benefit to Ke were six graduates, four boys and two girls.

            <seg id="p717">664 The course of study in the grades has been so arranged this year that it accommodates pupils of different capacity. One arrangement gives the work in nine years, and is named by years as Kindergarten, First grade. Second grade etc. The other form names the years by letters as A, B, C, D, E, and F, and is completed in six years. This plan has often been described and a trial has shown that it works well. It seemed before the attempt was made that it would be difficult to make the enrollment of the various rooms approximately equal, but nfter the pupils were in their places, a count showed that the differenc e • ■en the lowest and the highest grade enrollment was only .- The enrollment in the high school has been very satisfactory. Two years ago the number was 136, last year 159 and this year 193, of whjin re boys. The graduating class for 1912 numbers twenty-six, the seniors taking pedagogy nineteen. The high school teaching force of six. including the superintendent, has been unable to take up much v&gt;ork beyond the definite courses of study pursued. The Crete Plan in domestic science has been adopted and is working well. Eighty girls are enrolled under nine instructors. The entire ninth gradi - enrolled in the short course in agriculture and domestic- science given from the university in April. Every high school pupil is expected to appear before the school in some kind of literary work, the seniors performing this duty a nuniber of times besides presiding in turn during the rendering of literary and musical programs. EThe ample rooms and accommodations of the high school building ised for the social functions of the schools many times during the . For next year few changes have been made in the teaching force e grades. Some will change in the high school. For four years it been thought best to elect as principal a teacher already on duty e high school, as being familiar with the work. This has been done text year, and seems to assure a continuance of that department's r th and prosperity. In the matter of salaries a steady advance has made, though not a rapid one. C. S. JOXES. City Superintendent. OS&lt; KOLA. The Osceola city schools have had a steady growth in every way for the past ten years with a more rapid advancement in the last three years. The present buildings have proven inadequate to accommodate the school owing to a marked increase in attendance and increased teaching force. A fine new modern building Is now in the course of construction and when finished will be one of the very beat in central Nebraska. It is centrally located on a block formerly used for horticul - tural purposes and the many beautiful trees and shrubs give it a setting second to none It is a large, commodious building? of three floors. </seg>

The first floor is given over to grade work. It is arranged with a large assembly room for the departmental grammar whool. class and recitation rooms and a teachers' rest room. The u|&gt;i&gt;er floor is for the high school proper. There is a large assembly room with a seating capacity of 200, laboratories, recitation rooms, library, store room and office. Great care has been given in the heating, lighting and ventilating plans and the results seem exceptionally | Vhe high school attendance for the past two years has gr increased and it is expected to take additional advaiii ■ to the new facilities. Thirty students are taking advantage of the free high school law this year. The laboratories are well filled with good apparatue for the maintenance of science courses, the library has unproved and the course of study enriched. Domestic science has been maintained very successfully under the Crete Plan for the high school girls, while domestic art has been maintained in the grammar grades. A start has been made in manual training but the work has been retarted owing to limited room. Great care has been taken to enforce the attendance law and the attendance has been secured with very little friction. The citizens of the community are especially loyal in the support of educational sentiment and the Annual Patrons Day has become one of the most important affairs of the year in city and com - munity. The schools are rapidly increasing in strength as a commun - ity social center. The pupils throughout the system are enthus over their school and its work. The playground apparatus has proven a real benefit in the discipline of the playground while the high school athletics have yielded a good influence upon the high school. The high school has been active in debating, declamatory work anJ r.nisic . Several musical organizations are maintained and contribute •iiudi to the welfare of the school. The biennium may be summarized as the best in the history of the schools in every respect. The enrollment has increased , the per cent of high school attendance has had an exceptional advance, the teaching force has been increase I. apparatus and reference books added and a new building will soon be complete. The prospects for the next two years are even brighter for the Osoeola city schools. C. B. MOORE. City Superintendent.

The census in June 09, was two hundred and fifteen while in June, 1911, the census was o hundred and forty-four, an increase of twenty-nine. A good school spirit prevails as is shown by the fact that although our school census is but two hundred and forty-four, the enrollment is two hundred and twenty-five and the average attendance for the school yettr, one hundred and ninty-five. In the fall months the average attendance has run as high as ninety-seven per cent of the enrollment.

The attendance of the first grade and high school U larger than ever before. The school census for 1911-12 is 4.J4. an increase of 27 over 1910-11. The enrollment for 1*11-11 is 3 17. The large difference between the school census and enrollment is explained in a large part by the presence of two parochial schools in the city. Another factor which affects the attendance record in particular is Nebraska's obselete compulsory attendance law as it aplies to schools organized under subdivision 6. We wish to urge the making of a nine months compulsory attendance law applicable to schools organized under subdivision 6. similar to that now in force for schools under subdivision 14. We heartily approve of the resolution passed to that effect by the North Nebraska Ttachers' Association. I'nder the present law there are a number each year who fulfill no more than the law requires. The present law cannot but be detrimental to the best inter - ■ &gt;f education. Several changes mave been made in the high school &lt;ourse of study t in part the demands of the age for a more practical course of g in our high schools. A course in agriculture was introduced 0-11 and normal training added in KM 1-12. To this we expect domestic science in 1912-13. The normal training iourse in its first year has made ■ creditable showing. Aside from whatever specific training these stu - dents have received many been brought more fully to realize that they a.e scon to take up responsibilities of the outside world and their preparatory efforts have been thereby increased. The visiting of grade rooms has had an excellent stimulative effect on the grade teachers, inspiring them to greater efforts. This in turn is reflected in the work done by the grade pupils. </seg>

CHARLES ARNOT, City Superintendent. SCOTTSBIA FF The past two years of the Scottsbluff schools has shown mushroom growth. At the beginning of 1910-1911 the enrollment was about five hundred. The year before it was four hundred, the year before three hundred. Going the other way the increase has been by the hundred both years until the close of 1911-1912 checks six hundred and eighty. The "Centenary" school would be an appropriate name indicating the enrollment. In the fall of 1910 the former buildings were too small and private parties erected four buildings for school purposes. While this was being done an old store building was utilized, being sandwiched between a steam laundry and a blacksmith's shop A church came to the rescue with the loan of its building. At the end of this year school was scattered about the tovn in eight different buildings. E Meanwhile plans were under way for a new structure, so a $3" ing was erected for the high school. This was thought t _ jate for several years ahead. While this was under way the village Ri of government passed into the city administration and the old ol board retired to a man, six new recruits assuming the respon - ity. This new building was finally completed, bui the increased enroll - ment filled it to overflowing so that in Itll-lS, six months after the new building was completed, new quarters must bv added. Also two new teachers will swell the list to eighteen, twti the grades and six in the high school. This building was lighted and ventilated and heated by the most healthful and sanitary methods found. Sanitary drinking fountains are to be installed by the Laura M. Woodford club. The gymnasium has ample playing space, no posts interfering. The laboratory is well equipped with 1500 to $7."o worth of equip - ment, while a large library of reference and standard works aid in wholesome mental advancement. </seg>

Twelve of these go out to teach next year, representing the best part of the one-hundred and twenty-six enrolled in the high school. Although bas - ket ball and base ball are active in the school, membership on teams being restricted to class standing, they are not given entire attention. A band is maintained in the high school furnishing music for all school occasions. Besides this a juvenile band of thirty pieces is organized in the grades. Likewise an octet of the senior class has developed into a musical organization, having a reputation over this section of the country. "A strong mind in a strong body" is our slogan. W. L. GREENSLIT, City Superintendent. SKWARI). Every square foot of floor space in the two buildings is in use. The "overflow" room, opened in September, 1910, has relieved crowded conditions in the grade rooms and has strengthened the work. At present pupils from grades three, five and seven are cared for la that Forty pupils is the maximum number in charge of one grade teacher. These pupils are in two classes. Promotions take place reg - ularly senii-aunually. Special promotions are made whenever deemec 1 best for the pupils concerned. b Within the i&gt;ast two years nearly a thousand dollars have been . in improving the play ground. The grounds are now in excellent ition. The play ground apparatus consists of see-saws, sw og pole, basket balls, volley balls, and foot balls. R'here is regular manual training work in each grade below school. In grades six, seven and eight the boys are given bench in wcod, and the girls sewing. There is a special teacher for the work.

JOS. R. FILK. City Superintendent. SHKLTOX. At the opening of the ensuing school year, we expect to occupy our new, pressed brick, $40,000 school house. This building is scien - tifically hygienic and practical. The first floor contains eight standard sized grade rooms: the second floor accommodates the high school and offices for the principal and superintendent; and the basement gives ample room for the toilets, shower bathe, gymnasium, and manual training, domestic science, banquet room, and storage room; while the boiler room is outside. The building is H-shaped, with completely paneled ends, permitting the light to enter every room only from the pupils' left. The windows are over three feet from the floor, thus shutting out all harmful light below the eye-line; they reach to within a half-foot of the ceiling, affording the best light to be obtained; and they are arranged in batteries as closely together as possible, with steel rods between them for strength in construction. The ratio of window surface to floor sur - face is about one to four. Other matters of hygiene and economy have been carefulh sidered including ventilation, floor-deadening, wardrobes, drinking fountains, bookcases, blackboards, hall areas, etc., etc. I'pon entering this new building, we shall be employing the six - year plan in our schools, as fully as present conditions in Nebraska will permit. The elementary school consists of six grades, divided equally between the primary and intermediate departments. The sec - cudary school also consists of six years, iiivided equally between the grammar and the high school. The technical and legal aspects of the pecondary school, however, point to the seventh and eighth grade* as constituting the grammar department, and to the other four grades as the high school; but the work is being organized in such a manner as to lead pedagogical ly to as clcse a union, if not a closer union, between the ninth and eighth grades as between the ninth and tenth grades. We are attempting to bridge the commonly prevailing gulf between the elementary and high schools that has been such an obstacle to the child as he enters the years of adolescence. Credit points, cross-grad - ing, departmental work, four forty-minute periods, and other phases of high school organization are applied to the grammar grades. The </seg>
            <seg id="p729">674 program of studies will be adjusted gradually to enable cei tain phases of the high school subjects to be taught in the seventh and eighth grades, and likewise many different phases of the grammar school to be postponed till later years. ERNEST F. MONROE, City Superintendent. SIDNEY. Eing the past two years Sidney high school has made rapid . The enrollment has increased from forty-seven to sixty-six, number of new features have been added and those previously have not been neglected. During the first semester of the present year, 1911-12, the 'Crete Plan" of domestic science was introduced; thirty-six girls of the high school are taking this work and all are enthusiastic in their expressions of appreciation. Fifteen ladies of the city are very generously donat - ing their time and means to the work. Sewing has also been intro - duced in the high school; the interest manifested on the part of the girls shows that they are anxious to obtain a well rounded educa - tion. In September. 1911, the high school purchased a splendid dissolv - ing-view stereopticon which can also be used as a solar projectiscope as well as with the regular lantern slides. The school owns a fine collection of slides illustrating various high school subjects; in addi - tion, slides are rented and at least one illustrated lecture, to which both students and patrons are invited, is given in the high school audi - torium each week. At the opening of the school year several business subjects were added to the high school curriculum. Classes have been organized in both typewriting and shorthand. The business course has attrai t&lt; d quite a number of outside people, some of whom attend evening ses - sions only; there are fourteen students in the typewriting class and ten are taking the work in shorthand. In the science department several progressive steps have b&lt; »-n taken. The laboratory equipment has been supplemented by quite a number of new and up-to-date pieces of apparatus; a collection of fine specimens for use in physical geography has been made, and a garden has been secured for experimental work in agriculture. The English Department has been revised thoroughly. The his - tories of the American and English literatures have been introduced; the reading of selections from each of the representative authors augments the study of his writings and his style. The aim is to acquaint the students with the best in our own and other literatures. The study is more suggestive than comprehensive as the aim is to ■tart, stimulate, and direct processes of self activity. Theme writing on subjects of observation, reading matter, and current events plays an important part in the development of self </seg>

The generous and progressive board of education, coupled with the unselfish citizens of the town, make Sidney high school quite attractive to non-resident students. There are many good homes in Sidney where students may secure room and board in return for a little help with chores morning and evening. We now have quite a number of students, who are earning living in this manner and are doing good school work. In athletics, debating, oratory and declaiming Sidney is, as she has been for several years, among the leading high schools in Nebraska. City Superintendent SOI TH OMAHA SCHOOLS In numbers the schools of this city have not made any gnat gains. For the year ending last June the enrollment was B.MS, the highest enrollment in the history of the schools. However, for several years preceding the one just closed, the enrollment has been within one hundred of this mark. Probably no city furnishes an example of a more cosmopolitan population than does Nebraska's Magic City. Among the nationalities aside from Americans that are commonly represented are iiohemians. Germans, Irish. Russians, Swedes, English, Danes. Poles, etc On this account, if our enrollment was studied from the standpoint of the age of pupils, it would appear that in some schools the average age for certain grades was high or indicating that there was much retardation. Many foreigners enter the first grade at the age of fourteen years and remain there a half year or even longer, depending on whether or not they had made advancement in scholastic attainments in the schools of the mother country. In some cases even though the child is as old as twelve or fourteen years he is without any schooling whatever from the European country. Others enter the first grade at an advanced age, but on account of their schooling across the seas they are able to advance quite rapidly and many complete several grades in a year. The most notable case of this kind occurred during the past year when two chil- Uren from Germany, who had completed the Folke Schulen finished the work in seven grades of our system. They are taking summer school work in the eighth grade and expect to inter high school in September. This is in contrast to cases where foreign children of the same age may remain in the first or second grade a whole year. Eice any mention of these schools has been made in the biennial of the State Department, there have been expansions and ments in various lines. Three years ago the first kindergartens Ided, three being put in the largest ward schools. The follow- \V. J. BRAHA.M. </seg>

Along the lines of manual training and industrial work beginnings were made at the same time. For work along these lines there is provision made for children of all grades in the largest schools. In the smaller schools this does not reach beyond the fourth grade. In the hrst four grades this work is carried on in connection with drawing and under the supervision and direction of the supervisor of this subject. It consists of weaving in raffia and cloth, paper cutting and folding. In the schools having manual training equipment, of which there are five outside of the high school, work is provided for the four upper grades. In the fifth and sixth there is clay modeling, basketry and wood carv - ing for both boys and girls. In the seventh and eighth the boys have bench work and the girls sewing. The manual training we have in the high school has not been developed beyond bench work, but only the lack of funds prevents the expansion of this work in the secondary school. In each of the buildings where manual training is done they have a separate equipment save in one. Beginning in September the pupils in the upper grades of two more schools will be accommodated, by having them walk to a conveniently located building having manual training equipment. In conclusion, concerning the industrial work in this city, it is readily recognized by all that this is very needful since South Omaha is distinctly an industrial and commercial center. In the ordinary academic school work progress has been made which we believe is the result of certain definite requirements as to preparation both on the part of teachers and pupils. The latter are required to prepare their recitations in all grades above the third, immediately after the assignment of the lesson of twenty-four hours before the recitation. This plan has been in vogue during the past two years and teachers are unanimous in their praise of it, both from the standpoint of efficient work on the part of the pupils and from the effect which it has on the order and discipline. Pupils going from the recitation with vivid impressions of the lesson just disposed of and a definite assignment of what is to be done in accomplishing the work of the next lesson, proceed in the preparation with an effectiveness which brings them the joy of accomplishment. Then, too, they must reach out for the next lesson with a grasp enabling them to have a definite knowledge of that lesson twenty-four hours hence. Teachers are required to use plan books in the preparation of their lessons. Plans are made out for a week in advance which are sub - mitted for the inspection of the principal at the beginning of the week. However, after a teacher has done successful work and has definitely and carefully outlined the work of a grade for four succes - sive semesters, she is free to discontinue the use of a set plan, with the understanding that she is to continue to add to her knowledge of the subject which she teaches by reading books, whether academic or </seg>
            <seg id="p732">677 ■lidaetic, bearing on these subjects, of which she shall make outline* and of which she shall make use in her daily work. This plan has its basis and inspiration on what the great master of Rugby once said: "I wish my pupils to drink from a living stream and not from a stag - nant pool." During the last four years the qualifications or standards for Teachers have been raised, salaries have been increased and on the ".vhole there has been substantial progress made. N. M. GRAHAM, City Superintendent. STAXTOX. The success of any school is determined by the character of its graduates rather than by its equipment, but improved equipment mark of progress. During the past year Stanton has built and fur - nished a fine new high school building, which is modern in every respect. In the basement are toilet rooms, boiler room and an ample cymnasium. The first floor is devoted to grade work while the upper floor is occupied by the high school. The building is heated by hot air and steam, has splendid ventilation, good light, roomy halls and stairways and high ceilings. It was constructed at a cost of about "00.00. Bi the matter of salaries the Stanton board have been progressive e lowest salary now paid in the grades is $•")."&gt; per month. There E strong sentiment in favor of more men teachers in the school and ng the past year the board has engaged a man as principal of the school and has had a man in the grammar department. Next year high school principal will receive $100 per month and another man be engaged in the high school. It is the intention to intr. •ses in industrial and vocational training during the coming year. The Stanton school maintains a high standing in every line of student activities, especially in the lines of oratory and athletics. ■he percentage of boys in the high school is gratifying. Each as nearly as many boys as girls and in the 1912 graduating class were ten boys and seven girls. There is a healthy educational interest among the students and ■[usually large number of the graduates of the Stanton sch gone to higher institutions of learning. Of these the large ma- ority attend the State University and the State Normal schools. Some of the strongest teachers in the rural schools of the county have been trained in the normal training department of the Stanton high school. Nine teachers graduated from this department in the 1912 class and received their teachers' certificates at the time of graduation. In all there were seventeen enrolled in the class during the year. Of the nine teachers graduated this year four are boys. The </seg>
            <seg id="p733">678 county superintendent co-operates with the city teachers in training and locating the student teachers and the results are very gratifying. With a progressive school board, a strong corps of teachers and an enthusiastic, helpful spirit among the patrons of the school the educa - tional outlook of Stanton is bright. J. H. WELCH, City Superintendent. STROMSIU !«;. Within the past year the Stromsburg district has spent about thirty thousand dollars in permanent improvements. Most of this amount has been expended in the erection of a new high school build - ing. The remainder has been expended on the old building, now used as a grade school, in installing drinking fountains, toilet rooms, etc. EThe new high school building includes the usual class rooms and mbly room, a gymnasium, and rooms designed for manual training domestic science. It is of the most substantial semi-fireproof con - ction. Throughout it is abundantly lighted, and provisions for :ing and ventilation are entirely adequate. The enrollment of the high school, as well as its equipment, is enlarging. It is still, however, too small for a district of the school population that Stromsburg has. Twenty-six of the seventy-six stu - dents enrolled are non-residents, these non-residents including some of the most successful and most influential students of the school. The school is well equipped with books and with apparatus for laboratory work in botany, physics, and chemistry. The school kitchen is furnished with equipment for demonstration of all kinds of kitchen - work, and all high school girls have had the opportunity of taking weekly lessons in it, — only two or three not desiring these lessons. BA supply of tools of the best quality for bench work in wood has 1 secured, and preparations ar.e to be made for extensive manual ning. t There is an enrollment of twenty in the normal training class, r of them young men. Every member of the normal training class duated last year is now teaching in Polk County. City Superintendent. SITTOX Ehe past year has been a busy one in the Sutton schools. The high students have been crowded into three rooms, none of which accommodate over half of the school at any one time. Pin the primary department at the high eehool building ninety Is were enrolled and half day sessions were resorted to to meet situation of no available room in the city. All of this crowded condition, together with many inconveniences, including noise of construction of new building within a few feet of E. A. BOOSTROM. </seg>
            <seg id="p734">679 E&gt;sent school building, has been cheerfully endured. IV g, high school and grades, has been in progress, within fifteen the old building and this has been the chief interest of the nd inspiration of the school for the past year. The building will be one of the best of its kind in the state Elie basement is almost above ground, and contains a splendid sium, 55% feet by 25% feet in clear of a 12 foot gallery, with floor, running the entire length of gymnasium and extending to six feet of floor of gymnasium, and with 17 foot ceilings. The toilet rooms will be the same in size as the school rooms and will be provided with shower baths. Manual training, doimstic science, dinner and play room are also on basement floor, together with fire proof vault. Eight modern s&lt; hool rooms occupy the first floor. An assembly room .")5Vi by 37 Vi feet, chemical and physical laboratories, three recitation rooms, book room, library, rest room and superintend - ent's office occupy the second floor. Bie building is being constructed of hydraulic pressed brick and d stone at a cost of from $40,000 to $50,000. ■he corner stone was laid April 22, 1912, and it is the intention contractor to have the building completed long before school in September. Rliis marks an epoch in school development in Sutton and many hings are planned for the near future. Kormal training was started in September. 1911, with a class of -four members, fourteen seniors and ten juniors. Splendid in - has been manifested in this work and very satisfactory results Khen the old building is removed Sutton will have an excellent newhat limited play ground. E. CL1PP1NT.ER. City Superintendent. SYRACUSE. The Syracuse schools have been endeavoring to uphold the high standard of efficiency set by Superintendents Caviness. Delzell and Lackey. Ke enrollment has been almost stationary for many years, compared with the census one cannot complain, while the daily nee is much above normal. Very little difficulty is encountered in enforcing the compulsory attendance law. EJuring the past two years some improvements may be mentioned: he laboratories, city gas installed, ventilators and sewer connec - drinking fountains on all floors, a special dinner room for country ren and non-residents, and a sand room with its sand box for iry pupils. </seg>
            <seg id="p735">680 Breat interest is taken in normal training. The students are more t and conscientious in all their work. The high school has two organizations, a literary society and an athletic association. A program is given every two weeks and at end of each parlimentary practice is taken up. Base ball and basket ball are the sports; however, greater stress is given to basket ball and the team developed compares, every year, very well with the competing teams. E Syracuse is on the eve of even better times. The board is iring normal graduates for the grades and college graduates for high school and are beginning now to talk of consolidation of the 1 schools, which means greater efficiency in the near future. R. R. McGEE. City Superintendent. TABLE ROCK. During the past year the school has not increased any in num - bers, but has held its own while the population of the town has been falling off. All patrons complied with the compulsory education law. In the high school we had enrolled twenty free tuition pupils. EAt the beginning of the year the heating plant was repaired, giving flrst class, up-to-date steam heating plant. A rcom in the baae - t was fitted up for a laboratory, thus giving us a room used only for ratory purposes. One teacher was added. P During the year we placed on the playgrounds five teeters and swings, these with our basket ball and base ball grounds, give fine playground. Ke have a library of 900 volumes to which a number of additions ade during the year. The normal training class of eighteen members was an interesting class and did excellent work. All graduates have schools and will teach next year. Ke are planning to add manual training and domestic science to irse of study for next year. L. E. MOHLER, City Superintendent. TECUMSEH The 1911 census of the district was 577. As compared with the census the total enrollment has shown up well, amounting to 510 at the end of the seventh month. Of this number an unusually large per cent has been enrolled in the high school, 190 having been enrolled to date. In the high school the non-resident attendance is remarkably large. Eighty-four non-residents have been in attendance during the year. We have learned of no high school in the state with a larger LI U U OIUCUl BllCUUBUtCi </seg>
            <seg id="p736">681 P growth of the high school this year was such that an extra her had to be employed after school started. Considerable improvement in the laboratory equipment has been made diu-ing the year. Kach laboratory has been put in a separate room, and several hundred dollars worth of equipment added. The greatest improvement in the school plant has been the twelve ncre tract of land to the rear of the buildings, which the board pur - chased in the spring of 1911. This tract has a small stream running through it. sufficient natural timber to make it attractive and plenty of level ground for playgrounds and agricultural purposes. Little change has been made in the course of study this year except the addition of a course in domestic science. This course has organized under the Crete plan. A number of the ladies of the have taken hold of the work and a great deal of interest has been shown in the course both by the ladies and the students. Plans have been laid for putting in a course in manual training next' year. Four semesters of specialized agriculture work will be included next year, also some additional courses in domestic science for which an instructor has been hired. V. L. STRICKLAND, City Superintendent. TKKAMAH. The Tekamah schools have been gradually growing for the past two years. The enrollment in the grades has increased something live per cent, while the increase in the high school has been over sixty - five per cent. The increase in the high school has been largely due to the free high school law and normal training. For 1911-12, there are fifty-two free high school students enrolled. The census for June. 1911. shows 4 87 pupils of school age in the district, while the enrollment is now above 530. The compulsory education law is at this time practically a dead letter' in Tekamah. That is to Bay, the truant officer has nothing to do. The people of Tekamah have learned that the best truant officer is an enthusiastic, hard-working and honest teacher. So well have the teachers met the requirements for the past two years that the truant officer has had practically nothing to do. Two years ago, there were employed twelve teachers, including the superintendent; today, we have fourteen and five of these in the high school and nine below. It has been deemed wise on the part of the superintendent to organize the school under four heads: high school, grammar school, primary school and kindergarten. Each of the departments has its own principal, responsible to the superintendent, and he in turn to the hoard of education. The plan seems to be working nicely and far better results are being obtained than by the old plan. </seg>
            <seg id="p737">682 Within the last two years a $30,000 addition has been built to the original ten-room building. This gives four grade rooms and an assembly room fifty-nine by sixty-three feet, for the high school. The old hot air heating plant has been taken out and steam heat put in place; the dry closet system taken out and a flush water system in - stalled, rendering the building perfectly sanitary, convenient for teach - ers, pleasant and comfortable for pupils. One large room has been set aside for science work and equipped with tables, stools, water, light and apparatus for teaching the sciences. The room and equipment will accomodate about thirty pupils at a time. I The course of study in the high school has been strengthened in e way of U. S. history, political economy and psychology. The work the grades has been greatly intensified; the Nebraska course of study followed more closely that ever before, and better results obtained. Greater stress is being laid upon the grade work, and will continue to be bo as long as the present administration lasts. The grades is the place to prepare for the high school, and if it is not done there, it will never be done at all, The library is receiving more than usual attention. During the past two years more than two hundred choice volumes have been added to the general library, while perhaps half that number have been placed in the teachers library. New and ample room has been given on the first floor, the room properly shelved and all books catalogued. A librarian has been chosen and careful account kept of all books and papers placed there. P Normal training is one of the strongest features of the school, number of normal trainers has increased from twelve in 1909 to y-six in 1912. Out of a class of sixteen who graduated in June , eight are teaching and for the most part are doing good work, influence of normal training is felt throughout the entire school and always for good. It not only helps the Normal Trainers themselves, but it reaches down into the grades and we often hear the pupils expressing themselves as intending to become teachers. A county superintendent not long ago put the matter of normal training about right, when he said, "Those Normal Trainers from Tekamah high school go at their work just like old teachers." I am of the opinion that no feature of school endeavor in Nebraska is more productive of good results than normal training. Kdustrial education, manual training and domestic science, are in a limited way by the regular teachers, but no regular instruc - e employed. Pie last two years have been very prosperous for the schools of in, but greater things lie just ahead and will be reached, if we. hers, do our whole duty by the pupils and patrons of the dis- A. H.

LOUIS, TILDEX The growth in attendance of the Tilden schools may be best Men by comparing the enrollment of 1911-12 with the enrollment of the previous year. In 1910-11 there were enrolled in all of the grades 327 pupils while this year there were enrolled in all of the grades 357 pupils, an increase of 30 pupils over last year. The enrollment of non-resident pupils in 1910-11 was 28, while this year it was 38, an increase of 10 over last year. The three lower rooms had an enrollment of over 60 pupils each. This crowded condition made it necessary for the board of education to provide more room. The matter was brought </seg>
            <seg id="p741">686 up and discussed at the annual school meeting and as a result the board was instructed to build an additional room to relieve the crowded condition temporarily for the coming year, and to have an architect draw up plans for a six-roomed addition to the new part of the present school building, and to call a special election to vote on bonds suffi - cient for the construction thereof. The additional room which will be put up during the summer will be a single-roomed structure but will be well constructed with provision for modern lighting and heating. It will be used for a primary room. When the new six-roomed addition to f) present school building is completed it is the intention of the board sell this single-roomed building to some one for a dwelling house. During the first semester of the past school year there were but two violations of the compulsory school law. The matter was taken up through the proper channels and the two offenders required to com - ply with the law. A change in the course of study for the high school was made at the beginning of school last year. The study of beginning Latin was deferred until the tenth grade, and a year of German substituted for Cicero. The enrollment in the normal training course at the beginning of ■at was 22, twenty of them being members of the junior class. Each grade in the high school maintains class organizations, mainly for social purposes.

E'or the year 1911 and 1912 only ten of the high school stud non-residents. This is explained by the fact that most of the i grade graduates from the rural schools of this county continue education at the Wayne State Normal.

A separate well furnished room is devoted to library purposes and each day at certain hours the students have access to the library. Wayne has one of the best and most beautiful school build - ings in the state of Nebraska, built in 1909, strictly modern, large and ideally located. The heating, lighting and ventilation of this build - ing are all that can be desired for comfort and good work. This building with its thorough equipment is a monument to education and good citizenship and reflects much credit upon the enterprising people of the beautiful city of Wayne. E'he course of study below the high school is based on the course. In the high school Latin and German courses are offered, courses are based on the courses as outlined in the high school ■Since Wayne had a private normal for many years and now has a normal it has never been considered necessary to offer a normal ng course in the high school.

Last year there were seven - teen. 7 The play grounds have been equipped with tennis court, bas - ket ball grounds, swings, see-saws, and horizontal bars. 8 Electric lights have been extended so that every room is now well lighted. Eith an appreciative school patronage, a wide awake corps of ■s and a progressive board of education, the West Point Schools O. R. BOW EN. City Superintendent. WIL.BER. The growth of the Wilber schools has been slow, but steady, the greatest increase being in the high school. In the last biennium the enrollment of the high school has increased from seventy-seven to ninety-eight. In order to accommodate the high school, last summer there was built an addition, and the high school assembly room greatly enlarged. This gives the high school a nice large assembly room, a new laboratory, and plenty of class rooms. We have no trouble with compulsory attendance. The attendance ia always very good. In the high school there are twenty-nine non - residents, and there are sixteen tuition pupils in the grades. </seg>
            <seg id="p746">691 Last fall an excellent manual training equipment was added to the fchool plant. A good room was fixed up in the basement, and ten benches, each with a complete set of standard tools, was put in. There are 39 high school boys taking the manual training work, for the most part the work is very good, and the interest great. E,Ve have the domestic science, Crete Plan. There are fifty-four taking this work. Nothing that we have ever done has added to lterest in school work as have the manual training and dom - re work. Krnial training is very popular here, too; this is the third work here. This year there are thirty in the normal training The school library consists of more than 1.000 volumes of well - hosen books. This is made use of not only by the pupils, but b&gt; citizens of the town as well. B. E. DILL, City Superintendent. WYMOIM During the last two years Wymore schools have added a course in domestic science. The girls in this course get into forty-eight of the best homes in our city, and receive instructions from the home maker* therein. EOur high school has taken one first and one second place in the e league debate in that time. The school and the town are enthus - ically supporting the debaters. We have a school census of 606 and an enrollment at present, of 602. That is, we have more than 94 per cent of all pupils of school age in school. We have three buildings in good condition with fair equipment. City Superintendent. YOKK. During the last biennium the growth of our schools has been marked by a strengthening of the departments already organized rather than the organization of new departments. The number of teachers has remained about the same, but the quality of the teaching staff has. '»een materially improved. The York public schools consist of an elementary school and a secondary school The elementary school comprises, nine full years. This is divided into a kindergarten, primary and departmental grammar school. The kindergarten covers one year, the primary department the first six years, and the departmental grammar school C. LeROY CHERRY, </seg>
            <seg id="p747">• STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 692 The secondary school covers a period of five years beginning with the ninth grade. The faculty is composed of fourteen teachers who do the work in the following departments: — English, German, history, Latin, mathematics, industrial — including domestic science and manual training, military, music, normal training, science which is divided into physical, biological, and earth science. I 'he following is the maximum of credit that can be earned in department: — (a credit is based on five forty-five minuu-&gt; [ions, or equivalent, a week for eighteen weeks.) English m, in 6, history 8, Industrial department: — domestic science '.'.. il training 4, Latin 10, mathematics 10, military 4, nnis: il training 7, science — physical 4, biological, 2, earth 2. During the past ten years the yearly enrollment has remained rbout the same. The yearly enrollment of the kindergarten has like - wise made no material change in the same length of time. Ho the grammar school and high school have increased fifty per cent in numbers in this time, and the high school is graduating seventy-five t-nt more of its pupils. A part of this redistribution and retention of the pupils seems to be due to the introduction of a broader curri- ■e have a modern high school building, though inadequate for rk we are trying to do. Our ward buildings are not modern fairly satisfactory. Ee district receives no income from license fees and other sources of direct taxation. However, we are not in debt and we pay chers as well as any city in Nebraska in our class. Our bonded dness is less than $25,000. \V. W. STONER. City Superintendent. </seg>
