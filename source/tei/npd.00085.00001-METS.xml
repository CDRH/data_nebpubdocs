In the Matter of the Application of the ) C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company for authority ) to establish reduced emergency rates on ) APPLICATION NO. 12320 sand and gravel from Bridgeport, Ne- ) braska, to Alliance, Yale Siding, Berea ) and Hemingford. ) OPINION AND FINDINGS BY GOOD, COMMISSIONER: This application, filed on behalf of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company, by C. J.Rohwitz, General Freight Agent, seeks authority to establish the following reduced rates on sand and gravel, darload, subject to the minimum weights now published m the general sand and gravel tariff covering movements on the lines of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company within the State of Nebraska: FROM Bridgeport, Nebraska TO: RATE Alliance, Nebraska 45£ Yale Siding, Nebraska 50f nerea, Nebraska 50&lt; Hemingford, Nebraska 55^ Rates m cents per ton of 2000 lbs. In support of the application it is shown that the proposed rates represent a reduction of 10&lt; per ton over the rates now In effect. Applicant desires to establish these reduced rates as permanent rates not subject to any specific expiration date as has heretofore been allowed m connection with emergency reduced rates published for the specific purpose of meeting motor truck competition or road - side pit competition. At the lime this application was filed the Commission was of the opinion that an emergency did not exist m connection with the movement of sand and gravel from Bridgeport to these points. At the specific request of applicant, however, the matter was set down for hearing before the entire Commission. At the hearing, evidence was introduced by the applicant and contractors favoring </seg>
            <seg id="p072">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT the application m which .it was shown that there was to be a move - ment of about 123 carloads of sand and gravel from Bridgeport to the above mentioned stations for the express purpose of surfacing a state highway, the contract for which had been let, and under the terms of such contract the project was to be completed on or before the 15th day of April, 1937. Applicant, stated that its in - vestigation indicated to it that if the traffic were to be moved by rail the reductions requested would have to be made, and because of a time element entering into the completion of the project, it was necessary, m its opinion, to establish these emergency rates at an early a date as possible. The testimony adduced at the hearing showed that the distance by rail from Bridgeport to Alliance was 36"/6 miles; to Berea, 46.7 miles; and to Hemingford, 55.6 miles; that the road distance from Bridgeport to Alliance was 38.2 miles; to Berea, 48.95 miles; and to Hemingford, 56.95 miles. One of the witnesses on behalf of the applicant indicated that the haulage cost for delivering sand and gravel from Bridgeport to this project would be about 86£ per yard or 61c per ton. These figures do not include the cost of spreading the gravel on the highway. This same wit - ness also indicated that the cost for hauling the sand and gravel from the car to the project and spreading it on the road involved a cost ranging from 15c to 25c per ton. Comparing this cost with the cost of transportation by rail would seem to indicate that the rail cost /In delivering the sand and gravel from Bridgeport to the stock piles would be lower and m the end more economical than the same com - modity could be transported by truck, especially for these longer distances. At the request of the Commission, a witness from the State Highway Department was called, and from his testimony it was learned that the wages paid for labor used on any road pro - ject varied from 40( to 60c per hour, according to the classification of such labor. The fact was also developed that this contract labor cost would not obtain where sand and gravel was moved from a pro - ducing pit to a stock pile near a project, whether such sand and gravel was moved by rail or truck. A considerable amount of in - formation was developed, on the record dealing with the kind of equipment used, the maximum loads which, for instance, a ton and a half truck could handle, and the advisability or desirability of using the highways for the hauling of this large amount of sand and gravel. There seemed to be some indication on the part of this witness that constant travel of a large number of trucks over one particular piece of highway, and m this instance there would be but one highway available for the hauling of the material from Bridgeport, would cause considerable damage to such highway. Other information regarding conditions surrounding the letting- of contracts for various projects was developed quite carefully and fully, 72 </seg>
            <seg id="p073">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION but we do not believe that it is necessary to go into these features m connection with this particular application further than to find that rail delivery of sand and gravel by its very nature gives em - ployment to a large number of men since it is necessary to unload the cars of gravel and to use trucks m transporting the gravel to and placing it upon the highway. Again, we recognize that the rail carriers are subject to reg - ulation, whereas, on the other hand, the so-called truckers are not subject to any regulation whatsoever, with the unfortunate result (hat the truck rate often is an unscientific rate arrived at merely to secure the business, and without any regard to costs of operation. This situation, we are m hopes, will be ameliorated under the pro - posed trucking regulation now pending before the Legislature. Upon consideration of the matters involved and from the facts adduced m this record, it is the opinion of the Commission that the application for these emergency rates upon short time notice should be granted without a prior, full investigation as to the reasonable - ness of such rates. The Commlsion's action m thus granting the application does not mean that the rate involved herein are authorized as reasonable, maximum rates, any or all of such rates being sub - ject to investigation upon formal complaint or resolution of this Commission filed m accordance with the Nebraska Statutes. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company be, and the same hereby is authorized and directed to reduce the rates on sand and gravel from Bridgeport, Nebraska, to Alliance, Yale Siding, Berea and Hemingford, Nebraska, m the amounts shown m the opinion and findings, which hereby is referred to and made a part hereof.

Bollen Chairman Fred F. Shields Company, ) Complainant ) V. FORMAL COMPLAINT Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad ) No. 770 Company, ) Defendant. ) OPINION AXD FINDINGS By complaint filed January 30, 1935, the complainant, Fred t\ Shields Company, a Nebraska corporation, alleges that during the period May 26, 1931, to December 1, 1931, it caused to be ship - ped 48 carloads of sand from the pits of D. H. Merritt &amp; Sons and Lyman-Richey Sand &amp; Gravel Company at Oreapolls, Nebraska to complainant at Omaha, Nebraska. It is further alleged that as to forty four of such shipments from the D. H. Merritt &amp; Son's pit defen - dant collected freight charges based on a rate of 3 cents per hundred pounds instead of a rate of 45 cents per net ton which is alleged to have been lawfully applicable at the time such shipments moved. A.« to such shipments complainant seeks an order requiring a refund of 15 cents per net ton, the difference between the rate of 3 cents per cwt. charged and the.rate of 45 cents per net ton. As to the four additional carloads of sand shipped by Lyman- Richey Sand &amp; Gravel Company from Oreapolis, it is alleged that defendant collected a rate of 45 cents per net ton plus a switching 74 </seg>
            <seg id="p075">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION charge of $4.05 per car. Complainant alleges that the switching charge should have been absorbed to accomplish delivery at Omaha at the lawfully applicable rate of. 45 cents per net ton. We are asked to require the refund of the unabsorbed switching charges. In Rivett Lumber &amp; Coal Company of Omaha vs. Chicago, Bur - lington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company. Formal Complaint No. 767, de - cided April 9, 1937, the following findings were made: "We further find that the lawful rate applicable upon the ship - ments of sand and gravel moving irom Oreapolis, Nebraska to Omaha during the period on and after May 28, 1931 to and in - cluding December 31, 1931 should not have exceeded that ap - plicable from Louisville, Nebraska to Ralston, a point within the switching district of Omaha." "We further find that the lawful rate on sand and gravel from Oreapolis to Omaha during the period May 28, 1931 to and in - cluding December 31, 1931 was 45 cents per ton of 2000 pounds." Such findings are general m their nature and they inure to the benefit of every person who has oeen obliged to pay the unlaw - ful rate or charge provided that such persons have placed them - selves m a position to claim the benefit of such findings by season - ably filing a complaint tolling the statute of limitations as to ship - ments which they have received. The legal principles applicable to such a situation are well stated by the Supreme Court of the United States m A. J. Phillips Company v. Grand Trunk W. Ry. Company, 236 U. S. 662. On the record of this proceeding and on the authority of our findings m the Rivett Lumber &amp; Coal Company case supra, we must hold that on and after May 28, 1931 to December 31, 1931 a rate of 4 5 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds was lawfully applicable to the transportation of sand and gravel m carload lots from Oreapolis, Nebraska to Omaha, Nebraska via the line of defendant. Our decision m the Rivett Lumber &amp; Coal Company case supra did not involve the question, here Involved, relating to the absorption of switching at the lawfully applicable rata of. 45 cents per ton from Oreapolis, Nebraska to Omaha. On the record we must hold that such switching charges were subject to absorption and should have been absorbed". The President of the complainant company testified concern - ing the payment of freight charges on' all shipments, consisting of forty-eight carloads, transported from Oreapolis*, Nebraska to Omaha, Nebraska and there delivered to complainant, as alleged m the com - plaint herein. The evidence justifies a finding that complainant 75 </seg>
            <seg id="p076">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT has been overcharged, as alleged, and is entitled to a refund of such overcharges, together with interest at six per cent from date of payment. An examination of the freight bills offered m evidence shows that six carloads received at Omaha on May 28 and 29th were covered by bills of lading dated May 26 and May 27, 1931. Such shipments were transported at the lawfully applicable rate of 3 cents per cwt. from Oreapolis, Nebraska to Omaha, Nebraska, which was m effect until May 28, 1931, when it was displaced by the rate of 45 cents per net ton thereafter applicable between those points. There is no- overcharge on these shipments. FINDINGS I We find that the lawfully applicable rate on sand and gravel, m carloads, from Oreapolis, Nebraska to Omaha, Nebraska, during the period from May 28, 1931 to December 31, 1931, both inclusive, was 45 cents per ton of. 2,000 pounds. II We further find that the lawfully applicable tariffs provided for the absorption oi switching charges ai Omaha, Nebraska m con - nection with the rate of 4 5 cents per ton lawfully applicable to the transportation of sand and gravel, m carloads, from Oreapolis, Nebraska to Omaha, Nebraska during the period from May 28, 1931 to December 31, 1931, both inclusive. 11l We further find that complainant, Fred F.

COMMISSIONERS CONCURRING: (Signed) F. A. Good (Signed) Will M. Maupin In the Matter o! Rates on Sand, Gravel ) Resolution No. 122 and Crushed Stone to Apply on All Ne- ) Supplement No. 20 braska Intrastate Traffic. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: In this proceeding the Commission haa constantly tried to bring about the establishment of railroad rates applicable to carload ship - ments of sand, gravel and crushed stone which would be just and reasonable and so adjusted as to permit the free flow of such com - modities by railroad between points m Nebraska. The problem has been greatly complicated by the widespread distribution of sand and gravel deposits m practically all parts of. Nebraska from which deliveries to road projects or other consumers can be made on comparatively short truck hauls. Competition be - tween sand and gravel shipped by railroad with that delivered by trucks varies with the length of the hauls ot competing carriers, the quality of deposits of sand and gravel which can be cheaply moved by truck and the volume of such materials to be delivered m a given period. The delivered costs of such commodities consume a con - siderable part of funds available for highway building and main - tenance and such costs are an important element m competitive bids by contractors. In the course of this investigation we have prescribed or ap - proved rates based on a distance scale, with certain exceptions, m the hope that some general basis of rates would solve the problem. Competition between carriers by railroad and by truck presents an ever changing picture and we have found it necessary to authorize numerous exceptions to any general distance scale of rates. 79 </seg>
            <seg id="p080">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT In too many cases we' have been asked to authorize reductions m railroad rates to meet truck competition after contracts for high - way construction have been let. In such instances the question arises whether the contractor has secured an advantage which might have reduced the cost of construction of our highways if the rates sought were established and available to all competing contractors before the bids were submitted. The possibility of giving one ship - per or contractor an advantage which is or may be unjustly dis - criminatory and preferential has been a source of difficulty and embarrassment to the Commission. Conferences have been had with representatives of the High - way Commission and the rail carriers. On further consideration of this matter the Commission is convinced that no special or emergency railroad rates to meet competition of trucks should be permitted unless application for authority to publish such rates has been filed at least seven days before the opening of bids by the Highway Com - mission. Such an arrangement should protect the interests of the State of Nebraska, the railroads, competing contractors and sand and gravel producers. FINDING We are of the opinion and find that on and after June 1, 1937, no application by railroads lor reduced rates on sand and gravel for state highway projects to meet truck competition will be considered or granted by the Commission unless application is filed with the Commission not less than seven days prior to the day of opening bids of contractors by the State Highway Department. An appropriate order will be entered. OKDEIt IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission that on and after June 1, 1937, no application by railroads for reduced rates on sand and gravel for st.Ue highway projects to meet truck competition will be considered or granted by the Commission unless application is filed with the Commission not less than seven days prior to the day of opening bids of contractors by the State Highway Department.

OPINION AND FINDINGS BOLLEN, CHAIRMAN: - WHEREAS, from the evidence submitted m Formal Complaint No. 778, and the records and files of the Commission, it manifestly appears: 1. That the rates, charges and fares of the respondent. The Lincoln Traction Company, are unreasonably high and m excess of the fair return upon the fair value of the property used and useful m furnishing transportation service. 2. That the present equipment of the respondent is inadequate and, m large part, too obsolete to furnish modern transportation service. 3. That prior to July first, 1934, respondent paid annually the sum of $40,000. on its $800,000. of outstanding bonds to the lowa-Nebraska Light and Power Company from its depreciation re - serve and from other sources. 118 </seg>
            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 4. That respondent's monthly report for the month of December 1936, shows that respondent has, on hand, m cash the sum of $159, 059.53. 5. That some payments to related corporations and to their officers have been excessive and of doubtful value to respondent. We are, therefore, of the opinion and so find: 1. That the Commission should investigate on its own motion the rates, charges, fares and service of The Lincoln Traction Company. 2. That there should be an inventory and appraisement of respondent's property used and useful m rendering transportation service, as of February first, 1937. 3. That there should be an audit of respondent's accounts, books and records for the year 1936 and month of January, 1937. 4. That respondent should make no further payments of divi - dends to its stockholders, or payments of interest on its outstanding oonds from its depreciation reserve. 5. That respondent's cash now on hand represents m a large part its depreciation reserve and should be used for replacement and abandonment of its worn out and obsolete equipment. ti. That on February 27, 1936, the minutes show that the fol - lowing motion was made and carried, to-wit: •That the Commission institute proceedings on its own motion for a complete investigation of the rates and services of The Lincoln Traction Company."

            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION IX THE SUPREME COURT OF NEBRASKA ■ ■ In Re Application Kurstenberg, Fumtenberg y. Omalia &amp; Council Bluffs Street Kaihvay Uomjkany FILED APRIL 8, 19:J7. No. 20841 1. i'owers conferred upon an appellate court should be construed as intended to include only powers consistent with the discharge of its inherent judicial functions. '1. The grant or denial of a certificate of convenience and necessity by the railway commission requires the exercise of admin - istrative and legislative functions and not of judicial powers. u. Courts should review or interfere with administrative and legis - lative action of the railway commission only to far as is necessary to keep it within its jurisdiction and protect legal and constitutional rights. 4. On an appeal to the supreme court from an order of the railway commission administrative or legislative in nature, the only questions to be determined are whether the railway com - mission acted within the scope of its authority and if the order complained of is reasonable and not arbitrarily made. 5. The primary object of the regulation of public utilities by the railway commission is not to establish a monopoly or to guarantee the security of investment in public service corp - orations, but, first and at all times, to serve the interests of the public. In considering an application for a cer - tificate of convenience and necessity for the operation of motor bus transportation, the public, and not individuals, is to be most considered. fi. A public utility operating under a non-exclusive franchise is not estopped in a hearing before the railway commission upon application by another for a certificate of convenience and necessity to operate in the same field, to appear and object to the grant thereof. Heard before Day, Paine and Carter, J. J., and Tewell, Chappell and Yeager, District Judges, CHAPPELL, District Judge. Appellants Roy J. Furstenbergi as applicant, and the city of Omaha proponent, by precedent approval, applied to the Nebraska state railway commission for a certificate of public convenience and </seg>
            <seg id="p150">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT necessity thereby seeking authority for appellant Furstenberg to en - gage In the common carrier business of transporting passengers for hire by motor busses in Omaha over one definite route upon a definite schedule at a certain price. The application was denied. Motion for new trial was overruled, and both applicant and proponent, here - inafter called appellants, come to this court on appeal. All parties concede, and the record shows, that the railway com - mission had jurisdiction to hear the application. Appellants con - tend that the railway commission erred in its refusal to hold, over objections of both appellants, that the objector, Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, hereinafter called appellee, was barred and estopped from appearing and objecting to the granting of the certificate, and that the denial of the certificate to appellant Furstenberg was erroneous, arbitrary and unreasonable. With reference to estoppel, earnest contention is made that on November 6, 1928, appellee, having received and unconditionally accepted a nonexclusive franchise from the city of On.aha by vote of its electorate, is estopped to appear ; and make objection in this proceeding. We have made studious effort to find the proposition contended for by appellants in the cases cited by them and apply it to this proceeding, but have failed. The doctrine of estoppel has application in adversary judicativi; controversies at law or in equity where one party is prevented from making a claim by reason of his previous conduct to the damage of his opponent. Estoppel must be reciprocal and mutual and is founded upon the idea that the acts of the party estopped must result in injury to the other party and. generally, that it would be a fraud if the right asserted be maintained. See 21 C. J. 1107 and 1139. Estoppel; does not itself give a cause of action, its purpose being to preserve rights already acquired and not to create new ones. State v. Missouri Utilities Co., :i31 Mo. 337, 53 S. W. (2d) 394. We do not discover its application ordinarily in unilateral legislative or administrative proceedings. We said in Public Cars, Inc. v. Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co., 130 Neb. 401, 265 N. W. 234: "The grantl or denial of a certificate of convenience and necessity by the railway commission requires the exercise of administrative and legislative functions and not of judicial powers." In Gallaher v. City of Lincoln, 63 Neb. 339, 88 N. ■ W. 505, it was held that the city, acting in a ministerial and not in a judicial capacity, could not avail itself of the defense of estoppel in an action to enforce a contract contrary to an express statute. The rule gen - erally is that admissions, in order to constitute estoppel, must relate to matters of fact and not of law. 21 C. J. 1147. The doctrine of estoppel will not ordinarily apply to a private individual when the </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION public interest is concerned, and one private individual cannot be given an advantage over another by claiming an estoppel against the public. 21 C. J. 1189. We must not permit a confusion between the jurisdiction of the city and the railway commission. There is a clear distinction between powers of a city to grant or withhold franchises, licenses or permits to use its streets, police power, and the exclusive constitutional power of the railway commission to impose regulation and control over the city's common carriers. In re Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co., 126 Neb. 138, 253 N. W. 80. Appellants recognize these two different forces of jurisdiction by admitting and contending that such permit already obtained is insufficient to authorize common carrier service in that a certificate of convenience and necessity from the railway commission is also required. These two precedent authorizations arise from two different jurisdictional authorities, and that both are necessary is not questioned. Appellee's franchise recognizes these separate powers. Section 2, subsec. :i2 thereof, with reference to regulation, provides that such authority should be exercised by the city if the railway com - mission should relinquish it, or should it be held by the supreme court not to possess it. We have said that the railway commission has jurisdiction over Omaha common carriers even though contrary provisions are contained in its city charter. Omaha &amp; C B. Street R. Co. v. Nebraska State Railway Commission, 103 Neb. 695, 173 N. W. t!90. We re-affirmed this position in 1934 after the grant of appellees franchise. Omaha &amp; C. B. Street R. Co. v. City ot Omaha, 125 Neb. 825, 252 N. W. 407. The authority of the railway commission to require common carriers in Omaha to obtain from it certificates of convenience and necessity was later established. In re Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co., supra; Public Cars, Inc., v. Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co., supra. This court has expressly held that the jurisdiction of the rail - way commission cannot be avoided by the affirmative contractual provisions of a franchise. Such contracts are made subject to the right of the railway commission's jurisdictional regulation. Marquis v. Polk County Telephone Co., 100 Neb. 140, 158 N. W. 927; McCook Irrigation &amp; Water Power Co. v. Burtless, 98 Neb. 141, 152 N. W. 334. Public service corporations in each instance sought and obtained relief before the railway commission from low rates specifically im - posed by their own franchises or contractual obligation., without es - toppel. In other cases they appear as objectors and have been grant - ed or denied relief despite their own contractual obligations. The </seg>
            <seg id="p152">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT analogy Is that not any understanding, implicaion, or express agree - ment by franchise between a municipality and a public semce com Pany seeking to disrobe the paramount power of the raUwa, coS-~ mission can have any l egal force , n thls state. To assume that su^h a municipality, as a condition of favorably exercising It, veto power with reference to the entry into its jurisdiction of a common carrier u^s thr C n iSe&gt; dIVeSt a COnstitu «° na^ seated regulatory^ such as the railway commission, of its jurisdiction is without logic.

Railroad Commission, 206 Wis. 339, 240 N W 165 - 3 Ponds, Public Utilities (4th ed.) sec. 826. The converse of' these propositions we have been unable to find, and appellants have not found them for us. It is suggested that section 18, art^ III of the Constitution in - hibiting exclusive franchises, would be violated by an act of the Ne - braska state railway commission In denying a certificate of conven - ence and necessity to a second; common carrier in the city of Omaha - in other words, that such, denial would make the nonexclusive fran - chise of appellee exclusive in Its effect. True logic cannot so array the fact. The railway commission is thereby simply exercising the discretion reposed In It by section 20, art. IV of the Constitution wherein it was given plenary jurisdiction over the rates, service and regulation of common carriers. The jurisdiction to grant franchises in the city of Omaha was constitutionally reposed in the city under section 2. art. XII of the Constitution and nothing precludes the city from granting further street railway or bus franchises at its pleasure. This being true, appellee's franchise is not and never can be an ex - clusive franchise. We find that no conflict is assumed or recognized to obtain in the general inhibition to original grants of exclusive franchises and what appellants visualize as a practical status of ex - clusive franchises brought about by the regulatory bodies preferring to evolve adequate service out of the activities of one public service company duly regulated rather than out of two or more competing </seg>

This is true because the railway commis - sion, whenever it finds that the single public service is not giving, ami will not give, adequate service, can grant certificates of conven - ience and necessity to one or more additional competing companies. Resolution Xo. 137 of the Nebraska railway commission, the legislative instrument under and by which this appellant makes ap - plication for certificate of convenience and necessity, provides: While the old adage 'Competition is the life of trade' may still be acceptable as applied m private industry, still today it is the general concensus of opinion of both the courts and regulatory bodies that unbridled competition between such public utilities is not only harm - ful to the industries themselves but also m the end generally inures to the detriment of the general public as well." Appellants and the railway commission thereby brought this objector, appellee, and pros - pective competitor public utility, into this proceeding. Re Borough of Brookville, P. U. R. 192!)

True, plaintiff's franchise was not exclusive m the sense that the city might not grant similar right to another, yet it was exclusive against any one who assumed to exercise the priv - ilege granted the plaintiff, m the absence of authority or m defiance of law." We hold that the appellee had a legal right, enjoying an admittedly non-exclusive franchise, to legally object before the rail - way commission to any one else invading its field unlawfully.

St. 1929, provides for an appeal to this court from a decision of the railway commission with reference to any order or regulation made or adopted by it upon which there has been a hearing. This court under its previous holdings has juris - diction on appeal to review its orders and regulations. However, appellants confuse the administrative, legislative, and judicial field of action. In adopting the constitutional provision creating the state railway commission, it was made an independent part of the Constitution and not as an amendment to the executive, legislative, or judicial articles thereof.

I 1 The facilities of administrative law with the combination of ad - ministrative, legislative, and judicial powers such as the railway commission have been developed by the people of this state and m the country generally for the purpose of providing direct, swiftly-mov - ing, effective, nonpolitical protection of the public. The primary object of the regulation of public utilities by the railway ommission is not to establish a monopoly or to guarantee the security of invest - ment m public service corporations, but, first and at all times to serve the interests of the public Nothing is more injurious to the public from every standpoint than a law which is not capable of working out tangible results. Therefore, m its administrative and legislative sphere, if the railway commission acts within the law and not arbi- 152 </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION trarily, the courts should not, under the guise of judicial action, interfere and thereby unlawfully usurp administrative and legislative powers constitutionally reposed elsew.here. Courts should review or inlerefere with administrative and legislative action of the railway commission only so far as is necessary to keep it within its jurisdic - tion and protect legal and constitutional rights. The policy or wisdom of its action m this field ordinarily cannot be reviewed by the courts except where unlawfully exercised. This court has no power to reg - ulate public utilities. That power is constitutionally vested m the legislature and the railway commission. "The Constitution is still recognized as the supreme law of the state and as a limitation of power of all departments and all officials." Laverty v. 'Cochran, nnt o, p. , 271 N. W. 354. See Const, art. 11, section 1. This court has no business m the field of making legislation, and it is , not an administrative body. Powers conferred upon an appellate court should be construed as intended to include only powers con - sistent with' the discharge of its inherent judicial functions. The intended effective control of public utilities by the railway commis - sion is dependent upon this attitude of the court m that field. 3 Pond, Public Utilities (4th cd.) sees. 913, 915, 919. 920, 932, t&lt;37, 038, 939. and 940; 42 C.

The railway commission conducted an extended hearing on this application. We have read the record with great care. Many witnesses were called and a great volume of evidence was adducea, most of it for appellee, and many other objectors, including Omaha business men, contiguous residents and users of appellee's transportation system; persons interested m a then-proposed franchise election m Omaha to establish separate motor bus transportation, and traffic experts from Omaha, Des Moines. Kansas City and elsewhere. Only appellant Furstenberg and one city commissioner, not a patron of appellee, testified for him. The permit granted by the city to Fur - stenberg m the first instance was by a divided vote of its counsel 4 to 3. The evidence, which we deem it not necessary to quote at length supports the order of the railway commission; therefore, it is reason - able and not arbitrarily made. Appellant Furstenberg, a man of little experience m this field which he abandoned when unprofitable, made application for a certificate of; convenience and necessity to use motor bus transportation over one definite route through the best-paying, congested district of the city almost parallel with the routes of ap - pellee, crossing its system many times, and at a rate slightly lower, except for individual single fares, than now set by the railway com - mission for appellee. He is not bound thereby to give continuous adequate service upon any route. In other words, the railway com - mission is asked to put its approval upon an experiment at the ex - pense of that which is permanent. Appellee has a long-established, city-wide transportation system with great investment. It is heavily m debt, just emerging from an unprecedented depression of every - thing except individual automobile ownership and transportation. It operates under a franchise requiring continuous adequate service to every part of the city whether profitable or not. Its entire system haj recently been rerouted by experts with the approval and assistance of the city. Extensive Improvements were then immediately made. One - third of appellee's present mileage Is now served by motor bus trans- 154 </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION poriatioi:. "ill ere is no evidence of inadequate service. There is some evidence that part of appellee's present equipment is not up. - to-date;.^hat such equipment is not modern or the latest model, which changes frequently. jTraffic experts testified that there are now three methods of municipal transportation— the electric rail car, the rubber-tired trackless trolley, and the motor coach. The ex - pected development of the Diesel engine, electricity by high-frequency current or other mechanical perfection, n:ay suddenly destroy the modernity of all of them. Under these circumstances no common carrier m a city the size of Omaha could maintain a semblance of economic stability if it attempted to maintain the latest transportation equipment m its en - tirety. The effect of granting a certificate of convenience and necessity m this proceeding would be to install competition hazardous to appellee's investment and the public with no assurance of other better continuous adequate city-wide transportation for fhe people of the city of Omaha m the future. Appellee offers to furnish and makes claim that it is able to meet any reasonable order of the railway commission with reference to new motor bus or other trans - portation reciuirements. Since it has been culled to our attention by brief of counsel and argument to this court, we take judicial notice that, shortly after this proceeding was concludea by the rail - way commission, the people of the city of Omaha voted on the ques - tion of whether they should grant a separate franchise to other parties for the purpose of establishing exclusive motor bus transpor - tation m Omaha, and overwhelmingly defeated it. . Justice Brandets, m speaking of the necessity for regulation of public utilities or business affected with the public interest and certificate of convenience and necessity therefor, expressed the mod - ern view m a dissenting opinion m New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, when he said: "The purpose of requiring it is to promote the public interest by preventing waste. Particularly m those businesses m which interest and depreciation charges on plant constitute a large element m the cost of production, experience has taught that the financial burdens incident to unnecessary duplication of facilities arc HUcly to bring high rates and poor service. There, cost is usually dependent, among ether things, upon volume: and division of possible patronage among competing concerns may so raise the unit cost of operation as to make it impossible to provide adequate service at reasonable rates. The introduction t.i the United States of the certificate of public convenience and necessity marked the growing conviction that under certain circumstances free com - petition might be harmful to tht community and that, when it was 155 </seg>

            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION FINDINGS AND OKDEIt TO SHOW CAUSE BOLLEX, CHAIRMAN: The respondent now having filed its 1936 annual report with this Commission, we now have before us respondent's and its pre - decessors actual experience for a period of 24 years for its Nebraska property only. By our supplemental order entered on January 21, 1937, we prescribed an over-all composite depreciation rate for 1936 of not to exceed 3.3%. Supplementing our formula used in prescrib - ing the 1936 depreciation rate with respondent's 1936 actual exper - ience, we compute respondent's over-all composite depreciation rate for the year 193 7 as follows: A B Depreciable Debits to % Year Plant and Depreciation Ratio Equipment Reserve B to A 1913 $ 8,826,063. $ 428,741. 1914 9,284.347. 323,748. 1 0 1 f&gt; 9,952,614. 530,390. 191« 10,006,673. 563,650. 1917 10,162,565. 278,988. 1918 10.786,376. 187,839. 1919 12.935,286. 571,554. 1920 14,447,876. 707,283. 1921 15,721,537. 477,782. 1922 ■ IS, 614, 480. 1,015,256. 1923 19,974,817. 347,053. 1924 20,543,760. 583,932. 1925 21,153,611. 620, 151. 1926 21,587,324. 593,860. 1927 22,007,619. 630,262. 1928 23,146,063. 858,966. 1929 24.480,093. 1,007,788. 1930 26,839,154. 1,329,518. 1931 28.386,967. 1,434,332. 1932 29,245,988. 874,178. 1933 29.108,039. 450,049. 1934 29,204,412. 460,820. 1935 24,871,575. 438,331. 1936 25,132,812. 514,511.

            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the respondent to show cause before this Commission at its hearing room on June 2nd, 1937, why an order should not be entered fixing an over-all composite depreciation rate of 3.27% for the year 1937. Pursuant thereto a conference was held, after which the respon - dent submitted to the Commission a memorandum purporting to show the recognition which ought to be given to the effects of growth and of the presence m the existing plant of considerable property with respect to which retirements have been relatively small m amount. The memorandum Includes a tabulation based upon studies of certain Classes of Plant covering estimated Average Service Lives, Sal - vage, Depreciation and Composite Rate of Depreciation; and another tabulation consisting of net debits to Depreciation Reserve to average Book Costs, 1913-1936 by Accounts apparently on basis of book rec - ords. There is substantial disparity between the Composite rates of Depreciation and the Depreciation rates shown by the two tabulations. We hold that this corroborates the findings heretofore made m these proceedings. We further hold the Depreciation Reserve Balance of $7,932,063. at December 31, 1936, amounting to 31.59? ot the De " preciable Property, while the existing depreciation established at only 12&lt;a, eliminates respondents contentions as a serious factor of consideration m fixing the depreciation charge for the year 1936. Predicated upon the computations carried In our Order to Show Cause, entered on May 20th, 1937, we are of the opinion and find that an over-all composite depreciation rate of 3.27% will be adequate for the year 1937 and that respondent should apply such rates to primary accounts as will result In an over-all composite rate of not to exceed 3.3&lt;/f. 1 oki &gt; i :i ; IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska facate Railway Commission that the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company be, and it is hereby ordered to apply for the year 1937 an over-all composite depreciation rate of not to exceed 3.3% upon its depreciable property m Nebraska.

BY MAUPIN, COMMISSIONER: In the main intent and purpose of this resolution I am m hearty sympathy, but not with some of the language used. The statement that for several years last past complaints have been made to the Commission that the rates and charges of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company at its several exchanges m Nebraska are un - reasonably high, unjust and discriminatory" is true, but the resolu - tion fails to state that the same complaints have been made about the rates and charges of practically all other telephone companies m the state. That such an investigation of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company should be made goes without saying, but th e same is equally true of other telephone companies. Such an investigation as this resolution contemplates is impossible, owing to the parsimonious action of the legislature m failing to provide this Commission with funds to carry out the purposes of its creation. It has an insufficient force to do the work, and lacks by many thousands of dollars the funds to employ an adequate force and pay the necessary expenses of the </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION proposed investigation. Such an investigation can, m the very nature of things, be sketchy. Instead of a resolution calling for a "state wide Investigation", 1 favor a resolution to the effect that an Investi - gation be made of suctfe exchanges as the Commission may select to the extent that the Commission has employees and funds to prosecute. The resolution has too much the appearance of a compaign of a polit - ical nature, with no honest intent to make a state wide investigation, the concurring commissioners knowing full well that the Commission has neither the funds nor the personnel to carry out its purported purpose. I make no dissent from the idea involved; only from the nature of the proposed investigation under existing financial conditions now confronting the Commission. (Signed) Will M. Maupin Commissioner. In the Matter of the Investigation of ) Rates, Charges, Service and Practices ) RESOLUTION NO. L-2 of Northwestern Bell Telephone Com- ) OKDKK pany upon the Commission's own ) Motion. ) BY THE COMMISSION: On May 26, 1937, the Commission made and entered m the above entitled proceeding an order of investigation of the rates, charges, service and practices of Northwestern Bell Telephone Company at its several exchanges m the State of Nebraska, and pursuant thereto such investigation has been carried forward by the Commission and Its staff. Since the making of said order the Commission has had numerous conferences with the representatives of the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone Company regarding its rates, charges, service and practices m the State of Nebraska, and discussion has been had and consideration has been given to various phases of the business of the Company m Nebraska, looking to such revisions m the rates, charges, service and practices of the Company m this State as may be reasonable and proper m the premises. In particular, conferences have been had between the Commission and the Company relating- to the charges of the Company for hand - set service m the State of Nebraska. The additional charge for hand telephone sets has heretofore been reduced from time to time, and 177 </seg>
            <seg id="p180">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT the Commission finds that it is proper that further reductions m such additional charge should be made as the increased use of such instruments and other conditions warrant. We also find that the situation at the present time and for the immediate future is such that some additional- charge on this account should be continued. We find that some additional charge is now and will be required to insure orderly progress m changing from other types of instrument to the handset, and to prevent a wasteful displacement of serviceable desk sets. In view of the additional charge which heretofore has been imposed, the Company has not provided for applying the change of instrument charge ordinarily imposed where one type of instru - ment is supplied at the request of the customer m place of another to the substitution of a handset for a desk or wall set. The Com - mission is of the opinion and finds that the control of the substitu - tion of handsets for other types of instruments should bi&gt; provided In part by the application of the Company's ordinary change of instru - ment charge where a handset is substituted m place of another type of instrument ;it the request and order of the subscriber. We further find that with the application of such change of instrument charge an additional charge for hand telephone sets of ten cents per month per telephone, to continue for a period of eigh - teen months and subject to the same regulations as now provided m the existing tariffs of the Company, is reasonable and m the interest of the subscribers and m the public interest. The foregoing conclusions aacr c based upon the investigation made by 1 the Commission m this, proceeding as aforesaid, and upon the conference had with the representatives of the Company, and is pur - suant to an agreement and understanding reached between the Com - mission and the Company j after the conferences and negotiations above referred to. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that Northwestern Bell Telephone Company be, and it hereby is authorized and directed to file with this Commission such revisions of its existing tariffs as will provide that from and after December 1, 1937, its additional charge for hand telephone sets be reduced from fifteen cents per month per telephone to ten cents per month per telephone, such charge to continue for a period of eighteen months m place of thirty-six months, such charge other - wise to be subject to the same regulations as are provided m the existing tariffs. 178 </seg>

(Supreme Court of Ne - braska 30,294, Eastern Nebraska Public Power District v. Nebraska Power Company). Appeal filed September 18, 1937. Stipulation lor Dismissal of Appeal filed November 8, 1937.) OPINION AND FINDINGS BOLLEN, CHAIRMAN: By this application the Eastern Nebraska Public Power District seeks authority to construct approximately 421 miles of electric rural transmission lines m Saunders, Cass and Otoe Counties to carry a voltage m excess of 700 volts, the same being its Project No. 2. Consents by or agreements with all the interested owners of existing transmission and communication lines were not filed with the Commission at the time of filing application, and m accordance with the law and our General Order No. 72 the Commission notified all interested owners of existing transmission and communication lines to appear at a public hearing m the Commission's hearing room at Lincoln on July 26, 1937, at ten o'clock, a.m. Objections were filed by Inez L. Danielson, the Nebraska Power Company, the Alvo Telephone Company, the Unadllla Union Tele - phone Company, the Palmyra Telephone Company and the Eagle In - dependent Telephone Company. 219 </seg>
            <seg id="p222">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Pursuant to such notice, of the application and objections canu on for hearing. The evidence of the applicant was adduced m sup - port of the application, and the evidence of the objectors was ad - duced m opposition thereto. Briefs were submitted by objector, the Nebraska Power Company, an answer brief was submitted by appli - lant and the case was taken under advisement. The evidence having been considered, together with the said briefs, and the Commission being fully advised m the! premises, the Commission finds that the application should be granted and an order entered as will best pro - tect the rights of all parties! interested and those of the general public unless the Commission is Vested with statutory power to determine public convenience and necessity m the authorization of the con - struction, operation and maintenance of rural electric transmission lines, and, if vested with such power, whether the facts present a case for its exercise. ! The objection of Inez L. Danielson is based upon a conversation with one of the directors of the applicant wherein he has stated that the applicant intended to build a transmission line over and through her property. The map filed with the application shows that the applicant does not intend to build its line over or through her prop - erty and cannot do so without an application and authority from this Commission. In the event that the applicant should attempt to build its transmission lines through her property without her consent she can complain to this Commission and the matter then will be .con - sidered and a proper order entered thereon. The other objectors are telephone companies, and their objection is based on the fact that the proposed transmission lines will cause undue interference with their existing telephone lines. This ob - jection will be taken care of by the conditions and terms of our order. By its objection, the Nebraska Power Company contends that this Commission is vested with statutory power to determine public convenience and necessity ,m authorizing the construction of rural electric transmission lines tjo carry a voltage m excess of 700 volts, and that the facts alleged and proven present a case calling for the exercise of this power. Objector relies principally upon that part of Section 86-315 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes, which reads m part as follows: "•The State Railway Commission shall make such order and prescribe such terms and conditions for the location and construction and operation of the proposed lines as to it may seem just and reasonable and make such orders m the premises as m its judgment would best protect th'e rights of all parties interested and those of the general public." 220 </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The above language, standing alone, might be construed to in - clude the power to determine public convenience and necessity but, when construed with the title and other parts of the act, such power does not only not appear but is wholly inconsistent therewith and repugnant thereto. Our power to prohibit or authorize the construction of rural electric transmission lines to carry a voltage m excess of 700 volts arises from Chapter 242 of the 1915 Session Laws. This act as amended now appears as sections 86-313 to 86-318 of the 1929 Com - piled Statutes. The title of the act reads: "An act to regulate the construction, operation and maintenan.ce of electric transmission, telephone and telegraph lines m the State of Nebraska." We do not believe this language is broad enough to include the power of deter - mining public convenience and necessity m authorizing the construc - tion, operation and maintenance of a proposed rural electric transmis - sion line, or whether the same is wise from an economical standpoint or will result m duplication of facilities and economical waste. No legislative act can be broader than the title, and, if the power is not conferred by the title, either expressly or by implication, then no provision of the act can confer such power. If any doubt exists as to such power being expressed m the title of the act that doubt is removed by Section 1 (BK-313) of the act which provides: "All lines hereafter constructed for the trans - mission of eleciric current, including telephone and telegraph lines, on the public highways or m other places m this state, except as hereinafter provided, shall provide sufficient clearance between such lines and existing properly .constructed transmission, telephone and telegraph lines so that the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines shall not be interfered with." Construing Section 1 (86-313) of the act with the title of the act, it clearly appears that the powe,r conferred is to regulate the construction, operation and maintenance of electric transmission, tel - ephone and telegraph lines to the extent only that they shall provide sufficient clearance between such lines and existing properly con - structed transmission, telephone and telegraph lines so that the reason - able safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines shall not be interfered with. This section is our .charter and m our opinion is the extent of our power to regulate. By Section 2 (86-314) of the act our jurisdiction is limited to electric transmission lines carrying a voltage m excess of 700 volts. This section provides that an application to construct the same shall be made to the State Railway Commission. It provißes for hearing 221 </seg>
            <seg id="p224">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT and notice of hearing which need not be complied with when the electric transmission, telephone and telegraph companies have agreed m writing on the details of the proposed construction and have filed copies of the agreement with the Railway Commission. If the leg - islature had intended to vest the Commission with power to determine public convenience and necessity m authorizing the construction of transmission lines, it would have made it a subject matter tor agree - ment of the parties and n6t limited the agreement to the details of the proposed construction. ■ We, therefore, conclude that the power vested m us by Section. 3 (86-315) of the act, to ijiake such order m the premises as m our judgment wiir best protect the rights of all parties interested and those of the general public,, is limited to the subject matter contained m Section 1 (86-313) of the act. to-wit: that the proposed lines shall provide sufficient clearance between such lines and existing properly constructed electric transmission, telephone and telegraph lines so that the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of exist - ing lines shall not be interfered with. Having readied the conclusion that we are without statutory power to determine public convenience and necessity m authorizing the construction of electric transmission lines, we are not at this time called upon to determine whether tin - facts m the present case call for the exercise of that power, and we make no finding thereon. We, therefore, find: i 1. That Application No. 12515 should be granted and the East - ern Nebraska Public Power District authorized to construct the pro - posed transmission lines m accordance with its maps and specifica - tions attached to its application, m accordance with all written agree - ments now on file with the Commission and m accordance with the laws of. Nebraska and the fules and regulations of the Commission, subject to the condition that the applicant, being the junior occupant, shall, during the time of construction, bear all reasonable expense that may be necessary on its own lines or existing lines to insure the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines, and. if after applicant's lines have been constructed and energized the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines are in - terfered with, the applicant shall bear any reasonable expense that may be necessary on its own lines or existing lines to remove such interference. If the parties' at interest are unable to agree on the amount of such reasonable jexpense, either party may make applica - tion to the Commission for ;a determination of the controversy. 222 </seg>

            <seg id="p226">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT MADE AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 6th day of August, 1937. (SEAL) NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (signed) F. L. Bollen Chairman. ATTEST: (signed) Ruby Shelledy Acting Secretary. COMMISSIONERS CONCURRING : (signed) F. L. Bollen (signed) F. A. Good (by concurring opinion) COMMISSIONER DISSENTING: (signed) Will M. Maupin (Sy dissenting opinion) CONCURRING AND BUPPLKMENTING OPINION OP COMMISSIONER GOOD . Concurring m and supplementing the reasons set forth by the Chairman, I append the following: It has been customary m the past to allow m a rather ad lib way any request of a private power company for a permit to allow them to construct rural electric lines; our only requirement being that they must conform to the commission's formula as to construction. The Commission makes no requirement as to the number of subscribers for the service — they may have none — nor do we ask what rates are set up. There is no penalty attached if they never build the line prayed for. The above is m direct contradistinction with any application asking for a permit from a rural electrification district. Before ask - ing for such a permit, they must canvas the territory incident for subscribers. There must be an average of at least two to the mile. This done the territory must be surveyed, maps developed and an application sent to and approved by REA officials at Washington ; then funds sufficient for construction purposes must be duly appro - priated for the construction and any incidental purposes that may develop. 224 </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION After this is all attended to, the contract must be duly adver - tised and eventually let to the lowest responsible bidder. They are now far enough along so they may ask the Nebraska State Railway Commission for authority to construct the line. For tliis presentation it must appear that a certain and large advantage would accrue, for obvious reasons to a private corporation where priority rights are or were matters of moment. It appears from the record that on account of lines erected and others projected, that the Nebraska Power Company assumes to pos - sess certain definite rights and that said rights constitute the basis for what might be termed a monopolistic zone of operation which would and should be respected and protected by the Commission from invasion, regardless of what might be a fact that but a fraction of the farmers m this zone have taken or will take service from them. It is urged by protestants that whereas the great majority of farm homes are without electrical service, that rural power districts be developed only where there are now no private power develop - ments under way or under contemplation. This premise fails to recognize that the REA specifications set up as mandatory that a district may not .receive federal funds unless there be at least two subscribers to the average mile. Hence, districts can only be or - canized m «uch territory as might be found wfth such an adequate density of population as the county or counties under this consider - ation. One can scarce be insensible to the stimulus apparent m the field of electrical farm development evidenced by the private power companies since federal REA funds have become available for rural electrification. This has been a dormant field for the patrt halt century and could easily lapse back if a .commission had the power and did dedicate an exclusive territory for operation which might easily become a barrier of moment to many possible installations of rural service. (signed) F. A. GOOD Commissioner. DISSENTING OPINION BY COMMISSIONER MAUPIN The majority opinion and the order based thereon to my mind assumes, without a proper premise, that, with respect to this com- 225 </seg>
            <seg id="p228">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT mission's jurisdiction under the transmission line statute, this com - mission possesses no discretionary power whatsoever but acts m a purely ministerial capacity. This is a false assumption. It cannot be said that under the bro^d language of Section 86-315, Compiled Statute of Nebraska for 1929, hereinafter referred to, this commis - sion is a mere "rubber stamp" giving approval to all applications addressed to it under this statute. The very facts of this case demand the exercise of the commis - sion's power clearly granted as will be hereafter shown. The applicant district is organized under the law commonly known as Senate File No. J3lO, passed at the 1933 session of the Nebraska legislature. Undejr Section 111 of such law it is required that the creation of such district must meet the demands or "puDllc convenience, or welfare". ■ Such district is by such law enabled to borrow money from the Rural Electrification Administration, commonly known as the R.E.A., a federal department authorized to make loans of public monies for the purpose of .rural electrification. Applicant has admittedly per - fected such an organization, and lias secured an allotment pursuant to its application to R.E.A. It has already electrified Project No. 1 of the district, and now seeks the commission's authority to proceed to electrify Its proposed Project No. 2 m Cass, Saunders, and Otoe Counties, Nebraska. The district replies that it has met all re - quirements of R.E.A. , and has actually let the contract for construc - tion of its line m said Project No. 2. Here it might well be injected: "If this commission has no authority to deny the district's applica - tion, why should not the district go right ahead and huild, meeting all the requirements of the national safety code and the rules of the commission with respect to safety of construction and conflict of other lines?" The answer is obvious. The commission does have jurisdiction to deny the application even if the safety requirements and rules of the commission as to conflicts were met. for an appli - cation would still have to be made to the commission. Clearly no engineer of repute, such as the engineer of this project is known to be, would draw plans and specifications which he knew would not meet all the requirements imposed. But there is a perspective to this picture as well as a foreground. The whole purpose of the rural electrification act is to provide elec - tric current to rural areas not now served and not favorably situated to secure such service at reasonable cost. Clearly it is not intended to promote competition with such existing purveyors of electricity or to invade territory already served to the satisfaction of the people 226 </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION desirous of plectric current. Cheap electric service to areas not now served, or capable of being served, at 'reasonable rates, by existing' agencies, was the original intent and purpose of those responsible for the enactment of the law and the organization of the R.E.A. It should remain the sole intent and purpose of those seeking federal loans for the construction of generating and distribution agencies. In the instant case the applicant does not, and will not, generate electricity, but will buy it at wholesale wherever it can secure the most advantageous rates. I prefer to not use the words "invasion of territory", but m the instant case no other words seem applicable. Applicant proposes constructing its distribution lines m a territory already well served by a private utility that is giving every evidence of not only a willing - ness but :i desire to extend its service to others m the territory not now taking service. It admits that its logical territory is limited, and has shown every evidence of a willingness to co-operate with R.E.A. projects m providing rural electrification. The question of rates, competitive or otherwise, are not m the present picture. This commission had jurisdiction over rural electric rates, and will meet that problem when it arises. It is not concerned about the crossing' of bridges until it comes time to cross them. The proposed lines of the applicants will, as duly filed maps of applicants show, parallel the lines of the protestant for upwards of thirty-five (3. r &lt;) miles, and an additional twelve (12) miles for which the protestant has filed application with this commission. It is contended by the applicant that all this is rendered necessary, not by reason of the fact that the territory m question is now without rural electrification, but because it is necessary m order that it may have access to a permanent source of electric energy, which is either the municipal power plant at Fremont, Nebraska, or the Loup River project at a point adjacent to Fremont. This argument Is unsound and without foundation. It overlooks tße possibility of obtaining power from the Lincoln, Nebraska, municipal plant, or from the Loup River project, already committed by contract to build a transmission line to Lincoln; or from one or more established power developments on the Blue River. There are also other municipal plants as near, or nearer, as Fremont, capable of supplying sufficient power to Project No. 2. The granting of this application, not only means a gTeat dup - lication of service, which will result m increased investment to serve the same area, thereby increasing the cost of service to customers, actual and potential, m the area m question; but it also means a 227 </seg>
            <seg id="p230">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT direct perversion of the original intent and purpose of the Rural Elec - trification Act. The whole purpose of the act is to niake available ele-iiic service m areas not iiow so served, or not m a good position to be served by some existing; agency. It must be clear to any think - ing and unprejudiced observer, that to invest federal monies m pro - viding electric service to communities already being so served, or capable of being so served simply means that communities not now so served or capable of being served by existing agencies, "must wait just that much longer to get the service contemplated by the govern - ment set-lip. The maps filed by applicant clearly show that the west - ern half of Saunders County is almost completely ignored — a territory not now served by the protestant nor .contemplated by the protestant to be served. But it goes right into the heart of a section of that county, and of Cass County, already served and capable of being served by an existing agency, the protestant. It may be argued, and is argued, that the R.E.A. projects are handicapped by reason of having so many requirements to meet m order to secure federal aid, while the privately owned utilities are not so handicapped, but can "hurry m and occupy a territory with a minimum of delay. This, it is argued, enables the privately owned utilities to "bottle up" a proposed R.E.A. district. That is the fault neither of this commission nor of the privately owned utilities. If fault there is it must be deposited at the door of the framers of the law and the authorities at Washington. This commission's prime concern m these premises should be to see to it that all rural communities are adequately served with electric power, and at rates (hat will be compensatory to the serving agencies, and at the same time within the ability of the consumers to pay. It can have no concern as to what agency performs the service other than to see to it that the rignts of all the parties in - terested and those of the general public are protected. It should be further concerned with another phase of the problem — that of pre - venting undue, useless and wasteful competition, which m the last analysis means loss of investment, increased rates to make up losses incurred m ruinous competition, and later increased rates to com - pensate for losses thus incurred. It has a duty to protect honest investments, as well as a duty to prevent discriminations and un - reasonable and unjust rates. In the instant case it has the duty of not only protecting honest investments, but the duty of seeing to it as far as lies within its power, that communities not now served by electric power have every possible opportunity to be so served by the liberal advancement of federal funds now being made by the R.E.A. This rural service, so much to be desired, will be curtailed 228 </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION unjustly by expending federal funds to serve rural communities already served. It is to advance the best interests of the commun - ities not now served if this application be denied. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, and, to my mind irrefutable argument, the majority opinion asserts that this commission is with - out power and jurisdiction to deny the instant application. It is evident that to allow the instant application, it is prejudicial to the public interest and detrimental to existing- utilities serving the same area. With the contention of the applicant that this commission is powerless m the instant case to do anything except to grant the ap - plication, I have but little patience. The statute under which the application was made by 'the applicant district to this commission does not so circumscribe the power of the commission m my humble opinion. I hold that the admitted power to approve the application im - plies an equal power to disapprove and deny the application, either or both being based on the facts and the evidence. Such is the con - sensus of authorities: Aptel v. Mellon, 33 FeS. 2nd, 805 (decided by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia) and certiorari denied m 280 U. S. 585. See also State Xx Kel v. Smith, 57 Pacific 449; and Cosner v. Colusa County Supervisors, 58 Calif. 274. It is not claimed by even the applicant district that this commission is wholly without discretion m the excercise of its jurisdiction under the transmission line statute. If this commission has such dis - cretion then obviously it has the power to deny the Instant applica - tion, sufficient reasons for such denial appearing m the facts as disclosed by the evidence on the hearing of this case. Back of this principle are, however, plain statutory provisions. Section 86-313, Compiled Statute of Nebraska for 1929, gives this commission juris - diction over "all lines hereafter constructed for the transmission of electric current*** on the public highways or m other places of this state". The next following sections set forth how said lines including transmission, telephone, and telegraph lines shall be constructed. It is true, of course, that this commission is vested with power to require the observance of safety m the construction of such lines as well as the eraser or reconciliation of conflicts with other lines close by the proposed lines. The legislature m vesting the commis - sion with power In the premises did not stop with the observance of safety and the elimination of conflicts. On the contrary In order to vest this commission with the broadest possible discretion it went on m Section 86-315, Compiled Statute of Nebraska fox 1929, to provide: 229 </seg>
            <seg id="p232">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT "The State Railway Commission shall have full power and authority to prohibit the construction of any line or lines found to be m violation of the terms of Section 1 (86-313) of this act and after hearing, provided for m Section 2 (86 - -314), shall make such order and prescribe such terms and conditions FOR THE LOCATION AND CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE PROPOSED LINES, AS TO IT MAY SEEM TO BE JUST AND REASONABLE; AND TO . MAKE SUCH ORDER |IN THE PREMISES AS IN IT.S JUDGMENT WOULD BEST PKOTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL PARTIES INTERESTED AND THOSE OK THE GEN - EKAL PUBLIC." (Emphasis Mine) The principles expressed by the Nebraska Supreme Court m the cases of: In re Yellow Cab and Baggage Company, 126 Nebraska, 138; Pnblix Cai-s, Inc. v. Yellow Cab and liaggage Company, ISO Nebraska, 401, and m re Furstenberg, as to the unsoundness of ex - cessive duplication are applicable to this case. There is another reason why the commission has the power to deny this application. Since the decision m the Miller v. lowa-Ne - braska Light &amp; Power Company, 129 Neb. 757, this commission pos - sesses regulatory power m .rural areas over electric public utilities. Having such jurisdiction oveii' the rates and services of electric com - panies, the commission has the correlative power and jurisdiction to restrict and confine duplication and competition In occupied utility fields, and '.hereby qualify and condition service rendered by utili - ties or proposed utilities. It is asserted that this commission does not have power over the rates of public power districts, such as the applicant, and that, therefore, by implication it has no power to disapprove this application. This commission met a like argument m Towle v. Village of Salem, F. C. 760, the opinion being written by, then Commissioner, now Chairman Bollen, where it was asserted that because this commission had no jurisdiction over the rates of a municipal plant it could not regulate rates outside the municipality. As said m Public Service Company v. City of Lovelantl, PUR 1924 E-516, decided by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (page 529) "suffice it to say that the matter of the fixing of rates for a municipally owned plant is not the same as the question of whether or not the municipality should be permitted to engage m competition by the construction and operation of a municipally owned plant with an existing utility of a like character operating within the limits of such municipality." , 230 </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Clearly this grants to this commission complete jurisdiction m the instant premises. However, if this be not clear enough, attention is called to the following citations: IX re James, 132 At. (VT) 40, is m point. There the statute, m investing the Public Service Commission with jurisdiction over motor busses and requiring an application, made specific provisions, as does this statute, for ".routes, fares, schedules, continuity of ser - vice and the convenience and safety of passengers and the public". Pursuant to amendment, it then went on to provide that the commis - sion could find "that the operation of such motor bus*** over such route will promote the general good of the state* *•", — that and noth - ing more. The commission denied an applicant the right to install a bus line along side an existing competing trolley line. The court said — "That the Legislature intended to limit the use of the public highways of the state by common carriers to such operations as would promote the general good of the state, irrespective of the effect of such limitation upon competition, seems clear from the language of the statutes when read together, but all doubts concerning this are removed when existing conditions and the evil the Legislature sought to correct are considered. Probably those conditions and evils are nowhere better illustrated than m this case. Here was a section of the state served by an existing trolley line which was meeting 'all reasonable public demands.' The petitioner was operating motor busses over a portion of the route cov - ered by the trolley line, using for that purpose the public highways, with no excuse for so doing, so far as the general good of the state was concerned, and the commission was powerless to interfere under the law as it stood prior to the enactment of Act No. 74. See In re James, 97 Vt. 362, 123 A. 385." »• • ■ "The right, common to all, to the use of highways, is the ordinary use made thereof, and by no means includes the special and extraordinary use of a common carrier for com - mercial purposes or private gain. The latter use the Leg - islature, m the exercise of its police powers, may wholly deny, or may permit it to some and deny it to others, as will best promote the general good of the public." "Promotion of the general good of the state" was, therefore, held adequate, as statutory authority to deny the applied for dup- 231 </seg>
            <seg id="p234">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT lication of service. This is made strikingly apparent if one consults the prior decision mentioned (123 Atl. 385) where the court held that before "promotion of the general good of the State" was added by amendment to the statute, the commission, under a power of "gen - eral supervision and jurisdiction of such common carriers", could not make the proposed new service depend upon the public con - venience and necessity. How much broader is the "(protection of) the rights of all parties interested ana those of the general public" In the instant situation. The Nebraska statute not only requires protection of the rights of tlie "General public" — the general good, m the language of the Vermont statute — but it encompasses also existing utilities and their Tights as "parties interested". So m Public Service Commission v. Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co.. 31 S.W. &lt;2d) (Mo) G7, the question of whether the approval power of the commission over a transmission line included inquiry into the necessity and convenience thereof was answered affirmatively as follows — "Section 10481 of the statute provides that no electrical corporation shall begin costruction of an electrical plant without first having qtjtained the permission and approval of the commission, and! no such corporation shall exercise any right or privilege under any franchise hereafter granted without having obtained the permission and approval of the commission. "Appellant contends that neither section 10481 nor an} other statute requires a certificate of convenience and neces - sity or permission from the commission to construct and operate an extension of an existing transmission line. Con - tention is also made that, a proper .construction of section 10481 of the statute demonstrates a clear intent on the part of the Legislatures to require a certificate of public convenience and necessity only when an electrical corpor - ation starts m business*, or at most thereafter when it re - ceives a new franchise from public authority to operate m entirely new territory. "It is true that section 10481 does not. m express terms, require a certificate of convenience and necessity or per - mission and approval of the commission to construct and operate an extension to an existing electrical transmission line but this section of the statute must be read and con - strued m connection with other pertinent provisions of the Public Service Commission Act. and. if it reasonable 232 </seg>

I m Sellers v. Cumberland Traction Co., 127 A. (N. J.) 268, the Public Utilities Commission was held to have the power to require permission for the introduction of a bus service where the statute provided that the commission should have "general supervision and regulation of and jurisdiction and control over all public utilities." Nothing waa stated In the statute there as broad and pervasive as we encounter here concerning the protection of the rights of the parties interested and of the public. In re Washington Kapid Transit company, P. v. R. 1923 B 328 the District of Columbia Public rtilities Commission denied an ex - tension of bus service into a field already occupied by a street rail - way company under a statute giving only general regulatory juris - diction 137 U. S. Stat. 974) The Commission said 233 </seg>
            <seg id="p236">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT "And, similarly, the commission must protect these .regulated companies actually furnishing reasonable and adequate ser - vice from unfair and unnecessary competition as well as from anything else, possibly proposed by the public, that would tend to deprive them of their common law right to a fair return on the property judiciously dedicated to the service of the public. When the companies are furnishing adequate and convenient service, it is the duty of the com - mission to protect them against unfair and unnecessary competition; and, when their service is below a proper standard, it is the corresponding duty of the commission to protect the public byi compelling the supply of adequate facilities." j "The comparatively short extension now asked is typical of what should sedulously be avoided. Such an extension would deplete still further the earnings of a company whose present service is adequate and convenient, to that extent diminish an already unduly small return, and m the final event compel the company and this commission to meet this shrinkage by a corresponding reduction of service to the detriment of a great number of people living beyond the sphere of influence of the bus line and therefore unable to take advantage of it. Our theory of government is based on securing the greatest good fairly for the greatest num - ber; and all correct public utility regulation recognizes the • same principle. In this ;case the bus extension sought would probably damage a consideraoly greater number than seem likely to profit by it and, therefore, the application of this principle would require denial of the extension." The majority opinion asserts that this certificate of convenience and necessity power is not demonstrated to exist m the transmission line statute. I do not here assert that this commission needs any more specific power than the power to approve or correlative power to disapprove an application: to the commission. That is enough and certainly from the foregoing this commission has the power to dis - approve whereever the public interest would be injured by the allow - ance and approval of the application. It does not lie m the mouth of the applicant district to make an application for the exercise of the approval powers of this commission, and then to assert, as it does, that this commission cannot disapprove the application, suf - ficient reasons for such disapproval appearing. There is not dis - agreement among the members of this commission that the proposed duplication is unsound from a regulatory standpoint. The act m 234 </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION question both as originally enacted m 1915 and as amended m 1917 .clearly sets forth m the title thereof that this commission was vested with the power to regulate and to supervise transmission line con - struction. This together with the sweeping language of Section 86 - -315, supra, can leave no doubt hut that the commission is amply surrounded with discretionary power to deny the application and it should accordingly be denied m the public interest as to Cass County and the eastern half of Saunders County, Nebraska, now adequately served and occupied by the protestant. the Nebraska Power Company. The following practical observances should not be overlooked: 1. The protestant pioneered .rural electrification m this par - ticular area, commencing as long as ten years ago, its only hope of realization of a fair rate on its investment being that with future saturation of use m the rural areas involved the protestant will ulti - mately commence realizing on its investment, and with multiplication of customers, would thereby be enabled to accord rate reductions based on the increased revenues. The proposed duplication, however, will arrest such progress, and preclude the pioneering program to be carried out to its full extent. Apart from the detriment to the company, indicated by the foregoing, the important thing is that the existing and future customers will be definitely cut off from further rate reductions because the investment m this area by two utilities will be so enlarged that a fair rate on a double investment will not be realized, and consequently, rate, reductions will become impossible. 2. No less an authority than John Carmody, Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration, has said, that with respect to the objective and ideal of bringing electrification to every farm home m the United States, the Rural Electrification Administration and districts, cooperatives, and other distribution agencies cannot hope to do the whole job. In other words, it is necessary that m the attainment ot this ideal, the existing utilities also do their shau-e and play an appropriate part. It is obvious that the proposed dup - lication is directly contra to the attainment of this ideal, as blanket - ing a particular rural area with two distribution agencies is directly robbing another and unserved rural area of the service which It might otherwise obtain. This is not m the public interest and does not accord with the program with which every utility should be heartily m accord, namely, to make electricity widely available, particularly among our farm population. 3. There is m this picture no question of choice by the farm con - sumer as to the particular utility which should serve him. This is frequently advanced by a proposed competitor, namely, that the 235 </seg>
            <seg id="p238">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT consumer should have the right to select the service company which will serve him. This is contrary to all good regulatory practice. The fact is that under the Nebraska Physical Connection Law every farm - er m the area involved, who is not now supplied with service and who is reasonably close to existing lines, can obtain such service through application to the Nebraska State Railway Commission, which has the power to order the installation of service upon rates and con - ditions of service by the commission prescribed. But even apart from the existing and adequate power of the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission m this regard, if the protestant refused, on applica - tion, to render service to any particular farmer m the area involved, it would immediately forfeit any right to object to the farmer being supplied by some other distribution agency, such as the applicant. This is not a stituation where unserved farmers have been want - ing electric service but have not been able to get it. On the con - trary, the protestant has consistently endeavored- to enlarge the number of its customers m this area, but because of conditions over which the farmers of the state have had no control, such as drouth, depression, and other insurmountable obstacles, the farmers here - tofore have not been m a position to avail themselves of this service. 4. There is a charge made of piracy of the customers m this area by the protestant on the assumption that the Eastern Nebraska Public Power District, by merely organizing, way back m 1935. has. m some way preempted this field. The charge is a mere empty mouthing, as its proponent entirely overlooks that if there is any pre - empting, the protestant preempted this territory ten years ago. not by mere organization, but by actually building into the territory with lines and other facilities, and making an investment therein of many thousands of dollars. With conditions as they have been, that is, with, the farmers naturally desiring service but unable to take it because of adverse economic conditions, it is patent that the potential farm customer m this area was rot required to bide his time until the applicant district delayed jconstruction of lines and facilities even near the area, for over two years after a mere organization of the district on paper. B. If ! may reiterate, the commission under the Miller v. lo\ya- Xcbraska Light and Power Company decision, .construed the Physical Connection Law actually to contemplate more than physical connect - ion, and to invest the commission with full regulatory authority m rural areas. The commission, as a regulatory body, and the only regulatory tribunal, has all power and jurisdiction necessary and re - quisite. And m the exercise of the authority delegated unto it. the 236 </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSJON power to disapprove all uneconomic duplications and invasions of served territory, is an essential complement of such regulatory au - thority already conferred, and can, therefore, be sustained apart from the express authority m the transmission line statute, given to the commission, to enter such order under the transmission lines statute as will best protect parties interested and the public generally. If the general public has no rights to be protected m this matter of wasteful duplication of investment and consequent increased cost of service, then of a surety this commission is estopped from exer - cising any sort of 'regulatory power over public utilities. Surely no sensible citizen would argue that it would be just, sensible, economic or prudent to permit the paralleling of two lines of railroad, or per - mit the construction of competing telephone systems m a community. Indeed, this commission has stringent rules and regulations against tho invasion of one telephone company's territory by another tele - phone company. The-quibble that railroads and telephone companies are "common carriers," while an electric transmission line is not, seems to van to be "splitting a hair infernally fine". Protection of "The rights of all the parties interested and those of the general public" m the language of the statute, seems convincing evidence that it was never the intent of the lawmaking body to thus differentiate.

            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Consents to the proposed transmission line construction by, and agreements with, the owners of existing lines not having been filed with the Commission at the time of filing application, the Commission notified by United States mail all owners of interested and existing lines named by applicant m Exhibit A to appear at a public hearing on October 4th, 1937, at the Commission's Hearing Room m Lincoln. Pursuant to such notice, the application came on for hearing be - fore the Commission, the evidence was adduced and the case taken under advisement. At the time of hearing, applicant had secured agreements or waivers from all interested parties except the Nebraska Continental Telephone Company (2), the Skidee Telephone Company (4), North - western Public Service Co. (14), and lowa-Nebraska Light and Power Company (15). At the hearing by stipulation m the record an agree - ment was entered into between applicant and Nebraska Continental Telephone Company. Northwestern Public Service Company and lowa- Nebraska Light &amp; Power Company appeared at the hearing and either objected to Ihe manner of construction or insisted upon some agree - ment with applicant befors the commencement of construction. These objections will be disposed of if applicant constructs its transmission linos m accordance with Supplement No. 1. of Resolution No. 47, m the Matter of Rules to Regulale the Construction, operation and maintenance of Electric Transmission, Telephone and TelegTaph Lines m the State of Nebraska, made and entered on the Ist day of Feb - ruary, 1936, and which order approved and adopted "Bureau of Stand - ards, Hand Book No. 10". If applicant does not .conform to same m the construction of the proposed transmission lines, then applica - tion may be made by any party to the Commission for relief. Skidee Telephone Company owns and operates rural non metallic telephone lines Irom its exchange at St. L.d wards, m Boone County, which parallel the proposed transmission lines on the opposite side of the highway, a distance of about eight miles. Applicant did not secure the consent of or make any agreement with the Skidee Com - pany. Applicant refuses to enter into any agreement with the Skidee Company which will involve the payment of the cost, or any part thereof, of metallici/.ing the Skidee Telephone lines, or any part thereof. In the instant case, and m other cases, the Commission's Chief Engineer testified, and m other cases heard before the Com - mission, other engineers have testified, that an electric transmission line on the opposite side of the highway from a non metallic telephone line, does not provide sufficient clearance between such transmission line and existing properly .constructed telephone lines, so that the 241 </seg>
            <seg id="p244">THIRTIETH ANNUAL REPORT reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing, non metallic lines will not be interfered with. i From the record m thjs case and our independent knowledge of the subject matter, we are forced to conclude that the construc - tion of the proposed transmission lines will interfere with the reason - able operation and efficiency of the existing telephone lines of the Skidee Telephone Company. By Section S6-313 of 1929 Compiled Statutes, It is provided: "All lines hereafter constructed for the transmission of electric current including telephone and telegraph lines, on the public highways or m other places m this state, except na hereinafter provided, shall provide sufficient clear - ance between such lines 1 and existing properly constructed transmission, telephone ! and telegraph lines so that the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines shall not be interfered with." By Section 86-314, it is provided m part: "Provided, however, that the railway commission shall take into consideration the fact of the prior occupancy or the senior company." Section 86-315, m part, provides: "The State Railway Commission shall have full power and authority to prohibit the construction of any line or lines found to be m violation of the terms of section 1 (86-313) of this act" | For the first time, the question is presented to this Commission of what constitutes a properly constructed telephone line. In this state we have a large number of grounded telephone lines, or those with a single wire with a return through the earth. In fact, nearly all telephone lines owned and operated by farmers us mutual com - panies, are grounded. In a large degree this holds for other small telephone companies, and m a small degree Tor the larger telephone companies. Through these grounded lines, farmers are able to re - ceive telephone service at the minimum cost. These lines are now serving the purpose for which they were intended. We are unable to conclude that a grounded telephone line, otherwise properly construct - ed and maintained, is not properly constructed because it is a ground - ed line. These grounded lines are senior occupants of the highway and when the owner of an electric transmission line, a junior oc - cupant, seeks to occupy the same highway, it should leave the owner 242 </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of a telephone line so that the reasonable operation and efficiency of existing lines will not be interfered with. We know of no way to prevent this obvious result other than to metallif.ize all of the ground - ed line or that part which parallels the transmission lines with the use or coils. Applicant having refused to pay the cost, or any part thereof, of inetalllcizing the grounded lines of the Skidee Telephone Company, we are for the first time called upon to exercise the full power and authority vested m us by Section 86-315 of the 1929 Com - piled Statutes, by denying this application to the extent that the proposed transmission lines parallel the lines of the Skidee Telephone Company. If and when applicant and Skidee Telephone Company enter into an agreement m writing, duly acknowledged and filed with the Commission concerning the proposed construction, then the ap - plication will be granted m whole. We therefore are of the opinion and so find: 1. That the construction of applicant's proposed lines will interfere with the reasonable operation and efficiency of the existing telephone lines of the Skidee Telephone Company. 2. That a grounded telephone line is a properly constructed tele - phone line, if otherwise properly constructed and maintained. 3. That the construction of applicant's proposed lines is m violation of the terms of Section 86-313 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes to the extent that the proposed transmission lines parallel the telephone lines of the Skidee Telephone Company. 4. That the facts present a case where the commission should ex - ercise the full power and authority vested m it to prohibit the con - struction of applicant's proposed lines to the extent that they parallel the telephone lines of the Skidee Telephone Company. 5. That the application should be granted and the Loup River Pub - lic Power District authorized to construct, operate and maintain the proposed electric transmission lines and distribution system m Platte County to the extent that said transmission lines do not parallel the existing telephone lines of the Skidee Telephone Company, m accor - dance with Exhibits A and B attached to it 3 application, m accordance with the laws of Nebraska and the rules and regulations of this Com - mission, and Mibject to the consents.waivers, and agreements now on file, or [stipulated m the record, and that during the time of con - struction applicant shall bear all reasonable expense that may be nec - essary on its own lines and existing properly constructed commun - ication or electric transmission lines to insure the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines, and if after applicant's lines have been constructed and energized the reasonable safety, operation. 243 </seg>
