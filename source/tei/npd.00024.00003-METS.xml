Whatever betide our hearts swell with pride At mention of your great name, And joyfully sing till the echoes ring Of our Nebraska's fame. We hail with acclaim thy glorious name; We love ev'ry inch of thy sod. We shout in our glee when agleam we see The sheen of thy bright goldenrod, We sing in our pride of your rivers wide, Thy boundless resources proclaim; And cheer when we hear the echoes clear Of our Nebraska's fame. The storehouse of earth in thy bounds we build And point all the world to thee. The nations we've filled from thy fields well tilled, And ranges so broad and free. From valley and plain pours the golden grain In fullness that men acclaim, And loudly we sing till the echoes ring Of our Nebraska's fame. Chorus We're singing thy praise through the sunlit days Undimmed shall thy glory stand. Nebraska! Nebraska! The Queen of the West — Our own Nebraska land. —Will M. Maupin </seg>
            <seg id="p003">LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL HONORABLE ASHTON C. SHALLENBERGER, Governor of Nebraska. Sire- In compliance with the provisions of the statutes, I herewith present for your consideration the Twelfth Bien - nial Report of the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics, covering the biennium in part only, from Jan - uary 6, 1909, to December 1, 1910. Very respectfully, WILL ML MAUPIN, Deputy Commissioner. Lincoln, Nebraska, December 1, 1910. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">• </seg>
            <seg id="p005">BUREAU OF LABOB CEJiSUS A&gt;D INDUSTRIAL STATISTICS The Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics was established in 1887, its purpose and function being, as set out in the statutes, to collect, collate and publish statistics and facts relative to the material resources of the state; to examine into the relations between capital and labor; the means of escape from fires; the protection of life and health in factories, workshops and mines; the employment of illegal child labor; the exaction of unlawful hours of labor from any employe; the educa - tional, sanitary, moral and financial condition of laborers and artisans; the cost of food, fuel, clothing and building material; the causes of strikes and lockouts, as well as kindred subjects and matters pertaining to the welfare of industrial interests and classes. Since the establishment of the Bureau there has been added to its manifold duties the enforcement of the fire escape law, the enforcement of the child labor law, the enforcement of a female employment law, the enforcement of a hotel inspection law, and the maintenance of a free employment bureau. And in addition to ail these duties the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics must collect, collate and publish statistics of the manufacturing industries of the state, and collect, collate and publish all the agricultural and live stock statistics of the state. To summarize, the duties of the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics are as follows: To collect, collate and publish the manufacturing statistics of the state To collect, collate and publish the agricultural statistics of the state To inquire into the sanitation of factories and workshops. To inquire into the educational, sanitary, moral and financial con - ditions of laborers and artisans. To inquire into and report on means of protection to life and limb in factories and workshops. To enforce the fire escape laws. To enforce the child labor laws. To enforce the female employment laws. To enforce the hotel inspection laws. To maintain a free employment office, keeping a complete record and set of books. To inquire into the causes of strikes, and lockouts, holding investi - gations and subpoenaing witness as in court procedure. To supply all firms, corporations and parties employing child or female labor with placards setting forth the number of such children </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 BIENNIAL REPORT OF or females employed, their hours of work, etc., and to keep constantly in touch with such parties. To receive from and file reports of child labor permits issued by city and county superintendents of schools. To collect, collate and publish the surplus shipments of products. To collect, collate and publish wage statistics, statistics as to hours of labor, etc. To be even briefer, the deputy commissioner of labor is state statis - tician, state fire escape inspector, state factory inspector, state hotel inspector, state inspector of child and female labor, manager of state free employment bureau, board of investigation and chief of the state's general information bureau. For the accomplishment of all this work the deputy labor commis - sioner is paid an annual salary of $1,500 a year, being $300 a year less than any other deputy state official, and is allowed one stenographer at an annual salary of $840. For the printing of all bulletins, postage, expressage, telephone, witness fees, and traveling expenses, the Bureau is allowed $2,500 a year, or $208 a month. MEEDS OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR After an experience of two years in the management of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics I have no hesitancy in saying that it is idle to expect that one man and a stenographer, no matter how capable they may be, can adequately perform the duties imposed upon the Bureau. To expect two people to collect, collate and publish all the statistics of the state; to carry on the work of hotel and factory in - spection; to enforce the child labor, female labor and fire escape laws, and to answer the thousands of letters of inquiry about Nebraska re - ceived every year — to expect or require this of two people is either a wonderful compliment to the two people in question, or a sad com - mentary upon the judgment of those who impose the burdens. The office force and the appropriation for maintenance would not, even though the force be exceptionally good and the appropriation eco - nomically expended, suffice to adequately carry on the work of any one of three major duties imposed upon the bureau — Hotel Inspection, Fire Escape Inspection, and enforcement of the child and female labor laws. There are upwards of 1,200 hotels in Nebraska, and the law requires that the deputy commissioner of labor shall inspect each one of them every three months; failing, howeer, to provide a dollar for the expense or a force to perform the inspection. Nebraska covers an area of 77,000 square miles, and contains upwards of 200 cities and towns that need constant attention in the matter of fire escapes. One man is exppctec 1 to rttend to tt.u- department in addition to performing the duties of all the other departments. There are upwards of 2,000 manu - facturing and Industrial institutions in Nebraska, employing men, women </seg>
            <seg id="p007">BUREAU OF LABOR 7 and children. One man is expected to inspect these regularly, suggest changes for the safeguarding of life and limb, enforce the labor laws, etc., and all this in addition to performing all the other duties of the office. In short, Nebraska asks one man and a stenographer to perform the same duties that twenty-seven people perform in our sister state of Kansas, and these two people are allowed $2,500 a year for the total expense in contrast with upwards of. $60,000 a year allowed by Kansas. The Kansas Bureau of Agriculture expends yearly more for the single item of postage than is appropriated for the maintenance of the Nebraska Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics. Yet there are those who are impatient because Nebraska is not as well advertised abroad as some other states in the central west. After carrying out the duties imposed upon me to the very t?e«t of my ability, and after careful consideration of the needs of the Bureau, revealed to me by actual experience, I would earnestly recommend the following: That the Hotel and Lodging House Inspection law, save the matter of fire escapes, be put in charge of the Food, Dairy and Drug Commission, that department having the sanitary inspection of such places already in its charge. That the Fire Escape law be given for enforcement to the Fire Com - mission, save as it relates to factories and workshops, that portion to remain with the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics. The growing importance of Nebraska as a manufacturing and industrial state makes imperative that the Labor Department of the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics be given more atten - tion. While Nebraska is, and must always be, dependent to a great measure upon agriculture, yet the fact remains that today there are more people in Nebraska earning a livelihood apart from the farms than there are earning a livelihood upon the farms. With factories springing up on every hand; with wage competition growing fiercer every day; with thousands of children and women engaged in mechanical pursuits; with thousands of boys and men working around and with dangerous machinery — with all these things coming to pass with as - tonishing rapidity, it is high time that Nebraska take that forward step that shall put her in the same class with her sister states that are making adequate provision for the safety of their industrial worker*. I know of no state in the Union that makes less provision for the safety of her industrial workers than Nebraska; no state with as many factory workers that has so few laws safeguarding the life and limb of those workers. With upwards of 30,000 men, women and children working with machinery in factories and shops, Nebraska has no factory in - spectors, no laws for guarding dangerous machinery, no employers' li - ability law, no assumption of risks laws, no indemnity law. If it be not deemed practical at this time to divide the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics into two separate department*, divorcing </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 BIENNIAL REPORT OF the Labor and Industrial Statistical work from the Agricultural Statis - tical work, I would therefore recommend the following provisions for the Bureau as now established Salaries $1,800 for Biennium $ 3,600 Deputy Commissioner, per year 2,400 Assistant, per year 1,200 Male Factory Inspector, per year 1,000 2,000 1,000 " ', 2,000 Female Factory Inspector, per year Stenographer and Librarian, per year 1,000 »,( Total salaries per year $6,000 $12,000 Expenses Traveling expenses, per year , $ 1,500 for Biennium $ 3,000 Printing, postage, office supplies, cuts telephone, telegraph, etc 10,000 " " 20,000 Total expense for year $11,500 $23,000 Total salaries for biennium $12,000 Total miscellaneous expense for biennium 23,000 Total for biennium $35,000 It will be noted here that I have suggested a force of five people, and lest I be accused of extravagant ideas permit me to explain that while I recommend the employment of only five people, for carrying out identically the same work as outlined for the Nebraska Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics, Kansas employs a force of six in her Labor Bureau, and a force of sixteen in. the Agricultural Bureau — twenty-two in Kansas to do the work now expected of two Nebraskans, and which I am quite confident five Nebraskans can perform. I have so much confidence in the natural ability and acquired intelligence of Nebraskans that I am sure five of them can produce results equal to or superior to the results obtained in other states with, twice or three times the number. It will be noted, too, that I recommend a total expense appropriation of $35,000 for the biennium. But bear in mind all the while that this is for a Bureau that is doing the work of two bureaus in our sister state on the south, and is actually less than one-half the amount expended for similar work in the aforesaid southern sister. Postage and printing are two items of expense not borne by the departments in Kansas, that expense being provided from a general executive fund. As a matter of fact, the $35,000 per biennium I recommend for the Nebraska Bureau Of Labor and Industrial Statistics is less than one-half the amount appropriated by Kansas for similar work, and my recommendation carries with it the items of postage and printing — items not found in the Kansas appropriations for the two Bureaus. The plan of organization recommended will provide the following: </seg>
            <seg id="p009">BUREAU OF LABOR 9 One deputy commissioner to have general charge and direction of the work, subject to the immediate control of the governor. One assistant, who will officiate as chief clerk and statistician, collating and tabulating all statistics and generally assisting the deputy commissioner in preparing for publication the bulletins and reports of the Bureau. One male factory inspector, who will also give attention to enforce - ing fire escape laws; have supervision of boiler rooms and heating plants of state institutions, and aid in gathering factory and manufacturing statistics, accident statistics, etc. One female factory inspector, who will devote her attention to en - forcing the laws governing the employment of women and children in factories and other places where women and children are employed, and aid in gathering factory and manufacturing statistics, accident sta - tistics, etc. One stenographer, who will also act as librarian and mailing clerk. With this force and this appropriation Nebraska would be able not only to gather and circulate these important statistics, but could enter the field of publicity and advertise the manifold resources and possibil - ities of the state to the world. That Nebraska has been derelict in her duty to herself by not advertising more extensively, and keeping pace with the efforts of her sister states along similar lines, is admitted by all who have investigated the facts. If I have erred at all in my recom - mendations I believe it is in asking too little instead of too much. Ne - braska could well afford to spend $25,000 a year for the next ten years in the one item of publicity. And the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics is, because of its duties, the department that should hare charge of this publicity work. FREE EMPLOYMENT BUREAU Reference has been made to the fact that the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics is charged with the duty of maintaining a free employment bureau. No provision is made for the expense, however, nor has any such provision ever been made. I would recommend the establishment of a branch employment office in Omaha, the chief in - dustrial center of the state, to be in charge of the male factory in - spector. The expense of maintaining this branch office could, and should, be paid from a license fee required of all employment agencies, such private employment agencies to be regulated by severe laws such as obtain in Illinois and New York. All fines for violation of the em - ployment agency laws should, if constitutionally possible, be paid to the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics for the benefit of the state's free employment agency. The employment agency evil as conducted in our large cities is enormous and growing. Thousands of dollars are filched from the </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 BIENNIAL REPORT OF poor men and Women seekfhg employment, and often they are sent hun - dreds of miles only to find they have been deceived and abandoned. The state owes the fullest measure of protection to those who are too often the victim of unscrupulous men and women, and this protection can be afforded without much cost to the state under such a system as I have here outlined. During the biennium 1909-10 the state free employment office has been compelled to confine its efforts to the supplying of farm help. Applications have been received from 1,276 farmers in need of help, and from 977 applicants for positions. It has been impossible to keep ac - curate count of the positions filled, but several hundred letters from farmers bear witness to the fact that if properly equipped the bureau would be of inestimable service to the farmers on the one side and the jobless of the cities on the other. The state could engage in no better service to its citizens than to maintain a free employment bureau in Lincoln and Omaha all the year around, with temporary branch offices in three or four other cities during the spring months. FIRE ESCAPES The legislature of 1909 repealed the old fire escape law which provided that notice to erect fire escapes should be issued by the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics, and enacted a law providing for the erection without notice of fire escapes upon certain classes of buildings three or more stories in height within six months after the passage and approval of the law. This new law went into effect in September, 1909. Its effects were at once manifest. People who had persistently and consistently ignored the old law immediately got busy and began the erection of escapes. A number, however, who had been repeatedly notified under the old law without avail, also neglected to take cognizance of the new law. In October, 1909, the department began suit against a number of people in Lincoln. Thirty -one arrests were made and preparations made for a vigorous prosecution. In every instance the parties complained of agreed to comply with the law at once and pay all accrued costs, providing the cases against them were dismissed. It being the purpose of the department to secure fire escapes rather than to have delinquents fined, the department agreed to continue all cases for thirty days, and then dismiss at the cost of the defendants if the escapes were erected in conformity with law. With three or four exceptions every defendant had complied with the law at the end of that time, and the delinquents made showing that their failure was due to the inability of the contractors to get to the work. Another continuance of thirty days was allowed, and at the end of that time the escapes were all in place and approved. But one prosecution was pushed to a conclusion. This was the case against C. Rosso of </seg>
            <seg id="p011">BUREAU OF LABOR 11 Omaha, who was given the favor of several notices but studiously ignored them. Mr. Rosso was arrested and entered a plea of guilty. By agree - ment he was fined $25 and costs in the county court of Douglas county, with the understanding that the escape required should be erected at once under penalty of a prosecution to the utmost limit of the law. Mr. Rosso immediately set about complying with the law. FEMALE LABOR LAW Three prosecutions for violation of the female labor law were insti - tuted by the department, all for employing women more than ten hours a day. In all three cases the suits were dismissed at the costs of the defendants and upon stipulation that the violations of the law should cease. This was a virtual plea of guilty on the part of each defendant. The purpose of the department was well served by this disposition of the cases, it making evident that the department was watching closely and ready to punish all violators. Xo reputable merchant can afford to suffer from such derogatory advertising as would result from a prosecu - tion for over-working women, and knowing that the department waa keeping careful watch, as evidenced by the arrests mentioned, the law has been more than usually well observed. The department now has two prosecutions under way, the defend - ants being charged with working females after 10 o'clock p.m. The defendants claim this is not an infraction of the law, and there is reason to believe that the cases will be carried to the supreme court for final adjudication. This is to be desired, as it will finally settle a disputed interpretation of the law. CHILD LABOR LAW Every effort has been put forth by the department to enforce the provisions of the child labor law, but the lack of adequate means and the impossibility of securing the services of inspectors, has made it impossible to cover the field. Had it not been for the volunteer services of two or three interested parties, and the co-operation of the truant officers of Omaha, South Omaha and Lincoln, the department could not have accomplished anything in the line of enforcing this beneficent law. But enough was done to convince employers that every violation coming to the knowledge of the department would be vigor - ously prosecuted, and this resulted beneficially. Three prosecutions were begun in Omaha, but owing to techni - calities raised for the defendants by the judge upon the bench, the cases were dismissed. Profiting by this experience the deputy commissioner refused to bring further prosecution before the police judge of Omaha. One prosecution before a justice resulted in the imposing of the minimum fine. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 BIENNIAL REPORT OF The deputy commissioner desires to pay a deserved tribute to Mrs. Draper Smith of Omaha, who, as volunteer inspector for the de - partment, has rendered valuable assistance in the enforcing of the child labor law. If more women situated similarly to Mrs. Smith would show the same interest in the welfare of the children, there would be very little ehild labor in Nebraska in violation of the law. And until the state realizes the importance of enforcing this law and provides this department with sufficient means and help, it must depend largely upon women like Mrs. Draper Smith to keep the law from being wholly ignored and prevent the evils of child labor from securing a foothold in Ne - braska. HOTEL INSPECTION LAW The legislature of 1909 enacted a law providing for the inspection of hotels, boarding houses and lodging houses, making it the duty of the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics to perform the work of inspection. Under this law it is the duty of the department to inspect at least once every three months every hotel, boarding house and lodging house in the state, seeing that the plumbing is in good shape, the bed clothing aired and fumigated every quarter, proper fire escapes erected and all bed linen of the required size and changed for each succeeding guest. Absolutely no provision ' was made for defraying the expenses of this inspection, the deputy commissioner being expected to do it all alone and pay the expense out of the $2,500 appropriated for all pur - poses. There are over 3,000 places in Nebraska subject to inspection as above provided. The deputy commissioner, to perform the duties imposed upon him, would have to inspect an average of 10 places a day, travel of 3,000 miles a month and expend over $800 for railroad fare and over $900 for other expenses. This would consume all of the deputy commissioner's time, working twenty-four hours a day, and take four - flfths of the total amount appropriated for all expenses of the depart - ment. It would require the services of not less than three inspectors and an appropriation of not less than $10,000 a year to carry out the work of inspection required by law. The department, however, went at the gigantic task as best it could. The several organizations of commercial travelers co-operated heartily, and at their suggestion R. D. McFadden of Hastings was appointed chief deputy Inspector without pay. He appointed eighteen deputies from among the membership of the several organization, all of whom served without pay. All hotels were supplied with copies of the law, and every complaint was followed up. The mere presence of the law upon the statute books had a salutory effect, and hotels as a rule made every effort to comply. No prosecutions have been had under the law, but a threat to prosecute has in several instances resulted in sudden compli- </seg>
            <seg id="p013">BUREAU OF LABOR 13 ance with the law. That the law is ignored in hundreds of instances is beyond question. But as now situated the department is absolutely helpless. LOCATION OF THE BlREAl The present deputy commissioner desires to reiterate the recom - mendation of his predecessor, John J. Ryder, to the effect that the Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics should be allowed to move from the state house and occupy offices in the business section of the city. The department occupies two rooms that must be used by commit - tees during every session of the legislature. This means that every two years the department must be crowded into some other depart - ment's rooms, the records stored, and work practically stopped for from four to five months. The crowded condition of the state house precludes the possibility of giving the department permanent quarters suited to its needs. What the department needs is adequate room for its constantly enlarging library of priceless statistics, and for an adequate and per - manent display of Nebraska products. It should also have in a place easy of access to the general public an office for the free employment department. By providing for adequate quarters down town the servic - ability of the department would be greatly increased, and the pressure upon the state bouse relieved to a considerable extent. An appropriation of $600 or $700 a year would provide suitable quarters. A&gt; INTERESTING CORRESPONDEM K Omaha, Neb., October 15, 1909. Mr. Will M. Maupin, Deputy Labor Commissioner, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: — I received the report of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics and have looked it over with interest There is much information in it that is of value, but I wish it went into greater detail and gave the value of the different products of the state about which it treats. A short time ago I was in Cleveland and coming down from my room to the office in the Hollenden Hotel, I saw another Nebraskan who was with me in Cleveland sitting by the side of an old gentleman who recognized me and I saw that he was looking at my companion in an incredulous way as he might look at a champion liar. My Nebraska friend said, "Suppose you ask General Manderson to give you his estimate of the value of the products of Nebraska?" I said: "I have seen it stated lately that the products of Nebraska resulting from agri - culture and labor are valued at $400,000,000 annually and I do not be- </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 BIENNIAL REPORT OF neve, from what I know of the state, that this is an over estimate. The state had a million and seventy thousand people by the census of 1890 and I think the census of 1910 may show it to have a million and two hundred and fifty thousand, so you see the product stated means that there is a production of the value of three or four hundred dollars for every man, woman and child in the state." The Ohio man seemed utterly astounded for, like many other people in the East, he had always looked upon Nebraska as a barren waste. I think it would be of great value to the state if you would take all products, whether of labor in manufacture, or the result of labor in cultivation, and give an estimate of the value so that it might be given to the world. Figures of bushels, of acres and of the number of live stock of all sorts do not carry information that is of great value to the average mind, but when you put it in dollars it appeals to everybody. For my gratification, and, indeed for my use, where I think it will do the state much good, I wish you would make an estimate for me of the value of Nebraska's products in all lines. With the information that you have you could approximate very nearly to the actual value. I shall be glad to hear from you at your early convenience and will, of course, see that you and your office get the credit that is fairly due for the material furnished. Truly yours. CHARLES F. MANDERSON. Lincoln, Neb., October 18, 1909. Hon. Charles F. Manderson, Omaha, Neb. My Dear Mr. Manderson: — Your favor of October 15 at hand, and I hasten to make reply. Knowing your intense loyalty to Nebraska, and your opportunities for making known the wonderful resources of this state, I deem it a privilege to give you any information within my power. And knowing, too, your influence, I seize this opportunity to call to your attention a few things about this department, hoping to enlist your support to the end that the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics will be so equipped that it may, in future, do something really worth while in the matter of making Nebraska's resources and oppor - tunities known of all men. Before going into the details you request, let me give you some idea of the handicaps under which this department labors: It is really the only public service bureau in the state, and is the only advertising bureau the state has. The entire force consists of my - self and one stenographer, who also acts as statistician, librarian and assistant There are twenty-one distinct . duties devolving upon the de - partment, including fire escape inspection, hotel inspection, enforcement of child labor law, female employment law, free employment agency law, inspection of public buildings, co-operation in the enforcement of the Juvenile court and truancy laws and the law relating to the investiga - tion of industrial disputes. In addition it must collect, collate and </seg>
            <seg id="p015">BUREAU OF LABOR 15 publish acre, crop and live stock statistics, labor statistics, manufactur - ing statistics and city, chattel and real estate mortgage statistics. We are required to issue periodically bulletins of crop and manufacturing statistics, manufacturing statistics, mortgage statistics, etc., and reports of hotel, fire escape, factory and public building inspection. Apart from salaries — $1,500 a year for myself and $840 for my assistant — we have the magnificent sum of $2,500 a year to every expense, consist - ing of printing, postage, express, freight, telephone, telegraph and travel - ing expenses. It costs us an average of $200 for each bulletin we issue, postage included, and we issue from six to ten every. This, my dear sir, may serve to give you some idea of the fearful handicaps we are laboring under in our efforts to properly advertise Nebraska's wond - erful resources to the world. We cannot employ help to assist us in get - ting these statictics, and there is a limit to the physical and menial re - sources of both myself and my assistant. The work we are trying to do with two people and $2,500.00 a year is being attended to in Kansas by something like twenty-six people who have between $50,000.00 and $60,000.00 a year at their command. Yet there are those who fail to understand why Kansas is advertised the world over while Nebraska too often meets with incredulous ones like the Cleveland gentleman you mention, men who refuse to believe us when we tell them the truth about Nebraska. This bureau should have at least six or seven people working all the time. It should have at least $12,000.00 a year for expense apart from salaries, and $16,000.00 could be spent to splendid advantage. I have gone to some length in this explanation in the hope that you will lend us the weight of your influence at the proper time to secure from the legislature a proper recognition of this very important department of the state. Its duties are too numerous, its equipment too inadequate. Its possibilities for good to Nebraska are unbounded. And now to a hasty, though truthful, exposition of Nebraska's productivity, agricultural and mechanical. Because the crop figures for 1909 are not yet complete, I am taking the figures of 1908. The totals for 1909 will be of even greater ad - vantage because of the increased yield and advanced prices.

An average corn crop in Nebraska would fill enough standard freight cars to make a train reaching from Denver to Chicago, 1,040 miles, with 172 miles of corn-filled cars to ornament the side tracks. 1909 wheat crop of Nebraska would fill enough Burlington cars to make a solid freight train reaching from McCook to Omaha, with a few cars left over to ornament side tracks. If the total grain and hay production of Nebraska should be loaded into standard freight cars, the cars would make a train long enough to reach from Omaha to San Francisco, with a few hundred miles of cars left over for good measure. My dear Mr. Mandeison, it is not to be wondered at that the people of other states refuse to believe us when we tell them of the great resources of Nebraska. No need to stretch the truth in order to make &amp; good impression. On the contrary, the truth is so great that we will always have difficulty in making people believe it, and the only way to prove our contentions is to bring people to Nebraska and let them see for themselves. I have endeavored to give you a brief resume of Nebraska's pro - ductivity. At some future time. If you so desire, I would be glad to write you concerning the future possibilities of Nebraska.

Yours very truly, GOOD ROADS (Address Delivered by Robert J. Clancey at Good Roads Convention.) The public highways of this country, when compared with other arteries of commerce, assume at once almost the aspect of a commercial tragedy. WILL M. MAUPIN </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 BIENNIAL REPORT OF Indeed were it not for the utilization of electricity, steam and steel, which economically affords to the American producer the whole world for a market, he might well calculate the boundary of his commercial zone within a radius of fifty miles. While no branch of the transportation is of greater influence than wagon transportation, it may be truthfully said, I believe, that in respect to the economic solution of this problem it is alone distinguished for lack of progression. Wagon transportation is of primary importance because of its essentiality in transporting the products of the farm to the railroad station. It is the medium through which practically all the great com - merce of a great country makes its initial transit. In length of haul between the producer and consumer it constitutes but an infinitesimal part of the distance while the relative cost on either a mileage or tonage basis is many times greater. The importance of wagon transportation intensifies as you consider it from the standpoint of time, volume and cost. The average haul on foodstuffs in the United States is 8 1-10 miles and the ton-mile cost is approximately 28 cents. A normal crop of barley, corn, oats and wheat constitutes more than 26,000,000 average wagon loads and consumes 17,300,000 working days in moving it to market. It costs the farmers of the United States to move their crop of wheat, oats, corn, and barley from the farm to the railroad station $61,000,000.00. In other Words it costs the farmers of the United States $61,000,000.00 to move these four cereals a distance of 8 1-10 miles. Nothing, to my mind, more severely impeaches the existing road conditions than these figures and nothing can appeal more earnestly or more eloquently for relief. These figures are so widely disproportionate in cost when compared with the cost of rail transportation as to at once challenge the best thought of the studentry of economics for satisfactory solution. The seat of the trouble is in lack of system. There is in road building and improvement no well defined plan. Our road laws are heterogenous, and our plan of construction imperfect. In the last decade upwards of $850,000,000.00 have been taken from the people and expended on public road improvement and the roads are no better now than ten years ago, and are practically in the same condition they were half a century ago. The state of Pennsylvania very early undertook the construction of good roads and before the advent of the railroad had constructed more than 2,300 miles of good roads at a cost of $8,500,000. In the early history of this country the federal government and the states constructed what was known as the National Turnpike, a road from Cumberland, Md., to Vandalia, 111. On the improved roads of Pennsylvania the wagon-load was raised from 3,000 to 6,500 pounds, equivalent to a reduction in the cost of wagon haul of 116 per cent. This ratio of saving spread over the whole farm commerce of the United States would mean an annual </seg>
            <seg id="p019">BUREAU OF LABOR 19 saving to the producers of this country of more than $150,000,000, justi - fying an annual expenditure for road construction of $2,500,000,000. New methods must be employed. A uniform system, adjusted to varying conditions, must be adopted. Road and drainage laws, now bewilderingly conglomerate, should be effectuated by intelligent re - vision. Following section lines through marshes and over mountains may simplify geography, but it has and does exact a terrific tribute from commerce. The whole system of road construction should be under the di - rect supervision of the states and federal government. There should be national and state highway commissions. Wards of the state, penal or otherwise, capable of physical endurance, should be Impressed into good road construction. To reduce the cost of wagon transportation the farmer must in - crease the load tonnage. Two things are necessary for this, reduction of gradients and hard-surfacing of roadbeds. And roads should be built as well for the future as for the present. This is an age of pro - gress and it is well to anticipate the scope of invention, or at least keep step with inventive genius. It requires no violent indulgence of prophetic vision to encompass the possibilities of mechanical endeavor. It is apparent to me that just so sure as animal power has been supplant - ed on the rail by gasoline, electricity and steam, just so sure will it be supplanted on the wagon road by this same power. One cannot see the farmer thrash his grain and plow his land with steam, convey his family to town with gasoline, and ride on an electric car from the depot to his hotel, without broadening into the conclusion that some day he will employ this same power to move his crops from the farm to the railroad station. One cannot see a vehicle propelled by this power, easily conveying a load several time its own weight, without concluding that the time is near at hand When the farmer can move a ton and a half of wheat to market without having to move a ton and a half of horseflesh and a ton of wagon material. Governmental experimentation has proven conclusively that a hard - surface road, capable of sustaining ordinary traffic, can be constructed for about $1,400.00 a mile. There is not a mile of road outside the improved highways of Pennsylvania and New England, with few other exceptions, whose improvement at such a cost per mile would not in the net result assume an economic aspect. Funds for this purpose could easily and reasonably be obtained by the issuance and sale of bonds, augmented by a general poll and property tax, such as is levied now, thereby minimizing the burden by distributing it through a bond issue over a period of years. The question is not, "Can you afford to do it?" but, "Can you afford not to do it?" When you consider the enormous volume of wagon, com - merce; when you consider that wagon transportation which should con - sume less than 2 per cent of your crops now consume 5 per cent; when you consider that by constructiong good roads you may even </seg>

            <seg id="p022">YESTERDAY AND TODAY Born of the Kansas-Nebraska free soil struggles, Nebraska was ad - mitted into the Union on March 1, 1867. On the date of its admission to the Union Nebraska had less than 100,000 inhabitants, and was designated upon the maps of that time as "The Great American Desert" Today Nebraska has 1,250,000 inhabitants, and "The Great American Des - ert" no longer exists save in tradition. At the beginning of the Civil war the Territory of Nebraska had fewer than 25,000 inhabitants, and these were confined to a narrow strip of country bordering upon the Missouri river. With the close of the war came the great westward movement, and soon the tide of Homeseekers, urged on and lured still further westward by the Homestead Act, surged over the so-called desert To a Nebraskan, "Uncle Dan" Freeman, of Gage county, goes the honor of taking up the first Homestead under that famous act, and his patent bears the magic "No. 1." Within a decade after the close of the Civil War thousands of Home - steads had been taken up, many of them in the very heart of the "desert," and the work of building a great state was well under way. Then followed all of the hardships of the pioneers — with many new ones never before known. First came the great grasshopper plague of the '70's, and this was followed by drouth. But Nebraska was settled by the same men who had followed Grant, and Thomas and Sheridan and Sherman, and they were not to be dismayed by such things as grasehoopers, drouths and Indians. The faith of those early settlers has been since vindicated a thousand times, for today Nebraska knows no superior as an agricultural state, and what was once known as "The Great American Desert" blooms and blossoms as once did the Garden of Eden. In the short space of forty-ttiree years there has been builded within the confines of Nebraska an agricultural empire that is at once the wonder and the admiration of the world. One hundred and sixty thousand farms; four thousand In - dustrial plants; 6.060 miles of railroad; the third largest packing center in the world; the second largest smelter in the world; the largest per - manent school fund of any state in the union; the seventh largest state university — these are some of the things possessed by a state that is only forty-three years old. The total agricultural, live stock, poultry and dairy products of Nebraska in 1909, If loaded into standard freight cars would have made a train more than 10,000 miles long, and the total value of Nebraska's productions in 1909, agricultural and manufactured — exceeded $640,000, - 000. The total taxable wealth of the state today Is two and one-half billions. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">BUREAU OF LABOR 23 At the very beginning Nebraska made adequate provision for the education of her children. Immense tracts of land were set aside for school purposes, and much of this land can never be alienated. But hundreds of thousands of acres have been sold and the money placed in the permanent school fund. This fund cannot be depleted; if losses occur by reason of mistaken investment of the fund, or dishonesty of officials, the loss must be made good from the state general fund. This permanent school fund today approximates $8,500,000, invested in interest baaring securities. School land worth nearly J30.000.000 is still held by the state. Much of this is leased and the lease money yearly added to the money available for educational purposes. The wisdom of thus providing liberally for education is evidenced by the fact that Nebraska has the smallest percentage of illiteracy of any state in the union. The University of Nebraska has an enrollment of 3,200 students. There are nearly 7,000 public school buildings in the state, employing 10,200 teachers, with a total enrollment of 375,000 pupils. The school district property is valued at $13,000,000. The total expenditures for school purposes in 1909 was $5,759,000, and an average of $30.91 per pupil, based on average daily attendance, was expended. In 1909 the average yield of wheat per acre for the United States wa« 15.8 bushels; the Nebraska average was 20.1 bushels. The 1909 average yield of corn per acre for the United States was 25.5 bushels; the Ne - braska average was 25.7. Oats, general average, 30.3; the Nebraska average was 29.3. Rye, general average, 16.1; Nebraska average 17.4. Hay, general average, 1.42 tons per acre; Nebraska average 2:23 tons per acre. To the homeseeker Nebraska today offers unparalled opportunities. Fertile farm lands in the west-central and northwestern parts of the state may be secured for from $20 to $40 an acre, on the most liberal terms of payment. This land will raise wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, potatoes, alfalfa and sugar beets, with an average yield far greater than the average yield of the^entire United States. A farm in the corn 7. belt — and Nebraska is th^r buckle on that belt — Is a potential fortune. The opportunities for manufacturing are equal to the opportunities for farming. Flouring mills, planing mills, cereal mills, tanneries, shoe factories, automobile factories, cracker factories — all through the list of manufacturing industries, Nebraska offers them all the greatest possible inducement. Dairying in Nebraska is developing at a wonderful rate. Already this state has the largest creamery in the world, and Omaha, the metropolis of the state, is the largest butter market in America, Forty millions of dollars' worth of dairy products is Nebraska's record for tThe poultry industry is keeping pace with the dairying industry. 1909 the egg crop of Nebraska was worth more than the output of Id and silver from any single state of the union, and the total value ol </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 BIENNIAL REPORT OF Nebraska's 1909 output of butter, cheeee, eggs and poultry was worth more than all the gold and silver mined in the United States, including Alaska. Yet the diary and poultry industries are yet in their infancy. Ten years ago there were a few isolated creameries in the state, to which the farmers hauled their milk. Today there are more than 36,000 hand separators in operation, and the farmer hauls the butterfat bo central stations and feeds the skim milk to hogs and calves. The huge cattle range is rapidly disappearing before the tiller of the soil, and the huge herds are giving way to the small feed lots and the dairy herd. The story of Nebraska's prosperity is told in the figures represent - ing the bank deposits. On April 1, 1910, the total bank deposits of the state were $190,000,000 in round numbers, an average of more than $150 per capita. "Back to the land!" is the cry of a land-hungry people. They should study. what Nebraska has to offer them. A fertile soil, a climate unsurpassed by that of any other agricultural section, superior educa - tional facilities, and a hospitality as unbounded as the broad fields and prairies — these are some of the attractions Nebraska holds out to the men and women who yearn for homes and contact with the soil. The Nebraska Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics will be glad to convey all possible information to those who desire statistical information concerning Nebraska's resources. NEBRASKA Some Facts About the State That Nebraska™ Should Scatter Broadcast Over the World Here are some concrete facts about Nebraska that should made known to all men: The extreme length of Nebraska east and west, is 415 miles; the extreme breadth, north and south is 205 miles. The gross area of Nebraska in square miles is 77,510. The gross acreage is 49,606,400. The cultivated acreage in 1909 was approximately 16,000,000 acres, or less than one-third the total area of the state. On this 16,000,000 acres there was produced in 1909 the following crops: Corn, 169,179,137 bushels; market value $98,123,871. Wheat, 50,313,600 bushels; market value $45,642,234. Oats, 59,653,479 bushels; market value $23,861,389. Barley, 2,820,632 bushels; market value $1,269,277. Rye, 1,227,332 bushels; market value $786,399. Alfalfa, 1,971.770 tons; market value $17,745,930. Tame hay, 2,647,839 tons; market value $21,182,712. Potatoes, 7,386,497 bushels; market value $5,909,202.

From these pastures and grain fields Nebraska produced and shipped to market 1,118,518 beef cattle; 2,807,502 hogs; 76,274 horses and mules, and 554,505 sheep. The total value of the surplus shipments of live stock exceeded $120,000,000. The total products of Nebraska in 1909 — agricultural, live stock, dairying, manufacturing, etc., exceed $640,000,000 — an average of approxi - mately $600 for each man, woman and child. No other state in the Union made such a showing. Dairy farming in Nebraska is in its infancy, yet Nebraska is today one of the leading producers of dairy products, and is forging ahead by leaps and bounds. The inducements offered to dairy farmers by Ne - braska are beyond computation. Taking into consideration fertility of soil, healthfulness of climate, access to market and surrounding creature comforts and advantages, and in Nebraska, improved and unimproved, is to be had more cheaply and on better terms than anywhere else in the republic. Fifteen million acres of fertile land await the activity of husbandmen. Nebraska with a population of less than a million and a half produces more than is &gt;roduced and purchased by Japan, a nation of 35,000,000 people. b Nebraska offers greater inducements to homeseekers than any other ite in the Union — greater than any other similar area in the whole de world. Japan, with forty millions of people, enjoys a trade and commerce amounting to about $400,000,000 a year. This includes what Japan sells o other nations as well as what Japan buys from other nations. In 909 Nebraska raised from her soil and produced manufatured articles rom Nebraska raw products, the enormous total of $650,000,000. With 3 per cent of Japan's population, therefore, Nebraska produced and added to the wealth of the world 63 per cent more than Japan pro - duced and purchased from other nations. The total volume of Japan's production and purchase was little more than half of what the single state of Nebraska raised from the soil and sold direct, or converted into manufactured articles in her own factories. There are fewer than six states that produce more food products han they consume, and Nebraska is one the six. Upon these five or six states nations depend for their food supplies. Yet, with all of this remarkable record less than one-third of the tillable land of Nebraska 8 under cultivation. Millions of acres of the richest soil in the world ie within the confines of Nebraska and have never been touched by the </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 BIENNIAL REPORT OF plow. Other millions of acres with desultory cultivation have produced in an abundance that has been the marvel of the agricultural world. Why go into the desolate and frigid regions of the far northwest to undergo the hardships of pioneers, far removed from railway facilities, and then be able to secure only wheat lands, when Nebraska, with six thousand miles of railroad and a splendid live stock and grain market within her borders, offers without hardship and at a reasonable price land that will not only produce wheat far excelling the averge, but will produce in abundance every other crop that grows in the temperate zone. Nebraska wheat lands will produce vastly more wheat to the acre than the wheat lands of the Candadian northwest, and in addition will grow richer every year by the proper rotation of crops and produce abundantly of corn, oats, rye, barley, alfalfa, speltz, broom corn, and sugar beets. Nebraska's crop averages are to the highest of any state in the union. Compared with productivity, nearness to market, railroad facilities and everything else that goes to make life worth living, Ne - braska farm lands are selling at a lower price than tillable land is selling anywhere else on the North Amercian continent. The possibilities of Nebraska's soil are beyond estimate. Already it produces more corn to the acre than any other state, and more wheat to the acre than any other state. Intensive cultivation will add im - measureably to the yield. Eighty acres of corn land in Nebraska are not only more profitable than five times that many acres of wheat land in Manitoba or Alberta, but easier cultivated and surrounded by an Infinitely greater number of the comforts of life. And, too, the eighty acres of Nebraska corn land are no harder to secure than the two or three hundred acres of wheat land in chilly Canada. • Nebraska has room and a welcome for thousands of homeseekers. It has fertile lands that are cheap only in price awaiting the energy of the industrious homeseeker. If you want to locate in a state upon land that will produce more of everything than land in any other state; if you want to locate in a state blessed by superior educational facilities; if you want to locate in a state where the energy of the husbandman is rewarded bountifully; if you want to locate in a state where ambition may find its full fruition; if you want to locate in a state where the climate is superb and the death rate the smallest of any state in the union; if you want to locate in a state where you can begin with practically nothing and build a comfortable fortune upon the yield of the soil — if you want to locate in such a state as this, come to Nebraska. There is only one trouble about properly advertising the glories of this great young state — the truth reads so like fiction that is it difficult to make the world believe. But the facts and the figures are at hand to prove every claim advanced for Nebraska. The Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics will be glad to submit them to you.

Nebraska was admitted in to the Union on March 1, 1867.

Today Nebraska has 1,250.000 inhabitants, the Great American Desert" is a fast fading memory, and nowhere in all tie world is presented such a spectacle of prosperity and development as that presented by the giant young state carved out of the heart of the "desert."

The total agricultural, dairy and industrial product of Nebraska in 909 were worth $650,000,000. If loaded into standard freight cars the roducts of Nebraska in 1909 would make a freight train over 10,000 miles long. No one state or territory in the' Union produced in 1909 nough gold and silver to buy the butter that was made in Nebraska in the same year. No one state or territory in the Union in 1909 produced nough gold to buy the egg crop of Nebraska in the same year. The total gold and silver output of the nation in 1909 would scarcely pay or the butter, egg and poultry output of Nebraska in the same year. The total tobacco crop of the nation in 1909 lacked $22,000,000 of being worth as much as Nebraska's 1909 corn crop. Nebraska's 1909 crop of corn, wheat, oats and hay was worth $32, - 000,000 more than Pennsylvania's 1909 crop of anthracite coal. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 BIENNIAL REPORT OF The nation's output of crude petroleum in 1909 was worth $97,000,000, Nebraska's 1909 corn crop was worth a million dollars more. Fifteen years ago dairying was practically unknown in Nebraska. A few little creameries were scattered here and there, but they afforded no inducements to the farmers to engage in the dairying industry. With the development of modern methods Nebraska steps into the front rank of dairying states. In 1909 there were over 32,500 hand separators in Nebraska, separating the milk from 540,000 milch cows. From the cream thus separated was manufactured upwards of 50,000,000 pounds of the finest butter in the world. Nebraska is the greatest alfalfa field in the world. To the homeseeker Nebraska offers unparalleled advantages and opportunities. Fertile farm lands in the west-central and northwestern and western parts of the state may be bought for from $20 to $50 an acre, on the most liberal terms of payment. Land in the older settled parts of the state sells from more, of course, but it is a bargain at any price. This land will raise corn, wheat, oats, rye, barley, alfalfa, potatoes, sugar beets — or any other crop that can be raised in the temperate zone — and produce an average yield greater than the av - erage yield of the United States. Nebraska waits with a welcome for all who come to her to make home within her borders. The best gifts that any state can bestow she waits to bestow upon those who come to her — the finest climate in the world, the most fertile soil in the world, the finest school system in the world, the most prosperous and the happiest people in the world to associate with, a future that is as unbounded as space, and possibilities that the mind of finite man cannot measure.

Talk about Jack and his wonderful beanstalk — I hung my hat on a cornstalk while I rested for a few minutes in its shade, and when I woke up I had to go to the house and get an a* to cut the stalk down. It had grown so fast I couldn't reach my hat. When the stalk fell it made such a dent in the ground I had to brigde it over to get to the other side of the field.

If one baby should sleep on the floor close to the soil more than the other one it would grow twice as fast. When we stand still we must take care to keep both feet on the ground. If we didn't the one on the ground would grow so much faster it would bother us in walking. One railroad was enabled to declare extra dividends last year on the saving made in railroad spikes. It sowed shinglenails along the right of way in the fall and they grew into spikes in time for the spring track repairing. I'd give anything if we could raise pumpkins on our farm, but we can't. The vines grow so fast they wear the pumkins out dragging them over the ground. Early in June I cuj 90 tons of alfalfa from my 20-acre patch and then turned in a drove of hogs. When I got ready to market the hogs I had to get my neighbors to help me find them; the alfalfa grew so fast it hid the hogs completely. They'd gained 150 pounds apiece without an ear of corn, and I got $7.60 for them in South Omaha. Cut my wheat last week. Had sixty acres and the yield was so heavy I had to rent twelve acres extra from a neighbor in order to - have ground space on which to stack the straw. We are awfully busy out here, and we have to conserve every energy. One of my neighbors has crossed lightningbugs with his bees, and now he has honey in the making twenty-four hours a day. We get so much for our butterfat at the collecting stations that we've found it necessary to cross the milk - weed with the strawberry vine in order to have strawberries and cream on our table. I was shelling old corn last week and the engine broke down. I was in a hurry to get the job done, .and while the man was putting a new water guage on the traction engine I jacked up the rear truck of my automobile, threw the belt over one wheel and shelled 1,700 bushels of corn. Wife swings the baby in a hammock swung be - tween a couple of young trees in the back yard. We have to equip the hammock with a rope and tackle, because the trees and the baby grow so fast If we didn't we could not reach high enough to touch the ham - mock, and if we could the baby would be too heavy to handle with ease. Last week I was raking down a radish bed in the garden with a rake that had four broken teeth. Wife called me to the house for something and I stuck the handle of the rake into the ground before I went to the house. When I went back a half-hour later the rake had grown four new teeth and I had to trim the limbs off the handle before I could use it. This is the greatest growing country you ever saw, and the sooner you pry yourself loose from those stony fields of yours and get out here, the better off you will be." LAND VALUES IN NEBRASKA There is the old, old story of the man who once remarked that he remembered the time when he could have bought one-half the state </seg>
            <seg id="p031">BUREAU OF LABOR 31 of Texas for a pair of boots. "Why didn't you buy it?" asked a friend. "I didn't have the boots," was the reply. Instances of this kind could be multiplied by the hundred in Ne - raska. But there are also an equal number of instances where the man did have the "boots." Nebraska is a young state compared with many of her sister states. The man who laid out the town site of Lincoln is still a resident of the city, hale and hearty. Hundreds of men who homesteaded within a hundred miles of the Missouri river still live upon their original homesteads, and these homesteands have risen in value from practically nothing to 1100 to $150 an acre. In - stances of farms between the Missouri river and the second guide meridian, west, selling for $100 an acre and upwards have become so common as to no longer attract attention. Land in the western part of the state that was unmarketable ten and fifteen years ago is now selling at from $25 to $60 an acre. Four years ago a farmer in an eastern Nebraska county sold his 90-acre farm for $10,000 cash. He wanted to go to the Alberta country and improve his condition. He did go to Alberta, but in just a year from the date of the sale of his Nebraska farm he returned and bought it back, paying a premium of $750. And the man who sold it back to him had secured one splendid crop in addition to the premium. Nor is this increase in land values due wholly to a desire to safely invest money. It is primarily due to the fact that no other state has soil that produces more abundantly or more consistently. Other states may raise more in the aggregate; Nebraska raises more corn wheat, oats, rye and alfalfa per acre than any other state in the union, and the average yield per acre for Nebraska is generally far better than the average yield per acre for the entire country. Nebraska soil can stand more water and get along with less than the soil of any other state. Irrigation is opening up new farming land that a decade ago was thought worthless for agricultural purposes. In the extreme western part of the state, in the very heart of the "Great American Desert" of myth and tradition, irrigated land is selling at from $150 to $300 an acre, and new irrigation projects are rapidly increasing the acreage of land that may be cultivated with profit. From the Nebraska newspapers received in one week at the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics the following items were taken: M. M. Johnson bought B. H. Markwell's eighty adjoining town on the south for $100 an acre. No improvements. — Clay county. R. B. Reynolds purchased the quarter section of land adjoining his home quarter one day last week, consideration being $2,400.

(aSOLlNE EHGI3E8 ON BINDERS Beatrice, Neb., July 8. — Some of the farmers in this section have equipped their harvesters with a small gasoline engine, which is attached to the rear of the machine, for the purpose of assisting them in cutting their wheat in the muddy weather. The idea is to operate the harvest - ing mechanism by power from the engine, thus relieving the team of the extra work of furnishing power for driving the machinery. The truck carrying the engine has wide wooden wheels to hold it up in a muddy field. (2) </seg>
            <seg id="p034">SOME INTERESTING LETTERS The Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics has taken the liberty of using in full some of the letters sent in by crop correspondents. From others it has taken extracts that will doubtless be interesting and profitable. For obvious reasons the names of the writers of these letters are withheld: Favors Double Listed Corn. Verdigris, Nebraska. — Our best corn goes about 70 bushels, that is, on ground where alfalfa has been grown. By double listing the best yields are produced. I have both single and double listed corn and I think the double listed corn goes about 15 to 20 bushels per acre more than single listed corn. I think the single listed corn goes better than checked corn. Small grain does not pay around here, yet much of it is raised. The best results are obtained by changing corn and alfalfa, or some other legume. Generally late corn is the best. I judge that early corn makes about 15 bushels per acre less this year than late corn. Farm Too Much Land. Hebron, Nebr. — I don't see that we could improve methods of culti - vation very much. The greatest mistake most farmers make is, that they farm too much land. The consequence is they often have to do their work at a great disadvantage. For instance, there are farmers here who think they can farm from 60 to 80 acres of corn with one team and do it well. This might do when the weather is favorable during the time when corn needs cultivation. The way it was this season, the month of June was very wet, and the corn not fit for cultivation. By the first of July the wheat was ripe and had to be taken care of, and cultivating had to be suspended until after harvest. This is one reason why our corn crop is so light. Our leading men on the Nebraska experiment farm have an idea that the farmers are ignorant in doing their farm work. This is a mistake. The farmers do not put into practice what they do know. In my judgment land in Nebraska has not near reached the limit of its productiveness, and just so long as farmers rob the soil, that is take off year after year and put nothing back, just so long will the soil deteriorate and in course of time refuse to grow anything. I know of only one way to solve this problem — restore the fertility of the soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">BUREAU OF LABOR 35 The farmers must haul their straw piles to the feed lot instead of burning them and letting them go to waste. Where farming is extensive and manure cannot be hauled out on all the land, then the only way is to raise leguminous crops, such as alfalfa, clover, and other grasses. Too Many Shiftless Farmer-. Lemoyne, Nebr. — I take pleasure in giving you some information in regard to the method of raising our best crops. There are too many shiftless farmers, and you can tell by a glance at their crops just who they are. We have some fields of corn that will make 50 bushels per acre, and small grain in proportion. The corn as cultivated about four times during the season and was kept clean from weeds by the use of hoes. While the rain was very unevenly distributed, even in the dry districts where corn was clean and a mulch of two or three inches of dirt was kept after each shower, the crop will make 45 bushels to the acre. Land values are on the increase and a great deal is being sold for from $15 to $25 per acre — land that five years ago was selling at from $3 to $5 per acre. Wants Personal Instruction. Alliance, Nebr. — Crops that were planted here this year and culti - vated under the direction of Professor Hunt produced good yields, while the crops that were put in and cultivated under the old methods are lighter. This is Professor Hunt's first year here and there were but few who followed his method of farming. C. A. Xewberry had Professor Hunt here at his own expense. It seems to me that it is high time the state should be doing something for this section. One man like Professor Hunt and two or three assistants could do much for tis. He could go from one farm to another and give instructions and tbis, to my mind, would be better than experiment stations. There are but few who will go to see the work. I have a fruit experiment station and the trees were brought here from Osage, Iowa. There are not many who take an in - terest in looking at it. We have two acres of fine fruit trees. It would be worth thousands of dollars to our county if the state would send a man here next summer and give instructions in dry land farming. Kotatlon of Crops. Unadilla, Nebr. — Corn planted on ground that has been seeded to timothy and clover and used for pasture a number of years, yielded more than double the land on which corn had been raised for a number of years. Frequent harrowing of the corn, when small, seems bene - flcal, and corn that was cultivated after the big rains the first of July </seg>
            <seg id="p036">M BIENNIAL REPORT OF did not fire and dry up like that which was not so cultivated. My observation is that wheat planted on early plowing, other conditions being equal, is the best, and harrowing it in the spring beneficial. Complains of Seed. Whitney, Nebr. — I am a farmer myself and have been all my life, but I do not call this country a farmng country. We have a good soil here, somewhat sandy, and when conditions are favorable we raise large crops of everything that is put out and taken care of. The greatest trouble here is, there is so much land and so few farmers. Everyone tries to farm more than he can handle. All kinds of seed is run out and mixed. There is no fall wheat without rye in it, and oats have wheat mixed with it, and the seed corn is inbred so much that it is very poor. Some have tried the Campbell system of dry farm - ing with good results. Alfalfa does fine here on the lowland and along streams where it is irrigated, but on the upland it will only make one good cutting each year. Some leave it for seed, which is quite profitable. Some alfalfa made as high as six bushels per acre last year, and there will be a good crop of seed again this year. There are about 4,000 acres of seed alfalfa in Dawes county this year. This is a fine country for truck gardening, small fruit and dairying. Cabbage grows from eight to ten tons per acre, and all kinds of small fruit does well. There are lots of fine horses raised here. Hoping to see Dawes county farmers get their eyes open and get to business, I am one who is going to try to make this one of the best counties in the state. Wants to Advertise Nebraska. Bradish, Nebr. — We have in Boone county some of the finest farm - ing land in the state. Farmers here make a practice of feeding up their grain because it is too far to market. Most farmers have a large bunch of pigs. In the fall they go out to the Band hills and bring back a bunth of feeders and feed up their corn and alfalfa hay. The farmer who takes good care of his soil here can easily raise from 50 to 80 bushels of corn per acre. Oats have run as high as 50 bushels per acre. Farmers hers are mostly owners, there being comparatively few renters. Land Is selling from $55 to $80 per acre. Nearly every farmer has a manure spreader now, so I think the soil will get richer every year. I WISH NEBRASKA WOULD SPEND |»MW0 A TEAR IN ADVERTISING HER RESOURCES.

            <seg id="p037">BUREAU OF LABOR 37 done here since 1885. I made very little money until about ten years ago. Since 1898 crops have been fairly good and prices have been good for live stock and farm products. I have made as high as fifty per cent, on land I have farmed in Chase county, and have made 18 per cent, on an average for the past eight years. In 1892 I imported maccaroni wheat and have made the growing of it a success. I raise Khershan oats and Siberian millet and find them well adapted to Western Nebraska. Most farmers try to farm too much land and do poor farming. I try to farm better than most farmers and usually raise the best crops. I have practiced the Campbell system of farming to some extent during the past eight years, and ' find that it pays big for the extra work. I own 2,200 acres of good land near Lamar. and am buying more as fast as I can pay for it. In 1883 and 1884 I farmed in Van Buren county, Iowa, and made a little more than expenses. I can make more money with the same amount invested farming in Western Nebraska. The Farms Are Too Large Laurel, Nebr. — The land is all farmed on what is called the general farming plan. The farms are too large and help so scarce that no one has time to specialize very much. Most of the land is planted to corn, oats, wheat and barley, and each one is satisfied with a fair yield. Much of the land is being seeded to clover and timothy and many farmers have some alfalfa. The greatest objection many farmers have to alfalfa is that the first crop must be put up in June when they should be cultivating corn. One man here put in an acre of onions, but a little hail storm in August damaged his crop bo that he only got 125 bushels. I sowed 15 acres of alfalfa in a corn field when we laid the corn by and succeeded in geting a very fine stand. A New York man who owns two sections of land here, has it all seeded to timothy. Last year he offered to give anyone one-third of the crop who would harvest it and deliver him two-thirds in town. The seed was allowed to fall on the ground where it grew so that this year he only got two bushels per acre. I think it was too thick. I know of another piece which yielded eight bushels per acre, and it was allowed to stand in the shock until was badly shattered. Raising Good Corn Syracuse, Nebr. — I think there are two ways of raising good corn in this section. First of all, where the ground is poor an worn out I would suggest that it be put in wheat or oats, and sow alfalfa and red clover, then put it into pasture for a year or two and let it grow up well in the spring and then plow it under or put the first crop up for hay and the second for feed. I have a small patch of clover from </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 BIENNIAL REPORT OF which I got two tons of hay and two bushels of seed. When I put it into corn it will yield double what it did before. Or, if a man ia feeding cattle, haul all the manure out every year and keep changing from corn to oats and then to wheat and back to corn, and you can raise good corn; but you have to haul the manure and keep the corn free from weeds. Cultivate three or four times and the last two times not too deep. I would advise plowing every chance you get, and good and deep. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">CURT COMMENT FROM COUNTRY CIRCLES This country is well adapted to farming," writes a correspondent from Chase county. "That is, it is well adapted for farming if the peo - ple would farm less acreage and farm it better." A correspondent in Thayer county writes: "The greatest mistake most farmers make is that they farm too much land. The consequence is, they often have to do their work at a great disadvantage. For in - stance, there are farmers here who think they can cultivate from 60 to 80 acres of corn with one team and do it well. This may be possible when the weather conditions are favorable during the time when the corn Leeds cultivation, but it wouldn't do this last summer." This comes from Grant county — a territory that two decades ago was thought to be worthless for farming purposes: "I believe my corn will go 75 bushels to the acre. We have the best crops I have seen in twen - ty-six years' experience in this section of Nebraska." Here is a bit of wisdom from a Valley county correspondent, and it contains subject for a whole lot of thought: "We have more 15-bushel farmers than 15-bushel farms in this section of the country." A central Nebraska correspondent says: "Corn on alfalfa sod is ahead of all. *My experience is that it is not well to put corn on the same ground more than twice in succession. Plow a good depth, pack the soil with the disc, have it fine and clean before planting, harrow thoroughly before the corn is up, cultivate deep the first time and shal - lower as the corn gets higher, and if possible a shallow cultivation after harvest. Alfalfa is a big paying crop and should be grown more. It is a great soil restorer." Prom Norman, Kearney county: "There was one 12 acre field of wheat, sown on alfalfa ground, that threshed out 600 bushels of fine wheat, testing 63. It will pay to sow more alfalfa." Fifty bushels of wheat to the acre is "going some." From Gandy, Logan county: "Farmers have learned that it does not pay to haul much grain to market. We have to go from 25 to 30 miles and the roads are sandy. Many people will not live here on ac - ccunt of the distance to market. A railroad would double the value of our land. The dairy business is helping greatly. One-third of our people could not remain here without it." From Cherry county: "If people would farm here like the people do in the east, we would have better crops. But on account of cheap land people do not work their ground as they should, and raise fair crops </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 BIENNIAL REPORT OF with very little labor. There is land here that has raised a crop every year for ten years, and has never been plowed once. All the owners use is a lister and disc. Some people have called this 'the lazy farming country.' " From Butler county: "We are turning our attention more and more to timothy and clover. Alfalfa is sown but little, and then merely for the purpose of changing from corn to wheat." From Hooper, Dodge county: "In regard to the best methods of cul - tivation, I don't konw whether I should say much, as I am not one of the best farmers in this neigborhood. But I will say that if farmers would sow half of their land to alfalfa or clover and let the land rest for a few years, then farm less and better, our land would produce from one-third to one-half more, and at less expense." From Crete, Saline county: "Our experince with winter wheat this year was that where the land was plowed early, right after harvest, and well prepared, the yield was about double what it was on land that was plowed just before sowing time." From St. Paul, Howard county: "The largest wheat yields are from summer plowing, and as early plowing as can be done after the crop is taken off the ground. We used to list most of our corn, but of late we have gone back to the planter and checkrow." From Humboldt, Richardson county: "The best yields of corn in this county were planted early on fall plowing." From West Point, Cuming county: "The corn that was planted on clover sod is the best corn, averaging about 15 bushels per acre more than corn on other ground. The clay soil without clover roots did not hold the moisture." </seg>

In Nebraska I it to be one of the very best of all trees to propogate for profit or i. It fills the place of nearly all hardwood timber, besides many that other timber cannot fill, such as carving, veneering furniture, Besides the many uses of its timber, it is a nut-bearing tree, with Ei a failure In bearing a crop every year. It begins to bear at years and the nuts always sell at $1 per bushel as gathered from ee with shucks on. Propagation Take the nuts just as they come from the tree (leaving the outer husk on as it contains the fertilizing element necessary to the growth of the young seedling), spread the nuts on a level piece of ground, side by side, so they touch. Do not pile on top of each other. Now fill alt the open spaces between the nuts with sand, and scatter the sand over them. Take a broom and sweep the sand about until the spaces are well filled. After this is done cover with leaf mould or other material, rotted soil, or anything that will not easily dry out. Next lay a little brush or corn stalks pretty thin, just enough to hold the snow in winter. It may be necessary to sprinkle a few times during the winter. Early in th&lt;- spring plow and fit your ground same as for potatoes. Harrow down thoroughly and mark off rows eight feet one way and four feet tte other, letting the sunshine in by running the eigtit foot rows North and South. About May 25th, or after we have had a number of good growing days and your field is all ready, uncover your nuts and every one that has sprouted take out, leaving all old husks on possible; carry them to your field and plant about three inches deep. Use some J'ldg - ment as to the kind of soil you have, as some soil will dry out deeper than others. All nuts not sprouted in the bed should be covered up again and left for about two or three weeks. Uncover again and you will now get most of them, but those not sprouted, cover and leave until next year, as some will not grow the second year. It will take about ZVz bushels to the acre. K would recommend planting two rows of beans between the eight and give thorough cultivation.

It is safe to count a half bushel of nuts to each tree, making 340 bushels per tree for five years, or $1,700. At the fifteenth year, take out every other tree, leaving trees eight by sixteen. This will give two posts to the tree, 680 at 15c, or $102. Nuts from the 15th to 20th year, one bushel to the tree, $1,700. At 20th year we have turning lumber from the butt cut, say for table or stand legs and other lumber, ten dollars per tree, $1,700. Trees now stand sixteen by sixteen. At 25 years take out every other tree, leaving trees sixteen by thirty-two. Nuts five years, two bushels per tree, 340 per year, or $1,700 Lumber $20 per tree, $1,700 Thirty year nuts, $1,700. Lumber, $50 per tree. We thus have a total of $12,454. I believe I have made a very conservative estimate on the profit of one acre of black walnut timber. But we will cut this right in two, which leaves $6,227. Mind you, we now have on each acre planted the most beautiful grove of trees possible to raise, also the most valuable, stand - ing thirty-two feet each way. Five acres would be $31,135 and a five acre grove of black walnut upon any 160 acre farm in Nebraska would raise the price of that quarter $50,000. Get the people to take hold of this and in a few years Nebraska will be known as the "BLACK WALNUT STATE," and by far the richest state in the Union. Compare this walnut plantation with any scheme of life insurance and see which is the better investement. Cuba, Rock county. A WICKED WASTE. The other day a representative of a hardwood manufacturing concern was in this city. He had taken trip into the country and he said that one of the sights which shocked him, was a pile of black walnut cord wood alongside the road. "Such waste," said he, "to a man in my business seems almost in - credible. There is a tremendous demand for black walnut and the sup - ply is getting shorter and shorter every year.

"The time is soon coming when a community like the one you have here will be equipped with veneering mills to work up not only the walnut trees but also the old stumps-. It is only a matter of a few years when buyers will be hunting black walnut stumpage and when the mills will move to sites where there is a comparatively small amount of stumpage in sight. "I advise every farmr who owns a black walnut to save it. It is almost like burning $100 bills to cut black walnut trees up into cord wood and use it for fuel." — Xemaha County Republican. \EBKASk\ COUNTIES WIN Pawnee and Nemaha counties, which were not by any means the winners in the county collective agricultural contest at the Nebraska state fair, took their exhibits to the Missouri valley fair at Kansas City Mo., and won first and second places in the agricultural contest.

The quality of wheat, oats, rye and sreltz is also fine in that section, while the corn crop is really remark - able, all things considered. Some corn raisers report their yield as high as seventy bushels to the acre, and the wheat yield ranged from twenty to forty bushels to the acre. Rye went as high as fifty-two, speltz sixty and oats eighty-four. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">SOME STARTLING FIGURES Someone, unknown to history, but nevertheless deserving of ever - lasting fame, has asserted that there are three kinds of liars — liars, blankety-blank liars and statisticians. Another unknown philosopher has remarked with equal brevity and truth that "figures will not lie, but liars will figure." These two curt comments preface this chapter in order to disarm those critics who never investigate, and who confine their activities to casting reflections upon the investigations of others. As for the comparisons herein quoted — neither do the figures lie nor has a liar figured. Ordinarly statistics are dry and uninteresting things. When the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics issues a bulletin showing that Nebraska raised so many bushels of this grain or that, or bo many tons of this or that crop, people fail to grasp their immensity for the reason that the mind untrained to statistics cannot think clearly in hundreds of millions. But when we get down to comparative statistics we arouse interest, and for this reason the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics has spent some time in making comparative statistics for the information of the people of Nebraska. These figures are calculated to make the average Nebraskan "sit up and take notice," and wonder if he has really realized what a great state he is living in. And these comparative sta - tistics are calculated to make the people of other states gasp in amazement, especially the millions who have been raised in the belief that Nebraska is a half-settled, semi-arid, practically barren waste of raw prairie and stunted sage brush. Strange to say there are many people who believe that to be true of this great state. Now, when we state in cold figures that Nebraska's 1909 wheat crop amounted to 50,314,000 bushels nobody pays much attention to it, because "millions of bushels" is an indefinite term to most people. But suppose we put it in another way. Suppose we were to load it all into standard freight cars, 1,200 bushels to a car — it would take 41,095 cars to haul the wheat. That would make a train 280 miles long reaching from Lin - coln, Nebr., to Benkleman, Nebr. Some wheat, eh? The alfalfa crop of 1909 amounts to 1,971,770 tons. The wild hay crop amounted to 4,252,430 tons, and the tame hay crop amounted to 2,647.839 tons. This Is a total crop of 8,872,039 tons of hay that </seg>
            <seg id="p045">BUREAU OF LABOR 45 Nebraska produced this year. That is hard to realize, but suppose we load the hay into cars, twelve tons to the car. It would take 7 standard freight cars to haul this year's Nebraska crop of hay, making a freight train 5,059 miles long. This would make 8,385 trains of 70 cars each, and if the hay crop had to be hauled to market in cars in one day it would stall every railroad in the United States. Even put in this shape we cannot realize the immensity of Nebraska's yearly hay crop. But there are more miles of cars filled with Nebraska products yet to enumerate. The oats crop for 1909 was 59,665,00u bushels. It would take 39,770 cars to haul it to market, making a train 271 miles long. The rye crop is small, only 1,228,000 bushels, and it would take only 1,036 cars to haul it to market, making a train only 7 miles long. The barley crop this year is 2,821,000 bushels, and it would take only cars to transport it, making a train only 20 miles long. But the potato crop calls for some cars. The yield this year was 7.4uo,000 bushels. It would take 18,400 cars to haul the "spuds" to market, making a train 128 miles long. Just think of the oceans of gravy it would take to properly anoint all those potatoes if they were boiled and mashed. Nebraska creameries will make 100,000,000 pounds of butter in this good year of 1909. It would lake 4,760 cars to haul that butter to market, making a train of butter 36 miles long. That's lots of butter, but not nearly enough to spread the bread that is yearly made in Nebraska from Nebraska wheat ground in Nebraska mills. By the time the bells announce the birth of the new year Nebraska hens will have laid 100,000,000 dozen eggs in 1909. They will beat that record a million dozen or more, but call it even. That means 3,333,333 egg cases packed with "hen fruit." It takes just 400 cases to fill a car, so the hens of Nebraska in 1909 will, when they quit business for the year, have laid enough eggs to fill 8,333 cars. That would make a train of eggs 57 miles long. The live stock shipments of 1909 are not, of course available, but let's take the shipments of cattle, hogs, sheep, horses and mules in 1908. It took 42,257 cars to haul the cattle, 46,094 cars to haul the hogs, 5,022 single-deck cars to haul the sheep and 2,839 cars to haul the horses and mules, a total of 96,212 cars to haul our 1908 live stock to market. This would make a train of live stock 656 miles long. Now add it all up. To haul one year's Nebraska output of hay, grain, potatoes, live stock, butter and eggs to market would require 6,510 miles of freight cars, a total of 951,873 cars. And mind you we haven't taken into account the shipments of live and dressed poultry, of millet, speltz. cane, broom corn, and a hundred and one other articles we produce in profusion. And mind you we haven't taken into account our corn crop. That would fill enough freight cars to make a train 1,040 miles long. Thus we have a total of 7,555 miles of freight cars. If the Union Pacific had a four-track road from Omaha to San Francisco it would have to occupy every mile of the main line tracks the entire distance if it tried to handle Nebraska's crops for a single season all at once. The </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 BIENNIAL REPORT OP more you think about it the more you are dazzled by Nebraska's wonder- ful productivity. But let's go at it another way, just for amusement. The total gold and silver output of Colorado, California and Alaska in 1908 was $81,- 892,000. Nebraska's 1908 corn crop was worth more by $7,407,000. The world's production of gold and silver in 1908 was $512,000,000. Nebraska's production of hay, grain, eggs, butter, poultry, live stock and manufactured products exceed that amount by $98,000,000. Nebraska's 1908 corn crop was worth more than the republic's output of crude petroleum in the same year. Nebraska's 1908 output of butter, poultry and eggs was worth more than the nation's tobacco crop in the same year. Our corn and wheat in 1908 was worth more than the nation's output of copper in the same year. And the difference in Nebraska's favor will be much greater in 1909. On November 30, 1908, the permanent school fund of Nebraska amounted to $7,518,624. If all of it were in one dollar bills, and the bills laid end to end. it would make a ribbon of dollar bills 814 miles long. If the teachers in the public schools of Nebraska were to form a procession, single file, three feet apart, it would be six miles long. If the children of school age in Nebraska were lined up in a similar pro- cession the line would be 212 miles lor The wage earners engaged in mechanical, industrial and transporta tion- pursuits in Nebraska earned $30,000,000 in wages in 1908 and will earn much more in 1909. But if one tries to continue such figuring to the limit he would be apt to land in the asylum. The truth of the whole matter is that we Nebraskans do not know Nebraska, nor are we doing our part to im- part the knowledge we have to the people of other sections country. It's high time we begun singing the praises of this great state in a chorus loud enough to be heard around the world. What Nebraska needs right now is what every live, progressive business needs — proper and judicious advertising — publicity. The Bureau of Labor Census and Industrial Statistics will furnish the figures to startle the world if the people of Nebraska will only make provision for making those figures public and scattering them broadcast. • </seg>
            <seg id="p047">FARM PROBLEMS (Address delivered by Will M. Maupin, Deputy Commissioner Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics, before the Burt County Farmers' Institute, Oakland, Nebr., February 1, 1910.) Mr. President and Fellow Workers: — I deem it an honor as well as a pleasure to be privileged to address this institute. When asked to select a subject upon which to talk on this occasion I selected "Farm Problems." I was actuated to make this selection because I feel amply conpetent to instruct farmers as to the best methods of conducting their business. This feeling is based upon the well known fact that those who are best informed as to the proper methods of rearing children are those who never had any children, therefore, I, who never plowed a furrow, bound a sheaf, threshed a grain or harnessed a horse, ought to be equally competent to instruct farmers in the conduct of their busi - ness. But, seriously, ignorant as I may be of actual working conditions upon the farm, I am well aware of many of the problems that confront the men who, in the last analysis, must bear the brunt of the work, produce the bulk of the word's prosperity and stand as the bulwark be - tween the whole people and starvation. Time was when farming was a rather haphazard occupation. With land cheap and easy access, fertile and responsive, little save hard labor was required to make a good living. But with the rapid advance - ment of farm values, with the encroachment of trusts that fix the price of what the farmer has to sell and also the price of what the farmer must buy, the time has come when to be a successful farmer means more than mere plowing and sowing and reaping. Farming is no longer a mere occupation — it Is a science. The farmer who makes money upon land worth $150 an acre needs to practice more scientific methods than the farmers of a former generation who farmed land worth from $10 to $25 an acre. "What do you mix your colors with?" asked a visitor of Landseer, the famous artist. "With brains, sir," was the reply. The farmer who would succeed in these strenuous days must fertilize his soil with brains, must impregnate the seed he sows with brains, must cultivate with brains, must harvest with brains and must market with brains. The successful farmer, in short, must acquaint himself with soil con- </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 BIENNIAL REPORT OF ditions, he must select bis seed with care, he must cultivate properly and he must watch the markets. Formerly the farmer insisted upon adapt - ing the soil and seed to the man; now he realizes that the man must be adapted to soil and seed conditions. As this fact becomes more and more impressed upon the mind of the tillers of the soil, we hear less and less sarcastic comment upon the "book farmers." The things that were good enough for your fathers are not good enough for you, and the things that may, perhaps, content you today, will not bring content to your children. I enjoy far better conditions than my father enjoyed, conditions of life, socially, economically and educationally. This is not due to my efforts but to the fact that my father was not content to leave me the conditions under which he began life, and I fall far short of my duty to my family, my country and my God if I fail to work earnestly to leave to my children better conditions than I have enjoyed. Thus it is that in working along the lines laid down by these institutes you are not only bettering your present conditions, but you are vastly bettering the conditions of your children whom you expect to take up the burdens when you lay them down, burdens that will be hard enough to bear, but which shall have been made lighter by your sacrifice, your researches and your efforts. I have reached what is known as middle life, yet I was a man grown when one of the pressing problems was how to keep the young people on the farm. Knowing the conditions of farm life I, nor any other man, could blame the young man or the young woman for wanting to get away from its drudery, its isolation and its lonesomeness. That pro - blem, however, is well on its way to solution. The telephone, the rural free delivery, the furnace, the bath room, aye, even the automobile, have been factors in its solution, and today the farm is but the suburb of the city and we are hearing less and less of complaint about keeping the boys on the farm. Before leaving this phase of the subject let me call your attention to another factor in the solution of this problem. I refer to that splendid educational institution known as the State School of Agriculture. To my mind that is the most valuable assest of this great young state. I am amazed that among the chief opponents of more liberal appropriations for that department of our educational system are farmers. With legislatures usually made up of a majority of farmers it strikes me that the agricultural college should be about the first thing considered. I wish it might be so arranged that every farmer in Ne - braska could be taken to that great school and entertained for two or three days, and allowed to familiarize himself with the work it is doing. Every farmer who visits it goes away an active missionary in its support; every young man who graduates from it becomes to the farmers of his community what fertilzer is to the soil; every young woman who graduates from it becomes the keeper of a better home and becomes at once an influence for good in her community. Why, I ask you in all candor, should farmers select as their rep - resentatives in the legislature broken down lawyers, decrepit doctors </seg>
            <seg id="p049">BUREAU OF LABOR 49 and hack politicians, instead of electing live, i epresentative members of their own craft and calling? The railroads have a habit of selecting men to represent them who are "on the job" all the time. The same is true of the insurance companies, the stock yards companies, and all other special interests. The sooner the farmers of Nebraska profit by example and begin selecting their representatives from their own ranks, men who will be "on the job" all the time, the sooner will they solve some of the problems of legislation, taxation and vacation that now confront them. Taxation is one of the great problems confronting the farmer, as it is of every other enterprising citizen. Our system of taxation is anti - quated. Those best able to bear the burdens escape with the lightest load, while those least able to bear it must bear the heaviest load. While the farm land values of the United States represent less than 18 per cent of the total land values of the country, the farm lands bear 55 per cent of the burden of the taxes on land. This is not only un - fair; it is little short of criminal. Call me a crank if you will, for I am used to that designation, but I bold, and believe I can prove it given time and opportunity, that the only rightful solution of this problem was that laid down by Henry George, which is, in short, the taxation of land values. Not, mind you, the taxation of the land itself, but the taxation of its value for use and occupancy. Let me give you just a brief example and I will leave the matter with you. A few weeks ago a representative of the Union Pacific Railroad Company called upon me at my office, and while talking over matters pertaining to my bureau asked if I could suggest something that would induce people to settle upon the now vacant lands of western Nebraska. When the Unicn Pacific was built it received millipns of acres of land grant, land as fertile and as productive as any the sun now shines upon. The Union Pacific sold that land for from $2 to $10 an acre. It was bought up in vast tracts by speculators who are holding it off the market and becoming rich by its increase in value. Do they pay taxes in proportion? By no means. The fanner who buys a quarter section and improves it, putting into it his every energy and almost his very soul, is taxed for his enter - prise and his sacrificing, while the speculator continues to pay a rid - iculously small tax on "unimproved land" and profits by the increase in values brought about by his enterprising neighbor. Yet the unimproved lend is just as fertile, just as responsive, just as adaptable to tilling, as the improved land. But it is held out of the market. The result is that one pays too much, the other not enough. Why should we put a tax on enterprise and a premium on indolence? Make the tax upon the land's value for use and occupancy instead upon the improvements, and ■peculators would be forced to let go. The result would be the opening of vast tracts of fertile land to settlement, the congestion in our great cities would be relieved, the burden of taxation would be equalized, the state would have more money with which to better carry on its work, and a greater meed of prosperity would come to the whole people. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 BIENNIAL REPORT OF That was, in effect, the answer I gave the Union Pacific's repre - sentative, and until we have a taxing system of that kind millions of acres will lie idle, people will starve and suffer and die, taxation will be unequal and undue favoritism shown to those least deserving of favor. I commend the study of this problem to the farmers who be - long to this institution. The problem of good roads demands equal attention with the problem of taxation, for I know of no heavier tax upon the farmers of this country than the toll exacted by bad roads. In the last twenty years upwards of $800,000,000 have been spent upon the roads of this republic — and the roads are as bad today as they were twenty years ago. It is a wilful and wicked waste of money. What this state needs is a new set of road laws, framed by experienced men, that will enable us to keep the improvements made this year as the basis for further improvements next year, until we have really good roads everywhere in Nebraska. We have today four hundred convicts in the Nebraska penitentiary, and they are sold by the state to private contractors who use them in mak - ing goods that are sold in the open market in competition with the product of free labor. True this system lessens the cost of maintaining the prison, but it also lessens the purchasing power of free labor, thereby decreasing your opportunities for the profitable marketing of your com - modities. Instead of teaching convicts such trades as broom-making — which is a trade followed largely by cripples, invalids and the aged — and Bhirtmaking, which is a trade followed by girls and notoriously the poorest paid labor in the whole list of trades — instead of teaching strong, sturdy men such trades and depriving honest men and women of the opportunities of making a livelihood, I would utilize them in the prepar - ation of road material and the building of roads. We have an abundance of stone in Nebraska for the basis of good roads. Let us put the state's prisoners to work thereon, thereby lessening the cost of marketing the products of the farms, making a larger increase in the demand for farm products, and lessening the burdens now Imposed upon the honest wage earners of the state by the unfair system of convict competition. The average wagon haul on foodstuffs — that is from the farm to the railroad — is 8 1-10 miles; the ton-mile cost is 28 cents. This is so out of proportion to the ton-mile cost of rail transportation as to demand the thoughtful consideration of practical men. Bad roads are a direct and burdensome tax upon the producers, and relief must be sought along practical lines. But there is another problem of farm life that I would briefly mention before I close. Labor saving farm machinery is now so com - mon as to excite no comment. The self-binder has taken the place of the old cradle; the pneumatic stacker has emancipated the man who stood on the stack; the thresher has taken the place of the flail; the farmer rides his cultivator and sits under an umbrella; the gasoline engine has taken the place of the horse power. While all this has not, perhaps, lessened the hours of the farmer's labor, they have lightened </seg>
            <seg id="p051">BUREAU OP LABOR 51 his load and increased his productive capacity. But what about the labor saving machinery for the farm wife? I have seen a gasoline engine run - ning a feed grinder not fifty yards from where the farm wife was laboriously working over an old-fashioned washtub, and a gasoline engine pumping water for the stock while the farm wife was exercising handpower to turn the handle of a washing machine. Down in Thayer county a couple of years ago I saw a farmer running a corn shelter by automobile power, he having jacked up the rear trucks of his ma - chine and attached a rear wheel to his shelter by a belt. I ate supper with him and his good wife, and I noted that she had to carry the water from the pump to the kitchen, and the waste water from the kitchen to the back lot. She was forced to use an old-fashioned cookstove and, I presume, spent a goodly portion of her time picking up chips or carry - ing in wood or coal, as the case might be. What was Mr. Farmer doing to provide his good wife with labor saving machinery? An acetylene gas plant and a gas stove would have lighted his house and relieved his good wife and his two daughters of fully one-third their work, and his auto - mobile would run a washing machine as satisfactorily as a corn shelter or a feed grinder. I hold that not enough attention has been given by If you will bear with me now for not more than three minut' will tell you a few things about Burt county that perhaps you do not know. In 1909 Burt county produced 3,564,000 bushels of corn, being the eleventh largest corn producing county of the state. In production per acre Burt county stood sixth, and while the state average was 25.7 bushels per acre, Burt county's average was 40. The wheat yield per acre of the state was 20.13 bushels per acre; Burt county's average was 23.1 bushels per acre. The average yield of oats per acre for the state was 25.28; Burt county's average was 26.3. The average yield of barley per acre for the state was 21.97; Burt county's average was 26.2. the average farmer to the problem of labor saving for the women of his household. It strikes me that the good wife and the daughters are just as much entitled to a faucet in the kitchen and a kitchen sink as the farmer is to a windmill and a sulky cultivator; that his wife and rtau- just as much entitled to a power driven washing and !i ire to a self-bindi are just as much entitled to emancipation from the broiling castiron and the care of smoking ker&lt; sons are to emancipation from the flail and the haml-&lt;li shellt r. If there be any in all this broad land of ours who a, to the uti -ideratici le relief fron burdens, they are the wives and mothers, and if I had the mak laws I would se»' to it that every time a farmer bought a labor saving machinery fur himself he would let his wife buy a piece of labor saving machinery for herself. . cli </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 BIENNIAL REPORT OP The average yield of rye per acre for the state was 17.37; Burt county's average was 22.5. This demonstrate two things beyond dispute — first, that Burt county is a mighty good county, and, second, that its farms are conducted by intelligent up-to-date, progressive farmers. Am I not right in supposing that these more than average returns per acre are due in large measure to the information gained by just such interesting and progressive organi - zations as this one which I have had the honor to address? Friends and neighbors, I started out on the presumption that I was able to tell you how to farm because people who have no children are the best informed as to the proper training of children. I leave it to you if I have not shown as much knowledge of farming as the childless have of rearing children. In conclusion let me urge you to press forward along the educational lines you have laid down. Upon your progress our progress depends; upon your prosperity our prosperity depends. This is the greatest state in the greatest country in the history of all time. Magnificent as its progress has been during the forty years that have elapsed since Ne - braska became a state, we have but begun the work of development; great as have been the returns for the work expended, we have but begun to wrest from Nebraska soil the riches that are stored therein. Every year sees the area of tillable land widened because we are. rapidly learn - ing to adapt ourselves to soil and climatic conditions. Just as we stand at the head of the educational column, so should we stand at the head in progressiveness. It is not enough that we should get more from the soil than is wrested from the soil of other states; we must get all 'that is possible, bearing well in mind that we can not forever take off unless we put back. Last year the wealth produced in Nebraska — from Nebraska farms and manufacturing establishment — totalled upwards of $600,000,000. A state that can do that, and especially in a year that was by no means a record breaker for climatic conditions, is entitled to step out of the "grasshopper" class and into the live, wideawake, progressives class. I give you this toast: "Nebraska, the producer of the best of all good things; of bad things the possessor" of the least; a state without a bread line, without a child sent breakfastless to school, with a future unlimited and a past to be proud of, a state of homes and schools and churches — your development our duty, your bounty our reward." </seg>
            <seg id="p053">THE SECRET OF SUCCESS ON THE FARM (Address delivered by Andrew Young, Jr., at the Burt County Farm - ers' Institute, Oakland. Nebr., February 1, 1910.) Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am to give you the "Secret of Success on the Farm." Before revealing to you this great secret, let me state that I have never learned the secret of success as a speaker, nor have I tact for telling others what I know. "However, my task is made somewhat easy at the thought that I am to tell a secret, for a secret is considered easy told, besides being some - thing which other people want to hear 'you know.' "To begin with, let me ask, what is success on the farm? We must first decide that. I presume that if everyone here were asked to define this question there would be no two answers alike. My reason for be - lieving this is the fact that I have never yet seen two farmers conduct their farms, their homes thereon or methods of business and farm life, exactly alike, so there must be some difference' of opinion as to what consltutes success on the farm, or who should oe called the successful farmer. What I would call success would be to provide and conduct a Happy and Progressive home. "To make a good and honest living for ourself and those who de - pend upon us for support as we go along life's journey; making reason - able investments which bring to us steady accumulation, sufficient to pay all our pecuniary obligations, including a reasonable amount for pleasure and independence, and a reserve fund provided for old age in case we reach it; all to be accomplished with a conscience kept clear of offense toward man and toward God. "Now, one of the very first things for a man to obtain, if he wishes to try farming and be successful, is a pedigree of himself, and if he finds upon proper examination that he is not a thoroughbred, or does not possess the elements which would entitle him to grade in the ranks for Rural Progress and Right Living, then I would say to that man to let farming alone for he would make a failure of it sure. There would be no danger of the farm injuring him but he might be an injury to the farm and to the community in which he lived; for a careless, un - principled scrub man is no more fit for a farmer than scrub stock is lit for the farm, so it is very essential that we have a thorough knowledge of our own selves. That is, we must know our qualifications — our likes and our dislikes, our abilities and our disabilities, and our natural Inclinations, both mental and physical. And we should be very careful </seg>

"Many fail on the farm and also in other business, simply because they are continually over estimating as to what they can do and* how much they can successfully manage and the size of the profits which they expect to derive therefrom. "Success also depends largely upon our habits of industry, benev - olence and economy in saving. Benevolence is one of the most beautiful and useful traits of character bestowed upon man. We should all be liberal but only those who are careful and saving can really afford to be the liberal one. We should prevent waste and unnecessary extravagance. The Bible teaches this. The miracle of the loaves and fishes ends with a command to gather up the fragments that remain so that nothing may be lost. "How many farmers there are who waste or allow to be wasted in various ways enough each year to more than pay their annual taxes, and then 'howl' that taxes are high or put to waste. It is a sin to be wil - fully wasteful or extravagant. More especially so if we are indebted to anyone. Let me tell you, friends, both young and old, that it Is better to bear the proud title of being called a particular person to work for or a crank on doing things, than it is to be poverty poor or a penurious paymaster, which one is sure to be, sooner or later, who follows a careless and slovenly method of attending to duties. "To be successful on the farm one must also have a natural desire and love for rural life and rural conditions, love for home and family, love for knowledge, truth and honor; love to do manual labor; and the key note is to study and know your business, to make good use of your time and to grasp opportunities when they come, and if they don't come — go after them. "Never get discouraged under any condition, but meet disappoint - ments, defeat and adversities of all kinds with a determination to win out on some other, higher and better principles. It is said, and is generally admitted, that experience is our best teacher. Well, experience ought to be our best teacher for we pay pretty dearly sometimes for the lessons taught by it. I am speaking now from my lessons, learned from this same kind of a teacher. "In the laws of progress, each day's experience should either confirm or condemn that of the preceding day, and farming is one of the pursuits of life's struggles for existence in which this law is made manifest most by those most progressive. Fanners as a class are a progressive people. We have proof of this fact in every direction. But, like people of all other callings, we make mistakes and have our faults and I believe that one of the faults that we are most addicted to is that of running down or complaining about our own occupation and grumbling about the fellows in other pursuits of life having the advantage of us. Now, if </seg>
            <seg id="p055">BUREAU OF LABOR 55 some of them do have the advantage, it certainly is because we give it to them or let them take it If so, then we are to blame and not they. "Our position in the world as farmers reminds me somewhat of a picture which I have in mind and which I will try to describe to you as I see it. The picture is composed of a big fat moneyed king, a lawyer, a volunteer soldier, a preacher and a farmer. The old king is sitting in a big easy chair, before him and to which he is pointing, is represented all the different lines of industry and products of our land, and underneath is the king's motto, 'I govern all.' Next is the lawyer. He is occupying two chairs, the one upon which he is sitting and another for his heels to rest upon. Beside him stands a table strewn with law books and papers and on his door is his motto which reads, 'I plead for all,' Next comes the soldier, a gallant looking man, standing erect, with the motto, 'I fight for all.' Next is the preacher, on his knees, down on the hard floor, praying for all. And last, at the bottom, clear down on the ground, is the old farmer, pulling sand burrs and looking up with sweat on his face, he exclaims, 'Ye£, but I have to feed them, and do the paying for them all.' "Now it seems to me, brother farmers, that we are in a pretty good position, if we have to do the feeding, and a large amount of paying for them all. If we pay for anything we hadn't ought to, or that we don't want, it surely must be our own fault These are most encouraging times for the farmer. I think we can look with great satisfaction upon these evidences of growing prosperity. The whole world seems to be in need of the farmer's products, and with proper and judicious manage - ment, there should be no reason why the farmer's lot should not be one of the most desirable occupations to be found on the face of the earth. Let us do nothing which will result in injury or injustice to any of the people, but let us devise means and adopt laws, which will protect every honorable industry of our country. Let us not be so foolish as to elect bad men into office who will put bad laws into effect, and then, after we have discovered our mistakes, turn around and sign a pledge that we will cheat our own stomachs for 30 days in order to spite those fellows for doing what we ourselves are partly to blame for. Farm - era should attend all important meetings and elections, and it is their duty to study the needs of their community and of the whole country, for without knowledge we cannot vote intelligently, and then let us put good clean competent men into office, who are honest and free from prej - udice, and will do right, because it is right to do right, and not because they are afraid of the law. "My home, as most of you know, has been right here in Burt county, Nebraska, continuously, for a period of nearly 54 years. I am not, nor never have been, a member of any church, creed or religious denomina - tion, nor belonged to any political party, although I have been termed by some to be a Pop and a Democrat, I suppose for the reason that I have never been able to tell a good Pop from a Bryan Democrat, and </seg>

I know from personal experience that when engaged in earnest sincere prayer for the right, we are possessed with a desire to do right; with love and with a spirit of forgiveness toward others. I believe in a Supreme Creator and Ruler of the Universe. Oh, let us endeavor to get a better understand - ing of one another, and of all things with which we have to deal, so that we may be more able to extract and retain the good and reject the bad, to see the beautiful, enjoy the present, and hope for the future. "We are very often reminded by our educators of the benefactor, who is able to make two blades of grass grow where but one blade grew before.

Between January 1 and December 31, of 1909, Nebraska flour mills shipped by rail the enormous quantity of 240,000,000 pounds of flour. This, of course, does not include the flour consumed, at the point of milling. The amount shipped represents three and one-half fifty-pound sacks for each man, woman and child in the state. What these shipments would have been if Nebraskans had been loyal to the "home patronage" idea and insisted upon having Nebraska - made flour, no one knows — but the production would have been enormous - ly increased.

The possibilities of peanut culture in Nebraska may be Investigated in the very near future, if Phil R. Landon of Sterling continues his work. The Sterling Sun says: "Phil R. Landon, the seedsman, planted seven peanuts last spring and a few days ago he reaped his harvest, consisting of about a quart of the largest peanuts we ever saw. Most of them ranged from three to three and one-half inches long and were about one inch through. He will save them for seed next year. Phil is getting some mighty nice things started in his garden and we hope to see him build up a large business in this line, and it means much for the town and its people. Last year he sold every seed he raised and could have disposed of more if he had them." That much of the soil of Nebraska is peculiarly adapted to the rais - ing of "goober" is known to men who have visited the "goober" in its native lair. Whether climatic conditions are favorable is a matter for investigation. THE FUR INDUSTRY IN NEBRASKA. Fremont Tribune: "Few people would suspect that the fur products of Nebraska amount to a million dollars a year in value," said W. R. Adams, a local dealer today, "but that is a fact, nevertheless." Mr. Adams has inaugurated a campaign to make Fremont the center of the fur trade for the state and he is meeting with success. Since he began the business here he has advertised extensively and has thus carried the name of Fremont into many sections where it has hitherto been practically unknown. He has just sent out an installment of 120,000 large and attractive circulars and is beginning to get returns on these, which he says are very satisfactory. This week he is selling $14,000 worth of furs that he has accumulated since the beginning of the season, which opens about November 1st. These have come largely from Nebraska, but he -has received shipments all the way from Okla - homa to Minnesota. The principal kinds handled by him are skunk, muskrat and mink, with a few hundred 'possums thrown in. He now has in his warehouse 14,000 muskrats. These are bringing 60 cents apiece, whereas a year ago the price was around 32 cents. Few persons would suspect that the fragrant skunk is so valuable as a fur animal, but the skin of this plebian chicken thief is bringing $2.50. </seg>

Beaver City Correspondence, Omaha Bee: The beds of silica sand near Beaver City, comprising several hundred acres, have been opened and the sand is being shipped in carload lots to Cambridge, Mass., where it will be used by a large manufacturing concern, but for what purpose has not been disclosed. These beds of silica have been known for years. In 1S92 options were secured upon them by a large concern at Cleveland, O., and several carloads were shipped east, it was claimed, to polish glass. This scheme was abandoned and the options expired. Later some of the silica was sent to Denver, where a soap company, under a flaming name, advertised it as a "natural soap" deposit, accidentally dis - covered. The beds of silica in the eastern part of the county were purchased by the Cudahy Packing company and are now being actively worked, train-loads of the stuff going to the company's plants, where it is used in the manufacture of a cleaning preparation. If the product is as valuable as claimed, Furnas county can supply the world. BROOMCORN IN NEBRASKA. The growing of broom corn in Nebraska is an established industry, but it is not nearly so large as it might be if people generally understood the value of the crop. Better soil and climatic conditions for the growth of broom corn can not be found than are found in this state. There is a constant demand for broom corn, and of late years the demand has out - grown the supply. To those who may contemplate raising broom corn we commend the following from the pen of Thomas M. Cisel, who has made a success of its culture: Broomcorn can be grown on almost any soil, but does the best on a level, black soil. The planting and cultivation is the same as of Indian corn, only the plants must be much thicker in the row, as close planting makes the brush long and fine, which is much desired for making brooms. Plant some next spring. A farmer who has 20 acres of broomcorn should have 15 men when the corn is ready for cutting, which should be done the sixth day after the brush commences to push from the root. In cutting, the corn is first made into tables or benches by over - lapping two rows. After the tables are made the cutters pass down the open row and remove the brush from the stalk at the first joint below the boot, placing it in small bunches on the table. After that it is placed on wagons and taken to the seeder, where the seed is removed by passing the brush through spiked rollers. It is then placed on racks in a curing shed. These racks are made </seg>

Within the memory of men who are not yet accounted old it was thought that the greater portion of Ne - braska would never be worth cultivating, yet the plow is gradually turning the virgin sod, and every year thousands of acres are being added to Nebraska's cultivated area. A Field of I'litiitiM-* in Brown County A few years ago a number of men whose prophetic souls could glimpse the future, met in Lincoln to draft an irrigation law and pre - pare the way for wresting the then desert stretches of central and western Nebraska into cultivated gardens. These men met at the state house and for days worked to draft the first irrigation laws Nebraska had. After their work was completed they adjourned in a body to call upon the governor. The governor received them in the execu - tive office and listened courteously and patiently to the spokesman of the committee, who told in succinct language what had been done and what it was the intent of the people to do. Then the governor spoke. He admired the enterprise of the men who had been engaged upon this work, but he thought their energy woefully misdirected. He insisted that the western half of Nebraska was a cattle country and always would be a cattle country, and that any efforts to make of it an agricultural country would end in dismal failure and be productive only of heartaches and distress. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 BIENNIAL REPORT OF A Box Bntte Count} Wheat Field. That was slightly less than twenty years ago. The summer of 1909 saw hundreds of thousands of acres of the once "cattle country" land billowing with wheat that is threshing out from 25 to 37 bushels to the acre. It saw hundreds of thousands of acres of corn, thousands of acres of rye, oats and barley, thousands of acres of sugar beets. It saw vast alfalfa fields giving off from- four to seven tons an acre where twenty years ago a single steer had to be allowed from five to fifteen acres for grazing. The homesteader has taken the place of the rancher; the grade steer has taken the place of the long - born, and the dairy cow and the hand separator and the hen add more wealth to Nebraska every year than the cattle ranges of twenty years ago did in any two or three years combined. Too much attention cannot be given to the subject of alfalfa— the "mortgage raiser." The development of this crop during the past decade has been little short of marvelous, and well informed Nebras - kans are wont to declare that Nebraska dates her permanent prosper - ity from the time that her people awoke to a realizing sense of the importance of this wonderful plant. Drouth or flood, alfalfa keeps right on pouring its wealth into the lap of the husbandman. If the corn crop is short, alfalfa steps into the breach and makes it unneces - sary to sacrifice the young stock on a panic-stricken market. A dozen years ago a comparatively unknown agricultural product, in this good year of our Lord, 1909, its value as a product is exceeded only by wheat and corn.

The deputy commissioner con - fidently expects to have 750,000 reported in 1910, and before another inaugural ceremony is held in the national capital the alfalfa acreage in Nebraska will exceed a million. Merely to emphasize the mis - taken notion of the governor above mentioned, a picture is here given of an alfalfa field in Dawes county.

A decade ago that immediate section of Nebraska was looked upon as worth little save for grazing purposes. To show the diversity of crops in the section of Nebraska once comdemned by Governor James E. Boyd to eternal grazing and cattle raising, a picture is given of a potato field.

That this wild hay crop should be taken into account is evidenced by the fact that the 1908 crop was worth $24,398,442, and the 1909 crop will not only be larger by many thousands of tons, but it will be worth more per ton. The attention of Nebraskans — and all other people — is called to the poultry figures included in this bulletin. In 1908 the assessors reported a total of 6,155,765 chickens in Nebraska. This year they report 11, - 177,264, an increase of over 5,000,000. It has been difficult to impress upon the minds of the assessors and those assessed the importance of taking into account the little flocks of chickens — the half-dozen or dozen hens of the small villagers. The egg and poultry crop of Nebraska means many millions of dollars to Nebraska.

FORESTRY IN NEBRASKA Despite all the publicity given to Nebraska In the years gone by, there are doubtless millions of people who yet believe that Nebraska is a treeless plain. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nebraska is the home of "Arbor Day," and its founder, J. Sterling Morton, lived long enough to see the fruits of his idea. Nebraska is today a well wooded state. Nor is the forest restricted to fruit bearing trees. Vast groves of walnut, oak, catalpa, cottonwood and other trees deck the once treeless prairie, and the traveler need not seek far for cooling shade. One single example may be given as proof that trees grow in Ne - braska: In 1872 Josiah Miner located on a homestead in Saline county. He was a soldier during the Civil war, being a member of Co. A, Thirty - third Iowa. He has lived upon that Saline county homestead ever since, and is today living in a house built from lumber sawed from trees that he planted with his own hand. More than that, he is today the owner of a splendid walnut orchard that is 'growing into money faster than compound interest. Elsewhere will be found a picture of a portion of Mr. Miner '8 -walnut grove. In a very few years it will be of commercial size — and everybody knows what walnut lumber is worth. ORCHARDING IN NEBRASKA The growing of fruit Is an industry that is rapidly developing in Nebraska. Especially is this true in the matter of apples, peaches, cher - ries and " grapes. v The hill lands adjoining the Missouri river offer es - peciaf facilities to the grape grower, and the valley lands of the easten) end of the state make ideal orchard lands. Small fruits grow well in 'practically every portion of the state. Some of the largest apple and peach orchards in the republic are located in Nebraska, and tjie careful horttpulturist is prospering." Many small orchards, ad - juncts to farm lands, add to the income Of the owners. With advanced knowledge concerning fruit growing, careful use of the sprayer and care in picking and poking, Nebraska fruit growers are rapidly taking first rank, and the products of their orchards are sought for by shrewd buyers from all sections t»f 'the country. </seg>

            <seg id="p072">MANUFACTURING NEBRASKA While agriculture always has been, and in the nature of things always must be, the basis of Nebraska's material wealth, the fact is that this state is rapidly forging to the front in manufacturing lines. In this connection is given the following interview with the deputy labor commissioner, published in a number of Nebraska newspapers in June: "Of course Nebraska is a great agricultural state — one of the very greatest," said Deputy Labor Commissioner Maupin, the other day. "Other states may raise a greater number of bushels of corn and wheat and oats, but Nebraska raises more corn, wheat and oats per capita than any other state. In all three of these grains our yield per acre is away yonder ahead of the general average of all the states. We've got 'em all beat in optput of hay, wild, timothy and alfalfa. We have every reason to boast of our agricultural resources, but agriculture is no longer our sole dependence. It is the basis of all wealth, to be sure, not only in Nebraska, but everywhere else, but the time has come in the history of Nebraska when we may feel satisfied that our agricultural supremacy is no longer questioned or menaced, and therefore devote some time and attention to letting the world know what we are doing along other lines. "We are doing some manufacturing in Nebraska — when we get wise to our opportunities we will do more. In 1908 Nebraska manufac - turing plants and industries turned out $151,000,000 worth of manu - factured goods from raw material raised mostly in Nebraska. That was $20,000,000 more than the value of our iive stock in 1908. Men engaged in mechanical pursuits, including transportation, received upward of $30,000,000 in wages in Nebraska in 1908. Ever stop to think what a great variety of articles we manufacture in Nebraska? I'll give you a partial list, and it will help you form some idea of our growing import - ance as a manufacturing state." Deputy Labor Commissioner Maupin then fixed up the following list: Automobiles, alfalfa meal, aprons, artifical stone, awnings Beet sugar, beer, buttons, brooms, baking powder, boots, boxes, brick, breakfast foods, butter, barrels. Carriages, creamery supplies, candy, caps, crackerjack, cornice, crackers, canned goods, cigars. Dental supplies, dusters, divans, dressers.

All the wheat that is raised in Nebraska and not exported ought to be ground in Nebraska mills, and the Nebraskan who neglects or refuses to insist upon having Nebraska ground flour in the kitchen lacks some of the needful elements of state pride and patriotism. Everything made in Nebraska and put on exhibition anywhere ought to be labeled, 'Made in Nebraska.'

No manufacturing establishment is so small that its product will not go to swelling the grand total of Nebraska's rapidly growing manufacturing output It is the multiplicity of small enterprises that go to make up a total of which everj- Nebraskan should be proud. The Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics is under many obligations to &lt;he manufacturers who have shown a willingness to co-operate in tn e work of making public the truth about Nebraska's manufacturing enterprises. It is to be hoped that this co-operation will be improved upon during the years to come, and that every manufacturer will take a pride in adding his "mite" to the total. The number of enterprises reporting for 1908 shows a healthy in - crease over 1907. The growth indicated by the comparative tables is only apparent. While there has been a handsome increase, a goodly portion of the Increase shown in 1908 is due to the increased number of industries reporting. The wage scale may at first glance be mis - leading. The grand total of wages earned in 1908, including all lines of productive effort apart from domestic service and farm help, will doubtless aggregate upwards of $30,000,000. This will not appear too liberal an estimate when one considers that in the total given in the annexed table no account is made of transportation service, general job printing, plumbers, gasfitters, leatherworkers, electrical workers, ma - chinists, boilennakers, carpenters, and other skilled mechanical trades. It takes time, as well as money, to bring a statistical bureau anywhere near perfection, and until very recent years Nebraska has been sadly behind her sister states in preparation and equipment for securing this desirable information. With its limited equipment and financial support the Bureau of Labor and Industi.al Statistics feels that it is making good headway in the collection of this needed information. </seg>

            <seg id="p078">INTRODUCTION In presenting this, the first bulletin of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics devoted entirely to Labor Organizations, I desire to thank the officers and members of those Unions who have so cheer - fully complied with the requests made for data and statistics. It is only natural, under the circumstances, that there should be evidence of a suspi - cion that the information was sought for ulterior reasons, and that the Bulletin be, therefore, incomplete in many respects. There is every reason to believe, however, that in future it will be easier to secure the information sought and that succeeding Bulletins will be more complete and satisfactory. It is needless to say that in this work every effort has been made, within the resources of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics, to make the presentations accurate. While the law creating the Bureau is broad in its scope, it is only the just due of the present chief and his predecessors to say that the means at the command of the Bureau are and have been wholly insufficient to carry out the work demanded. For instance, any one of the semi-annual "Reports of the Statistics of Labor" issued by the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor costs more than is annually appropriated for the maintenance of the Nebraska Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics, and the duty of gathering labor and industrial statistics is only one of twenty-one duties devolving upon the Bureau. It is the hope of the compiler of this Bulletin that it will be of such interest and advantage to the state at large that in good time the people will realize the necessity of properly equipping the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics so that it may perform efficient work. So far as known, this Bulletin contains the first compilation of the Labor Laws of Nebraska, outside of the Statutes themselves. This, too, is the first time any effort has been made by the Bureau to collect and collate "cost ot living" statistics, and while as a first effort the results are meagre, they will, at least, serve to arouse interest, and in this way tend towards a better support of the Bureau. WILL M. MAUPIN, Deputy Labor Commissioner. State House, Lincoln, March 31, 1910. $ </seg>
            <seg id="p079">TRADES UNION TERMS STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS— DEFINING THE TERMS. Distinction should be made between a "strike" and a "lockout," although it is often difficult to draw such distinction in practice. But, broadly stated, a "strike" is a concerted withdrawal from work by a part or all of the employes of an establishment, or several establish - ments, to enforce a demand on the part of the employes. A "lockout" i3 a refusal on the part of the employer or employers to permit a part or all of tbe employes to work, such refusal being made to enforce a demand on the part of the employers. In a "strike" the employes take the initi - ative; In a "lockout" the employers take the initiative. Even this explanation, however, is not sufficient. Not every strike is based upon a refusal to meet the demands of the strikers. A very common cause of strikes is a refusal on the part of employes to accede to demands made or terms proposed by employers, and a lockout may owe its initiation to a demand on the part of the employes. The Massachusetts Bureau of Labor, than which no better organized Bureau exists, has perfected a new classification by grouping together on the one hand all cessations of employment which result from a movement begun in the first instance by the employes and terming them "attack disputes;" and by including on the other hand all cessations of employment resulting from the initiative of the employer in making some change in the conditions of employment, and terming them "defense disputes." The following from the 1908 Report of the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor, Charles F. Gettamy, director, is so clear and concise that it is given as the best possible presentation of th* subject. "An unfortunate result likely to arise from careless interpretation, on the part of the general public, of the technical distinction between strikes and lockouts is the tendency to attribute a certain degree of blame to the party inaugurating the dispute. It appears that there is a much larger proportion of strikes than of lockouts, and employes are, therefore, more apt to be held to a greater share of responsibility. But when it is ascertained that a considerable number of disputes classed as strikes is due to resistance to proposed reduction of wages or other changes in working conditions, rather than to demands by employes, some of the onus which might attach to a strike may be removed; yet the fact is not always understood by the ordinary reader of newspaper ac - counts of individual strikes or by the reader of strike statistics." • </seg>
            <seg id="p080">80 BIENNIAL REPORT OF "CLOSED SHOP" AJfD "OPEIC SHOP." In the generally accepted definition of the term, an "open shop" la one not recognizing union rules and conditions, while the "closed shop" Is one wherein only members of trades unions are employed. Trades Unionists, however, do not accept these definitions, preferring' the terms "non-union shop" and "union shop." The reason for this preference is not far to seek. The so-called "closed shop" is open to any member of the crafts employed who will abide by certain well defined shop rules, and pay an equal proportion of the burden of securing and maintaining the better conditions that have resulted from the efforts of the Trade Unionists. The so-called "open shop" is closed to the Union worker who is unwilling to work by the side of men eager to benefit from the better conditions brought about by Trades Union agitation and effort, but un - willing to pay their share of the expense necessary to the securing of the conditions which the non-union man enjoys equally with the union man. The Trades Union has so often been denominated a "labor trust" that it might be well to show the difference. A trust seeks to limit the benefits of the organization to the least possible number. A Trades Union seeks to confer its benefits upon the largest possible number. A trust deals with the product of human toil. A Trades Union deals with the sole merchandise of the toiler — his labor. The trust-made product that is not sold today may be kept in stock and sold tomorrow. The labor of the worker must be sold today, or it is forever lost The trust deals with inanimate things. The Trades Union deals with the men and women who produce the articles sold by the trust. The trust speaks in terms of dollars and cents. The Trades Union speaks in terms of souls and bodies. r LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. A labor organization is a combination of workingmen and working women of the same trade, or of several allied trades, for the purpose o securing, by united action, the most favorable conditions obtainable as regards wages, hours of labor, sanitary surroundings, etc., for its mem bere, each member contributing a stated sum, either by fixed dues o percentage assessments, based on wages earned, the funds thus obtained to be used either for defense, education or insurance purposes. Broadly speaking, there are three distinct types of labor organiza - tions in the United States: The "local" trade union, which is composed of the workers engaged in a single occupation, and who live and work in the seme locality. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">BUREAU OP LABOR 81 Certain locals are sub-divided, as in the case of Typographical Unions, which maintain "chapels" in each printing office. The business of a local union i« transacted by direct action of its members in formal meetings. The "delegate" unions are bodies made up of representatives from different local unions of the various trades in a given locality, and are variously known as "central labor unions," "district councils," "joint executive boards," etc. The purpose of such delegates unions is to secure concerted action, and to afford an adequate means for the ex - change of information pertaining to the well being of the whole body of workers The "international" unions are made up of local unions, the latter having more or less complete autonomy, and join in the government of the general body. The American Federation of Labor is formed by the banding together of a great majority of the international unions. The American Federation of Labor has established an alliance between members of trades that have much in common, as, for instance, the "Building Trades Depart - ment," made up of workers engaged in the different branches of the building trades; the "Metal Trades Department," made up of workers in all branches of the metal working industry. The "Allied Printing Trades Council" is made up of representatives of the different branches of the printing trades, printers, pressmen, stereotypers, bookbinders and photo-engravers. ARBITRATION, MEDIATION, CONCILIATION. Once more we are indebted to Mr. Gettamy of the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor for concise explanations of these terms. In his 1908 report be says: "While there is, unfortunately, considerable looseness in the general use of the fundamental terms connected with the methods of collective bargaining and arbitration, there are, strictly speaking, clear distinc - tions between (d) collective bargaining, (e) mediation, (f) conciliation, and (g) arbitration. "(d) Collective bargaining is the process by which the general terms of the labor contract itself, whether the contract be written or oral, are determined by negotiation directly between employers or employers' associations and organized workingmen. "(e) Mediation Is the intervention, usually uninvited, of some out - side person or body, with a view to bringing the parties to a dispute together in conciliatory conferences. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 BIENNIAL REPORT OF "(f) Conciliation is the settlement, by the parties directly, of minor disputes, as to the interpretation of the terms of the labor contract, and as to- whether that contract be an express one or only a general understanding. "(g) Arbitration is the authoritative decision by some person or persons other than the parties immediately concerned to whom the issue involved has usually been submitted. "Arbitration in the strict sense implies the rendering of an authori - tative decision. Conciliation and collective bargainng imply amicable conference and agreement by the parties themselves. Mediation is only a preliminary to the settlement of a dispute. Through the intervention of a mediator the parties may be led to conciliate — that is, to reach an agreement among themselves — or they may be led to submit the matter to the arbitration of the person who mediates or to some other person. THE RELATION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL UNIONS. (Massachusetts Bureau of Labor, Report for 1908.) From the historical point of view the local union was the first type of labor organization. The great international organizations were Duilt up by the alliance for mutual encouragement and support of exist - ing local unions. At the present time it is seldom attempted to build international unions in any other way than by uniting existing locals. The printers were probably the first of the trade unions in the United States to form a national organization, the convention out of which the International Typographical Union grew having been held on December 2, 1850. The national association of stonecutters may possibly be as old, or older, but the exact date of its origin is not known. It had an established position and a regularly published official journal as early as 1857. The United Sons of Vulcan, one of the predecessors of the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers, was formed in 1858, the Iron Molders' Union in 1869, and the National Cigar Makers' Union in 1864. The local union preceded the national by nearly half a century, the New York Society of Journeymen Shipwrights having been incorporated in 1803 and the house carpenters of New York in 1806. We have been unable to learn, however, in how far the aims and methods of these societies coincided with those of the present-day trade unions. A union of tailors is said to have been formed in 1806, one of hatters in 1819, the Baltimore union of printers in 1831, and the Newark union of Stone - cutters in 1834. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">BUREAU OF LABOR 83 In Great Britain local unions of tailors and of weavers were in existence in the early part of the eighteenth century, and by the year 1800 the movement had grown considerably. National unions, however, even in Great Britain, were not in vogue until the nineteenth century. The Friendly Society of Iron Founders, which now has 19,501 members, was established in 1809; the United Boiler Makers and Iron and Steel Ship Builders, whose present membership is 52,776, in 1834. The two British unions which have branches in this country — the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners — were established in their present form in 1851 and 1860, respec - tively. The former has a total membership of 110,084, the latter of 68,735. Although the local union was historically the first form of organiza - tion a very large proportion of the local unions which exist today, and a large proportion of those which from day to day come into existence, are, in fact, the offspring of national organizations. Some of the stronger national unions maintain regularly paid organizers, who devote either the whole or some portion of their time to traveling from place to place for the purpose of encouraging and strengthening existing locals of their trade and establishing new locals. The American Federation of Labor has 1,046 general organizers bearing its commission, in all parts of the country, who are more or less constantly active in the neighborhood of their homes in organizing not only the workmen of their own trades, but those in other trades as well. During 1908 the Federation kept in the field, upon the average, some twenty-five special organizers under salary. A portion of the time of these men is devoted to the settlement of disputes, the super - vision of strikes, and other work of maintenance and conservation, but their energies are chiefly directed to bringing the unorganised into the union ranks, and especially to the establishment of new local unions where there has been no organization of the crafts concerned. The local trade union, properly so called, is composed of men of a single occupation. There are also workers who can not well be brought into unions of the regular type, because not enough members of their separate craft can be gathered. The Knights of Labor set the example of forming "mixed assemblies," composed of workers in various industries. The American Federation of Labor has also found It desir - able to adopt this method of organization, for the purpose of absorbing those workingmen whom it would be impossible to organize otherwise, and has established in many localities "federal labor unions," into which are welcomed all wage-earners whose occupations do not make them eligible to any trade union in the town. Some of these federal unions have become large and flourishing bodies, although it is not desired to </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 BIENNIAL REPORT OP secure for them a large permanent membership. They are regarded rather as recruiting stations from which each class of workers, as soon as enough members of it have been gathered to form a separate union, are to be drawn off to an independent organization of their own. The constitutions of national and international unions usually pro - vide that local unions may be established by not less than five, seven or ten workers at the occupation. It is often also provided that the local can not be dissolved so long as a given number of members, usually the same number that is required for establishing it, are willing to retain the charter. In many cases, when a local already exists, its con - sent must be obtained before a second can be established, or if it objects the general executive board of the national or international often has power to overrule its objections. Each local union, even when subordinate to an international organiza - tion, is a self-governing unit Its theoretical relation to the international body is similar to that of one of the states to the United States. The local body has power to do anything which is not specifically forbidden in the international constitution. Rates of wages are, of necessity, matters of local consideration in almost all trades. Hours of labor are also fixed locally, in most trades, according to local conditions. The regula - tion of apprenticeship is left by many internationals to the locals, and even when international rules are made the locals often make further restrictions. A few international unions fix initiation fees and dues, but in many cases local unions fix them, either without any restriction or subject to a maximum or a minimum limit. Locals levy assessments upon their members, and inflict fines and other forms of discipline. Hardly any restriction is placed upon the power to collect local asseso - ments, except that in a few cases it is forbidden to raise them to support strikes unauthorized by the international officers. In the matter of discipline there is usually appeal to the international authorities, and a few international unions forbid the imposition of a fine above a certain amount without the approval of the international executive board. Us - ually, however, the local unions are vested with almost complete local autonomy. </seg>

            <seg id="p121">* STATISTICAL INFORMATION The incompleteness of the following statistical tables is not due to any lack of effort upon the part of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics to secure them. As before stated, this is practically the first attempt ever made by the Nebraska bureau to gather such statistics, and the natural result is more or less incompleteness. Despite the efforts of the commissioner to make the inquiries as plain and as simple as possible, many local secretaries faltered when they approached the task. Others simply treated the repeated requests of the Bureau with indifference, is not contempt. One secretary, acting for a local in Omaha, informed the commissioner that he "wouldn't furnish the statistics unless compelled to do so at the end of a lawsuit." He was informed that there was no intention of "forcing" any secretaries to co-operate with the Bureau, and that if secretaries of local unions, and the members thereof, could not see the advantage to the work of organization of the proposed work of the department, certainly the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics would not undertake to force those benefits upon them. But it is especially gratifying to note that a large majority of the secretaries made honest efforts to co-operate with the department, and with the experience thus gained in the preparation of this Bulletin, both the commissioner and the secretaries will be able to prepare a much more comprehensive and valuable Bulletin next year. The commissioner begs leave to call to the attention of the local organiaztions throughout the state the value of keeping a comprehensive set of books for the locals. The history of a local union should be familiar to every member, and its statistics should be kept up to date as a very necessary means of having at hand the best arguments for sustaining the demands of the organization. The commissioner begs the co-operation of all secretaries in the efforts to so equip the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics that it may in future prepare and publish Bulletins of Organized Labor in Ne - braska that will be as valuable as they are interesting and instructive. *. </seg>

            <seg id="p140">I COST OF LIVING The difficulty of securing cost of living statistics can not be thoroughly appreciated until one has tried it In a commonwealth like Nebraska, where living expenses vary so much, and where so many opportunities are afforded for adding to one's wage or salary by raising "garden truck," it is practically impossible to secure satisfactory averages. Espe - cially is this true at the first attempt, as this one was. In this first attempt at statistical reporting on the "cost of living" in Nebraska, twenty families, representing twelve occupations and twenty different localities were selected, and after agreeing to keep the statistics were furnished with the proper blanks. Of the twenty, only ten re - sponded, and of that number only six were reported in such shape as to make comparisons possible. Not all of these are renters, but where the reporter owned his own property he was asked to give an estimate of what he would have to pay in the way of rental if he was merely a tenant. As the rental problem is a pressing one the following table will be interesting. Instead of giving names numbers will be used for obvious reasons: No. Location. Annual Wage. Rent per Yr. Per Cent "No. 1" in the above table is not a member of a trades union, but represents a large professional class properly catalogued as wage earn - ers. The use of this case materially increases the average of wages paid, but does not materially change the average of rentals. The average wage in the organized trades, according to the reports made to the Bureau, was a fraction less than $850 per year. This is greatly in excess 4o. 1. so. 2. &lt;o. 3. &lt;o. 4. Mo. 5.

The fuel problem in a state like Nebraska is always a pressing one. The use of wood for fuel is very limited save in a few agricultural communities. The bituminous product is drawn from Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Colorado and Wyoming. In Omaha and Lincoln, to a considerable extent, and in one or two other cities to a limited extent, gas is used far fuel in kitchens. For the purposes of this bulletin the whole fuel supply, both for heating and cooking, was included under the general head of "fuel." The reports show that an average of $131.66 per year per family was paid for clothing. The average cost of clothing per income was .094, or nearly ten per cent of income for this single item.

            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA STATE FEDERATION OF LABC R The Nebraska State Federation of Labor was organized at Lincoln on June 22, 1909. It is a delegate body, made up of delegates from the local trades and labor unions of the state, one delegate for each 100 members or fraction thereof. The body is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The officers for the year 1910 are as follows: President, Frank M. Cofley, Typographical, Lincoln, Neb.; first vice-presi - dent, John C. Trouten, Federal Union, South Omaha, Neb.; second vice - president, Will M. Maupin, Typographical, Lincoln, Neb.; third vice - president, J. A. Booth, Cigarmakers, Fremont, Neb.; fourth vice-president, John Lambert, Carpenters, Fairbury, Neb.; secretary-treasurer, Frank P. Hart, Carpenters, C. L. U., South Omaha, Neb.; sargeant-at-arms, A. A. Hyers, Machinists, Havelock, Neb. Legislative Committee: Frank M. Coffey, Chairman, Lincoln, Neb.; S. A. D. Smith, Havelock, Neb.; John C. Lynch, Omaha, Neb.; Jas. Kotera, South Omaha, Neb.; T. C. Kelsey, Lincoln, Neb.; C. L. Widman, Fremont, Neb. Delegate to A. F. of L.. M. H. Chrisman, Omaha, Neb. The 1911 convention of the Nebraska Federation of Labor will meet at Havelock on January 3. The "Declaration of Principles" of the Nebraska State Federation of Labor is as follows: "The aim of government should be to protect man in his natural rights; to promote domestic tranquility; to promote the general wel - fare; and to insure the blessings of liberty. "From time immemorial a law-favored and law-making few have enjoyed idle luxury at the expense of the toiling many. About the only rights vouchsafed to the toiler is the right to sin, starve and suffer. "Under the present organization and manipulation of legislation the burdens of life are unequally distributed. The non-producing class, by reason of its having ample time to devote to the perpetuation of the causes which at present unfairly divide the results of honest toil, tends to perpetuate the evil, instead of diminishing the burden. "Wherever one is getting without workirig, somewhere, some place someone is working without getting. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 BIENNIAL REPORT OF I "IT THEREFORE, behooves the man who toils, the laboring man, to take such action and adopt such measures as will beet insure his self-preservation. "WE, THEREFORE, pledge ourselves to assist each other in secur - ing the best possible wages and best possible treatment to the laboring class by all honorable means, and we will withdraw, and use our in - fluence to have others withdraw, all patronage from unfair employers. "WE FURTHER PLEDGE ourselves to assist in guaranteeing to each national and international organization affiliated with the Nebraska State Federation of Labor the trade autonomy or control of their own busi - ness."

            <seg id="p146">THE MORTGAGE RECORD The mortgage record (or 1908 affords satisfaction to those whok are interested in watching the development of Nebraska. The farm being the basis of wealth production it naturally follows that agricultural prosperity will reflect prosperity upon all other forms of human en - deavor. The mortgage record for 1908 shows a splendid improvement over 1907. Fewer farm mortgages were filed in 1908 than in 1907, and the indebtedness incurred in 1908 was smaller than that incurred in 1907. While the number of mortgages released in 1908 was smaller than in 1907, the total amount of indebtedness released in 1908 was greater than in 1907. The apparent discrepancy between this statement and the figures in the annexed table is explained when it is noted that the $126,357,791.56 of farm mortgages released in 1907, $100,000,000 repre - sents a railroad mortgage released in Hall county, and cannot, therefore, be properly charged to the farm mortgage account. At first glance it may appear that the city mortgage record for 1908 does not make a good showing as compared with 1907. But a little in vestigation will prove the contrary The city mortgages record for 1901 shows an increase both in number of mortgages filled and in amount But this seems to have been due wholly to the fact that the number o home owners has been rapidly increasing. The wage earner who has saved up a little nest egg has bought a lot, and having secured title has proceeded to build a little home, securing payments for the same by giv ing a mortgage upon the completed house. That this is an explanation of the increase in the city mortgages is made certain by the scores of in - stances within the knowledge of the chief of this department. The per - centage of home owners among the mechanics, clerks and tradesmen of the cities is increasing at a rate that promises well for the commonwealth. While comparative statistics are not available, it is believed that if com - parison were possible it would be shown that Nebraska is well to the front in the percentage of citizens owning their own homes, just as she is at the front in the percentage of population able to read and write. Ne - braska is rapidly becoming a state of home owners, a fact which makes for peace and industrial prosperity. </seg>
