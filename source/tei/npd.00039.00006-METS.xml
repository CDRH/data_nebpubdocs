            <seg id="p003">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 3 A New Economic Principle The passage of the "Nebraska Workmen's Compensa - tion Law" by the legislature of 1913 introduced a new eco - nomic principle into the affairs of the state government. The first workmen's compensation law was enacted in Germany, July 6, 1884. Forty-tivo of the civilized nations of the world note have such laws. Thirty-six states of the United States have made this practically new economic principle a part of the statute laic of the state. Workmen's compensation laws are distinctively a prod - uct of modern, social and economic conditions. The underlying principle, which is the foundation of workmen's compensation, is that the burden of accidents occurring in any industry shall become a part of the cost of the production in that industry, to the end that the con - sumer of the product will eventually bear the expense of tin sanh. This principle of social right and justice means that the loss occasioned by accidental injury is as much a part of the cost of the article produced as in any other los.-- which might be occasioned by the destruction of material or flu brt ■akinfi or wearing out, or replacing of machinery and tools of any kind. By most any sort of careful reasoning one will reach the conclusion that compensation paid to an injured workman as the result of an accident "arising out of and in the course of his employment" bears as close rela - tionship to the cost of producing a commodity (in which tin i mploye is engaged at the time of the accident) as does the cost, expense or loss occasioned by broken machinery or equipment. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 4 "Safety First" Suggestions The mere installation of safety devices does not discharge the duty of the employer. The employer should realize that furnishing safety devices is only his initiation into the campaign of accident prevention. He must insist upon their use at all times. Delay is much better than an accident, from both the financial and humane standpoints. The employer who provides a safety device to ostensibly com - ply with an order of the inspector, and then requests, encourages, consents to or acquiesces in its non-use is in no situation to insist that his employe who is injured thereby is not entitled to com - pensation because of the non-use of such safety device. Don't forget this. No employer is without fault until he has placed in operation in his plant the precautions that will reduce accidents therein to the inevitable class. Industrial accidents are of tu-o classes, the inevitable and the preventable. Inevitable accidents do not result from the fault of anyone, and the loss occasioned thereby is naturally a part of the cost of production. Preventable accidents result from the fault of someone. As between the employer and the employe, they result either from the failure of the employer to place in operation such pre - cautions or to use such safety devices, or to exercise due care. As to injuries resulting from accidents happening on account of the fault of the employer, the employers, by such a course of conduct, recognize the expense thereof as a legitimate part of the cost of production. For years Nebraska employers carried liability insurance to indemnify themselves against loss for injuries caused by such accidents. Certainly the cost of such insurance has been treated as a part of the expense of operation, and, therefore, is a part of the cost of production, to be borne ultimately by the consumer. It would be a fallacy to even imagine that the aggregate of the premiums paid for such insurance do not so far exceed the li - abilities of the employer for such injuries as to pay the expenses of such insurance, and leave the companies writing it a profit. Insurance is business, not sentiment. It is carried on for profit. </seg>

            <seg id="p006">6 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Short "Safety First" Sermons The employe who thinks he can learn thinks a great truth. Carefulness costs you nothing and its value cannot be meas- ured. Eight out of ten accidents would never happen if the eight injured men had the safety habit. Accidents cost those who are injured pain, worry, suffering, loss of time and wages. Why not avoid them? The principal factor in accident prevention is the application of good common sense. Working for "safety" is the highest form of service. Safety men are humanity's greatest friends. It takes only a moment of carelessness to cause a lifetime of suffering. Guards are placed on machinery for the protection of the employe. Don't operate the machinery unless guards are in place It is the chance takers who make widows and orphans. Every warning sign means a danger is pointed out there Take the safety way. Life is too short to take chances. Regrets don't bring lost legs, arms and eyes. Recklessness is no indication of courage. Brave men a ways cautious. Do not work with defective chains, cables, tools or appliances of any kind, or even in an unsafe place. Carefully examine same and report dangerous conditions to your employer. Wear goggles when working around circular saws, chipf handling acid, cutting cables, working at emery wheels, etc. A careful man's greatest risk of injury is because of carele ness on the part of someone else. Watch the other fellow. Get the safety habit. Don't take chances. Learn all the rul understand your work thoroughly. Study the dangers- ineidt thereto and avoid them. Think before you act. Safety appliances are placed on machinery for your prote tion and benefit. Use them. Carelessness is the cause of many advoidable injuries. In fact it can safely be said that carelessness in some form or otlu is responsible for more accidents than any other specific raits Carelessness sometimes takes the form of downright recklessnes, although it is mor\ frequently manifested as mere thoughtles. ness or indifference. Every workman should be thoroughly impressed with the fact that his safety and the safety of his fellow irorh»i&lt; -n d&lt;j&gt;rtidx n/io), his own carefulness. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 7 he Nebraska compensation law was passed by the thirty-third ses- islature 11913-1914) and was designated as "Workmen's Compensation Law of 1913." Under the provisions of the constitution the law would have been in effect July 18, 1913. Those opposed to making the principle of compensation for work accidents regardless of fault a :he statute law of the state circulated a petition and the law was abeyance until after the referendum election in November, 191 1. In the November election of 1914 the people of the state approved the law and compensation for work accidents regardless of fault become a part of the statutes of Nebraska, December 1, 1914, by a proclamation by Governor John H. Morehead as directed by the provisions of iative and referendum law. The Principle of Workmen's Compensation The principle of workmen's compensation is that industry in general should bear the financial burden of all industrial accidents rather than the workers who happen to be the victims of particular accidents, and that the only way this can be accomplished is through the agency of the em - ployer who, in computing costs and fixing the price of his finished product will include the industrial losses due to accidents. Industrial operations being broadly considered, the question of direct fault is not material. The fact that loss of bodily faculty and regular wages occurs entitles the victim to compensation unless his injuries have been received through his own wilful intent. In this concept of social ob - ligation the compensation principle differs from the old system of em - ployers' liability, under which the employer paid damages only where the accident was due to his fault or the fault of his servants. Further Extension of Employers' Liability The liability of employers under the statute could have been and un - doubtedly will be further increased by the enactment of safety requirements and regulations, the violation of which would imply negligence and create liability on the part of the employers. This phase of the subject is illus - trated by federal law. Under the safety appliance act affecting interstate railroad employes, as interpreted by the United States supreme court, the employer is under an absolute duty not only to install specified safety appliances but to keep them in order. The original argument of the rail - road companies was that, having installed safety appliances as required by the statute, their full duty was performed by using reasonable care </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR in keeping them in order, but this contention the supreme court ov deciding that the duty imposed upon the railroad company a fety appliances was a continuing one anil that the company w an employe injured from failure to keep the appliances in orde this it is apparent that if compensation had not been proposed thi ployers' liability would ultimately have been greatly increased both b the removal of the common law and statute defenses and the adopt strict safety requirements. Since it is certain that liability law as they are upon negligence or the violation of a statutory duty, can i reach all accidents, as many can not be traced to legal fault of any an employer would have found himself under the burden of an expe liability law without affording protection to all of his employ Questions Should be Considered Separately Each of the problems arising under the compensation act shoul considered separately, and that much of the confusion that exist* the subject is due to the fact that public opinion with regard to a ticular statute is controlled and influenced by some particular featui the law, when, as a matter of fact, that particular feature is merely - dental and not essential to the operation of the principle of workr compensation. This became apparent, for example, when persons found criticising compensation legislation in general, when as a fact antipathy had been aroused merely by reason of a particular defe&lt; through faulty method of administration which can easily be cured the other hand, persons are found praising aparticular method ol ministration, entirely unmindful of the fact that equally fortunate re are reached under other methods. The principle of granting compensation to injured workmen, re| less of fault, is the essential attribute of a compensation act; that prir p should be tested upon its own merits. The methods of administr: and of insuring the payment of compensation are entirely separable the consideration of the principle of workmen's compensation. Prior to the enactment of the Compensation Law, Nebraska had prac - tically no legislation on its statute books providing for industrial safety. Other states have had factory inspection laws and acts of a similar nature designed to provide safety and sanitation in all working places. The absence of any law of this nature in this state means that there is an open field in which to work that must be pioneered in such a manner as to secure the best results and to efficiently surround employes with safe conditions of employment. One of the great objects of the com - pensation act is to reduce the number of accidents occurring in the in - dustrial field in this state. This can be best brought about by enlisting the active support and cooperation of both employer and employe. Each preventable accident that is allowed to take place, represents a costly error in social efficiency for the value of a human life cannot be estim - ated, entirely, in dollars and cents. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 9 Necessity for Safety First When the appalling 1 number of industrial accidents is considered the necessity for the Safety First movement is convincingly apparent. A multitude of strong men are each year being rendered useless to the community and non-supporting to themselves and families as a result of industrial accidents. The toll in death, in permanent disability and tem - porary loss of time, with suffering and want as the attendant on mis - fortune, is startingly large. The propaganda of Safety First has been widely diffused that people everywhere know what it means. The ncies teaching the principles of this life saving creed are the insurance ■g lanies and the large individual employers of labor. It is gratifying link of the work that is being accomplished along this line. The so apparent that every employer of any considerable number of arks on its wonderful results. Even in remote logging camps where accidents are only occasionally reported, and where doctors are not immediately available, in response to the question, "Was medical aid furnished by you?" the answer is written in, "First Aid service at camp." Wherever "First Aid" is, "Safety First" has been there. Safety Appliance It is hardly necessary to refer to the objective of safety appliances. The state, in its mature judgment, as voiced by its legislature, should make certain requisitions on employers operating hazardous industries. It should impose obligations to see that these requisitions are met. Safety appliances wherever possible must be installed. The state's interest in this subject is ostensibly one of economic value, yet everyone knows, who has given public movements a moment's thought that back of every law like this is the sentiment of humanity dwelling in the public heart. To protect human life and guard against injury to body and limb are cardinal elements in human life itself. The necessity for collective co-operation is so urgent and appalling in this age of tremendous operations that the individual is being looked after by the public. The body politic, which has heretofore been considered an individual without soul or sentiment, has developed into an entity possessing all these attributes which dis - tinguish man from the brute creation. Therefore the public in the great industrial world is solicitious regarding the safety of its individual. It goes with him into the mines and insists that rational condtions must be maintained; that avenues of escape must be provided for in case of un - expected calamity. It accompanies him to the mills, smelters, workshops and logging camps and waits until safety appliances are installed to guard the thoughtless and unwary from the exposed belts, shaftings, gearings, pulleys, saws and protruding set screws. </seg>

Many employers who ha^ their own insurance have settled work accidents suffered by th ployes under the provisions of the compensation law, but have failed an neglected to make the reports to the department. Several of the insurance companies are likewise guilty of neglect in reporting all of the cases which they have settled under their policies. This makes the assembling of data and statistics difficult. The Nebraska compensation law needs amending in many instances The more specific suggestions for amendments, as time and experience will suggest, will be more fully covered in the biennial report of this department.

            <seg id="p011">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 11 pensation law as it now reads settlements may be made between the parties. If they cannot agree then the controversy may be submitted to mutual arbitration. If mutual arbitration cannot be agreed upon, then the matter is submitted to a court of equity. Under this method of ttlements many injured employes are at the mercy of the employers and the representatives of insurance companies. There are a large num- ber of reports on file in the department of labor which on the face of the report show that the employe has not received the full . amount of benefits to which he is entitled. The injured employe does not understand sufficiently just what his rights are and to avoid the expense of legal he submits oftentimes to a settlement which is far from what aw authorizes. The purpose of the compensation law is to get relief ured employe and his family when that relief is needed and without long drawn out negotiations and litigation. The representative e company too often knows the immediate ned of relief of red employe and proceeds to negotiate and consume time before a proffered. The pressing needs of the injured employe and sften under the present method of settlement necessitates terms of settlement not in accord with the provisions i aw. The employer pays a premium to the insurance company on hat the injured employe and his dependents will be com- irding to the provisions of the law, and that there is to be sharp practice or shaving down of these settlements as to benefits. The law must be so amended that there will be some board or some in- ithed with sufficient judicial powers that an immediate order iy be made covering each accident. Compliance with this order or find- should be enforced during a review by a court of equity, if such review be desired by either party. The fact that nineteen states out of thirty-one, which have com- jn laws, have adopted the two weeks' waiting period, does not iblish the wisdom of allowing that length of time for an levelop and determine if it justifies payment of compensation. The Colorado compensation law provides a waiting period of twenty-one the Federal statute contains a provision for fifteen days. Six have a waiting period of one week, two states have ten days. Oregon. Washington and Vermont have no waiting period. Nebraska and Nevada have waiting periods of two weeks, and if disability extends beyond eight weeks, the compensation is paid from the date of the in- jury. Wisconsin has a waiting period of one week, and pays compensa- on from date of injury in the evrnt of disability extending beyond four weeks. Illinois has a waiting period of six days. The fact that there are few specific amounts set out in the Ne- braska law for certain injuries justifies the shortening of the waiting period. Many of the reports filed in the department of labor furnish ample argument for the change. Take the loss of a finger, the loss of a toe. Quite often the employe suffers an injury which causes the ampu- tation of a finger or toe and is able to return to his employment within the fourteen days waiting period and therefore receives no compensation </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR for the dismemberment. A careful examination of the reports filed under the Nebraska compensation law indicates the justice of changing the waiting: period in the law to seven days. The primary purpose of com - pensation laws is to compensate the injured employe for lost earning power, and the waiting period is established to discourage malignering. Whatever the period of waiting may be the injured employe must bear the total of the lost earning power. There were 2,222 complete reports filed under the Nebraska law for the first year of its operation. Out of this total 1,617 were cases in which there was no compensation paid and 605 in which compensation was paid. The average number of days lost by the injured employe in compensation cases was 19.4, while the average number of days lost by the injured employe in non-compensation cases was 3.1. Practically 127 per cent of the total number of completed cases were compensation cases. This leaves over 70 per cent of the work accidents in which the injured employe must assume the total lost earning power by reason of the two weeks waiting period. This is not an equitable division of the time pre - sumed to be necessary in order to wait out the effects and results of the injury in order to determine whether the injury is one in which com- pensation should be paid or whether the injured employ malignering. The purpose of a waiting period i se administration of a compensation act from the burden and payments for trifling injuries, and to eliminate as far as possib of malignering, that might arise with no waiting period. Wi w and cost of living at their present levels, a very large numbei are necessarily living from hand to mouth, and in all such ca days without compensation in time of accident to the breadw real hardships. There seems to be good reasons for reducing ,v period to seven calendar days. Medical Attention Section 111 of the Workmen's Compensation law reads as follow Sec. 111. During the first twenty-one days after disability begins the employer shall be liable for reasonable medical and hospital services and medicines as when needed, not however to exceed two hundred dollars in value, unless the employe refused to allow them to be furnished by the employer. Provided, however, where the injured employe refuses or neglects to avail himself of such medical or surgical treatment, the employer shall not be liable for any aggravation of such injury due to said neglect or refusal. An adherence to the provisions of this section works many incon - sistencies and results in an injustice to the injured employe in many cases. An employe receives an injury which upon the first examination by the physician is deemed not very serious. But the injury becomes serious, in that blood poison sets in. The attending physician applies all his skill to prevent serious results, but to no avail. Amputation is </seg>
            <seg id="p013">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 13 necessary. The twenty-one days have elapsed in the meantime. Strictly following the section of the law the employer or insurance company are not liable for any part of the $200 maximum for medical attention or hospital services necessary after the twenty-one days have elapsed. The amputation, necessitating surgical skill and hospital services, is a direct result of the injury suffered in the course of employment. The employe must bear all of the cost of the amputation. Again, a workman while operating a lathe receives a piece of steel in the eye. The physician hesi - tates to use the knife in removing the piece of steel from the eye, hoping that it will work its way to a point where it may be removed without an operation and thus avoid the danger of loss of eyesight. But the physician's hopes are not realized. An operation is necessary. The twenty - one days have elapsed in the meantime. The employer or the insurance company are not responsible for the cost or any part of the cost of the operation for the reason that it was after twenty-one days, though the operation was a direct result of the injury received in the course of em - ployment. There are an endless number of these illustrations. And in each the attending physician uses his knowledge and skill to save the in - jured employe the necessity of a dismemberment and the dangers incident operation, and the employer the loss of an employe and the money cost of dismemberments and operations. The twenty-one days' limitation should be striken out of the law. Possibly a more reasonable limitation may be inserted, but it is doubtful whether there should be any limitation, as to time. Graduated Benefit* The Nebraska compensation law provides that where a deceased em - ploye leaves a widow wholly dependent upon him for support, and under the provision of the law a wife is presumed to be wholly dependent upon a husband with whom she is living at the time of the accident, shall re - ceive 50 per cent of his wages for a period of 350 weeks, subject to a maximum of $10 and a minimum of $5 per week. The number of de - pendent children does not increase or decrease the amount of the com - pensation. Several of the states have provisions that the compensation payable to a widow shall be graduated according to the number of de - pendent children. If there be no dependent children then the widow shall receive 30 or 40 per cent of the weekly wage of her deceased hus - band. But if there be dependent children then the percentage shall in - crease for each child until a reasonable maximum percentage has been reached, the weekly payments on account of each child to continue until the child has reached an employable age. There seems to be no need of any reason or argument why such an amendment should not be made to the compensation law. True, if the widow alone is to be considered then there would be no difference in the lost earning power of a deceased husband. But if the dependent children are to be taken into account the widow with children has suffered a greater loss and handicap than the childless widow. The lost earning power of a deceased husband means, more to a widow with children than it does to a childless widow. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Administration Contrary to a large majority of the compensation states, the Nebraska law provides no machinery for the administration of the compensation law. The law provides rules in accordance with which settlements are supposed to be made between the employer and the employe. But in actual practice these settlements are made between the insurance company and the em - ploye. Only when no satisfactory settlement can be reached is the state right into the matter, by a petition to a court of equity, or which there many in the state. The court is required to hear such witnesses ■ presented and in a summary manner decide the merits of the controversy. Under this system one of the important purposes of a workrr compensation law, the making accessible of full and complete relief for injured employe or his dependents at the time most needed, is to a 1 degree defeated. The administration of a compensation law through the courts number of separate and scattered tribunals already overburdened by th ordinary business and more or less likely to be unfamiliar with the 1 results harmful in that serious delays occur, unnecessary fees paid attorneys and court costs eat up a large portion of awards, settlement. - violation of the law are frequently sanctioned by the courts or even orde by them on their own initiative, conflicting opinions are handed down, c fusing and complicating the whole system and making justice a mai of location, not of law.

The inevitable that equal justice to all require that the indus rv the expense of accidents incident to its operation. With this thought firmly fixed there will follow a strenuous and combined effort to prevent industrial accidents, which, after all, is more to be sought than any pay - ment of compensation. The doctrine that an employer, or the product that he is manufacturing or the business in which he is engaged, shall be responsible for the cost of injuries occurring to workmen, without any consideration as to where the fault may lie, is practically a reversal of the common law rules governing statutory liability of employers. With the certainty that every industrial accident will call for the payment of money the employer seeks to distribute the money cost as a part of the selling price of his products. There are some employers who are unable to make such distribution by reason of fixed selling prices and statute limitations and competition. To protect himself against the money cost of industrial accidents the employer pays a premium to an insurance </seg>

No com - pany or association shall enter into any such contract for insurance unless such insurer shall have been approved by the state insurance commis- sioner as provided by law. Under this section the insurance company is bound to pay the total liability of the employer under the provisions of the compensation law.

An employer who buys insurance from an insurance company not licensed to do business in Nebraska is not carrying out the plain pro - visions of the law, and is not giving the employe the protection against the employer's insolvency which the law intended should be given. The Problem of the Minor The minor who receives a serious and permanent disability injury tients a problem only partially solved through the continuance of the kly payments provided by the compensation law. These payments should be sufficient to permit the minor to obtain special training along technical or commercial lines and thereby become fitted for remunerative wage-earning work in the future. A boy of sixteen, left with one arm, who was earning $3 or $4 week at the time of his injury, can be provided with employment paying the same rate of wages that he was earning when the injury occurred. Usually such employment offers the minor no prospect of an improve - ment in his earning capacity, and full justice is not done him under the provisions of the compensation law. There should be a provision in the compensation law which the minor who earns a low rate of wages and who receives permanent injuries a weekly compensation based upon his probable earning capacity at the time he attains the age of twenty-one. Such a statute has been in effect in England since 1906, the English law providing that "during total incapacity of a workman who is under twenty-one years of age at the date of the injury, and whose average weekly earnings are less than 20 shillings, 100 per cent shall be substituted for 50 per cent of his aver - age weekly earnings, but the weekly payments shall in no case exceed 10 shillings." It might be possible to work out a solution of the problem of the minor if it was provided that in such a case, if a minor received a personal injury which permanently incapacitates him, in whole or in part, it shall be con - clusively presumed that his average weekly wages are not less than $12. Compensation for Public Employes Section 106 of the compensation law reads as follow Section 106. The terms 'employe' and 'workman' are used inter - changeably and have the same meaning throughout this article; the said terms include the plural and all ages and both sexes, and shall be con - strued to mean: </seg>
            <seg id="p017">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 17 1 1 » Every person in the service of the state or of any governmental agency created by it, under an appointment or contract of hire, express or emplied, oral or written, but shall not include any official of the state, or any governmental agency created by it, who shall have been elected or appointed for a regular term of office, or to complete the unexpired portion of any regular term. The intent of the legislature seems to be plainly set out in the above ion that all employes of the state or of any municipal subdivision of the state are under the compensation law unless an election to the con - trary has been filed with the insurance commissioner. The distinction ade as to the use of the word "employe" and the word "workman" i the general meaning attached to the word in its everyday use. A state treasurer is primarily an employe of the state, but is designated in the statute as an officer. One who is appointed to fill an office for which there is a statutory term of service provided is termed an officer. One who is elected to fill or appointed to complete a term of office for which there is statutory definiteness as to time of service would be an officer and not an employe or workman, and therefore would not be under the compen- sation law. But employes of the state and employes of municipal sub - divisions of the state, including sanitary districts, drainage districts, school districts, and all employes of municipalities not elected or appointed to an office created by statute with definite terms of service, would be under the provisions of the compensation law. The members of the state militia should be brought under the com - pensation law. It is a common custom, and a right one, too, when a member of the state militia is injured while executing the orders of his superior officer, or as a matter of fact "while in the course of his em- ployment" suffers an injury that the injured employe or his dependents present a claim to the legislature, and, after traveling the rocky road which most such claims must travel, the claim is finally allowed at the end "f two or three years waiting. The amount of the award is not based on any fixed method of ascertaining lost earning power, but is based on the sympathy of the members of the claims committee and the members of the house and senate. An injustice is sometimes done the state in grant - ing the larger amount as well as the employe who is granted the smaller amount. Compulsory or General Law The theory upon which the modern method of workmen's compensation for injuries received in the course of employment must rest is that it is just and reasonable that employes, or their dependents, should be paid compensation for such injuries from the business in which they are re - ceived, and that it is not just, or a wise social policy, to leave employes who are thus injured, or their dependent families, to destitution, or the inadequate aid of organized and unorganized charity. Chapter 67, Section 10, of the laws of Nebraska, adopted in 1911, pro - vide that owners and superintendents of all factories, workshops, mills </seg>

All accidents suffered by railwaj ployes and all accidents suffered by patrons of railway companies be reported to the state railway commission. All accidents suffen employes under the compensation law must be reported to the stat partment of labor. These and other methods of gathering data di the state's concern with all such injuries, their cause ami results. I shock to one's sense of justice that when many injuries thus reporte investigated, it is found that no compensation can be obtained b injured for their incapacities, or by their dependent families, in ca death — whereas in other cases, under like circumstances and condi compensation is provided. This is due to the fact that the Nebraska pensation law is an elective act, so called, and not a general law. un in its application. The bad effects of this- system of discrin to the injured persons and their families, but stances of this injustice are many and appear through childrer schools, in the work of charities, and in cases reported to the state ment of labor when it is learned that the employers hav or are not under the compensation law. One of the first essentials of law is that it should aj "Equality before the law." The Nebraska compensati so amended as to make it a general law, applying to employes and their dependents, within the clas Esation law. If a constitutional amendment ctment of such a general law, proper step uld be taken. To avoid any misunderstanding in the cons it should be remembered that the words "compulsory" and are used in the discussion of compensation acts, are usec technical constitutional sense. A general law, applying as to those affected by occupational injuries, would be in its no more compulsory than other equal and general laws. The Nebraska compensation law should be so amended, all employers of one or more employes. iclude Fatal Accidents Only six fatal accidents have been fully reported to the department of labor. There are several fatal accidents under the compensation law, which, owing to the fact that the employer and the insurance company have not made a complete report to the department, are not included in the summary showing the fatal accidents under the law for the year just closed. Until some board or individual is clothed with sufficient authority to direct and administer the compensation law this haphazard method must continue to prevail. According to the information given in the report of these six fatal </seg>
            <seg id="p019">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 19 accidents, they are classified as to fault as follows: Two, incident to employment; three, fault not placed, and one, the fault of the employer. It will be noted that the two cases in which the fault was not placed upon the employer nor the employe, but simply accidents which just seem to have to happen, the beneficiaries received $2,500 in each instance. But in the three cases in which the fault could not be placed from the in- formation given in the reports, the representative of the employer or the insurance company was able to strike a much better bargain as to money settlement, and the beneficiaries of each one of these three ployes received $731.39. In the one case in which the fault plainly that of the employer a settlement and release was secured the beneficiaries for the sum of $2,054.81. The compensation law provides that the payment for an injury re - ng in death shall be 50 per cent of the wages received by the em- ploye at the time of the injury, for a period of 350 weeks, subject to a maximum payment of $10 per week and a minimum of $5 per week. In f the cases included in the table the employe was receiving the ;i&lt; num wage. This would entitle the beneficiaries to $3,500 in each with $100 additional as a burial benefit. There is no provision in jensation law for any method of settling a fatal accident except that the provisions of the law be followed, provided employer and employe are under the compensation law. An employe under the compensation law cannot waive its provisions before the accident happens. But after accident he or his beneficiaries may settle according to his or their needs and notions. In the absence of some specific method of direct - ind supervising settlements and commutations in the law the "needs" otions" of the injured employe and his beneficiaries vary and the ire of human beings to strike a bargain defeats the intent and purpose of the law, and the widows of two deceased employes who received the same maximum wage do not receive the same payments in compensation. The legislature without doubt intended that the widow of an employe he course of his employment and receiving more than $20 per week, should receive 50 per cent of his wages for 350 weeks, or $10 per week for 350 weeks, aggregating $3,500, plus the $100 as a burial benefit. It was not thought best that the widow be paid the total amount in one payment unless and until the district court found that the best interests of the widow and dependents could best be served by such lump sum pay- ment. Plainly stated, the legislature never intended that the widow and dependents of a deceased employe, in case a lump sum settlement was permitted by the district court, that the amount of money received by the widow and dependents should be arrived at through the different whims of different district courts and the ability to negotiate a bargain by dif- ferent employers and representatives of different insurance companies. The widow and children of Jones are entitled to the same compensation for the loss of earning power of a husband and father as the widow and children of Smith, provided Jones and Smith both received in excess of $20 per week at the time of the injury resulting in death. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR The state must provide some board or commission or individual whose duty it will be to protect the interests of all parties in the administration of the compensation law. As a rule compensation claims should be payable as annuities and should be capable of commutation to a lump sum payment only on appli - cation of either party to some board or commission or court. Wage- ' • rners or the dependents of wage-earners are too often little used to the handling of large sums of money and the payment in the form of an annuity prevents the money being misappropriated. But there are cases where the possession of a little capital will enable the wage-earner or his dependents to become self-sustaining by the purchase or settling up of a little business. In these cases a lump sum payment should be made, and the board or commission or the court should be plainly authorized to order such lump sum payment upon the application of either party, pro - vided it be found to be to the best interests of the injured employe or his beneficiaries. The Nebraska Law Needs Amending The Nebraska compensation law does not in all cases furnish adequate compensation to injured workmen or their dependents. Moreover, the pay - ment of compensation, in the absence of any method of administration, has been neither prompt nor certain. An unnecessarily large amount of benefits both to employer and employe have been wasted. Some of the hostility between employer and employe, and some of the waste and in - justice that existed under the old liability system remain because too many of the practices under the old system will remain so long as there is no adequate method of administration. Experience in other states has shown that these evils can be eliminated by an adequate compensation scale, and guarantee of reasonable and well regulated relief when needed, through the creation of a supervising authority with summary power in the admin - istration of the law, and settlement of disputes. Time and experience have suggested needed amendments to the Ne - raska compensation law. It was not expected that the first attempt to enact the principle of workmen's compensation into the statutes of Ne - braska would be final and the last word in the matter, but time and ex - perience and changed conditions point out the changes that are necessary Fatal I Accidents Whose Fault Whose Fault No. Cases I Compi n M.ilkal sation Atten- ] Paid tion !

Requiring all settlements and releases to have the approval of some board or commission or individual. Copies of all releases and settlements to be filed with some court or office of record. More specific and stringent state laws dealing with insurance com - panies which write Nebraska business without first procuring a state license. Making more specific and certain many of the provisions of the law to the end that misunderstandings and litigation may be minimized. Graduate benefits according to number of children until a reasonable maximum percentage is reached. In case of death or permanent disability reduce the number of weekly payments by increasing the per cent. Requiring the insurance commissioner to notify the board, commission or individual charged with the administration of the law, of each insur - ance company licensed to write compensation insurance under the law.

Domestic and Household Servants Section 97 expressly provides that the Nebraska compensa shall not apply, among other classes, to: (a) Domestic servants; (b) Household servants. The term "domestic servant" means one who lives and works in the house and does not include a servant whose employment is out of doors and not in the house. Bouvier in his law dictionary says that the term "domestic" does not extend to workmen and laborers employed out of doors. Another writer has said that domestic servants are those who receive wages and stay in the house of the person paying and employing ri for their services. They are sometimes referred to as menial servants, are defined as persons retained by others to live within the walls of house and to perform the work of the household. A household servant is a servant dwelling under thf r under circumstances which make him a member of the family. The w&lt; "household" comes from the Latin word "familia." It is jrenerally u: to denote persons dwelling together and composing a family. Webs defines the household as those who dwell under the same roof and ci stitute a family. The status of a household servant is dete ath by his relation to the family than by the character of the service which he performs. If he is taken into the family and occupies a relation such that he could properly be considered a member of that household, then he could with propriety be considered a household servant. Private chauffeurs do not occupy this close relationship with the employer. He usually lives in another house than his employer; he boards at a different table; his laundry is done at a public laundry, his clothes are mended at a public tailor shop, and he does not sustain such close relationship with the employer and his family as would make him a member of the family. The courts have frequently decided who are and who are not employes and who are "servants," and in their opinion we find such language as the following: "A servant is one who is employed to render personal service to his employer, otherwise than in the pursuit of independent calling, and who in such service remains entirely under the control and direction of the latter, who is called his master." "A servant is one who does work under the direction of another, who not only prescribes to the workman the nature of his work, but di- </seg>

An employe is a person bound in some degree at least to the duties servant and not a mere contractor bound only to produce, or cause Kluce a certain result." the case In re Caldwell, 164 Fed., 515, the court held that musicians wages to play in a theater or other place are "servants" within the bankruptcy act. July 1, 1898, c-541, par. 64b.

The contract of employment may, however, be such change the relationship of the parties so that they would be inde- ractors or perhaps employes of the director of the orchestra." A Comparison ible below will show a comparison as to the waiting period of th&lt;' several compensation laws, the death benefit and the method of administration. Twenty-two states have fourteen days as the waiting period, while six states have seven days, one state twenty-one days, one state fifteen clays, one state six days, two states ten days, and two states no waiting period at all. The death benefit varies from $6,100 in Pennsyl - vania to $2,000 in Wyoming. The average death benefit for the twenty - eight states which have fixed benefits is $3,921.27. The Louisiana law provides a death benefit of 50 per cent of the wages received by the em - ploye at the time of the injury resulting in death during the life of the wife. Under the provisions of the Wisconsin law the widow is paid an amount equal to six years' earnings of the deceased employe. Injuries resulting in death are not included in the Oklahoma law. Under the fed - eral law the widow receives an amount equal to one year's earnings of deceased employe. Under the Oregon law the widow is paid $50 per month during her life, and under the West Virginia and Washington laws the widow receives $35 per month during her life. In eleven of the states </seg>

Accidents are classified according to a reasonable interpretation of n formation given on the face of reports. A thorough investigation properly authorized tribunals or individuals might ascertain the facts be different from that indicated on the face of the reports. But there a large number of accidents which "just happen" — it being impossible fix the blame or ascertain the cause. These are classified as "incident employment One result of the operation of the Nebraska compensation law has most gratifying. With hardly a single exception injured employes ,ec have returned to their job as soon as repaired, that is, as soon as they recovered from the injury sustained. Under the common law or em - ployers' liability method of dealing with work accidents, when the ambu - lance chaser's activities were unchecked, such was not the case. The court records of the state will show that about 50 per cent of those who suffered work accidents were induced to start a damage suit and that about 10 per cent of those who sought damages finally secured an award of damages after long drawn out litigation. Practically 100 per cent of those who sought to recover damages for a personal injury never returned to the job upon which they suffered their injury. Even though the scale of compensation may be smaller in the exceptional cases than could be recovered by litigation, the certainty of the payment of a fixed amount without trouble or worry is surely a gratifying circumstance when the employe knows and feels that he is not to lose his employment by reason of the meddling of those who seek to profit by his misfortune. Many a man may go to his daily toil with a lighter heart due to the knowledge that if anything happens to him before the day is done, that at least his loved ones will not be objects of charity.

Statistics gathered by the fed - eral government and the several states show that only about 10 per cent of the employes who suffer work accidents have been able to recover dam - ages under the common law and employers' liability statutes. In other words, if an employe should suffer an injury he had only one chance in ten of recovering an award at the end of litigation. Under compen - sation laws the injured employe has 100 per cent of the chances to recover. True, the amount of recovery in exceptional cases is larger, but the em - ployer under the compensation law is given a certainty of recovery for an uncertainty, together with loss of employment and court c attorney fees and the almost limitless waiting period.

In tabulating these cases under the heading "Fault Not Placed" the department adhered to the rule that in all cases where the face of the report did not show the cause of the injury that it was impossible to place the blame or the cause of the injury, and could only be listed in the very indefinite column of "fault not placed." The 313 cases in this table called for the payment of $2,367.81 for medical attention and $72.85 for hospital services. In the column giv - ing the number of days of disability it will be noted that there were twelve cases in which the disability lasted more than fourteen calendar days. In each case in which the disability lasted more than fourteen calendar days the injured employe should have been compensated for each working day in excess of the fourteen calendar days. The figures in this table show that twelve injured employes who were entitled to the compensa - tion for which the employer had paid failed to receive such compensation. ion Imp! oyi G $9.00 2.00 10.00 5.00 8.00 5.00 10.00 5.80 11.5 io!o IMJt 2 159.00 $5.80 , ... 5.80 </seg>

There was paid for medical attention $5,894.80, and $187.50 for hospital services. The provisions of the compensation law apply to the state of Nebraska and every governmental agency created by it, and every employer in the state employing five or more employes, in the regular trade, business, profession or vocation of such employer. Household servants and farm laborers are declared not to be engaged in hazardous occupations and are not under the provisions of the law.

            <seg id="p039">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 39 Under the provisions of the Nebraska statutes as they existed be - fore the adoption of the compensation law, and the defenses under the common law, employes injured in the course of employment could only recover an award of damages for the injury where the fault or negli- was that of the employer. The briefest statement of the common law rule governing the em - ployer is that he is required to use due care for the safety of his em - ployes while they are engaged in the performance of their work. This is taken to include all reasonable means and precautions, the facts in each particular case being taken into consideration. If such provisions have made as a reasonably prudent man would supply if he himself were exposed to the dangers of the servant's position, no negligence would appear. In the case of corporations supreme courts fix the duty at the use f such caution and foresight as a corporation controlled by careful, prudent fficers ought to exercise. Though the courts have not sanctioned the that would tend to charge the employer with a higher degree of than that which may be defined as ordinary, the measure is not an ute one, but is proportioned to the dangers to which the employe posed. The ordinary incidents of railroading, mining and certain s of manufacturing are in themselves, in comparison with general ymeiits, unusually dangerous; and so of a large railroad as com- 1 with a smaller one, an express train as compared with a freight , or a gaseous mine with one in which no such dangers exist. In ch cases as these, or when temporarily abnormal conditions prevail, dinary care is advanced far beyond the requirements of the less danger- tions. On the other hand, care may lawfully be relaxed if the s unusually slight or if a device is for a specific and transitory Practically the rule of the common law can be stated as being that in employer can not be required to respond in damages unless fault can ye traced to him, or that he was negligent and failed to exercise ordinary The Nebraska compensation law substitutes for the common law rule and statutory provisions the rule that the employer must respond in damages regardless of fault, unless it be shown that the employe wil - fully produced the injury. This substitution is based on the theory that occupational injuries should be a charge against the business operated by the employer. Applying the rule of the common law, only those accidents which are the result of the fault or negligence of the employer can the em - ployer be required to respond in damages. Reports filed under the com - pensation law show that out of the total number of cases reported compen - sation was paid in a total of 605. Only seventeen of these reports show that the employer had been negligent. Under a normal application of the common law rule only 29 per cent of the 605 employes who suffered an injury and received compensation could have recovered. Thus the differ- </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ence between 100 per cent and 29 per cent, or 71 per cent, received an award by reason of the provisions of the compensation law. In the reports of 605 completed cases in which compensation was paid are included 17 cases in which the fault on the face of the reports was clearly placed on the employer, while there were 155 cases which the reports failed to indicate from the statements of the cause of the injury sufficint information to place the fault, so these 155 cases have been listed under "fault not placed." Thirty-eight accidents for which com - pensation was paid were plainly the fault of the injured employe; thirty - two the fault of a fellow servant, and 363 which from the face of the reports seemed to be those sort of accidents which simply happen — unex - plainable and the fault of neither employe, employer or a fellow servant. Summing up the information contained in the tables following, which cover a total of 605 completed cases reported, 71 per cent of the total number received money settlements for injuries simply by reason of the provisions of the compensation law, whereas if the rules of the common le coir law had prevailed only 29 per cent of the total number covered a money settlement Compensation Cases The following tables show the number of completed repo which have been reported to the state department of labor in wh pensation has been paid.

            <seg id="p047">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 47 "Employers Liability" at Common Law It is assumed that employers and employes are alike interested in any hange of conditions which affects their relation as such, and therefore the f the "Workmen's Compensation Law of 1913" and the Opera- prov tion Of SUC'h law (luring the first year of its use and application to work accidents in Nebraska are of especial interest and importance to both employer and employe. To assist those who are so vitally interested, and Who desire to become acquainted with the provisions of the compensation law and its operations and application, this bulletin is issued. It is not the intention to here enter into any extended discussion of the law as it heretofore existed, with reference to the relation of and servant; nor is it the intention to dwell at length Upon the COn - and Considerations which may have influenced the legislature in law the specific plan of compensation for injured or killed employes, but the purpose will have been accomplished if it is stated in a brief and concise manner the common law principles and statutory modifica - tions thereof, upon which recoveries for injuries to employes injured in the course of their employment have heretofore been based, and the statutory rule giving to the dependents or legal representatives of killed employes a right of action against the employer, and the changes wrought in such common law and statutory rules by the compensation law. pies of the comomn law, except as it may have been modi- tatute, have heretofore determined the right of an employe to 'om his employer for an injury received during the course of his id the right of recovery depended solely, in the first instance, whether the employer had been negligent in performing some duty to- ward the employe imposed upon him by law, or implied from the contract of employment. The contract of employement under the common law imposed the obligation upon the employer to use ordinary care in the following par- ticular 1. In furnishing his employes a safe place in which to work. 2. In furnishing safe tools and machinery with which to work. In making reasonable rules and regulations. 4. In the selection of reasonably competent persons to assist in the work to be done. The contract of employment likewise imposed certain obligations to be observed by the employe, among which were: 1 . That he should use ordinary care to avoid injury to himself. 2. That he should obey and observe such reasonable rules and regula- tions as might be formulated by the employer for the orderly disposition of the work in hand, and for the safety of employes generally. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 3. That he should assume such ordinary risks as are incident to the employment. 4. That he should assume the risk of injury received on account of the negligence of his fellow servants. The failure of the employer to so use ordinary care, which is such care as the ordinary prudent man would exercise under like circumstances and conditions, renders the employer liable in damages for any injury that may result to his employe — provided always that the employe has himself observed the conditions imposed upon him by the contract of employment. It will be observed that the employer is never liable in damages for an injury to his employe unless he has failed to exefcise "ordinary care" — in other words, unless he is negligent in failing to perform the duties on his part to be performed, which are imposed upon him by law, or are implied by the contract of employment. Neither is the employer liable, although negligent, if at the time of receiving his injury, the employe himself was not exercising due care for his own safety, and such failure on his par exercise due care contributed in any degree to his injury. We believe the foregoing to be a fairly accurate statemer common law principle governing in all cases where an embloye seeks recover damages from his employer for an injury received in the his employment, and in the practical application of the law in cases, where the fact of injury itself is not contest ed, the empl plead and prove as a defense the violation by the employe of any c obligations imposed upon him by the contract of employmt event, he is said to assert the "common law defenses" which ar 1.

It will thus be seen that by the common law rule the emplc all the ordinary risks incident to his employment, and that his employe only liable when he is guilty of negligence and the employe is wholly f from negligence and his injury was not caused by the negligence of a fellow servant. The common law gave no right of action to the personal representativ of a killed employe on account of the death of such employ Defenses Under the Common Law For a breach of duty to an employe resulting in injury, an action will lie for the recovery of damages. Employers are not insurers, however, and are liable for the consequences, not of danger, but of negligence. Some duties are by statute made obligatory upon the employer to such an extent as practically to fix his liability in case of injuries entailed by their omission. Apart from such enactments, however, the employer may, in case of an </seg>
            <seg id="p049">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 49 action for damages, offer a defense based on the principle expressed in the maxim, "Volenti non fit injuria;" or he may undertake to prove the plain - tiff's assumption of the risk, or his contributory' negligence; or he may rely the doctrine of common employment to relieve him from liability The principle of the maxim, "Volenti non fit injuria," is of general application, the meaning of the phrase as freely rendered being "That to which a. person assents is not esteemed in law an injury." A clearer state- ient is that by an English judge, "One who knows of a danger from the ?Kligence of another, and understands and appreciates the risk therefrom i'K I voluntarily exposes himself to it, is precluded from recovering for an jry which results from the exposure." In brief, the injured person has assumed the risk; and, apart from the contractural relation of employer and ?mplove, there is a considerable class of cases in which this defense to an ages may be interposed. The invitation or assent is not 'ven commonly formal, but is inferable from conduct and ir ns, often subsequent to the entrance upon the situation that giv€. he circumstances to which the doctrine is applied. English courts have more definitely fixed the application of the principle is the case in this country, where it has been fully discussed in compar- tively few juridictions, but neither in England nor in America are the authorities agreed on its application to concrete cases nor on its relation to the doctrines of contractural assumption of risk and of contributory negli - gence. Many authorities hold that the rule of the maxim covers the ground of the usual defense of assumed risks under the employe's contract, besides A-n field of non-contractural relation, while others regard the two sos as distinct. It may be said here, however, that the distinction is naintained. and it is held by some courts that the person des- volens may be better described as negligent, or, rather, that the iking the voluntary choice may be none the less guilty of con- &gt;utory negligence. In so far as the liability of employers is concerned, appears that the more general application of the rule in this country I the same lines as are observed in connection with the doctrines of fd risks under the contract of employment. Contributory Negligence When a risk involves such a degree of danger that a prudent man would not assume it, the defense to an action by an injured employe is not that the plaintiff by his contract assumed the risk, but that he was, by his con - duct, truilty of contributory negligence. The line is not clearly drawn between the two defenses, nor is it always easy to do so, inasmuch as the facts in a given case may support either defense. The principles are dis - tinct, however, as assumption of risk is an implied or actual agreement, en - tered into before the happening of the accident, to waive compensation from the employer for injuries resulting therefrom; or, it is an incident of the contract, read into it by the fixed rules of law. If, however, there has been contribtuory negligence, there is no reference to either contract or status to </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR determine rights, but only to the conduct of the employe. If under all the attendant circumstances he fell short of reasonable and ordinary care, the defense of contributory negligence will lie against him. The rule is announced by Cooley as follows: "If the plaintiff or party injured, by the exercise of ordinary care under the circumstances, might have avoided the consequences of the defendant's negligence, but did not, the case is one of mutual fault, and the law will neither cast all the con - sequences upon the defendant, nor will it attempt any apportionment there - of." The contributory negligence must be that of the party injured; that of a fellow-servant co-operating with the negligence of the master being no defense to the latter for injuries resulting from the combined negligence. Course of Employment It may occur that an injured person received his injury under circum - stances that raise the question whether or not the accident occurred as the result of his employement within its true bounds. Such a question arises, for instance, when an employe is being transported on a vehicle owned or operated by his employer. If the injury was received while he was being transported for the purpose of forwarding the undertaking for which he m engaged, it will be regarded an incident of his employment, and the rules as to assumption of risks will control. The possible negligence of the employe engaged in operating a train on which a bridge gang is, according to custom, being conveyed to the place of its actual work i ■ would ordinarily be contemplated in accepting such employment. T rule will apply to the negligence of other classes of employes, i hands, if their negligence would not have furnished grou injured employe had been actually at work at the time of If, however, the employe was traveling entirely for h ■P 1 and was not at the time subject to the orders of his of master and servant will be held to be suspended, and the injured pe will have the rights of a stranger. In a Pennsylvania case it was held tha an employe who received transportation to and from th* his employment as a part of his compensation was entitled to r :is passenger in the event of an accident inflicting injury. The same view seems to have been taken by the supreme court of Washington, while in New York this ruling was condemned, and the fact of transportation being considered as part payment for his services was held not to take the case out of the rule stated in the paragraph above. The courts of Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have allowed recovery for injuries received by employes riding on trains or street cars at the close of the day's work or for meals without payment of fare, the view being taken that such transportation was not connected with the performance of their duties, which were at an end for the time, and that they had no connection with the operation of the vehicle on which they rode. The variety of facts involved in cases presenting the question of course of employment is so great that it would practically require an enumeration of the decisions to present the attitude of the courts thereon. The genera! </seg>
            <seg id="p051">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 51 rule has been mentioned, i. e., that the employer is not liable for injuries incurred by employes going beyond the scope of their employment. They approximate the condition of volunteers, with whom they are sometimes classed. By the term "volunteers" is meant persons not in the service of the employer prior to their engaging, without authorization, in the employ - ment at which they received the injury complained of, and their situation is in general no better than that of trespassers. They are held to have assumed the limitations of servants without acquiring the right to claim the performance of a master's duties toward them. They will be protected from wanton injuries at the hands of the regular employes, however, and the circumstances may be such that they will be held to warrant a service ren- at the invitation of persons not ordinarily authorized to hire employes to give to injured volunteers a right to recover. Or it might be said he situation of the persons so employed is modified so that they are ger regarded as volunteers, at least not as trespassers. The reason for the rule as to volunteers is that no one can be subjected e obligations of an employer, which are the result of contract, without ?nt thereto, either express or implied. This being the case, the of a person undertaking to render service, either on his own motion it at the invitation of an unauthorized person, gains nothing from the fact hat the danger was not appreciated. This prevents exceptions in behalf of hough in some jurisdictions they are regarded as trespassers when too young to be charged with discretion, and thus a greater degree n must be exercisd in their behalf. The "Fellow Servant" Rule The remaining defense to an employe's action for damages is what is &gt;wn as the 'fellow-servant" rule, or the doctrine of common employment According to this, where the employer has discharged his duties as to a safe afe and suitable appliances, competent fellow-servants, etc., he is not ■&gt; an employe for the acts or negligence of any mere fellow-servant -employe, provided such co-employe does not represent the employer. Or, as it has been otherwise stated, "A master is not bound to indemnify one servant for injuries caused by the negligence of another servant in the same common employment as himself, unless the negligent servant was the master's representative." If, however, the negligence of a co - servant concurs with the negligence of an employer in causing the injury, the injured employe not contributing thereto, the employer will be liable in Jamagi The well known diversity, not to say confusion and contradictoriness of the rulings of the courts as to the application of this rule, arises from the lack of precise and generally accepted definitions of the idea of common employment and of representation of the master. The relations of this doctrine to the other elements which determine employer's liability are such that practically all that has been said with reference to the duties of th« employer and the assumption of risks by the employe must be read in the light of the rulings of the jurisdictional courts on the subject, although the principals involved are held to those of general law. In an opinion on </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR fellow-servant case which was before the Supreme Court of the United States, a few years ago, it was said that "there is perhaps no mattter upon which there are more conflicting and irreconcilable decisions in the various courts of the land than the one as to what is the test of common service, such as to relieve the master from liability for the injury of one servant through the negligence of another. Not only do the courts of the various States differ, in the individual states are found fluctuations of opinions from time to time, and the acceptance of new standards, with departures from former positions, so that it is important to know the date of an adjudication in order to determine the present construction in the state. The attempt has been made in a number of states to fix by statute the relations of employes to one another, and to determine the liability of the employer for their acts of negligence; and this would appear to be the only practical method of attempting a solution of the problem as it exists to-day. It must be confessed, however, that even where statutes of different states are closely similar if not identical in phraseology, the effect of local inter - pretations is apparent in the varying constructions adopted. The common law rule was enounced in England ant America at about the same time, apparently independently, and to practically the same effect. Subsequent developements have been more favorable to the employe in this country than in England, however, some states having apparently lost sight of the foundations of the rule. The reasons offered by the courts for the rule have b&lt; being found in the view that the master's responsibility is thas used ordinary care to employ competent servant.*. It ploye assumes the risk of the possible negligence of a co c of the incidents of the employment. In another opinion Court it was said that the obvious reason for exempting tr liability, is that the employe has or is supposed to have s templation when he engages in the service, and h ax accordingly, so that he can not in reason complain if he suff« I which he has voluntarily assumed, and for the assumption of which he paid. Another reason is found in alleged grounds of public policy, as te tf ing to make the employes more watchful over their own conduct and that of their fellows .thus benefiting employers, employes and the public alike by the greater care with which they perform their duties. In close connec- connec tion herewith is the claim that any marked enlargement of liability to capital would lead to the withdrawal of capital from industrial enterprise, thus reducing the opportunities of employment and inflicting damage upon the whole community. Each of these reasons has been the subject of adverse criticism, and no one of them seems to give a satisfactory ground for excepting employes from the benefits of the doctrine of respondeat superior, or for compelling the employe to bear the burden of "pure accidents" which occur in the prosecution of undertakings the advantage of which are to be reaped by the employer. The last two reasons mentioned above have perhaps been most frequently relied on as supporting the customary rule, though no such results as are therein indicated have followed the adoption of statutes </seg>
            <seg id="p053">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 53 greatly enlarging the rights of employes to recover for injuries following upon industrial accidents. The chief points requiring determination in any action involving the principles under consideration are those of common employment and of representative capacity. If it appears that the injuries complained of are the result of the negligence of a co-employe, the only hope of the plaintiff lies in showing that the negligent person was a vice-principal, representing the master at the time, and so devolving upon him a liability for the acts or Assumption of Risks When a contract of employment is entered upon, the law imports into the agreement an assumption by the employe of the ordinary risks incident to the employment, and of such other risks as may be known to and appre - ciated by him. This is said to be a term of the contract, express or implied from the circumstances of the employment. One seeking employment im - pliedly represents that he is capable therefor, and that he comprehends the ordinary risks. Another view of the defense is that it does not arise from the contract of employment, but from the status of the employer and employe as fixed by common law, and is over and above the contract, being posed by law upon the parties thereto, regardless of their desires. Ordinarily the promise becomes effective as soon as made, but if ful- set for some indicated period the employer does not become t until the arrival of the time indicated. The special res - the employer continues for a reasonable period only, regard jr the circumstances of the individual case. A complaint by an n effect a declaration that he will no longer continue in service 11 itions of danger, while the promise of the employer, so long continues, is said to have established a new relation, the ■eing that the employe shall not be held to have rt The question of the employe's knowledge is in general controlling, but the knowledge may be either actual or imputed. A workman of mature years and ordinary intelligence, offering himself for employment, is pre - sumed to know and appreciate the conditions and to assume the risks ordinarily incident to the service and to have notice of all risks which, to one of his experience and capacity, are, or ought to be, obvious. He does not assume risks arising from conditions of which he was actually and excusably ignorant; nor is he required to use more than ordinary care to discover existing conditions. There is, however, one class of cases in which the question of knowledge is not raised, and that is where the conditions complained of are the result of the employe's own choice or selection of a course of action. In such cases the risk is assumed irrespective of any implied term in his contract of service, the employe being held to be responsible for the proximate re - sults of his own conduct. ssions charged. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Ordinary Risks The determination of what are ordinary risks evidently becomes im- portant in view of the fact that with regard to them the employer is re - lieved of all responsibility, even if the employe did use ordinary care, unless by reason of inexperience or minority he was not chargeable with having: assumed such risks. The courts have sometimes denned ordinary risks as those that per- tain to the employment after the employer has discharged his duty as safe place, appliances, etc., and which ordinary care on his part cannot guard against. Under another conception the word "ordinary" is held be construed in its usual sense. This may be taken to mean either that the risk is obviously a normal incident of the employment that an intelligent observer would recognize it as such, and the dangers arising therefrom as constantly possible or it may imply that the employment unavoidably and of necessity involves the risks, which is much the same as holding that the master's care can not obviate them. These risks are such as arise from the negligence of fellow-servant unless the employer was negligent in employing incompetent worki from the nature of the instrumentalities used; or from the conditions the work already completed. Extraordinary Risks Risks which may be obviated by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the employer are classed as extraordinary, and these the employe is held not to have assumed without a knowledge and comprehension of the dangers arising from the employer's negligence. If the dangers are patent or are brought to the knowledge of an employe, his entering upon or remaining in service is presumed to have waived his claim against the employer for resulting damages. In the first case he will be held to have made his contract in the light of existing conditions; and as to risks arising during employment it has been said that if a servant continues to use an appliance which he knows to be dangerous he does so at his own risk and not at that of his employer. It must appear, however, that the risk was actually appreciated. While a failure to notify the employer of discovered or known risks is construed as indicating the employe's willingness to continue to work while they exist, the risk is not thrown whether permanent or temporary, of the conduct and nature of the busi- less. The master can not undertake, for instance, to make railroad labor &gt;r the manufacture of explosives as safe as many other employments, and he hazards of such industries are held to be assumed according to the standard for the industries themselves. In like manner works of construc- :ion and repair, in regard to which the master's liability was found to be nodified, cast upon the employe a correspondingly larger degree of risk, »-hich, by this principle, he is held to assume. This rule applies only to !mployes actually engaged upon the work, and the risks assumed are those :hat arise only from the work in hand and not from defects in portions of </seg>
            <seg id="p055">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 55 upon the employer by a mere notification not replied to by his promise to repair. If the alternative of continuing to work with the defective appli- eaving the employment is offered, and the employe continues to ance work, he will be held to have assumed the risk. A promise to repair can be relied upon only for a reasonable time, after which the risk will be upon the employe. Common Employment What constitutes common employment? It was said in a leading case that, "prima facie, all who enter into the employ of a single master are engaged in a common service, and are fellow-servants," but this broad statement will not answer as a conclusive test. Not only employment by a master, but also engagement in the performance of duties that sonably be said to tend to the accomplishment of the same end ;ary to meet general acceptance by the courts; nor is it a sum- answer to say that all serve the profit or convenience of a common jyer. While another servant than the plaintiff, employed for a pur - entirely different from his duties, has negligently caused the injury omplained of, it may well be said that they are not fellow-servants. But ven with this qualification the statement is not definite enough to be of mch use in determining particular cases, and the impressions used by idges in passing on the question of common employment throw little light subject. "Engaged in the same geners.1 business," "the same gen - iertaking," or "in promoting one common object," are frequent modes •ession, though in other cases the somewhat more restricted phrases, es having an immediate common object" or "working in the same o subserve the same interests," are used. The question involves m and facts, but where the latter are undisputed, the decision be - simply a matter of law, and the trial jury will not pass upon it. Preventable Accidents What are termed "preventable accidents" will not be prevented, solely, by the installation of safety devices and methods. If they are to be pre - vented it will be largely due to the co-operation of the workman with his employer in a careful endeavor to avoid accidents. The point to keep firmly in mind is that no system for compelling the installation of safety appliances, enforced by law, or executive order, will be effective unless the workman lends his serious attention to the object and purpose of the safety installations. The fact that every accident now costs the business a fixed sum of money is a powerful factor in arousing the employers to take active measures toward the prevention of accidents; but this is only a part of the successful measures that minimize accidents. The workman himself must contribute the main factor to bring about this most desirable elimination of preventable accidents. He can do it if he will. If he will but realize that compensation is a poor substitute for loss of life and limb, </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR or health, it will surely awaken his sensibilities to the fearful burden that he voluntarily places on his shoulders by being thoughtless, careless, slovenly or incautious and unmindful of the work he is engaged in. Compensation is an economic way of meeting the hazards that attend industry. Its co-efficient is "Safety" and to the instilling of this faculty in the minds of everyone, we must look for and expect a decrease of the distressing accidents that have been unnecessarily attending hazardous employments. The vital end to reach at this time is that of impressing on the minds of those who work in dangerous pursuits the necessity of constant caution. An ever-present interest in the thing being done and the safe way to do it, will in most cases prevent accidents. Eliminate negligence by installing prudence, discard carlessness for expert and scientific interest in the work in hand and accidents with their terrible results will be rendered to the minimum. Unavoidable Accidents All accidents classified as unavoidable should be carefully investigate by the employer and the causes removed or provided against insofar &lt; the business or industry will permit. The prevention of accidents shou be the first consideration in all hazardous occupations. It saves mone, saves time, prevents accidents, prevents suffering, improves conditioi and creates higher industrial ideas. Safety both saves and pays anil t effective mutual organization and co-operation changes can be brought aboi whereby "preventable injury losses" can be changed to profits, with all tl other benefits that such a change implies. Of course, it cannot be claimed that accidents will not happ&lt; less of precaution. It is acknowledged that in spite of the «| it and the most impressive admonitions, that machinery will fail and human judgment be at fault. This is a deplorable fact, perhaps inseparable from our economic life. Nevertheless, accidents that result from carelessness, thoughtlessness, ignorance or absent mindedness can and should be avoided. Mind wandering from the actual work that the employe is engaged in i i probably one of the most fruitful sources of accidents. The workman who goes about his work as though he were in a trance is sure to come to grief. Compensation laws and safety provisions are made for the workman. He is not expected to be a subjective beneficiary only but an active agen f in forestalling these unfortunate happenings which necessitate compensa - tion laws. Every intelligent human being knows that nothing "just happens." Everything is the result of an efficient cause. So-called unavoidable acci - dents can be traced to a falling short in observation, experience or judg - ment in one form or another. Detailed investigation will nearly always show that if the unfortunate had given closer observation, or more attentive care to what he was doing and had exercised thoughtful caution and clear judgment, that the accident would not have occurred. </seg>

Co., Though the effect of such a promise is not entirely excluded from con - sideration in cases where it was given before the beginning of work, rine applies chiefly to cases where it was made subsequent to such g. It is then held to rebut the presumption that the employe med the risk or that he was guilty of contributory negligence in re - ling in a place of known danger, though it does not of itself entitle red employe to recovery. Doctrine of Workmen's Compensation The doctrine of "Workmen's Compensation" involves an abandonment of the rules of employers' liability for industrial accidents, as fixed by com - mon law and by statute, and the substitution therefor of a system which will avoid long drawn-out and expensive litigation in the courts, and secure for every workman injured in the course of employment, a limited amount of compensation, based on his earning capacity and the nature of the injury. The doctrine of compensation for industrial accidents has been sub - stituted for the civil action based on fault or negligence in all the countries of continental Europe, with the exception of Switzerland and Turkey. It was first adopted in England in 1897. 900. 70 N\ H. 390, 47 Atl. 613.) </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR The question of workmen's compensation has been the subject of much study and investigation in our country in recent years by organizations representing both employers and employes, such investigations being made with the view of ascertaining whether it would be preferable, from an economic standpoint, to substitute the principle of compensation for the common law and statutory rules based upon fault or negligence. Not only is the compensation plan approved by organized employers but it also has the approval of organized labor. Modern economic conditions have resulted in two general plan.s of com- pensation for injured employes, neither of which is founded upon common law principles of liability. Each plan contemplates that compensation be made for every injury or death occurring to an employe in the course his employment, which is not self-inflicted, and eliminates entirely th« question of negligence. Chief Justice Fullerton, in the course of his opinion sustaining th stitutionality of the Washington law. said: "The evil it seeks n&lt; one that calls loudly for action. Accidents to workmen engaged in ir tries enumerated in it are all but inevitable. It seems that no matter ho\ er how carefully laws for the prevention of accidents in such indust or how rigidly they may be enforced, there is an eleme tion that enters into the problem which cannot be eliminated a invariably causes personal injuries and men engaged therein. Heretofore these losses have t injured workmen themselves, by their dependents, or by It was the belief of the legislature that they should be borne by the dustries causing them, or, perhaps more aicurat the products of such industries. That the pri effect is economically, sociologically and ir conceded. "The common law does not purport to afford a remedy tions found to exist. It affords relief to an injured work limited number of cases; cases where the injury is the result of fa the part of employer and there is want of fault on the part of the work- man. For the greater number of injuries traceable to the dangers inci to industry, no remedy at all is afforded." Advantage* of Workmen's Compensation There are, at least, three very desirable direct advantages of work - men's compensation over common and statutory liability laws: 1. It secures promptly to the injured workman, and in case of his death, to his dependents, a certain compensation instead of the often long delayed and very uncertain final result of a lawsuit. The compensation, in the first instance, is made to fall upon the em - ployer, not as a punishment, not because he was at fault, but in order to throw the burden ultimately upon those who enjoy the product. Those who enjoy the product, ultimately pay the compensation, and should render certain to the injured workman what is justly due him and </seg>
            <seg id="p059">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 59 prevent him and his dependents fr om becoming the objects of a most undesirable charity. Under the old system only a small per cent of the injuries resulting from industrial accidents were actually compensated. The premiums paid for liability insurance, and which was considered a legitimate item in the cost of production, were largely expended in de - fending lawsuits. This system resulted in actual waste. It insured the results of law - suits, and wholly failed to provide direct protection to the workmen and indirect protection to the public, as it should. Under the compensation system, it must be expected that the number payments will be greatly increased, but the elimination of the waste ncurred in the litigation of claims under the old system will certainly have i material effect in keeping the cost of compensation within reasonable irai 2. The certainty that compensation will be paid is sure to be con - ducive to the contentment of the workmen. The elimination of the probability of a lawsuit between the employer and employe, in the event of the injury of the latter, is bound to be pro - ductive of a better state of harmony and co-operation between them. It may be expected to reduce the probability of friction, discord and ill feel - ing and bring about a closer and more compatible relationship between the ployer and the employe. 3. The certainty that injuries are to be compensated is a potential factor for safety. It will compel the employer to consider the causes of injuries and the means of preventing them. It is a silent, automatic and constant argument for the best working conditions, and the removal of the opportunities for accidents. It pleads not merely for "safety first" but for "safety all the time." The principle of social justice and right, which underlies, and which, in fact, is the foundation of workmen's compensation, is that industry should bear the burden of its accidents, and that the cost thereof should be added to the selling price of its products, and be distributed among the consumers. In orther words, that the loss occasioned by accidents is as much a part of the cost of the article in the production of which the workman was employed at the time of the accident and his injury, as is the loss occasioned by the destruction of material, the breaking, the wearing out and replacing of tools and machinery. If a mule be kept and employed alone in the production of a commodity and becomes injured, the expense of its injury becomes a part of the cost of production, even though its injury is not due to its employment. There is vastly more reason for treating the expense of an injury to a human employe as a part of the cost of the production of the commodity, when the injury is caused by an accident arising out of and in the natural course of the production of the commodity. Reason should certainly accord the expense of the injury of the human employe, caused by an accident arising out of and in the course </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR of his employment, as close a relationship to the cost of the production of the commodity in which he was engaged at the time of his injury-, as it does the expense of the injury of the mule, caused by an accident entirely outside of its employment. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin vs. Miller (144 N. W. 188) announces the rule that personal injury losses, not intentionally incurred, arising out of, and in the course of the production of an article, whether occasioned by the fault of the employer, or injured workman, or without fault of either, are as legitimate of the value of the money cost of the production of the commodity as are expenses for raw material, for machinery or wages. The doctrine that an employer or the product that he is manufacturing or producing, shall be responsible for the cost of injuries occurring ti workmen, without any consideration as to where the fault may lie, is almost a complete reversal of the rules of common law, governing statu - ory liability of employers. The fact that the compensation law not onl&gt; makes it possible, but legal, that the injured employe may recover fron: lis employer for injuries received, even though the same may be reall&gt; aused by his own contributory- negligence or the negligence of a fellow servant, or through the inherent risk of the employment, is a radical change or abrogation of the common law rules governing employers' liability. The operation of the first year of the Ne iraska Workmen's Com lensation Law has brought forth words of approval for the principle o compensation for work accidents from a large number of employers am employes, as well as the public at large, and the consumers, who in thi end are the real liguidators or bearers of the cost of compensation. Gov - ernor Boyle of Nevada, in his recent inaugural address, said: "Modern legislation of this type, providing for compensation victims of industrial accidents, reflects the changed attitude of pub ion toward the relation of employer and employe. "Under the old system of what was termed 'Employer's Liability,' the question of 'fault' was the basis of recovery, and recovery by the injured person was made difficult and expensive, as a result of court procedure, anil often impossible as a result of court rulings out of tune with our progres - sive and humanitarian ideas of social relations and social justice. "Workmen's Compensation legislation is predicated on the theory that mlustrial enterprise creates a source of danger and becomes responsible or damages resulting from that source; that risk as well as labor should &gt;e compensated, and that the industry should be made to bear its proper share of the financial burden growing out of industrial accidents, rather han permitting the full burden to be borne by the individual workman who lappens to be the victim of a particular accident. Under this theory the question of 'fault' is eliminated and the fact that an injury has been sus - ained in any employment establishes automatically the right to compen - sation. "The wisdom and justice, as well as the true economy of such legisla tion, is so universally recognized today that argument in its favor appear: unnecessary." </seg>

V Constitutionality of Statutes An important decision in a case of first impression under the present has been rendered by the Supreme Court of California, sustaining statute the constitutionality of the compulsory law of 1913, likewise compulsory, has also been before the court of that state recently on questions of con - stitutionality, the decision upholding the law generally and applying it to a case in which the injured workman was employed in unloading a vessel which was engaged in interstate commerce. It was held that until Congress acts in behalf of such workmen, recovery is determined by the State Laws of the jurisdiction within which the injury was received.

            <seg id="p062">62 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Another interesting decision in the same field was handed down by the Supreme Court of New York (appallate division) in the case of Win - field vs. New York Central, etc., R. Co. (153 N. Y. Supp., 499). The injured man was concededly engaged in interstate commerce, so that if the injury had been due to the employer's negligence he would of necessity have had recourse to the Federal liability statute. However, as there was no neg - ligence, the injury being due to pure accident, it was not within the Federal law, and the court held that it was a case in which Congress had not yet acted, so that the State law would control, and affirmed an award made in the claimant's favor by the compensation commission. Another statute that received consideration at the hands of the courts this year was that of Texas, the court of civil appeals having held certain provisions of the act unconstitutional (Middleton vs. Texas Power &amp; Light Co., 178 S. W. Rep. 956). The act authorizes the employer to choose whether or not he will accept the provisions of the act, but having done so his employes are deprived of any right of action against him for damages for personal injuries, and are restricted to such relief as the statute in question provides. The court held that this provision was void as in viola - tion of the clauses of the Federal and State constitutions which guarantee due process of law, and also of those clauses which forbid depriving any person of the equal protection of the laws. It was further held that giving the employer his choice as to the nature of the remedy which he we permit his employes was in substance a delegation of legislative functii and void as an attempt to confer upon him powers belonging exclush to the legislature. The jurisdiction of this court is not final, and the c has been taken to the supreme court of the State. Has Proved It* Superiority The operation of the principle of workmen's compensation its superiority over employers' liability from several standpoint First. The prevention of accidents. Ignorance of the machinery which they operate, carelessness and recklessness in its operation, stand out in any study of the causes of accidents. Personal equipment of the workman for the task he performs is ofttimes overlooked and from loose, torn and unsuitable clothing accidents result. Insufficient lighting and crowding of machinery contribute their quoto to which must be added defective machin - ery and lack of the use of proper safeguards. Under the system of employers' liability in force in practically all countries previous to the introduction of workmen's compensation, it was the negligence of the employer that determined the right to recovery of damage or compensation. This negligence had to be clearly shown and while the more humane employers expended thought and money for the prevention of accidents, the vast majority were content to make only slight effort to minimize the number of accidents. With nearly every accident entitled to compensation, the question of the number of accidents and their severity become of financial importance and vast strides have made in the methods and means used to prevent accidents. </seg>

The system of employers' liability is It is not always easy to determine whether an A lecessanl r has been negligent or not.

The cost to employer a part of cost of production. Under a workman's compensation system nearly all accidents carry compensation, nearly all employers insure their liability, and the payments to the in - jured workman are with a certain degree of definiteness stated in the law. Therefore, the speculative feature is largely eliminated, the soliciting ex - pense is lessened, and the determination of rates more scientific and ac - curate. The cost to the employer becomes a fixed «harge upon the indus - try, it enters into the cost of the commodity as one of the items of produc - tion, and in the last analysis the burden is transferred to the consumer. The fact has been established that there is a certain accident risk attaching to industrial employments and principles of justice and humanity </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR demand that the loss shall in no event fall wholly on the workman. Sta - tistics show that a large percentage of accidents are not due to the negli - gence or fault of the employer, or of the employe, but are due to inevitable accidents connected with employment. The following table taken from the official reports of Germany sums up the results of an inquiry as to question of fault of 81,248 accidents compensated for the first time in 1907: Accidents due to Fault of employer .... Fault of the workman Per Cent 12.00. i Fault of both employer and workman Fault of fellow workman or third party General hazard of the industry 4 Other causes (chance, etc.) Under employers' liability laws, the greatest possible percental accidents for which damages could be obtained would be 18.91, while p ably less than that percentage would be chargeable for damages. For the purpose of rendering some reasonable compensatioi of the 80 per cent or more of accidents occurring in industri ments not provided for under employers' liability, the princif pnnoip men's compensation is substituted. New Legislation Xew compensation laws were enacted in 1914 in K Maryland and a New York statute of 1913 was re-enacted that the previous enactment had taken place after the adop constitutional amendment, authorizing such a law, but f into effect. The Kentucky statute was declared unconstitutional by a divi( before it became operative. The court held that, although the act was elective in form, the provision as to passive or presumed th part of the employes and the abrogation of the defense of the em who rejected the provision of the act, made it compulsory, and a thus constructed, limited the amount recoverable for damages for pe injuries, it was unconstitutional in all parts. During 1915, compensation laws were enacted in Alaska. Colorado, Indiana, Maine, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming. There are now thirty-one statutes for compensation laws besides the ter - ritories of Alaska and Hawaii, the Canal Zone, the Philippine Islands, and the Federal law. The Oklahoma legislature submitted to the people an amendment to the constitution, authorizing an elective or compulsory com - pensation law covering death, as well as disability. The legislature of Utah provides for a commission to report to the next legislature a sug - gested bill. A compensation law passed by both houses of the Idaho legis - lature was vetoed by the governor of that state. The Missouri commission of 1913 recommended to the legislature a carefully drawn bill, but the legislature of that state declined to enact a compensation law. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW ■ Numerous amendments were made to existing compensation laws during 1914 and 1915. The changes made in some of the laws are so extensive that it amounted to about an adoption of a new law in its en - tirety. The failure, thus far, to secure uniformity in compensation laws quite noticeable. The Oklahoma statute restricts its application to cases non-fatal acidents, while in Wyoming, all accidents, both for death and disability, are in the form of lump sum settlements, arbitrarily fixed by the statute without regard to the earning capacity of the injured person. Practically all other compensation laws favor periodical payments, cal- nccording to the wage loss. The benefits payable under the Alaska are similar in form to those of Wyoming, except for temporary or which, in Alaska, payment, based on the percentage of the allowed. The Alaska statute is more liberal than that of Wyom- i maximum of $2,050 for death and $3,000 for per- lisability, while in Alaska the total in either case may amount to The death benefit in the Colorado statute is next lowest to that Wyoming, being limited to a maximum of $2,500. The Colorado law also ■scribes a waiting time of three weeks before any benefits are payable, h these respects diverging from the tendency generally observable &gt;w larger benelits and to reduce the waiting time to less than two weeks. Disability benefits, in Colorado, continue until death if the dis - ability is total and permanent. licial boards or commissions for the administration of compensation ontinue in favor, the laws of Alaska and Wyoming being the only ew laws enacted in 1915, which do not provide for a method of adminis - ration. The Louisiana statute is administrated by the courts. The indus- i of Maine is limited in its powers to those relating to the the compensaton law. The same is true of the industrial is of Maryland. Oklahoma and Vermont. In Hawaii, county h restricted functions are provided for. The Pennsylvania law reates a bureau of workmen's compensation in the State Department of which furnishes the clerical force for the workman's compensation board being the administration body proper, for the hearing, be nvestigation and determination of claims under the law. The industrial Colorado is charged, not only with the adminstration of the i&lt; compensation law, but also with the duties of factory and mine inspection, the enforcement of women and child labor laws and safety laws generally. The same provisions are found in the law of Indiana, and that of Montana. These same provisions were provided for in earlier laws enacted in Califor - nia. Iowa and Texas. The compensation laws of New York, Ohio and Wis - consin are in the hands of industrial commissions, and clothed with very broad powers. The following states have elective compensation laws: Alaska. Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.

Exceptions are the exclusion of railroads from the scope of the law in Minnesota, and of domestic and argicultural labor in Nevada. In Illinois an amendment permits the use the common-law defenses in suits against farmers and stock raisers. Ar important change in the law of California consists of the substitution of the word "injury" for the word "accident" throughout, the evident intent being to permit the inclusion of disabilities not resulting from single acts of vio lence, as in cases of industrial disease. An act of the California legislatun of 1915 that may be mentioned in this connection is one that provides tha officers and members of the National Guard killed or injured whi service of the State shall be within the provisions of the compensatio The Connecticut statute provides for its presumptive acceptar in cases where there are five or more employes, instead of in cases as formerly. Casual employes and outworkers are excluded from the benefits of the act. Waiting time is reduced from two weeks to ten days, and the levy of the sum of $750 for the expenses of the State compensation commissioners where there are no dependents of a deceased workman is dis- continued. Other amendments relate to the liability of third pers whose negligence injury is due, to giving of notice of accidents immediately instead of within thirty days, to the readjustment of benefit paym among other beneficiaries, giving powor to a commissioner to review an award on his own initiative as well as at the instance of the parties, etc. In Illinois, the minimum death benefit was increased from $1,500 to $1,650, and the minimum weekly disability payment from $5 to $6. A number of changes relate to details of administration. The law now provides for a review of decisions of the board by the circuit courts instead of by the supreme court only, this restriction having been held unconstitutional. The Massachusetts statute was amended in 1914 and 1915, the most important changes being the increase of benefits, the basis being raised from one-half to two-thirds of the wages, the maximum amount for total dis - ability increased from $3,000 to $4,000. and the limit of term of payments for partial disability extended from three hundred to five hundred weeks. Other changes relate to questions of dependents, the discretionary payments of partial lump-sum awards to permanently disabled minors, the securing of evidence from absentees by the use of depositions or letters rogatory, Ciitration of disputes, the review of awards, the organization of the State ployes' insurance association, etc. The directors of the insurance asso- </seg>

Branch offices of the indus - trial m cident board in not more than four cities of the State may be estab - lished, and the appointment of a medical adviser is authorized. Amendments to the Michigan law authorize the appointment of two deputy commissioners to assist in the administration of the act, and give the State commissioner of insurance power to administer medical and hos - pital benefits through the State accident fund, the same as other benefits. Part 5 of the act, relating to the administration of the State fund by the commissioner of insurance, was amended in several respects, one change authorizing the levying of sufficient premiums or assessments on the em - ployers insured to meet the expenses of the administration of the fund. The standing appropriation for the expenses of the industrial accident board is increased from $40,000 to $45,000. Other laws relating to adjusters of claims for compensation and to the classification of risks by insurance com - panies were also enacted. In Minnesota, all common carriers by steam railroad are exempted the operations of the act, instead of only when engaged in interstate MM A special liability law was enacted for railroads. Provision was made for the payment of funeral expenses by the employer in cases of fatal accidents, the amount not to exceed $100. The weekly benefits payable were changed from $6 minimum and $10 maximum to $6.50 mini - mum and $11 maximum. In cases of permanent total disability not more per week is to be paid for one hundred and fifty weeks after the of the four hundred weeks of full benefits originally provided to exceed $5,000. The schedule of partial disabilities was may be taken at any time. The industrial commission, instead of consist - ing of five ■Makers, three of whom are exofficio, is to consist of three members, appointed by a board made up of the governor, the attorney and the inspector of mines.

Instead of permitting suits for damages against employers failing to comply with safety laws, the offending employers are to be prosecuted by the industrial accident commission of the State. Besides enacting a compensation law and related acts, the legislature of Pennsylvania affected the second adoption of a resolution for an amendment to the State constitution, which, if adopted, will permit the enactment of a compulsory compensation law. This will be voted upon at the regular election in November of this year. The law of New York was amended in 1914 so as to include employes on public works, instead of excluding them. Other amendments relate tc pleadings in suits where the employer ha.s failed to guarantee payment- under the act, to penalties for failure to provide such guaranty, to tht increase of a child's share in case of the death of a surviving parent during or. the compensation term, and to the consideration of public pension system? in determining be? .tils payable. The legislature of 1915 made .severa amendments, principal among them being the permission of direct agree incuts between the employer and employe, subject, however, to the approva of the industrial commission; a provision for advances by the employe] prior to any final agreement, and one for penalties in case of negligeni or intentional default in compensation payments.

Mutual Insurance Companies The insurance of the employers' risk under the compensation laws is the subject of various forms of treatment, as appears from the fact </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR that some of the State compensation laws are in themselves insurance laws, others require some form of insurance without specifying its type, while still others leave the matter entirely to the initiative and choice of the persons interested. Stock companies writing employers' liability in- Cince under the old laws naturally extend their activities to cover the gations imposed by the compensation legislation; and both by provision of law and by a natural growth to meet new conditions, the question of the formation of mutual companies came into increased prominence. In some states the compensation acts themselves contain provisions covering this subject, while special acts regulating the formation of such companies have been passed in several others, and while they are not strictly parts of the compensation laws, they are so closely related to their operations that they should be considered in a discussion of compensation legislation. Among the States having laws on this subject are New York, Califor - nia, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan. Minne - sota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The law of California requires five incorporators and not less than five nor more than eleven directors. Business may be begun with one hundred subscribers having not less than one thousand employes in the aggregate. The state insurance commissioner may limit the membership of any company to persons engaged in the same general character of industry or residing within a limited part of the state. The term of the corporation may not exceed fifty years. Premium rates may not be less than those fixed by the state workmen's compensation rating bureau. Under the Colorado statute fifteen or more employi ia corporate, may associate to write mutual insurance. Bu I begun until at least twenty employers with not less than 2,500 employes apply for and agree in writing to take insurance and until such applica - tions and agreements are properly authenticated to the commissioner of insurance. In special cases, where the hazard is comparatively slight, the ht. number of employes may be reduced but must be above 1,000. Member? have one vote for each 500 employes, or major fraction thereof, but no member may have more than twenty votes. Directors make classifica- assincs tions and fix premium rates and may allow for merit rating: also maintain separate funds and rates for different employments In Illinois, not less than twenty persons may form mutual associations and may begin business with the simultaneous issue of at least twenty policies to twenty members covering the same kind of insurance upon not less than 200 separate risks. No maximum single risk may exceed 20 per rit of its admitted assets, or three times the average policy, or 1 per cent the insurance in force, whichever is the greater. Not more than $25,000 admitted assets is required, and at least 1,500 employes must be covered. each employe being considered a separate risk. Policyholders must be members of the corporation and are entitled to votes in accordance with the insurance in force, the number of policies held, or the amount of premium paid, as may be provided by the by-laws. The Indiana statute requires at least twenty incorporators and con - tains similar provisions as to initial issue of policies, maximum single </seg>
            <seg id="p071">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 71 risks, and the amount of admitted assets and number of employes as appear in the Illinois statute; provisions as to voting are also similar. The Maryland statute calls for at least nine directors and twenty sub- scribers, with 2,000 employes as a minimum for the commencement of business. Members have one vote for each 500 employes or major fraction thereof but not more than ten votes in all. If employes contribute to the insurance fund, they are to have an equal voting power with the employers. In Massachusetts ten or more persons may form a mutual company, but no policy may be issued until applications for insurance in an amount not less than $50,000 have been received, or applications by not less than 100 employers having not less than 5,000 employes, each employer obliga - ting himself in an amount not less than five times his cash premium, which may be called upon in emergency, or they may give bond in an amount of $100,000 to meet such emergencies; a fund of $50,000 in cash deposited with a trustee may be substituted for the bond. In any case provision must be made for extraordinary losses caused by disasters. In general, corporations of this class are subject to the provisions of the corporation iws of the State. The law of Michigan requires five incorporators and provides for a discretionary restriction to groups of employers engaged in operations of the same general character. At least 5,000 employes must be represented. The term of the corporation may not exceed thirty years. In fixing pre- nium rates the board of directors may take into account the safety con - iitions of the plants of the respective subscribers. The law of 1915 author- ny mutual company, organized in the state or elsewhere, to write liability insurance if possessed of net cash assets in an amount of $500,000. In Minnesota, twenty incorporators are required, and business may be begun only when there are at least 5,000 employes covered. A proviso as to companies insuring creameries and cheese factories only allows them to operate if there are 300 employers covered, the number of subscribers being not less than 200. This act requires a statement in each policy of the maximum contingent liability of the holder. The life of the corporation is limited to thirty years. Twenty employers with 5,000 employes may incorporate in Nebraska, and the charter may be perpetual. Subscribers may cast one vote for each $100 premium or fraction thereof paid during the preceding calendar year. The New Hampshire law authorizes the incorporation of twenty or more employers with not less than 5,000 employes. The general corpora- tion law applies where not inconsistent with the present act. One vote is allowed for each $100 or fraction thereof paid in premiums, no per - son to be allowed more than twenty votes. Directors may inspect plants, prescribe safety rules and regulations, and examine books and pay rolls. Merit rating is permissible, and a reserve as required by the insur- ance commissioner of the State must be provided. Groups of industries and separate funds may be maintained, but all funds are ultimately avail - able to meet losses when necessary. The Oklahoma statute is identical with that of Illinois in the points noted. The premium rates to be charged by mutual companies, as by </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR "every insurance company granting insurance against liability of em - ployers," are subject to revision by the state insurance board if found unreasonably high or inadequate. The Pennsylvania law requires twenty or more employers with not less than 5,000 employes who have accepted the elective compensation system of the state, though in case of agricultural employment, not less than 200 employers and 500 employes are required. The same provision as to voting, inspection, premiums, groups, funds, and ultimate collective liability as appears in the New Hampshire law is in force in this state. A surplus may be established to cover catastrophe hazards. The Texas statute differs considerably from other laws of this class and authorizes subscribers "to exchange reciprocal or insurance contracts with each other" at an office designated in the application for such author - ity. Not less than seventy-five employers with 2,000 employes must apply and must place on deposit at least $10,000 for the payment of losses, and the reserve fund must be retained at this amount as a minimum. The insurance contracts must amount to not lees than $500,000, and no employer may assume a risk in excess of 10 per cent of his net w shown by a reputable commercial rating agency. Applicable to the above forms of insurance companies, and other operations in the field, including the state fund, are the pr&lt; of a statute of California which requires every such company to ti the state insurance commissioner its classification of risks and p rates, together with its list of schedule or merit rating. After heari commissioner is to fix a uniform classification of risks and prt rt and may also establish a uniform system of merit rati c be carried at less than the established rates. The statistical and actuarial data compiled by the state's industrial accident commission and compen - sation insurance fund are to be at the disposal of the insurance commissioner for the purposes above set forth. The purpose of insuring the risk of work accidents from the employees point of view is to shift the cost of these accidents, and to save the em - ployer from possible bankruptcy through a catastrophe which might result in wiping out his industry through several serious accidents causing the payment of compensation in an amount beyond the capitalization of the industry. The Nebraska compensation law provides that awards under the law, without limit as to amount, shall have the same preference against the assets of the employer as unpaid wages for labor performed. From the employe's point of view insurance of the risk is necessary to protect the employe against the possible insolvency of the employer, espe - cially in view of the fact that many of the compensation payments con - tinue out over a period of many weeks, the maximum number being for permanent total disability, which continues during the life of the injured employe. The Nebraska law needs amending in such manner as each employer Cst either insure his risk or satisfy some competent board or commission individual that he is solvent and that he will continue to be solvent over </seg>
            <seg id="p073">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 73 the period of time for which he may be subjected to the payment of com - pensation to an injured employe. The Nebraska law provides that all employers of five or more are presumed to be under the law unless an election to the contrary has been filed with the state insurance commissioner. To require an employer to take out insurance or qualify as to solvency before he could come under the law would change the method of election, in that the employer would elect to come under the law when he had complied with the requirements as to insuring his risk or had his solvency passed upon. The Nebraska law was made an elective law on the theory advanced by learned counsel that under the Nebraska constitution one could not be required to respond in damages where there was no fault. There are a number of able members of the bar who do not take this view of the power conferred upon the people by the constitution. The safer way, in order to avoid litigation and possible adverse rulings by the supreme court, would be to amend the constitution, plainly empowering the people with author - ity to adopt a compulsory compensation law. Then the matter of requiring an employer to insure his risk and protect his employes against insolvency could be made a part of the compensation law and not affect the applica - tion of the law to the larger number of employers of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 74 Common and Other Cause$ of Accidents One delusion is passing away, in the campaign to prevent industrial accidents — that erery industry has its own peculiar set of accident cause* and that practically all the accidents result from those causes. One industry that In quite different from the ordinary run of manufacturing plants is the electric light and power industry. Yet the safety engineer of an electrical company wrote recently to Safety Englneer- "One of the distinctive features of accident statistics in central stations Is the relatively low rank that electricity itself holds among the causes of accidents. The returns from the companies generating electricity for commercial purposes show that approximately 15 per cent of the accidents to their employes are due purely to electricity. The remaining 86 per cent are due to causes common to all classes of industries, such, as falls, falling objects and other similar source* of Injury." If 85 per cent of the accidents in central stations are due to "cause common to all classes of Industries," it way be inferred that most of the accidents in manufac - turing plants are due to common causes. Safety work means taking care of all common causes of accidents— which includes carelessness of workmen, elimination of chance-takers and the inculcation of the safety habit. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 75 A Gallery of Injured Employe* The following pages show a few pictures which will represent differ - ent conditions under which accidents have happened, and the lessons which may be learned from each case. The increasing danger to life and limb involved in the pursuit of indus - trial occupations has become so great that the necessity of doing every - thing feasible to keep it within the narrowest possible limits is clearly evident. We are living in a constructive era. Articles are being manu - factured in greater number and variety than ever before in the world's history. More and more machinery is constantly being used, and more and more persons are being employed in factories, mills, and workshops. The toll of human life and limb being exacted by modern industry has reached such startling proportions as to be a serious menace to our national welfare. That it is so recognized is evidenced by the increasing number of laws made to protect life and health, and the marked tendency shown to fix the legal responsibility for accidents. Investigation into the causes of this drain upon our national vitality has proved conclusively that a very large percentage of industrial accidents can be avoided by the adoption of proper preventive measures. From the nature of the case, it is plain that, although the employer and employe must work together to attain the desired end of reducing accidents to a minimum, the initiative should come from the employer. Ignorance can never be entirely overcome in many instances, and it is certainly not the duty of the employer to undertake the general education of his employes. He can do much, however, to prevent ignorance from contributing to the causing of accidents in his plants. He can gee to it that no man is allowed to handle or work about any machinery unless he is qualified to do so. He can prevent a workman familiar with one job, and specially trained for it, being allowed to undertake other work in which his ignorance is apt to cause injury to himself, if not to others. He can exer - cise discrimination in the assignment of work, so as to avoid putting a man of slow-moving mind and heavy body on a job for which quickness of mental action and physical agility are necessary. He can formulate rules showing how work should be done to assure the largest degree of safety possible, and he can furnish copies of these rules to all his employes, printed in as many languages as may be necessary to convey their meaning to all concerned. He can also make prominent display of caution signs warning his men what not to do in order to avoid danger. It is astonishing how ignorant many workmen are, not only of mechanical arrangements in use in factories, but of palpably dangerous general conditions and the necessity of exercising ordinary care to avoid being hurt. It is equally astonishing how large a part native curiosity plays in the causing of accidents. </seg>
            <seg id="p076">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 76 Arm Caught in Gear This inexperienced workman was injured while removing a lap of waste from around the shaft under the head of a doubler by reason of getting his arm caught in a gear. As a result of the accident, he eered two fractures of the right i, a severe crushing of the elbow, and multiple bruises and lacerations of the arm. This type of injury illustrates the importance of thoroughly guarding gears, and also the importance of in - structing inexperienced and ignorant employes of the dangers to be avoided in working around machinery. The injury is such that this man is pre - vented from ever advancing to any considerable extent, and if the em - ployer should in the future be unable to keep him employed he is severely handicapped in finding work wh can do. The Work of a Circular Saw This employe, a boy of nineteen years, worked as a sawyer table sawmill owned by his father. While standing on a wooden While standing on a wooden p sawing dry pine logs with a 52-inch circular saw, he placed his right hand against the smooth surface of the saw to see whether or not it was overheated. His hand was drawn in between the side of the saw and a board on top of the saw-frame, and held fast. In an effort to release his hand he slipped to the floor of the platform, and fell upon the revolv - ing saw. The installation of practical safety devices is the only efficient method of lessening the injuries in - cidental to this kind of employment. The use of rubber mats or strips, which are safeguards against slipping upon floors or platforms, might have saved this employe from serious in - jury. </seg>

An operation for the grafting of new skin and two opera - tions for the purpose of loosening the skin on the right thumb for the pur - pose of getting better flexion, kept him in the hospital for a period of eight weeks. The use of a long wax taper might have enabled this employe to be out of the range of the flames and thus prevented the injury. Severe Electrical Burns This employe, a carpenter, was en - gaged in making measurments on tem - porary partitions when the rule which he held in his hand came in contact with high voltage electric wire cables, his head at the same time brushing igainst an iron beam, making a ground for the current. Injuries re - sulted which necessitated the amputa - tion of his hand above the wrist, and he insertion of a silver plate in his ikull. Proper signals — "Danger," "Don't touch," etc. — at the point of danger would have warned the workman of danger, and in all probability have prevented the accident. </seg>

He was working at such a height that the injury might have proved fatal had he not been lowered to the ground. This injury strikingly illustrates the need of a lineman's shield in ev - ery case where contact with live wires is likely, and the necessity of wear - ing rubber gloves which extend over the wrists of the workman. When - ever the nature of the lineman's work will permit, rubbers should also be worn. By strict adherence to these precautions many similar injuries could be avoided Inexperienced Foreigner Receives Serious Injury This employe, an inexperienced foreigner, was picking cotton from back of lap, while the machine was in motion. His fingers were caught under - neath, between the lap and the calen - der roll, the result, as shown in the illustration, being substantially the loss of the use of the hand. He was employed as a double-tender in a yarn mill, and received a weekly wage of $6.35. Injuries under such circum - stances, generally due to the inexper - ience and lack of knowledge in the use and operation of machinery, occur fre - quently. Instructions, when given, should be fully and thoroughly under - stood by the operator. "Things not to do" should be pointed out, and rigid discipline enforced. </seg>

This injury indicates the impor - tance of safeguarding machinery and placing the safety-control device with - in easy reach of the operator. Many effective appliances may be devised to protect employes from this type of machinery. In connection with this injury the point is also illustrated that not only should safeguards be pro - vided, but employes should be edu - cated and compelled to use the guards. Falls From Ladder* Falls from ladders cause many serious accidents. Material should never be carried in the hands while going up or down a ladder. Place the ladder so it will not slip. If nec - essary have someone hold the ladder. Examine the ladder thoroughly before using. Don't use it if it isn't per - fectly safe. Don't lean ladders against windows or any other insecure sup - port. Don't walk or work under ladders.

There are many injuries that entail danger to the injured party or termin - ate in permanent disabilities because the necessary first aid equipment is not at hand or, if so, no one present sufficiently capable of rendering first aid to the injured. "Safety First" is always pertinent. Method of applying splints in case of fracture to upper arm. The splints are padded with cotton, and are then held in place by bandages as shown. A sling is impro - vised for holding the in - jured's wrist in comfortable position. A fracture is the same as a broken bone. Get a surgeon. Don't move the patient unless you have to. In any event first put on a temporary splint. Ends of a broken bone are sharp and if the ends are moved there is danger of cutting blood vessels, or even the skin. If end of bone sticks through skin cover wound with gauze and wait for surgeon. It is also important to remember that a mere knowledge of first aid, invaluable as it is, does not in any way replace the need of a competent physician. The laity is not supposed to be able to foretell the seriousness or ultimate result of accidents that may occur.

The following- suggestions, we believe, are worthy of consideration 1. Every industry where persons are employed and subject to injury should carry a few first aid articles, kept in a clean dust-proof box. For a small box, the following supplies are suggested: a. Small glass or rubber stoppered bottle of tincture of iodine. b. Small bottle of spirits of ammonia. c. A few one-yard packages of plain sterile gauze. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 83 d. Assorted roller gauze bandages, one to two-inch widths and five yards long. e. A few muslin roller bandages for tourniquets, etc. f.

There are four chief things to do in case of injury: First, orrhage; second, apply sterile dressing and bandage to wound patient at rest; fourth, call a physician. check hera - ; third, pat </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR If hemorrhage is from a limb, it may be checked with a tourniquet made by tieing loosely a piece of muslin bandage above the injury and then inserting a stick through the loop and twisting the bandage, using only sufficient pressure to check the bleeding. If the bleeding^s from the body place over the wound a heavy pad of sterile gauze and bandage tightly Never attempt to check bleeding by the application of soot, chew- ing tobacco, flour, etc. All dressings should be taken from a new sterile package, otherwise germs will be carried to the wound and infection (blood poison) result, which may even prove fatal. Never touch a wound with dirty fingers and do not wash a wound — the water is not germ free. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 85 Fractures — Straighten with as little manipulation as possible and hold :he broken limb in that position with some sort of splint, having the limb n the position most comfortable to the injured party. If it is a broken ami, place the forearm across the chest and bandage the whole arm tightly to the body. If a leg, pad two sticks by wrapping them in cloth and bind the leg to act as splints and then tie the broken leg the good one — this gives additional splint to the leg and comfort to the patient. In all such cases, summon a physician. If the limb is wounded jr a bone protrudes, cover the wound with sterile dressing. Never put any dirty object over a wound. Foreign Bodies in the Eye — These should be carefully removed; do not rub the eye, for if the cornea is injured an ulcer is likely to result, with a partial or even complete loss of vision. After removing the foreign body, Method of turning up pper lid of eye to search for remove particle from surface of lid. First grasp eye lashes of upper lid and pull downward and for- ward.

Otherwise here may be blindness in put a few drops of 10 per cent argyrol solution in the eye to prevent in - fection. If the particle is not loose in the eye, send the party to a doctor. Electric Shock — If the party is still in contact with the live wire, don't grip hold of him to pull him free, for the current in that case would also shock the rescuing party. Pick up a board or long stick (wood does not conduct electricity) and shove and hold his body away from the wire. Per - form artificial respiration unceasingly and, if the party can swallow, give duced by infection. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR stimulants. In all cases of electric shock, secure the services of a capable physician as early as possible. To Perform Artificial Respiration — Place the patient on his back with shoulders slightly elevated by a folded coat. Grasp his tongue, using a handkerchief to keep it from slipping from the grasp and pull it forward after wiping mucus from the mouth and nose. The tongue should be held forward by an assistant or by forcing a pencil behind the last teeth and over the tongue; kneel behind the patient's head, facing his feet; grasp t forearms just below the elbows and press them forcefully against the s of his chest to expel the air from his lungs; then draw the arm upward and backward, extending his body, thus allowing the chest to ex - pand and the air to enter. Do this about fifteen times per minute until respirations become voluntary or life is proven extinct. Usually the effort is continued for at least an hour. Ammonia held to the nose and slapping the body alternately with towels wrung out of hot and cold water may aid. Fainting — Fainting is due to a lack of blood supply to the brain. In treating a patient who has fainted, lay him on his back on the floor, or if possible, have the head a little lower than the body. Sprinkle cold water over the face and, if necessary, put some spirits of ammonia on a handker - chief and hold to his nose. This is usually all that is necessary. Drowning — Remove water from lungs by placing the party face down - ward with a coat folded and placed under his chest. Get astride his body and press on the back to force out the water; put your hands under the abdomen and lift up the body with the head hanging down so the water will run out; then apply artificial respiration and send for a pulmotor, if there is one available. Remove the wet clothes and apply hot blankets to the body. After respiration is established, put the patient to bed and and keep him wrapped in hot blankets with hot water bottles to the feet. Burns and Scalds — Here the greatest element to combat is usually pain. The main object is to exclude the air, thus lessening the pain. Immerse the part in water, cover with sterile gauze, then apply an abundance of cotton and bandage snugly to exclude the air and send the workman to a physician for proper medical attention. Cuts, Punctures and Scratches — The surrounding parts should be painted with tincture of iodine and a sterile dressing bandaged over the injury. Minor injuries such as produced by splinters, scratches, abrasions, etc., should be immediately reported to the foreman who should paint them with iodine and apply a dressing. Neglect in these cases is often the cause of serious infection. Infections (Blood Poison) — Infection frequently is the result of unintel - ligent treatment or of neglect. Unboiled water is as potent a carrier of germs as a dirty cloth or dirty fingers. Keep everything dirty away from wounds. Nothing should be used except sterile dressings from the first aid box. "SAFETY FIRST" should be constantly before the mind and should be the common slogan of employer and employe. Prevention is always better than any sort of cure. </seg>

            <seg id="p091">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 91 Supreme Court Decisions The supreme court of Nebraska has handed down two decisions affect- ing the Nebraska workmen's compensation law. The first decision was in th&lt; f Bailey vs. the U. S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. and Apperson. In this case the dependents and the employer (Mr. Apperson) agreed on the amount of the compensation and that the amount be paid in a lump sum. The insurance company resisted the settlement. Application was made by the dependents to the district court for an order directing the payment of the compensation in a lump sum, and offering to discount the total amount of compensation agreed upon 4 per cent. The insurance company contended that the district court of Lancaster county lacked jurisdiction to compel kly payments in a lump sum. In its decision sustaining a finding for the plaintiff by the Lancaster ty district court the supreme court said: 'Under section 3681, Revised Statutes, 1913, of the Workmen's Com- pensation Act, after the amount of compensation payable has been fixed, her by agreement or decision of the court, the parties may agree upon the payment of a lump sum in lieu of the periodical payment. There is no provision in the statute allowing either party to compel the employer to pay, or the workman or employe to receive a lump sum settlement." Section 3681 referred to by the supreme court provides that "the amount pensation payable periodically under the law either by agreement of the parties, by decision of the court, may be commuted to one or more lump sum payments, except payments for death or permanent disability. These may be commuted only with the consent of the district court." The intent of the legislature seems to be clearly expressed in the Section 3681. The legislature intended, and so worded the the intent is made plain, that the amount of compensation won sw agreed upon between the parties, or by the decision of the court, compensation due for death and permanent disability. Certainly if it i- authorized to make a decision, and is directed to make a decision, that decision must be in response to an application to the court for the determination of a controversy between the parties. Compensation due for death and permanent disability may be agreed upon between the parties but such agreement in fact becomes the order of the court. The use of the word "consent" is synonymous with the word "order" or "de- cision." Courts do not give "consent" but render decisions and issue orders. Section 3678 of the Revised Statutes, 1913, provides that in all cases except a claim for death or permanent disability, the parties may mutually agree upon a settlement; or they may mutually agree to submit the con - troversy to arbitration.

The intent of the legislature, without question, was to direct of competent jurisdiction to render a decision in all cases where the ment of the controversy could not be reached by mutual agreement. That being the intent of the legislature, either party must be within th in making application to a court of competent jurisdiction to render such a decision. If the interpretation by the supreme court of the compensa is written is to be the rule followed then there is grave necessity for tt amendment of the compensation law in that particular.

Court Decisions — (Minnesota) Piece Workers vs. Contractors. Stanley Bashko vs. Virginia &amp; Rainey Lake Co. (St. Louis County), State of Minnesota ex rel Virginia &amp; Rainey Lake Co. vs. District Court of St. Louis County et al, 148 N. W. 1082, 127 Minn. 519. A series of cases arose in which the employe was employed in cutting ties for a lumber company. The question that arose in these cases was whether or not the injured was a piece worker or a contractor. The case which decided the question and which has controlled the decisions in the other cases was Bashko vs. Virginia &amp; Rainy Lake Company. The district court held Bashko to be a piece worker and awarded compensation. The court's memorandum citing the reasons for the decision was as follows: Plaintiff went to defendant's logging camp in the ordinary way and asked for a job. He was put to work on defendant's land cutting defend - ant's timber. He boarded in defendant's camp. He used defendant's tools with some sort of understanding as to payment for use or breakage of same. The foreman told him where to work and what to do. No term </seg>
            <seg id="p096">96 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR of service was agreed on and no definite quantity of timber was to be cut. So far one cannot say whether he was a "monthly man" or a "piece worker." When he wanted some money, instead of asking for so many days' wages, he asked for a count of the ties and poles and posts which he had cut. Instead of the foreman counting the number of days and issuing a time check accordingly, he counted the number of ties and poles and posts and issued a time check accordingly. In either case, the foreman deducted the board bill and the hospital fee and the "van" rount. Plaintiff was not told in detail how he should do his work, but was probably told as much about it as the monthly men were about their work. He was called a "piece worker." He had the right to begin work and quit work each day when he pleased. But he and the defendant both profited from his industry if he worked longer each day than the monthly men, and both lost by his idleness if he loafed in camp, although it affected him in greater degree. If he loafed in camp too much, the defendant would have and would exercise the right to discharge him. No one can reasonably say he was ai was an employe. He undoubtedly was of the term in these parts, known as i employment as such clearly was mere] Even if some of the characteristics &lt; different or absent, the result would independent contractor or that what is, in the common accepts "piece worker."

Until December 1, 1913, she received $4.00 per week in payment of her services. Since that date she performed them gratuitously. The court found that the reasonable value of the services of this daughter was $4.00 per week over and above her board and that of her child." The question is whether these gratuitous services of the daughter w months made the parents only "partially dependent" upon the pport. It is clear that the only money the parents or family upport came from the son, Anton. He was the real head he bread winner. The daughter's services had been rend - .-hort time, and may well be considered a temporary help. We should give the provisions of the act a very liberal construction. It is rather difficult to understand on what theory the legislature makes its those who are "wholly dependent" and those who are The criterion should be, as it seems to us, the amount wages that the workman has contributed monthly to the dependent, ther than whether or not the latter had received some measure of sun- ■es. But of course this is for the legislature to t It may certainly be argued with some force that one who l.-t whom others perform friendly services, is not. iwns his hor peaking, "wholly dependent" upon the cash received from the wages of the worker of the family. Nor is one who receives help from a charitable organization, or from neighbors. But we cannot suppose that the legislature intended that such a person should be considered only i "partial dependent." Giving the act a reasonable and liberal con - struction, our conclusion is that the trial court was justified in finding that plaintiffs were wholly dependent upon the deceased for their support \risi&gt;i(j Out of the Employment.

Commenting on its decision in a memor- andum the court states as follows: ieveral cases, sustaining claims of employes where injuries were ■d under somewhat analogous conditions, do not warrant the cou**t jr in sustaining the claim of the plaintiff in this action, because of the difference in the phraseology of the statutes of the states in which the decisions were rendered. Comparison of the Minnesota act with that of the English Workingmen's Compensation Law, with the federal law, and with the similar laws enacted by various states in the Union, shows that the right of employes to compensation has been very much more circum - scribed by the express terms of our act. Under the Wisconsin act, by the express terms of the statue an employe is entitled to compensation for injury sustained on his employer's premises while going to and de - parting from his labor. Other acts embrace such injuries because sus - tained while doing something 'incidental to the work' for which he is </seg>
            <seg id="p102">102 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR I ■i employed. Nearly all the statutory laws of this character provide that the injury must 'arise out of and in the course of employment,' as does the Minnesota act. But our statute expressly provides— as no other act does — that the clause 'personal injuries arising out of and in the course of employment' shall not cover 'workmen except while engaged in, on or about the premises where their services are being performed or where their service requires their presence as a part of such service at the time of injury and during the hours of service as such workmen.' The act is, by its terms, much more limited than any other statute and less humanitarian, but the question of limitation and of humanitarianism and the general policy of the law are questions for the legislature and not for the court. Neither sympathy for the plaintiff in his pathetic condition nor wishes that the law were broader and less circumscribed in its terms can properly move the court to give to the language of the act a meaning which will bring the unfortunate plaintiff within its terms and entitle him to compensation. He worked for the defendant and was on his prem ises at the time of the accident, but was not engaged where his service was being performed or where his service required his presence as a par of such service during the hours of service as such workmar Accident Defined.

"That said accident or personal injury was due to accident within the meaning of the statute in such case made and provided and was dup to an unexpected or unforseen event which happened suddenly and violent - ly and produced at the time injury to the physical structure of the body of said employe. k"That said employe received said injury while engaged in, on and ut the premises where his said services were being performed at tht e of said injury, and during the hours of said service, and it was not caused by the act of a third person or fellow employe who intended </seg>

This is strange doctrine. House of Lords or from anywhere else, unless it is a ■cause of some statutory provision. It is at variance k-cl :h the best thought of this country, and especially with our own statute, ler which mere negligence is no bar to such a claim as this, unless gence be wilful This case was appealed to the supreme court which affirmed the decision of the district court. The supreme court states as follows: "If the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment he judpe is right. "The injured servant, Charles DeCook, had worked for relator, in the bottling house of its brewery at Duluth, Minn., as the foreman's helper during more than five years prior to the accident. In the bottling room were a number of electric light bulbs. To protect them against breakage, a wire screen cover was provided. These screens were fastened with a lock to prevent the bulbs from being stolen. The foreman carried the key — a simple three-cornered contrivance. It was part of DeCook's duty to replace any of the light bulbs which broke or became defective. In doing this he had to get a key from the foreman, unlock the cover, take the broken bulbs to the foreman, then go to the office or store room for another bulb, replace it, lock the guard, and return the key to the foreman. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">104 STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ■n ip i l I i in ■f On April 9, 1914, DeCook had occasion to go to the basement where other employes were engaged. One of these handed DeCook what rred to be an empty cartridge shell of unusual length. It occur DeCook that the empty shell could be easily fashioned into a key to save the time and energy spent in hunting up the foreman i carrying the key back when light bulbs had to be replaced. Dur Erking hours, in the afternoon of April 9, 1914, DeCook went to se in the room where the tools and appliances to make the ordir lairs called for in the business were kept, took a hammer and be t hammer the supposed empty shell into a key. The shell happe be an unexploded dynamite cap and the third blow set it off. A fr nt therefrom pierced plaintiff's right eye and destroyed the sight. "It is earnestly insisted that the facts show DeCook to have depar from his duties as a servant when he met with the accident, and to h been engaged in something entirely at variance with the master's busir and without the scope of the employment. Dynamite caps were neit kept nor used in relator's establishment, and, it is said, DeCook had no press or implied authority to make a key, hence the accident cannot held to have arisen out of the employment "The law in question was intended to relieve against the resulting from the many unfortunate accidents which do take pla ge of extensive use of complicated machines and appliances, and nterprises necessitating the indiscriminate employment of the r's fault or negligence is eliminated from cases arising under 'he intention was to compensate all accidental injuries growin nd received in the service except those intentionally self-inflicte to intoxication.

(Sec. 8230, i. ) "The trial court found expressly that DeCook was within the partial definition quoted when injured; and the evidence sustains the finding in that respect.

            <seg id="p105">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 105 it still ie determined whether the injury to DeCook arose out of and in the course of his employment. In England and also in some courts here attempts have been made, with more or less success, to formulate general rules with regard to the shade of distinction between the terms ie of, as used in the act. All agree that the ex- ou pressions are not intended to be synonymous. An injury may be received ne employment, and still have no casual connection with I said to arise out of the employment.

The doubtful proposition whether it arose out of the employment. attempt to formulate a definition of the phrase, acci- \Y y arising out of the employment, except to say that the acci- K the injury must arise out of work or business being done aster either by direct or implied authority. The trial court evi - k the view that DeCook in good faith believed he was furthering r's business and performing an act which he might reasonably tpected to do when he undertook to supply himself with a key. He never been told that the light bulbs were to be under lock as to him &gt;d with the duty of seeing that the broken and defective :i i replaced. He had a variety of matters to attend to in which ervants generally, had to rely on the promptings of his own detail. Undesirable, indifferent, and of little value indeed rr rvices of an employe who must be expressly directed as to the er, and extent of doing each particular task. Hence, when a iertakes in the course of his employment, during the proper 'or, and in the proper place to do something in furtherance ;er's business and meets with accidental injury therein the inding, that the accident arose out of and in the course of employment, should not be disturbed, unless it is clear to us that the ordinary servant, in the same situation would have no reasonable justi- fication for believing that what he undertook to do when injured was within the scope of his implied duties. If another servant duly engaged in the master's work had had his sight destroyed, instead of DeCook, in this accident the thought would have been almost irresistible that this law was meant to cover such injury. But, upon the facts in this case, we doubt whether DeCook should occupy a less favorable position. If the attempt to make a key was reasonably within the scope of his em - ployment, the fact that, from ignorance or error of judgment, he made use of dangerous material, not provided by the master, should not neces - sarily exclude the conclusion that the injury arose out of the employment The term cannot be restricted to injuries caused from anticipated risks of the service if the law is to be of the benefit intended. "Our conclusion is that the judgment is right and should stand." </seg>

Lord Loreburn wrote the principal opinion, and in the course of it he said: '"In this case a workman, suffering from an aneurism in so advanced a state of disease that it might have burst at any time, was tightening a nut with a spanner, when the strain, quite ordinary in this quite ordinary work, ruptured the aneurism, and he died.

I do not think so and for this reason: may be that the work has not, as a matter of substance, contributed to accident, though in fact the accident happened while he was worki In each case the arbitrator ought to consider whether, in substance, far as he can judge on such a matter, the accident came from the dise ht alone, so that whatever the man had been doing it would probably have come all the same, or whether the employment contributed to it. In other words, did he die from the disease alone or from the disease and employ p ment taken together looking at it broadly? Looking at it broadly, I say, and free from over nice conjectures: Was it the disease that did it or did the work he was doing help in any material degree? In the present case I might have come to a different conclusion on the facts had I been arbitartor, but I am bound by the findings, if there was evidence to sun - port them. It is found that the strain contributed to the death. There was evidence on which the learned judge was entitled so to find, as I respectfully think, and I, therefore, advise your Lordships to affirm the order of the Court of Appeal."

            <seg id="p131">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 131 Death Benefit and Method* of Procedure Under the provisions of the Nebraska compensation law if the de- ceased employe leaves one or more dependents wholly dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of the accident causing death, the compensation shall be 50 per cent of the wages received at the time of the injury, subject to a minimum of $5 per week and a maximum of $10 per week, for a period not to exceed 350 weeks from the date of the acci- dent causing the injury. These several weekly payments may be com- muted to one or more lump sum payments if the district court so orders. If the district court declines to direct the several weekly payments to be commuted to one or more lump sum payment, then the dependents shall receive the amount of compensation due them in weekly payments con - tinuing over a period of 350 weeks, or practically seven years. If the employer has carried his own risks under the law, then the question of the solvency of the employer during the period for which he is to pay com- pensation is a matter in which the dependents are vitally interested. The same would be true of an insurance company carrying the risk. It is the purpose of the compensation law that the compensation shall be payable as wages, and in this manner liability for compensation is incurred. In order to protect the dependents against the possible insolvency of the em- ployer or the insurance company during the larger period of time, and at the same time more fully carry out the intent and purpose of the law, the following amendment is suggested to the compensation law: Sec. — . Where payment of the compensation in the event of death made to dependents, the payment shall be made in weekly installments corresponding in amount to the weekly earnings of the employe, subject to a maximum of $20 per week. The total number of payments may be commuted to one or more lump sum payments by the district court upon the application of either party. This does not mean a greater liability on the part of the employer; it merely shortens the period within which the total indemnity becomes payable by reason of the increase in the amount of the weekly com- pensation payments. There is produced below the various sections of the law having to do with the methods of procedure in litigating claims under the compensa - tion law. That a system of negotiation has been substituted for the old method of litigation is apparent, and will be the case until some adequate method of administration is provided: Sec. US. — In case of a dispute over, or failure to agree upon a claim for compensation between employer and employe, or the dependents of the employe, the claim may be submitted to arbitration in such manner </seg>

Sec. 130. — Procedure in cases of dispute shall be as follows: Eith party may file in the district court a verified petition setting fo names and residences of the parties and the facts relating to the emplo ment at the time of the injury, the injury in its extent and chara amount of wages being received at the time of injury, the knowlec or notice to the employer of the occurrence of said injury and su upon the adverse party, as in civil petition. Return of service shall bt causes, together with a copy made within four days from suance of the summons. Within seven days after the re summons, the party upon whom the same is served shall fi said petition, which shall admit or deny the substantial «•! petition, and shall state the contention of the defendant w to the matters in dispute, as disclosed by the petition. The answ be verified in like manner as required for a petition. At the exp of the time fixed for filing answer the court shall p determine the cause without delay and from such judgme prosecuted in accordance with the general laws of the state appeals and actions at law except that such appeal shall within thirty days from the entry of the judgment and the cau be advanced for hearing in the supreme court so as to bring said on for argument before such court within sixty days from the filing the appeal; and said supreme court shall render its judgment and opin in such cases within thirty days after submission Sec. 131. — The amounts of compensation payable periodically und the law, either by agreement of the parties, or by decision of the may be commuted to one or more lump sum payments, except compen&gt; tion due for death and permanent disability. These may be commut only with the consent of the district court. Sec. 132. — All settlements by agreement of the parties and all award of compensation made by the court, except those amounts payable peri odically for six months or more, shall be final and not subject to read justment. Sec. 133. — All amounts paid by an employer or an insurance company 'acts as may be necessary for the information of the court, and als stating the matter or matters in dispute and the contention of the p&lt; :itioner with reference thereto.

            <seg id="p135">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 135 To Whom the Law Applies The law will apply to every employer in this state employing five or more employes, except those employing household domestic servants, farm laborers and railroad companies doing interstate commerce, who are subject to Congress and not within the provisions of this law. However, other employers and employes not included in this act may be their joint election, file with the Insurance Commissioner, and accept the provisions of Part II. Part I is so framed as to penalize both the employer and employe if they do not elect to remain within the provision of Part II, as follows: If an employer is sued for damages he can not avail himself of the de - fenses of assumption of risk, fellow servant doctrine, contributory negli - gence, which means the loss of the old time common law defenses. Should an employe elect for litigation as against compensation the employer can use these three defenses when suit is brought against him, and all actions at law brought under Part I of this act, the burden of proof to establish wilful negligence of the injured employe shall be on the de - fendant Part II. Every employer (other than those exempted) automatically comes within the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law and will be governed by its provisions unless the employer posts, and thereafter keeps posted, in a conspicuous place about the place or places where his workmen are employed, a written or printed notice of his election not to be bound by Part II, and he must file a duplicate of such posted notice with the Insurance Commissioner, and unless every employe gives a writ - ten or printed notice to his employer of his refusal to be bound by Part II and files a duplicate proof of the services of such notice, with the Insurance Commissioner, he will automatically come within the provisions of the law, and be governed by its provisions. If an employer has given notice not to accept the provisions of Part II he may later waive such notice by posting in a conspicuous place a written or printed notice of withdrawal and file a duplicate notice with the Insurance Commissioner. If an employe has given notice not to accept the provisions of Part II, he may later waive such notice by a notice in writing directed to the employer and serve same upon his employer or his agent, and file a dupli - cate with the Insurance Commissioner. The waiver will not be effective until noon of the fifth day after filing the required notice with the Insur - ance Commissioner. Printed blank forms for making the elections under the law will be furnished by the Commissioner of Insurance or the State Department of Labor upon application. The following forms have been approved by the attorney general for use in the administration of the compensation law: </seg>

            <seg id="p143">WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION LAW 143 The General Divisions of the Law "Part I" refers to the adjudication of personal injury damage suits in the courts and affects employers and employes who do not "elect" to operate under Part II — the Compensation Law. Part I is so framed as to penalize both employer and employe if they elect to retain the com - mon law system based upon negligence of the employer, the object being to encourage everyone to accept the automatic workmen's compensation system as set forth in Part II. The Two Options All employers of five or more persons, except railroads engaged in interstate commerce and employers of farm labor, domestic servants and "casual workers" are presumed by the terms of the law to have "elected" to come within the provisions of Part II, in the absence of written or printed notice to the contrary. (See Section 12.) Any employer may elect to be liable only for those accidents for which — through negligence — he may be responsible, by posting a notice to this effect in the place where his workmen are employed, but in such cases the employer cannot, when sued for damages on account of the accidental death or injury of an employe, avail himself of either of the following defenses: Assumption of risk, Fellow-servant doctrine, Contributory negligence. The loss of these old time and most important common law defenses constitutes the penalty imposed by the legislature upon the employer who elects for litigation under Part I in preference to compensation under Part II. (See Section 3.) Employe's Option All employes (where the employer is subject to the Act, as shown in Section 6) are likewise presumed to have elected to work under Part II, unless they serve a written notice upon the employer to the contrary, as prescribed in Section 12. If an employe elects for litigation as against compensation, the em - ploye is penalized, for in such cases the three defenses above mentioned are available to the employer when suit is brought against him, thereby greatly lessening the employe's chance to recover a judgment. It will be noted that the framers of this law have made it a strong inducement to both parties to work together under the Compensation System. If the experience under similar laws in other states is a criterion, few if any of those affected by the Nebraska Act will choose to subject themselves to the uncertainties inherent in the negligence system by re - maining under Part I.
