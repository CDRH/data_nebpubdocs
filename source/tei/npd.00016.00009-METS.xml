The elevation of the hospital, the character of the soil tend to produce conditions of a most sani - tary nature. However, the medical staff feels that the crowding to which the inmates have been subjected on account of lack of room, has resulted in an increased mortality. There have been five deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, in two of which disease undoubtedly has had its inception in this hospital. At the present writing the patients in the male cottage have each only three hundred and seventy-five cubic feet of air space during sleeping hours. On the female side, the individual quota four hundred and forty cubic feet. This amount is far below the proper air space which normally should be at least one thousand cubic feet. DIETARY Iis the aim of the present management to make the diet of patients liberal and varied and as closely as possible adapted he needs of the individual case. To this end the products he farm and garden are carefully employed and a studied ary will be provided for the different wards. It is hoped that ass dairy will be provided which will give us an abun - t supply of good nourishing milk. NURSING DEPARTMENT. The nursing force of the hospital is now undergoing re-organ - ■&gt;n. Instead of separate departments for both male and female patients in charge of attendants who though willing efficient are unskilled in nursing, it is our intention to pro - vide a co-ordinsu -m of nursing under the direction of an trained nurse who will be designated the chief r.orse. Aided by the medical officers of the hospital she will establish a training school to which young ladies and men de - sirous of adopting a nil reer will be admitted. It is our desire that this training school be affiliated with a private hospital where the graduates of our school may n credit for the work done here and graduate in a year's with a regular trained nurse's diploma. Negotiations are now in progress looking toward a fulfillment of this purpose. '''he members of our training school will be admitted only </seg>
            <seg id="p005">215 are actuated by a sincere liking for nursing work. It is hoped that by this means that our patients will receive more thor&lt; care and that the hospital in future will be free from all rumors of cruelty and abuse Hand in hand with impr. ng will go a thorough and painstaking medical supervision of our inmates. More exact clinical work will be performed and a new system of records installed. FARM AND STOCK. The hospital now has an acreage &lt;&gt;f three hundred and twen - ty acres. This in previous years has proved insufficient. During the year just passed, there have been rented one hundred and t'fty-four acres of land lying about one-half mile north-west ol the hospital site. The year has been favorable for the rais - ing of crops and the hospital has reaped an abundant reward for the time and labor expended in working this land. The one hundred and sixty acres of which the land rented forms a part, is now for sale and inasmuch as the land in this part of the state is becoming more scarce every year and its price ily rising, I would recommend consideration of the advisability of buying this quarter section could a reasonable price be ob- The stock belonging to the hospital is in a healthy and pros - ondition. We now have one hundred and two hou which twenty-six are brood sows and the remainder are being fattened for the sustenance of the hospital. I am sorry to say that the dairy herd does not come up to the standard sirable for an institution of this nature. It is composed mainly rub stock derived from the so-called beef breeds and - but a very small quantity of milk in proportion to the ration -■ umed. I would suggest that an appropriation be made which will *• us to dispose of the greater part of this herd for beef to replace them by some standard dairy breed such as or Ayrshire. By doing this with the ample pav forage land that the hospital possesses, we can always be of an abundant supply of one of the prime necessiti&gt; hospital. IMPROVEMENTS EFFECTED. ce the hospital was opened March 15th. 1905 the follov improvements have been made: </seg>

In ee to the patients who are employed here, there should be installed an electric power towing machine bench of ) machines. This could be done for the sum of $500.00 and would greatly increase the efficiency of this department. The hog and cow yard is in a ba of repair and is at present arranged in a very inconvenient way. The drai .e yard is very poor and the yard needs grading. Much of the en brick remaining on the grounds could be utilized I with proper fencing, a very convenient stock yard coul constructed. The old frame stable now in use dates back to the beginning of the hospital. It is small and very much brok - lown and moreover it occupies a location which soon will i&gt;e utilized for a hospital building. I would recomti that a new and commodious combined stable and cow barn be 1'iiilt directly south of the present hay barn. .Much is owing to the employes of the hospital for the I liich they have put up with the very annoying ineoi •s consequent to the overcrowding of the hospital. Their quarters have been unsanitary and have been provided with little or no plumbing. A new system of plumbing should be ided for these apartments and the rooms be placed in a &gt;rtable and sanitary condition. NEW BUILDINGS NEEDED. Mention has been made of the present crowded state of the hospital The low per capita air space for sleeping quarters is lieve without precedent in the history of the state institu - tions. We now have 165 patients sleeping where by allotting a per capita air space of 800 cu. ft. only 90 should be all&lt; The cottages should not accommodate more than 45 patients each and this only when the present dining rooms are turned dormitories. The new wing is now ready to be occupied and will tec modate 78 inmates which together with the three cottages will a total capacity of 213 patients. There are now in the hospital 219 patients, of whom 113 are males and 106 females. The new wing and male cottage will take care of 123 patients iff a surplus of 10 beds to provide for the increase of male </seg>
            <seg id="p009">219 Kto note that the number of applications for admission show a&lt;ly increase and that there are now a number of path e Lincoln hospital who should be cared for at the Norfolk institution. I'e need additional room sufficient for V2~) patient! to be ished by a hospital building for female patients an for men. The hospital building should be especially ada; the treatment of the acutely insane and a.s such will entail a higher per capita cost of construction. It should be built to accommodate 75 to 80 patients and will cost not less than 'i&gt;0. The cottage for men should lie similar to the in use and will cost $30,000., the cost of construction greatly increased over that obtaining three years ago. CONDITION OF FUNDS The balance in the different funds will be sufficient to I hospital to the end of the biennium with tin- exception of fuel and lights and the board and clothing funds. In the ler there will be a deficiency of approximately $2,500.00. In board and clothing fund owing to its being drawn ily for repairs and for furnishing the west win jr. it is [ able that we shall fall short to the extent of $1,800 to $2 the end of the fiscal year there will be available u pended funds amounting to $1,850.00 as per following table: Appropriation. Expended. Available. Balance. Total available $1,850.00. I would suggest that in your fto the legislature that you recommend that these moi ansferred to the board and clothing fund and furthern 1 emergency exists that they be made available at once ap - le passage of the bill. With $1,000.00 added to the board clothing fund I believe that by the practice of a si economy there will be no further deficiency. PER CAPITA COST OF MAINTENANCE. The last three semi-annual reports show a steady decrease in the per capita cost of maintenance. From June 1. 1906 to '05 the expense per capita was $120 07. from Dec. 1. lift urn of patients $1,000.00 I $17:: B)lain 300.00 ts &amp; oils l'.i 100.00 ■00 789 150.00 800.00 «SXf Fire hose 7",0.00 :..")() 196.50 </seg>
