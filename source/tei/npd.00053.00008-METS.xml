Moisture determinations were made on a part of the plats of the seed-bed preparation experiments, from 1914 to 1917 inclusive. These were made on two dates in 1914. on four dates in IMS, and on three dates each in 1916 and 1917. In all of these tlie determinations were made for each foot section to a depth of six feet. In 1917 one series of samples was taken to a depth of six feet only. The moisture percentages are shown in Table 4.

The average gain from packing when the tilt two dates of plowing are considered together is 1.8 bushels per acre. This is sufficient to more than pay for the cost of packing. The necessity of packing and the advantages to be expected from it will depend much upon the condition of the ground at plowing and at seeding time. On clean ground containing suf - ficient moisture to plow well, harrowing and drilling may be sufficientto firm the ground and make a good seed bed If on the other hand there is a heavy growth of stubble or trash on the ground, or if the soil is somewhat dry and breaks up cloddy, </seg>

Subsoiling is as laborious and expensive an operation as plowing, but must be done in addition to it and at the same time. Plowing with a special deep-tillage machine to a depth of 12 to 14 inches requires con - siderably more than double the labor, time, and expense of ordi - nary plowing.
