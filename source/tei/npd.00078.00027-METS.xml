L. HATHAWAY AND H. P. DAVIS Department of Dairy Husbandry LINCOLN, NEBRASKA DECEMBER, 1933 </seg>
            <seg id="p002">summary A study was made of the vitamin A content of skimmilk, of milk standardized by the addition of separated milk, and of cream. Rats whose body stores of vitamin A had been depleted by being fed a vitamin A deficient ration were fed either skimmilk, standardized milk, or cream as a source of vitamin A. Approximately 750 rats were used in nine experiments. From the results of these experiments the following conclusions were drawn: (1) that the vitamin A content of milk is associated largely with the butterfat and that separated milk containing a small quantity of fat contains only a small amount of vitamin A, (2) that the standardization of the butterfat content of milk by the addition of separated milk reduces its vitamin A potency, and (S) that, under the conditions of these experiments, Holstein cream contained more vitamin A than Jersey cream. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">The Vitamin A Content of Skimmilk, Standardized Milk, and Cream from Different Breeds of Cows L L. HATHAWAY AND H. P. DAVIS During preliminary trials m the writers' study of the vitamin A content of the milk of Holstein, Ayrshire, Jersey, and Guernsey cows (2), the vitamin potency of unstandard - ized Holstein milk was compared with that of Jersey milk, of which the butterfat content was standardized to the same percentage of fat by the addition of Jersey separated milk. It was noted that the unstandardized milk seemed to be slightly more potent m vitamin A than the standardized milk. From the study noted above the conclusion was drawn that under the conditions of our experiments the difference m the vitamin A content of the milk from the Holstein, Ayrshire, Jersey, and Guernsey breeds was insignificant. It is well known that Jersey and Guernsey milk have a higher aver - age content of butterfat than the milk of the other breeds. Therefore, the question arose whether standardized milk from a Jersey or Guernsey herd would always have the same vita - min A content as unstandardized milk from a Holstein herd. Since standardization of butterfat is a common practice among milk dealers it was decided to study the effect of this practice upon the vitamin A content of milk. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE The management of the rat colony and the procedure for the determination of vitamin A were essentially the same as those outlined m a previous study (2), except where other - wise indicated. The breeding stock which produced the rats used m Experiments I, 111, IV, V, and VI was reared on Stock Ration 1, composed as follows : Stock Ration 1 Wheat 290 grains Peas 75 grains Yellow corn 280 grams Alfalfa flour 50 grams Meat scraps 100 grams Calcium carbonate 15 grams Oatmeal 75 grams Sodium chloride 10 grams In addition to this ration the rats received either sprouted oats or milk ad libitum daily. The ration was prepared by grinding finely all the ingredients and then adding 2 per cent by weight of cod-liver oil. 1 All rations were freshly mixed each week. When the young rats were to. beiused. for vitamin A studies the breeders were placed on Stock Ration 2, composed as follows : 1 Standardized cod-liver oil from Mead, Johnson &amp; Company, Evanaville. Indiana, was used. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 69 Stock Ration 2 Ground whole wheat 66% Sodium chloride _ 1% Whole milk powder 2 33 % Sprouted oats ad libitum The antirachitic requirements of the breeding rats were supplied by irradiation of this ration for 40 minutes at a distance of 60 centimeters in a layer one to two millimeters in depth with a Cooper-Hewitt quartz mercury vapor lamp 3 run at 2.4 amperes, 220 volts. The breeding stock which produced the rats used in Experi - ments II, VII, VIII, and IX was maintained on the Steenbock Stock Ration, composed as follows: Stock Ration 3 Ye.low corn 76.0% Ground alfalfa 2.0% Linseed oil meal 16.0% Sodium chloride 0.5% Crude casein 5.0% Calcium carbonate 0.5% The materials were finely ground and then 5 per cent by weight of butter was added. In addition to this ration the animals received milk daily and lettuce several times each week. Since vitamin A is a growth-promoting vitamin, the vitamin A determinations were made by comparing the growth produced when groups of rats, whose body stores of vitamin A had been depleted by being fed a vitamin A free ration, were fed these milks as a source of this vitamin. The rats Used in Experiments I, II, IV, V, and, VI were albino rats whose parents were obtained from the Wistar Institute, while those used in Experiments III, VII, VIII, and IX were from pied stock reared in our laboratory. Male and female rats, 24 to 28 days old and weighing between 35 and 45 grams, were fed a vitamin A free basal ration com - posed of casein, 18 per cent; corn starch, 78 per cent; and salt mixture (McCollum No. 185) (9) , 4 per cent. One gram of dried yeast daily was fed separately as the source of the vitamin B complex. 4 The antirachitic factor was supplied by irradiation of the corn starch with a Cooper-Hewitt quartz mercury vapor lamp run at 2.4 amperes, 220 volts. One hundred grams of starch were spread uniformly over an area 60 centimeters square in metal trays and then irradiated for 40 minutes at a distance of 60 centimeters. All experimental animals received distilled water to which iodine was added once each week according to the method of Sure (16). The 1 "Cremora A" whole milk powder from the Dry Milk Company, New York, was used. •Uviarc Poultry Treater, Type R. I. Special 100. t Compressed yeast was furnished through the courtesy of the Fleischmann Yeast Company. It was diied in a current of air at room temperature, finely ground, and fed without further treatment. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Vitamin A in Milk and Cream rats were weighed twice each week except during the deple - tion period, at which time they were weighed daily. The litters were allotted so that as far as possible related animals were distributed throughout all the groups. Each rat was placed in an individual cage at weaning and remained there until the experiment was complete. A negative control receiv - ing only the basal ration, and a positive control which received the basal ration supplemented with 0.1 cc. of cod-liver oil daily, were selected from each litter except where several litters were started on the milk supplement at approximately the same time. The feeding of milk was begun when ophthal - mia was in its incipient stage, or when there was a cessa - tion of growth. As a rule the pre-experimental or depletion period lasted for about five weeks, while the feeding trial was carried on eight weeks. The milk used in these studies was taken from groups of cows typical of the breed. All the cows were from the Experi - ment Station herd and were selected so far as possible (Table 1) for uniformity of age, stage of lactation, number of lactations, and stage of gestation. In general the cows in each group were milked the same number of times daily and received the same feeds. The cows milked four times per day received Ration 3, while those milked two or three times per day received Ration 4. These rations were composed as follows : Ration 3 Ration 4 Corn 200 lbs. Corn 250 lbs. Oats _ 200 lbs. Oats 250 lbs. Bran 150 lbs. Bran 300 lbs. Hominy 50 lbs. Cottonseed meal 200 lbs. Linseed oil meal 50 lbs. Salt 10 lbs. Gluten feed 100 lbs. Lime 5 lbs. Beet pulp ._ 100 lbs. Bone meal 5 lbs. Cottonseed meal 50 lbs. Salt 10 lbs. Lime 10 lbs. Bone meal 5 lbs. The average daily food consumption per cow was approxi - mately 20 to 25 pounds of silage, 5 to 20 pounds of grain, and 20 pounds of alfalfa hay. An aliquot of the milk produced at each milking during a 24-hour period was taken. This milk was bottled in one-half pint bottles and stored at 0° C. until used. </seg>

McCollum, Sim - monds, and Steenbock (7) made the observation that fat - free milk, when included in a diet consisting otherwise of purified food substances, promoted growth and prevented decline of animals in a manner which indicated that it still contained the fat-soluble essential in appreciable amounts. McCollum (8) later stated that "Recent experiments lead us to believe that approximately half of the fat-soluble dietary essential is present in the fat and half in the non-fat portion </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 69 of the milk." Hopkins (5) reported that he had experimental evidence to show that highly separated milk contains an amount of the so-called fat-soluble substance decidedly in ex - cess of what the residual fat would seem to indicate. Sher - man, MacLeod, and Kramer (13) reported that according to their experience skimmed milk contained probably about half as much fat-soluble vitamin as whole milk. Steenbock and Snell (15) reported that skimmed milk contained only about 20-25 per cent as much vitamin A as whole milk. Morgan (11) studied the vitamin A content of skimmed milk powder containing about 0.7 per cent fat and reported that average whole milk should be more than 8 times more valuable as a source of vitamin A than the skimmilk made from it. Platon (12) studied the vitamin A content of skimmed milk and concluded that the vitamin A in milk other than that con - tained in the fat is insignificant. McCollum and Simmonds (10) stated that "Hart (personal communication) informs us that probably over 90% of the vitamin A in whole milk is removed in the skimming process". Crawford, Golding, Perry, and Zilva (1) studied the fat-soluble vitamins in milk and concluded that the entire vitamin A content of milk is associated with the milk fat. Sherman and Smith (14) stated that "So far as the writers are aware, there is no con - clusive evidence as to how the vitamin A content of milk is divided quantitatively between its fat globules and its aqueous phase". In Experiment I all the milk produced during a 24-hour period by a group of ten Jersey cows was collected, pooled, tested by the Babcock test, and divided into two lots. Lot 1, which was the whole milk, was left unaltered, while Lot 2 was separated. The whole milk tested 6.2 per cent butter - fat, while the separated milk tested 0.01 per cent butterfat. Lot 1 and the separated milk from Lot 2 were bottled and stored at Q° C. until fed. The results are shown in Table 2. The whole milk was fed in 1, 2, and 3 cc. quantities daily, while the separated milk was fed in 10, 20, and 30 cc. quan - tities. The rats allowed the larger quantities of the separated milk did not consume the entire amount given after the first week. The average gains per rat in the 1, 2, and 3 cc. whole - milk groups were respectively 54, 65, and 63 grams. Of the 45 rats fed separated milk, only 9 survived and they were losing weight and had ophthalmia. .As the rats receiving the separated milk survived somewhat longer than the rats receiv - ing only the vitamin A free diet, it seemed that the separated milk contained a very small quantity of this vitamin. Experiment II was a repetition of this study with milk pro - duced by Holstein cows. All the milk produced by a group of </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Vitamin A in Milk and Cream five cows was collected and treated as explained above. The whole milk tested 3.25 per cent butterfat, while the separated milk tested 0.03 per cent butterfat. The whole milk was fed in 1 and 2 cc. quantities while the separated milk was fed in 15 and 25 cc. quantities. The average gains per rat in the 1 and 2 cc. whole-milk groups were respectively 29 and 56 grams. Of the 42 rats fed separated milk, 19 survived, 17 of which were losing weight. All had ophthalmia. These results were therefore in agreement with those of the first experiment and it was concluded that separated milk con - taining only a small quantity of butterfat contains also only a small amount of vitamin A.

            <seg id="p011">Vitamin A in Mjxk and Cream should be called to the fact that three of the Holstein cows which produced milk used in Experiment III were milked four times daily, while only one of the Jersey cows was milked four times daily. As explained above the cows milked four times per day received Ration 3, while those milked twice a day received Ration 4. The test was repeated in Experi - ment IV. In this trial the milks were fed in y_\ 1, 1^2. and 2 cc. quantities. The groups fed these quantities of Holstein milk gained respectively an average of 5, 14, 34, and 50 grams per rat. The corresponding groups fed standardized Jersey milk gained respectively an average of -26, 6, 23, and 37 grams per rat. Again the gains were greater in the lots fed unstandardized milk. Unstandardized Holstein milk was compared with standard - ized Ayrshire milk in Experiments V and VI. In Experiment V the milks were fed in 1, lVa, and 2 cc. quantities. The groups fed the Holstein milk gained respectively an average of 35, 53, and 63 grams per rat, while the corresponding groups fed standardized Ayrshire milk gained an average of 20, 16, and 40 grams per rat. The test was repeated in Ex - periment VI. In this experiment the milks were fed at 1 and 2 cc. levels. The groups fed the unstandardized Holstein milk gained respectively an average of 49 and 58 grams per rat. The corresponding groups fed standardized Ayrshire milk gained an average of 39 and 51 grams per rat. In these two experiments as in Experiments III and IV the groups fed unstandardized milk made the larger gains. No attempt was made to study the results statistically, as the number of rats in each group of the first two experiments was rather small. It seemed evident, however, from these four experiments that standardization of the butterfat content by the addition of separated milk reduced its vitamin A potency. In order to check the effect of standardization still further, Experiment VII was run in which a study was made of the vitamin A content of standardized and unstandardized Jersey or Guernsey milk. A sample of Jersey milk and a sample of Guernsey milk were collected in the usual manner. The Jer - sey milk tested 5.3 per cent fat, while the Guernsey milk tested 4.6 per cent fat. Half of each sample of milk was standardized to 3.5 per cent fat. The Jersey milk was standardized by the addition of Jersey separated milk, while the Guernsey milk was standardized by the addition of Guernsey separated milk. Each of these four types of milk was fed at 1 cc. levels to groups of 20 to 25 rats. The results are summarized in Table 4 and statistically examined in Table 5. The group fed unstandardized Jersey milk made an </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 69 average gain of 57±1.4 grams per rat, while the group fed standardized Jersey milk made an average gain of only 43 ± 2.0 grams. The group receiving unstandardized Guern - sey milk made an average gain per rat of 60 ± 1.6 grams, while the group receiving the standardized Guernsey milk made an average gain of only 46 ± 1.6 grams. In other words the unstandardized milks as a source of vitamin A pro - duced an average gain of 14 grams more than did the stand - ardized milks. When these differences were divided by their probable errors, values of 5.7 and 6.3 were obtained. Since differences of 3.2 or more times the probable error of the difference are significant, it is evident that the difference was a true one, and, therefore, the unstandardized milks were more potent in vitamin A than were the stand - ardized milks. From the results of these five experiments, it was concluded that the standardization of the butterfat con - tent of milk by the addition of separated milk reduces its vitamin A potency.

            <seg id="p013">Vitamin A in Milk and Cream Although these data refer only to vitamin A, it seems likely that since vitamin D and vitamin E are also fat-soluble vita - mins, the standardization of the butterfat content of milk by the addition of separated milk would reduce its vitamin D and vitamin E content. This statement is made on the assump - tion that these vitamins are associated only with the butter - fat. Since milk is generally a rather poor source of vitamin D, this reduction would appear to be of less importance than that which occurs in the case of vitamin A. On the other hand such standardization of milk, whose vitamin D content has been greatly increased by feeding the cows irradiated yeast, would no doubt cause a marked reduction in its vitamin D content. In contrast to the reduction in fat-soluble vita - mins, a slight increase might theoretically be expected in the case of the water-soluble vitamins. As pointed out by Kelley and Clement (6), the standardization of milk by the addition of separated milk increased its solids-not-fat content. There - fore, milk standardized in this manner has a higher food value, from the standpoint of solids-not-fat, than has normal milk of the same fat percentage. the vitamin a content of holstein and jersey cream As mentioned above, the results obtained in our study (2) of the vitamin A content of the milk of Holstein, Ayrshire, Jersey and Guernsey cows led to the conclusion that, under the conditions of our experiments, the difference in the vita - min A content of the milk produced by these breeds was in - significant. It was shown above that separated milk contain - ing a small amount of butterfat contained only a small quan - tity of vitamin A and that the standardization of the butter - fat content of milk by the addition of such separated milk reduced its vitamin A potency. It is well known that Jersey milk has a higher average content of butterfat than Holstein milk. Furthermore, as pointed out by Hunziker (4), with the cream screw set to deliver a definite richness of cream and all other conditions normal, the separator will deliver a definite ratio of skimmilk and cream, and the purpose of the cream screw, milk screw, or skimmilk screw is to regulate the ratio of cream to skimmilk and to control the richness of the cream. In view of these facts the question arose whether Holstein and Jersey cream, having the same percentage of butterfat, are always equal as a source of vitamin A. A study was therefore made of the vitamin A content of Holstein and Jersey cream in Experiments VIII and IX. Milk was collected from groups of four to nine cows as explained above. The milk produced by each group was pooled separ- </seg>

The cream screw was set to deliver 20 per cent Holstein cream and the Jersey milk was separated by the same separator and then standardized to 20 per cent fat by the addition of Jersey separated milk. The original plan was to set the cream screw to deliver 20 per cent Holstein cream and then adjust it later to deliver 20 per cent Jersey cream, but this method proved too time-consuming to be practical. In Experiment VIII the Holstein milk tested 3.4 and the Jersey milk 6.4 per cent butterfat. In Experiment IX the Holstein milk contained 3.5 and the Jersey milk 6.7 per cent butterfat. The cream was bottled in one-half pint milk bottles and stored at 0° C. until fed.

            <seg id="p015">Vitamin A in Milk and Cream In the first experiment the creams were fed at 0.2 and 0.4 cc. levels, while in the second experiment they were fed at 0.18 cc. levels. In both experiments the cream was taken daily from storage at 0° C, melted slowly, and held at 37° C. The quantity allowed each rat was then measured with a special serological pipette having a graduation interval of 0.01 milliliter. The results of the two experiments are sum - marized in Table 6 and are statistically examined in Table 7. The group fed 0.2 cc. of Holstein cream made an average gain per rat of 53 ± 1.7 grams, while the group fed 0.2 cc. of Jersey cream made an average gain of only 37 ± 1.8 grams. The group fed 0.4 cc. of Holstein cream gained 75 ± 2.3 grams, while the corresponding Jersey group gained 55 ± 1.6 grams. When these differences of 16 and 20 were divided by their probable errors, values of 6.4 and 7.1 respectively were obtained. Since differences of 3.2 or more times the probable error are considered significant, it is evident that these differ - ences were statistically significant and, therefore, the Hol - stein cream was more potent in vitamin A than was the Jer - sey cream. In Experiment IX each kind of cream was fed at 0.18 cc. levels. The group fed Holstein cream made an average gain per rat of 38 ± 1.0 grams, while the group fed Jersey cream gained 27 ± 1.4 grams. When this difference of 11 was divided by its probable error a value of 6.4 was obtained. It was again evident that the difference was statistically sig - nificant and that the conclusion drawn from Experiment VIII was confirmed. These results seem not to be in agreement with those of Wilbur, Hilton, and Hauge (17), who compared the vitamin A activity of butters from Ayrshire and Guernsey cows and reported that the vitamin A activities of their samples were similar regardless of the breed of cows. However, on the basis of our results, which showed that the Holstein cream was more potent in vitamin A than was the Jersey cream, it was concluded that when Holstein and Jersey cows are maintained under similar feeding conditions, if the butterfat content of the milk produced varies widely, as in these experiments, the vitamin A content of the cream separ - ated from this milk will also vary. It seems likely that as the percentages of fat in these milks approach each other the difference in the vitamin A content of the cream separated from them will disappear. </seg>
