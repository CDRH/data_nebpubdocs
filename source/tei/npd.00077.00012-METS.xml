Mehrens Wayne ' Phil Damme Webster No report Wheeler No report BY PRESIDENT MILLER: What report does the credentials com - mittee have to make. BY CHAIRMAN GOLDER: The only case we have at this time is from Phelps Co. BY MR. O. C. RANDALL: The whole question is whether we are authorized to vote. We come here this morning from our County Fair Association. We had the appropriation last year. We held a Fair, and have held them at Holdrege. Bertrand, a little town in the county, has made plans to have a rival organization, hut they have not made any financial statement and they have paid in nothing to this association. What we want to know is whether we are to be seated and entitled to vote in this meeting. BY SECRETARY REED: A copy of what we have in this office is from Bertrand. Going back into the records from fifty or sixty years ago there was a court ruling that in order to be present and entitled to vote an organization must comply with certain conditions. We have always tried to follow this Supreme Court ruling and we have from time to time been compelled to have some of the organizations re-write their constitution. Some of them have com - plied with these demands. BY MR. RANDALL: We had been getting the appropriation from the County Board. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: It doesn't so show in the report. BY MR. RANDALL: Have you any record that shows where Bertrand sent in any report or money? I don't think they have held a fair for years. We had the appropriation in 1932 and as we had some money left over we didn't get another one until 1933. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: What is the recommendation of your committee? </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BY SECRETARY REED: I would say that Bertrand has filed no report. BY MR. VANCE: I think this man has showjn he should be seated. They got the county money. BY MR. RANDALL: We had $300 left in 1933 so we didn't go back for more in addition to what we got in. 1932. We are receiving the 1934 appropriation. BY MR. VANCE: I move that this delegate from Phelps County be seated. Motion seconded. Vote taken, and motion carried. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: The secretary will now make the formal roll call. (Roll call showed Hawk. See preceding pages for county dele - gates.) • Mr. Vance called to the chair. We will now receive the Presi - dent's message. THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS The year of 1933 has been significant in the life history of fairs. It has been important in indicating that the crisis is about past. The peak of depression so far as attendance and financial remuneration is concerned has apparently been reached. We are now about to decend into a more favorable atmosphere where the results of our labor and efforts will be rewarded. This does not mean that we can sit back idly and rest on our oars. The requirements of our endeavors are even greater than before if we are to maintain the small amount of success we have attained. Finances and entertainment must be guarded with a watch dog tenacity. Officials of the various fairs must study their budgets and their kinds of entertainment. It is the aim ot all legitimate under - takings to give the greatest amount of good to the greatest number of people at the least possible expense. The immutable law of good judgment and honest effort will always prevail. In studying the financial reports of the various fairs and ex - positions held throughout the United States and Canada, it is ap - parent that the county fairs were slightly more successful financially than the state fairs. The reason for this can no doubt be attributed to the fact that the county fairs were able to eliminate certain ex - penses which the state fairs could not. For an illustration the county fair is a local institution and the officials can contribute their labors and efforts to that fair with practically no expense to themselves </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE outside of their time, while those of the state institutions, must, in many cases, go a great distance from their homes and remain away the entire duration ot the fair. This expense must be endured by the fair association if the officials are to remain on the job. In addition to this, home talent entertainment, with very little expense, can be given with success in county fairs. There is a local color to this class of entertainment and creates a lot of interest with the result of a large attendance. For, after all, increased attend - ance is what is wanted. With the state fairs it is almost impossible to put over a proposition of this kind successfully. The distance those who are to appear on the program would have to journey is so great that the expense would be heavier than would be the case if professionals were employed. Thus the state fairs must either have rodeos, circuses, revues or professional free acts to provide the nec - essary entertainment for their patrons. As a result of investigations and interviews with the managers, di - rectors, exhibitors and those essentially interested in fairs we find a highly bouyant feeling. The outlook is brighter than it has been for the last two or three years. As a matter of fact no difference how dark and gloomy the outlook of a fair may be, the managers and di - rectors can not afford to be down cast or pessimistic. Neither must they throw a wet blanket on any enthusiasm anyone might manifest nor cause the patrons or exhibitors to become discouraged. Their faces must at all times be pointed towards the rising sun with a look and hope of expectation for the brighter days which they confidently assert will come. Optimism must be the rule and guide of their actions. Although fairs are held first for educational purposes and second for entertainment, yet the financial end must not be forgotten. Premiums for the best exhibits are provided in order that the best of the whole country might be brought together in competition. Then amusements such as horse and auto races, free acts and revues must be secured to make a well balanced program for the pleasure of the patrons and guests. Besides this there is a labor bill for putting the grounds in shape and maintaining them, and a labor bill for actually running the fair. All this costs money and the finances must be provided by the fair management. The usual methods of raising funds is charging admission at the front gates and at the grandstand, charging for concessions of various kinds and from county levies in the case of county fairs and state ap - proporiations for state fairs. In years of prosperity this question takes care of itself and everything runs along like a long sweet song and the cares of the fair management are at a minimum. But when ■ ■ ■ . ■■ : </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE adversity comes and depression settles on the land a different story is told. Not only do admissions and concessions shrink but also levies and appropriations dry up, in many instances like dew before the sun. The natural thing to do is to curtail expenses by cutting pre - miums, reducing help and wages and providing less money tor races and all other forms of amusements. Even this reduced budget has often failed to keep the fair out of the red. Bills must be met and expenses paid if the fair is to continue. Necessary funds become the all important question with fair managers and directors. Is it any wonder many of them lose sleep and become bent and pre - maturely grey. In his annual address as President of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions, Arthur R. Corey stated that the 1933 lowa State Fair, of which he is secretary, had put on harness races during the day time and rodeo and running races at night. The night events proved a wonderful success. It was a complete sell out and the patrons were loud in their praise in the efficient manner in which the various events were conducted. Considerable expense was incurred in secur - ing the proper lighting effect. The Association spent $3,500 besides borrowing a large number of lights and reflectors from the Drake University and the Des Moines high school. Mr. Corey made a. careful study of the financial conditions of the fairs. Averages from 21 fairs with which he had been in communica - tion disclosed that receipts for the 1933 fairs increased 8% over those of 1932 and expenses decreased 19%. Obviously this accounts for the financial success of the 1933 fairs over those of 1932. Your President and your Secretary who were sent to the Chicago meeting by the Board of Managers as representatives of the Nebraska State Fair took part in every session of the Association. Much use - ful information which will be of great benefit to our fair, was secured. Copious notes of every address were taken. Your representatives also attended the meeting of the Middle West Fair Circuit Association. By a vote of all the fairs present it was decided that the same car - nival of last year, namely, Castle, Enrlich, Hirsch Shows, would have the Middle West circuit again this year. It was agreed by the rep - resentatives of the shows that they would spend some $40,000 in dolling up their equipment and furnishing new features. By the -rea - son of the fact that one company having the entire circuit, a much more remunerative contract can be secured by the individual fairs. The shows open at Des Moines, lowa, and run almost continually thru to Dallas, Texas. Although the Nebraska State Fair was not as successful financially in 1933 as it should have been yet it has no reason for serious com - plaint, everything considered. Premiums and other expenses had </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE been cut to the very minimum with the fond hope and expectation that all debts could be paid in full, this would have been done and the 1933 fair would have had a happy ending were it not for the fact that all the grandstand receipts nad to be turned over to the grandstand debenture bond holders. It is generally agreed that no fair can exist without the grandstand receipts and our own fair conclusively proves that statement. Aside from the financial end the Nebraska Fair was successful beyond the hopes of its officers. Wonderful exhibits of every kind were on display, not as many perhaps as in some years past, but in quality as good or better than ever before. This was made possible by the splendid cooperation given by the exhibitors, patrons, super - intendents and all those connected with the fair. All of them ex - pressed their full measure of devotion to the fair, In many cases, with - out hope of fee or reward, by being continually at their places of duty and laboring unceasingly for the best interest of the fair. Without this ardent devotion and self sacrifice no institution as big and im - portant as the Nebraska State Fair could hope to carry on. In conclusion, with the full knowledge of the rough and rugged trail that lies ahead, the fair managers and directors must again put their calloused shoulders to the wheel, push and heave as they have never labored before. The slight success they have attained and the twinkle light they have discerned in the distance should spur them on to greater efforts. As the lofty mountain is not surmounted by a single leap but rather by patient toil of step by step, so the success of the fair ls not attained in one single year, but by working year after year with patient fortitude. If we choose the path of co-operation, self sacrifice and devotion to our duty to our fellowman there will be no question of the out - come of the fairs. Pairs were created for a purpose and will con - tinue to serve its patrons as long as -the people demand it. The citi - zens of the commonwealth are responsible for the fairs and it is within their power to perpetuate them. May each and everyone not be derelict in the duty he owes to his citizenship and to his country. Let optimism be the rule and guide of all our future operations. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We will now receive the report of the resolutions committee. During this first resolution we will ask that you stand in silence and at the conclusion of this reading we will ask some of those who are most closely associated with them to pay tribute to the four departed and absent associates of the past years. REPORT OP RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN E. J. MITCHELL of Deshler: It is with sorrow that we learn of the passing from this life of four of our members during </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1933. A. W. Lamb of Albion, W. T. Parkinson of Pawnee City, Z. T. Leftwich of St. Paul and J. D. Ream of Broken Bow. These men have been earnest and efficient workers in the Agricultural Societies of their home counties of Boone, Pawnee, Howard and Custer in addi - tion to their work as members of the State Board of Agriculture for many years. Therefore be it RESOLVED that this resolution of condolence be spread on the records of this organization and copies of same be for - warded to the families of our departed members. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: First we will hear report upon A. W. Lamb. BY R. R. VANCE of Adams: I always found Arthur Lamb to be a hard worker and sincere in all he did. We had no fairer man on the Board than Arthur Lamb. We found that he was ready to help in every thing you ask him to do. He kept up work at the last fair long after he could have relaxed his labors and let down but he said that as long as he could keep going we would find him at work. BY SECRETARY REED: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I would not feel right indeed if I didn't say a word on this occasion. It was my pleasure to be associated with Mr. Lamb, not only in his own county fair, where we found him indeed a hard worker but in the work of this association and especially during the last Fair. When - ever I was with him in my office we would sit there and talk about the financial condition of the Fair. His interests were there and they remained so up until the last. I think it is fine that we can pay this tribute to this just man. BY MR. CHAS. GRAFF: Mr. President and Gentlemen of this convention we are here pausing for a few moments to pay tribute to four men, who have had a great deal to do with this organization. But I want particularity to say a word for Arty Lamb. I want to say it is more sad when a man passes on who has not yet reached that three score and ten in his life. We had a right to feel that Arty Lamb could remain with us for many more years. He was cut down in the afternoon of his life. He was not privileged to live out the even - ing of his life and it is sad Indeed to us to lose him this way. Arty Lamb was a man of few words. He had a quiet way about him that made you like him and I considered it a great privelege to be asso - ciated with him. I drove up to Albion to that funeral and there that community which has produced some very good men paid a won - derful tribute to Arty Lamb and I feel glad indeed on this afternoon to join in with them. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: If there are no further remarks on </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE this part of the program, we will turn to a few words on our brother W. T. PARKINSON. BY SECRETARY REED: I was indeed glad that I could have the association of my friend Parkinson over a period of twenty years. He was one of my early friends in this work. He was very quiet but when he said anything it was worthwhile. It was my privilege to have attended the funeral at Pawnee City and I want to say they paid a splendid tribute to Mr. Parkinson. One that any man might envy. Ten or twelve years ago Mr. Parkinson lost his wife and that saddened his life. But he maintained his usual cheery smile and did all he could to make life cheerful for those around him in his droll way. And no one associated with him will soon forget. I appreciate these tributes to him. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: He lived out that four score and two years and he seemed to have lived his life in full and yet he main - tained his youth as he went along through the years. BY R. R. VANCE: I don't want to be talking too much but I can't help but get up and say a word for my friend Parkinson. It is not usual that a man can keep that spirit of youth as he goes along in life. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: Now we come to two of the older members. Zack Leftwich was on the Board long before most of us here came into this earth. lam wondering if he didn't serve with you. And if you couldn't give us something, George Jackson. BY GEORGE JACKSON: Mr. President, I served on the board I believe for not over four years with Mr. Leftwich. The State Fair was a hobby of his. You could always depend on him being present when he was called. But I think there are others here who would know more about Mr. Leftwich's work than I do. I first had quiet contacts with him, in other words, but I know that he would always do a job that you could depend on. I believe Bill Banning perhaps knows more about his work than I do. W. B. BANNING: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, my contact with him was not so much on the Board as other places. I know his strength of interest during all those years and whatever he undertook he always remained interested in the Fair. He would come down and give us the advise of his counsel. And I am very glad to have had the con - tact that I did have with him. BY CHAS. GRAFF: I had the pleasure of several years service with Zack Leftwich and it was a pleasure that I will always remember. He was a well met man and a friend at all times. I should indeed have </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE regretted not to have had the privilege of working with this splendid man. He would come to see us while the Fair was on and meet his old friends. I feel that indeed these years of association with Zack were a rare treasure. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We now come to J. D. Ream, of Broken Bow. I believe this can best be presented by Mr. Emerson R. Purcell. BY MR. PURCELL: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I believe no man on this Board had the close contact of Mr. Ream that was my privilege. He was a most unusual man. He was an early settler in Custer County. He took the first homestead, near Broken Bow. He was an early pioneer in Agricultural Work. And in the develop - ment of Agricultural organizations and I think that line of work was a great deal to J. D. Ream. He was privileged to live to see some of the results of this work reach fruition. There is no doubt! but what he was one of the greatest workers in agricultural education. In the early days he used to call at my office. He was one of the older mem - bers of the board who was in this work very early and who dove into it very deeply. He had an unusual capacity for the development of that work. Very early he built a splendid home near Broken Bow and set out trees which are now forty or fifty feet high. He devoted a great deal of time to that line of work and his services were a great benefit. I feel that Mr. Ream has done a great deal of work on this line of work and in the forty years he served this state he did a wonderful work for the State of Nebraska. One of the last honors paid to him was the recent hanging of his picture in the hall of achievement. Then a wonderful tribute was read by Dean W. W. Burr in which he splendidly outlined the life of J. D. Ream. It was my privilege to publish that a short time ago and It is one of the articles that I have been able to publish very wide and received unusual attention. BY DALE P. STOUGH REPORTER: When I came to this state twenty five years ago and had finished law school I went to Broken Bow. I have served this organization for the past eight or nine years in a silent capacity but due to the circumstances I could not let this occasion pass without saying something of the life of this great and wonderful man. During the first year of our married life we formed a close and intimate contact with this unusual family. His daughter Loy came into our home to live while she attended high school In the county seat town. In 1915 when we came to Lincoln for me to take up duties in the State House she came with us and lived with us in our home for the next year. So we had unusual opportunity to form an estimate and enjoyable privilege of this fine man. About that time </seg>
            <seg id="p018">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE when my own father died he seemed to be the man who took his place.

He was the first that I came to know of those whom I have met. Reading of Resolutions resumed by Chairman Mitchell. As each resolution was read. Motion was made, seconded voted upon and adopted that the same be adopted. Discussion thereupon was as follows: Resolution BY CHAIRMAN MITCHELL: This resolution concerning a later opening of schools came from a Fair worker in Furnas county. I wish Mr. Brown would tell us something of the purpose by FLOYD T. BROWN of Furnas county. Be it resolved that the Nebraska State Board_of Agriculture in annual convention assembled plan and conduct a publicity campaign respectfully requesting that all school boards iu the State of Ne - braska co-operate with the Nebraska State Fair and open their schools the second week of September each year. Respectfully yours, FLOYD T. BROWN, Stamford, Nebr. Furnas, Co. With reference to the resolution just read I have noticed in Fair work that the 4-H clubs are very much interested in the State Fair, and that in many schools. throughout the state where the school opens at the same time as the State Fair; some of the teachers and students would like to go to the State Fair and take part but they cannot do so because they do not want to miss school.. It is with the thought that a later date for the schools could be provided and this conflict elimiated. That this resolution has been offered. Chairman Mitchell then moved the adoption of the resolution, and the same was carried. BE IT RESOLVED that the Nebraska County Fair Managers in convention assembled at Lincoln, Nebr., this Jan. 15th. 1934, go on record favoring an amendment to the law setting the date of the </seg>

Respectfully submitted, FLOYD T. BROWN, Delegate Furnas Co. * " Stamford, Nebr. BY CHAIRMAN MITCHELL: There might be some comment of explanation that could be made upon the resolution concerning the conflict of dates between this meeting and the Denver Live Stock Shows. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: I take that thiß Resolution is offered because some of the people in the western part of the state who exhibit at the Denver Live Stock Show find a conflict between its closing dates and this meeting. I have found that by attending here and leaving at once that one can get to Denver for the last couple of days of the show. But perhaps that does not help the exhibitors so much. Does anyone have anything to offer in explanation of this proposal? BY CHARLES GRAFF: If we will go back into the record we will find that the Denver people were induced to change the date of their show on account of Organized Agricultural meetings in this state. They have always blamed us more or less because they felt they got into worse weather through that change, so I think that if a change was made in our metings we would have to take a later date rather than an earlier one because we old fellows have to have a week be - tween the time we come down to Organized Agriculture and would not go right into these meetings without a lapse of a week or ten days. BY SECRETARY REED: A number of people have approached me about this matter and I think there are quite a number who are interested in the Denver Show and at the same time in attending our meetings, so that we ought to consider this matter seriously. (Whereupon the Resolution under discussion was voted upon and adopted.) BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We now come to the order of busi - ness when we will receive nominations for membership upon the Board of Agriculture for the coming year.

At the beginning of the year 1933 we found the Fair had a deficit of $103,764.41. Two bills were introduced in the legislature to take care of the deficit, one bill asking for an appropriation of $53,764.41 and the other for $50,000.00. The bill for $53,764.41 was indefinitely postponed and the one for $50,000.00 failed to get the necessary </seg>

This money was available after the 10th of August and each note that was included in the re - quest has been paid their pro-ratio share when presented for payment. The legislature appropriated $35,000 for maintenance for the biennium or $17,500 for each year which was only about one-half the amount formerly appropriated. The 4-H Club work was cut from $10,000 for the biennium to $7,500 and the amount for agricultural activities was cut from $30,300.00 for the biennium to $15,000.00. Some of the members of the legislature voting for the appropria - tion for our 1931 and 1932 deficit gave us to understand that we were not to come back with a deficit for 1933. That necessitated our cut - ting down our budget in every way possible which cut approximately thirty per cent of that for 1932 and compelled us to include a clause in our premium list and advertising that if the fair did not pay out we would have to pro-rate the expenses. The cutting down of our appropriation for maintenance com - pelled us to pay many items of expense out of state fair receipts which were formerly paid out of maintenance funds. Many of the roofs on the buildings on the fair grounds needed repair and especially the roofs on the Women's Building, Swine Barn, Sheep Barn and Poultry building, these had been in bad shape and neglected for a number of years and had damaged the stringers and sheeting under - neath which had to be replaced with new lumber and then new roofs were put on totaling 164,860 square feet of roof space. The amount of roof space on the various buildings on the grounds would total about 18 acres, which would prove without question of doubt to any - one that there is a great deal of expense in keeping these roofs in good repair. A horse show was put on for the first time at the state fair in connection with the Lincoln Saddle and Bridle Club who put $1,000 of their money into the venture. This made it necessary to do con - siderable remodeling in some of the barns to make room for the show horses. The old K.K.K. dining hall was purchased for $85.00 and remodeled into a pony barn. Due to the different arrangement of exhibits in the Agricultural Hall for the Agricultural Products section, it was necessary to rearrange in the Agricultural Hall at considerable expense. During December we made application for some C. W. A. projects to do some work on the Fair Grounds and were awarded two projects, one for $2,000 and the other for $3,000. We also made application to the Railway Commission to have the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific </seg>

This will enable us to get our grounds in much better shape and the removal of the bridge across Salt Creek will shut off one of the main avenues for people to get into the grounds without pay. While our budget was cut down for the 1933 Fair we feel that the program and entertainment that was given to the patrons of the fair was up to par with past years as we were able to buy much cheaper than ever before. The exhibits at the 1933 State Fair while less in number of entries were, as a rule, better in quality than in previous years. No doubt the reduction in the number of entries was caused first, for the rea - son that the premiums were not paid In full the two previous years; second, the amount of the premiums in the various classes having been reduced on an average of about thirty per cent; third, the financial condition of the country in general. The number of entries in the different classes were as follows: Horse Department 134 Horticulture 406 Horse Show : 188 Domestic Products 1,474 Beef Cattle 332 Bees and Honey 50 Dairy Cattle 273 Needle Work .....1,205 Swine 738 Fine Arts 1^456 Snee P 264 Educational 1,978 Poultr y 399 Horseshoe Pitching 27 p 'eeons 76 club Work 2,551 Rabbits 29 Bird Department '52 Farm Products 1,026 Home Project Booth 14 Total Entries 12,672 This was a decrease in entries over 1932 of approximately 48%. The entries for 1932 showed a decrease over 1931 of 30%. The greatest drawback to the Fair is the fact that we must turn the receipts of the grandstand over to the trust company for the bond holders and pay for the attractions from the receipts of the front gate. In 1929 the legislature, not feeling that they could make an appropriation to build a grandstand, passed a bill giving the State Board of Agriculture the right to issue $250,000 in debenture bonds to build one. These bonds were issued to the trust companies and were sold by them to various people over the state, many of them being sold to persons putting their life's savings into them believing that they were hacked by the state. The contract with the trust companies called for the payment of interest at 5 _ % and an annual payment of $12,500 on the principal, making a total of $25,750 to be paid out of the receipts of the grandstand. In the past four years </seg>
            <seg id="p023">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we have paid in receipts $59,465.98 and at the present time we still owe $255,421.74 which is $5,421.74 more than the original bond issue. While at the meeting of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions at Chicago, I asked the question as to whether any other state fair in the United States or any fair in the Canadian provinces could run a fair and turn their entire grandstand receipts over to some other purpose, they all said that it would be impossible for them to hold a fair and pay the expense of the attractions from the front gate. The financial report of the State Board of Agriculture for the past ten year period — 1920 to 19 29 inclusive — shows the following figures as balance on hand each year and the grandstand receipts for the respective years: . Balance on hand Grandstand each year Receipts 19 20, $3,126.9 7 $43,048.50 192 * :..'.- 8,053.49 27,625.80 1922 - Overdrawn -344.20 26,173.25 1 92 3 890.40 33,124.25 1924 - 199.67 31,795.80 1925 - 1,190.81 26,139.75 192( S 1,418.15 32,472.50 1927 - 231.81 31,487.25 192S 1,390.36 47,591.81 1929 4,236.06 54,554.10 $354,013.01 A review of the total receipts and the amount expended for attractions in front of the grandstand for the past fourteen years, will, I believe, reveal to anyone that it is impossible to pay all the expenses of the fair and attractions out of the receipts of the front gate. The total grandstand receipts for the past fourteen years amounts to $482,799.51, the total expenditures at the grandstand for attractions $616,064.61, and the amount expended for grand - stand attractions OVER the grandstand receipts $133,265.10. It is my private opinion that unless the legislature at the next session makes an appropriation large enough to take care of the inter - est and payment on the grandstand it will be necessary to close the gates of the fair. We can not expect exhibitors to show at the fair unless they receive payment in full for their premiums, nor can we expect business firms to accept a pro-rated share as final settlement </seg>
            <seg id="p024">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for their claims as was necessary this year. Had we had the re - ceipts of the grandstand to use ln paying expenses of the 1933 fair we would have been able to pay out in full. At the International Association of Fairs and Expositions meet - ing at Chicago, Mr. Raymond A. Lee, Manager of the Minnesota State Fair, gave a most interesting address, his subject being, "Everybody Pays" in Minnesota. Before the 1933 Nebraska State Fair, the pres - ent Board considered the matter of passes, and there were 1500 less so.ison passes than in 1932. lam quite sure from the records we have from other state fairs that we issued fewer passes than any other state fair in the country, but never-the-less the pass problem is a very em - barrassing one to handle and always creates more or less trouble and hard feelings, and no doubt some ot the disatisfactiou manifest at this meeting was brought about by the refusal to give out the num - ber of passes requested. I believe that Mr. Lee's address would be of interest to this Asso - ciation and have included part/ of his address in my report which is as follows: "To an audience of fair people, it is surely unnecessary to produce documentary evidence to prove that the wholesale issuance of passes is a menace to any enterprise depending primarily upon gate receipts for its existence. We are all confronted not with mere requests but with insistent demands for free tickets until with most of us it has become a very serious matter. Unfortunately, there is no definite line of demarcation between the person or group actually entitled to a pass and those who should pay their way. Each year the free list increases. Special and emergency groups enroll themselves in the list for non-paids, and the following year the3e special cases, because they were the recipients of passes at the previous fair, expect the same courtesies to continue. And they invariably win out. So it is that ami-ally the management finds a new and larger list of special re - quests. The exception one year becomes routine the next. This orgy has been the established program for years and years at Minnesota State Fair, until the situation got to the point where about half the attendance paid and the other half crashed the gates. Doubtless this is startling to you. Surely, it is a surprise to learn that each cash customer who bought his ticket in reality paid the way of a person who held a pass and who in most instances was far more able to buy a ticket than the individual who put his money on the line. From this it follows that Minnesota State Fair had virtually been operating under a 25-cent gate for several years, but, unable to publicize the fact, lost the value of a good advertising headline. If </seg>
            <seg id="p025">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE you indict the Minnesota State Fair management for this pass evil I agree with you, but the public, with its greed for free tickets, should likewise be held guilty. Minnesota State Fair is not the only institu - tion that has given away its show. You would not hesitate in giving your opinion as to the sagacity, nay, the sanity of anyone in business who, for every article of mer - chandise he sold, would give away a similar article. Yet that is exactly what, as you will see from the enlightening figures I am about to quote, the majority of the fairs have been doing. A very prominent State fair, likewise represented here, reports an attendance of 230,000 at its 1932 exposition. The gate admission was 50 cents and the treasury should have rung up $115,000 in re - ceipts from the outside gates, but unfortunately the free list ran into tremendous figures. The revenue from ticket sales was only $42,000 leaving $73,000, representing the 146,000 — the favored many — who rode thru the portals of the fair upon the vehicle of a free ticket. Minnesota State Fair has mourned at a similar altar of mismanage - ment and wept for the last time. Here is another case. One of the outstanding fairs and exposi - tions of the Middle West in 1932 reported an attendance of 277,000 people. The balance sheet indicates that of these 185,000, 70 per cent of the total attendance, got into the fair grounds at the 'expense of the 9 2,000 public-spirited citizens who insisted upon paying their way in. Up at Minnesota we have taken all the degrees In combating and struggling with the pass situation and, having had the experience, can sympathize deeply as a fellow sufferer with the other State fairs that are continuing the practice of giving away their show. We all know there is some enchantment about a free ticket to anything. A man told me the other day that he had a pass to a prize fight for which he had no use, and an acquaintance hired a taxi at $1.50 to come for it at his home. A similar admission could have been purchased for $1 at the box office. Our superintendent of transportation has told me that with a couple of passes to the outside gates he can get service down in the railroad yards that he couldn't budge with a ten-dollar bill. At Minnesota — and I am sure the same holds true at other fairs — in cases where we issued tickets which would admit the bearer "and lady" or "and one" to the outside gates, we were confronted by the abuse of the privilege of bringing in an extra person. One man, whose position in the community should have made him ashamed to resort to any such petty chiseling, openly boasted to me how, by es- </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE corting into the grounds one person and then immediately going out and bringing in another, he made 26 persons non-paying guests of the fair in one day. A pass to the fair is the management's token of hospitality. We enjoy sending them to folks engaged in the same line of endeavor, to newspapermen who tell the story of the fair to the public, to officials whose line of duty touches in an influential manner the means of contact between the fair and its many agricultural and industrial projects. It was with certain misgivings and not without trepidation that the Minnesota State Fair management approached the problem of establishing a new ticket policy. Where was the ax to fall? Who and what groups were to be left on the free list and who were to be dropped? No snap judgment was used. Every member of the governing board had studied the problem for two months when, at the April meeting, resolutions were passed establishing and adopting the rule that everybody must pay the required admission at the outside gate. The board stated its case thru the press of the State and was gratified over the favorable reaction to the new setup. We stated our position to the exhibitors and with very few exceptions, were encouraged. We mentioned the new ticket rule conspicuously in many places in the premium list. Meanwhile there were breakers ahead. As the dates of the fair approached it wasn't so easy to steer a straight course. Our ticket committee found itself on the defensive most of the time. Individuals and committees representing themselves and about everybody else waited upon the board to inquire if the rule really meant what it said and if the board was sincere in its announcement of the with - drawal of passes. And surely their own individual case should and would be an exception. You will be interested in brief references to a few such cases, which I mention because I know you all have the same experiences and contacts. The implement dealers — good friends of the fair and of great value to the exhibiting departments — had the board on the carpet several times and protested the no-pass rule. I am sure that each of the 20-odd fraternal organizations with headquarters on the fair grounds wrote letters or had delegations wait upon the board in criticism of the "everybody pays" policy. We had a visit from representatives of an express company that was interesting. Their story centered around the special service their company gave to exhibitors and concessioners by making prompt </seg>
            <seg id="p027">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE deliveries of express and again by giving every attention to their requirements in shipping out at the close of the fair. Surely, there would be no charge for their trucks and men engaged in this work. In defense of the no-pass rule, our admissions committee argued that the fair made possible a profitable field for their business; that, according to all the rules of the game, they were concessioners and should be required to pay a fee for doing business on the grounds. All we now asked of them was to comply with the rule and pay ad - missions for their trucks and their employees, the same as everyone else. Rebuttal in this particular case continued at length until the express company offered a compromise whereby they would pay for the men, with the understanding that the trucks, three of them daily must be admitted free. Time is of considerable value to a busy fair official on the eve of the opening of his fair, and there comes a moment when patience ceases to be a virtue. This point was reached when President Bailey, in summing up the case, reasoned that the three truck admissions would cost 75 cents per day and for the eight days of the fair the total expense to the express company would reach the sum of $6. So he took from his pocket a $5. bill and a $1. bill and in his most cordial manner urged the express magnate to accept the $6 as a con - tribution not from the State Fair but from himself personally. He accompanied the offer with the statement that It would be worth that amount to be able to say to the next delegation demanding passes that no exceptions had been made. The express folks, realizing the absurdity of their stand in the matter, declined the money, said, "you win," and departed. The telephone company put up quite a battle. Forgetting that, with a $14 charge for each telephone installed for the fair period they gleaned more than $4,000 in business from the fair, the exhibitors and the consessioners, not to mention the revenue derived from the 40 pay stations on the grounds, they argued that they certainly were entitled to free tickets of admission. They lost. The State departments exhibit folks put up a prolonged argument. They were a part of the State. Their booths made the show, etc. The board was obliged to tell them that the fair had two things to sell — exhibition space and tickets. One of these commodities exhibition space — was given gratis to their organization. One of the best buildings on the grounds is taken out of the income-bearing columns and turned over to the department and institutions of the State with free upkeep, free lights, and free grounds service. The cost of the few tickets of admission for the necessary help in their respective booths would be a small amount in proportion to the total expense of their displays. Furthermore, the fair spent many thou- </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sands of dollars in bringing to the grounds nearly half a million people who constituted an audience to be shown the activities and the manufactured wares of the State institutions. No exception was made in dealing with the exhibitors in the State Departments building. The numerous exhibitors — both the competitive and the com - mercial — the' employees of the fair, the politicians, many State and city officials, show people and a great many more classes of customers all had their innings, each suspecting that down in the bottom drawer of the secretary's desk or in the inside pockets of the president or the managers could be found a handful of passes held in waiting ' for their own particular and peculiar case. Every official and every employee of the fair was obliged to pay his way into the grounds. At the time of our fair there was a general epidemic of salary and wage reduction. This did not reach our own institution. We paid the same wages for labor and, in nearly every case for department assistants. However, every employee, regardless of his position or the nature of his work, was obliged to pay his way into the grounds. The only exceptions were the personnel from the sheriff's office, uniformed city policemen, firemen on fire trucks and pure food in - spectors. These officials rendered, without cost to the fair, an indis - pensable service, and furthermore, the gates could not he closed against their official duties. , In the cases of the carnival company and the United States De - partment of Agriculture exhibit, our contracts for these antedated the birth of our new ticket policy and contained no provisions relative to the no-pass rule. The carnival management bought tickets for their in-and-out employees, and the man in charge of the government exhibit paid for himself and two helpers. Each was reimbursed after the fair .for this expense. No pass-out checks were issued. Mon entitled to remain on the grounds overnight — bona fide exhibitors, concessioners, employees — were given a button by the superintendent in charge of their respective duties, which button passed the roundup in the morning but was at no time good for admission thru any outside gate. The hundreds of complimentary cards to guests, our State association, legislators, newspapermen, State and city officials, were issued the same as usual but across the face of the cards was printed in heavy type, "Not Good at the Outside Gates." The press of the State Indorsed our "everybody pays" policy and applauded the action of the board. The Legislature was favorable, Governor Olson likewise. The county fair officials, appreciating more than anyone else the seriousness of the situation to be corrected, </seg>
            <seg id="p029">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gave the board their moral support, and many are the letters re - ceived from county fair men expressing keen interest in the venture and hoping for satisfactory results from the "everybody pays" pro - gram. And here is the result. It can be explained by giving the actual figures showing the revenue received and the general attendance in 1933 as compared with 1932. The total paid admissions thru the out - side gates at the 1932 fair were $74,000 and this year they were $93,000. When the policy of requiring everybody to pay at the outside gate was definitely decided, there was considerable conjecture as to the effect it would have upon the free list in the grandstand. Some of the board members felt that there would be a great increase in the number of grandstand passes issued and used. But that did not prove to be the case. On the contrary, there were almost 10,000 fewer free admissions to the grandstand in 1933 than in 1932. Not only was the financial outcome of the fair satisfactory, but the officers of the fair are happy over the favorable comments rela - tive to its excellence. It pleased the management to receive, follow - ing the fair, commendatory and approving letters and visitations from individuals and groups who earlier in the season had been caustic and critical in their attitude towards the "everybody pays" policy. Our friends, the express company and the telephone company, like - wise are now strong for the new deal. A fine letter came from the State departments exhibit folks. The concessioners without exception made money. They ' paid more for their concession spots and more for their employees' tickets of admission. Against this, however, the "everybody pays" brought them many more potential customers — and kept them inside the grounds once they had passed the gate — but these customers, satisfied that they had got a good bargain at the outside gate, were in a mood to spend much more freely after entering the grounds. Not for several years has there been evident among the visitors at Minnesota State Fair so carefree and lighthearted a spirit as at this year's exposition, and there was a noticeable loosening of purse strings in the matter of patronizing concessioners. Needless to say, all the concessioners want to come back next year. The term "everybody pays" covers a great deal of territory, it includes not only those who come thru the gate — visitors, exhibitors, concessioners, officials, employees. It embraces the very fair itself, which, considered as an individual among the "everybody" mentioned, likewise pays. The fair, by putting into effect the drastic no-pass policy, PAYS, without undue strain upon its resources or upon the ■ : '. ■ i : . </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE patience of its creditors, all its obligations for premiums, operating expenses, etc.; it also Pays in the sense of realizing a profit. And the institution is thus established as a very unusual and important "individual" in these days of delinquent accounts and undermined credits. A year ago Minnesota State Fair owed $52,000 in miscellaneous bills. Today it does not owe a dollar. It has PAID because of the splendid co-operation and support given its management by the people of Minnesota. The indorsement of its ticket policy by the public will enable the fair to continue to PAY for the best classes of exhibits it is possible to assemble; to PAY substantial sums as cash awards to the thousands of boys and girls in the rural schools of Minnesota and to continue its generous support of the praiseworthy activities of the 4-H clubs. It will be able to PAY for the encourage - ment of better methods in agriculture, better living, better citizenry." I have given you part of Mr. Lee's address. With the experience I have had in the fair business and especially the past year, I am thoroughly convinced that the policy of "Everybody Pays" is the best policy for a state fair.

            <seg id="p041">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PREMIUM REVISION COMMITTEE REPORT Lincoln, Nebraska, January 16, 1934. To the Honorable Nebraska^, State Board of Agriculture: Gentlemen: We, the Committee on the Revision of the 1934 Premium List, beg leave to submit the following report and recommend the following changes in the premium list: Change all dates to comply with the year 1934. (This report was read and at the conclusion of each recommenda - tion motion made, seconded and adopted to adopt said recommenda - tion. Following changes were thus presented: Page 17 — Rules and Regulations— Third Paragraph Change to read as follows: "The Nebraska State Fair Management assumes no liability for loss or damage to any property of the conces - sionaire, exhibitor, or patron, due ;to theft, fire, tornado, weather con - ditions, or other causes. Page 18— Auto Parking— Last Paragraph Add after the word "accrue" the words— "to the car or its con - tents." Page 20 — Next to Last Paragraph Change to read as follows: In all livestock departments all ex - hibitors must show registration papers or a certificate of ownership before animals are shown. Failure to do this will disqualify animals Should an individual enter an animal or article in a name other than that of the bona fide owner, or attempt to perpetrate a fraud by mis - representing any fact, the entry thus made shall not be allowed to compete for or receive any premium, and the owner barred from this show unless re-instated. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: I believe this relates to your depart - ment Mr. Johnson. What do you think about it? BY MR. R. C. JOHNSON of Mead: We have had some trouble in our department upon that point. I havn't looked into it. This may be a duplication for they are supposed to supply the registration. BY MR. VANCE: The rule on page 36 relating to Partners, might cover this. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I ' BY SECRETARY REED: I think this was suggested by Mr. J. J. Robinson. BY R. C. JOHNSON: Mr. Robinson is the assistant in my depart - ment. And he must have had some specific purpose in advancing this. BY CHAS. GRAFF: I think if we will consider the old rule 71 it will send some light on this. In fairness to the Breed's Association this ought to be required, because if this information and data is not furnished before the exhibit, some times they do not consider it worth - while to go ahead and do so. It may cost more to complete this registration than there is involved in the premium rewards. But it is unfair to both the Breed Association and the Fair to allow the matter to hang. (Motion then voted upon and adoption of rule carried.) Page 73 — Change the Hampshire premium offering and classifica - tion to correspond with that of Durocs and Polands. ■ ■-.'■ -j Page 84 — Change as follows: Strike out first paragraph regarding purchase of exhibitors ticket, and change to — "No exhibitors ticket required for this department." Strike out third paragraph and change as follows: "Twenty-five cents entry fee required for each bird entered except the lots for Game Bantams and Ornamental Bantams which shall be fifteen cents entry fee for each bird entered. This entry fee shall cover the coop rental. Add the following new rule: "Names of Exhibitors shall not appear on poultry coops until after judging is completed." Page 13(5 — Bees &amp; Honey — Strike out — (center of page) — "Open to Nebraska Entries." } Page 137 — Strike out — "Open to the World." Add new rule for Bee and Honey Department as follows: "Note — Entries limited to residents of Nebraska, and residents of other states which permit entries of similar foreign exhibits at their state fairs." . I ' General motion made for adoption of report as a whole. Carried. BY MR. E. P.

FRISBIE CALLED UPON. BY MR. FRISBIE: I would just like to comment on one matter that you passed upon this morning. It relates to Mr. Johnson's Dairy Department. The requiring of furnishing the registration own - ership is something that I have hoped this body would act upon for a. Jong time. The 4-H club boys and girls made a very fine record In their shows But they are interested in the proper preservation of these records and ownerships.

            <seg id="p044">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we can get an appropriation that will wipe out the deficit that now exists, so that the Debenture Bonds on the grandstand may be cared for and the slate wiped clean. If that is done maybe you can handle the other worries about premium payment, get the budgets balanced and these other problems met. Personally I would like to see every Fair man get behind this matter. Work so hard with the Legislature that he can put this across; wipe out the deficit, take care of the Debenture Bond of the grandstand and solve these problems. Per - sonally I will do all I can and I hope we may all furnish every co - operation along that line. BY C. G. MARSHALL: As Secretary of the County Fair Organiza - tion I would just like to mention two matters and that is for your co-operation. The question of the recapitulation sheet was brought out and Mr. Purcell offered to print these if we gather the information and furnish him the copy. If this is to be of any use it should be done promptly and I trust every one will get the information in to Mr. Reed's office as soon as possible. If Mr. Purcell will print this for us we should at least do the work oni it so as to get it out in good time.

            <seg id="p045">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE j ELECTION OF OFFICERS BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We will next proceed to the election of officers, for the coming year. What is your pleasure as to President? BY MR. CHAS. GRAFF: Mr. President, I don't want to repeat myself all of the time but there has been a good deal said around here about Washington County. The [great men it has produced and the great things it has done. I have tried to point out that for such things as that you have to come! to Cuming county, but Ido want to openly admit that there is one man in Washington county of whom we must take notice. A man who can go as far as he has and manage to remain free and clear and to have escaped the clutches of all marriageable women, must be recognized. So I want to come forth again and nominate for president this boy for the coming year, Mr. Bert Miller. Now I believe that before another year is over some attractive marriageable woman of his county will have ended this continual bachelorhood. BY MR. GOLDER: I move that the nominations be closed and the secretary be instructed to cast an unanimous ballot of this meeting for Mr. Miller for President. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion carried. BY SECRETARY REED: It affords me much pleasure to announce the vote of this convention for Mr. Miller for president the ensuing year. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: I thank you for this courtesy and if the Lord and his all-wise Providence will permit, I shall try to carry out your expectations and justify what Charles Graff has done here when he made this nomination. I thank you for the co-operation that I have had the past year and I know that if I receive the same the coming year we shall have success with the State Fair beyond what we have had before. The next order of business will be to receive nomination for First Vice President. BY MR. E. R. PURCELL: I want to assure Charlie Graff that Wash - ington and Cuming counties do not furnish all of the good men. My neighboring county of Adams in j the past year has furnished us with a good First Vice President for this body and I take pleasure again in offering to you Ralph Vance of Adams county. His work on this State Board has been outstanding. I don't believe we have ever had a First Vice President for the State Fair who has deevloped Into such an outstanding Pair man. Nomination seconded. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE - Motion made and seconded that the nomination be closed and the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this meeting for Mr. Vance for First Vice President. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion carried. Ballot cast by Secretary. BY MR. VANCE: I want to thank my friend Emerson Purcell for the kind words that he has said about me. I remember back in the legislature that I found Emerson to be one of the first democrats I met there with whom I could sit down and talk things over man to man. And I have always found him to be that square minded. I want to thank you gentlemen for this honor and assure you that I will try to render as good service as f can. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: Next will be nominations for Second Vice President. BY MR. FRANK SHUBERT: I come from a county that has made a good record for furnishing governors for our state. We have given you at least two governors. Morehead and Weaver. Now I want to turn to a county to two north of us where we find a man that we have all known for 22 or 23 years while he has given such good service, and turning to Cass county, I want to place a nomination for second Vice President, our next governor, W. B. Banning. Nomination seconded with a motion that nominations be closed and ballot taken. Voted and carried, and secretary in pursuance thereof cast unanimous ballot for Mr. Banning. BY MR. BANNING: I want to thank you for this honor. It is true I have served twenty-two years on this board. I think Mr. Purcell and Mr. Graff have been on here with me and are the only two who have served all that time. They are sure ready to fight for another 23 years in the interest of the Nebraska State Fair. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We will now receive nominations for Treasurer. BY MR. H. J. MCLAUGHLIN: Gentlemen of this organization, I am sure you will agree with me that no office within this organiza - tion is more important than that of Treasurer. There never has been a time in the history of the Nebraska State Fair when sound advice in financial matters was more needed and I am sure that there is no man in the State of Nebraska more qualified to meet these problems than Tom Wake, and I take pleasure in nominating Mr. Thomas A. Wake. Nomination seconded. Motion made and seconded to close nominations and for unanimous vote for Mr. Wake taken. Motion -carried and secretary so cast the unanimous vote. BY MR.

R. WIDLE, J. F. SHUBERT, J. A. BOYD, and GATES LILLEY. Motion made and Seconded that said appointments be confirmed. Vote taken. Carried. Motion made and seconded that the Grievance Committee be dis - charged. Vote taken. Motion carried. BY GEORGE JACKSON: Now that the battle royal is over I want to say that it has again been proven that organization is a great thing. I feel also in stepping out as a private citizen for the first time In many years, when I will have no connection with a Fair at all, that I can say this. I feel that as a citizen I will not only continue to do all I can for the state and the State Fair, but no individual in this state will do more than I will try to do for the advancement of Fairs in Nebraska. You will find me working to the fullest extent as I have always done. I want to say that there are no sore spots on me. I practiced all my life to avoid wasting any time getting even with people. It will make no difference to me who is in the harness </seg>

GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE: E. M. Baumann, Chairman....Cumming E. M. England Burt Wm. Steyer Douglas AUDITING COMMITTEE: Ervin Hutchison, Chairman.. ..Lancaster Peter Berner Knox Albert Benson Saunders CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE: E. J. Miille. Chairman Boone C. B. Mehrens .....Washington J. J. Meisenberg Butler PRESIDENTS ADDRESS At this time I believe it is the custom for the President to make his address or annual report. I do not want to offer any excuses but I want to say that I'm not prepared to make a speech, but I will give a short verbal report for the year. The year 1933 has been a very trying year for all of us and I don't believe that any of us are sorry to see it leave. We are deeply hopeful that 1934 will bring forth a good many things in the way of better conditions that we haven't seen in 1933. But one thing that I do want to express an appreciation for, is the support that we have received, for it has taken courageous leadership to bring forth as much progress as we have had in 1933. In 1934 we hope to put over a better program and make the balance sheet show a profit in - stead of a loss. I know we have been puzzled about many things that have confronted us and we hope to get the figures on these different fairs over into the black and not have to go any longer into the red. I'm sorry that I've not been able to attend many Fairs during the past year, but one thing that I think we should be very thankful for is that the past season we have been very fortunate in meeting attacks upon the Fairs. During the past session of the Legislature, last winter, there were many varieties of bills introduced to cut down the appropriations of the Fairs all over the State. If those bills had passed I'm sure it would have put out of business virtually all of the Fairs. There was a great deal of work done along that line last winter and we were in much better shape when the session was over and we had killed almost all those bills. The result was </seg>
            <seg id="p073">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS that enough appropriations were kept to assure a fairly good season. Last year there was a resolution passed here that this organiza - tion should not be represented at the National association meeting. Consequently we have no report to receive from that meeting. I did avail myself of the opportunity of attending the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, and I was rather surprised and disappointed to find that the State of Nebraska was not represented in the Hall of States, and in that Exhibition. Since it has been decided to con - tinue that great show for another year I would like to see some steps taken by our Governor and other proper authorities to see that our State is represented in such a show. Now in closing I want to remark that I feel that this organiza - tion of Fair people should do all that they can to help the State Fair and I understand that it needs some help. The County Fair Man - agers can do a great deal of work to help out the State Fair. If I'm informed correctly, at the present time, the managers of the State Fair are in financial difficulties. I think we should do what we can for the State Fair and in doing so we will encourage the work of the Boys' and Girls' Clubs. Now, I think we no doubt have a lot of concession people in the room and would like to have them meet with Delegates. The following concession people were then introduced: Ted Norris of the Ted Norris Dramatic Shows. Mr. Brammer of the J. L. Landes and Company Shows. Mr. A. B. Carr of the Clyde Miller Shows, Society Horses and Rodeos. ■ Chick Boyes Players, Hebron, Nebraska. P. C. Delman, Agent. MR. PFEIFFER: Our next subject is an address "Budgeting County Fair Expenses," prepared by Ted Robinson of Waterloo. Mr. Robinson is Secretary of the National Seed Association, and it is necessary for him to be absent today. But he has kindly prepared the matter on this subject and I am going to ask that it be read to the meeting by MR. E. P. NOYES of Douglas County. BUDGETING COUNTY FAIR EXPENSES E. T.

            <seg id="p074">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE far reaching benefit to the rural sections — if this be true and no one present presumes to doubt it— then it is of equal importance that we study ways and means to insure the fullest possible success in educa - tional value, interest to the community and financial independence. It is my intention to discuss only the latter phase of County Fair operation. ...■-...'■ No student of this subject will attempt to question the funda - mental statement that to be fully independent in all departments, there must be a balanced budget. In fact it is difficult to conceive of a fair operating year after year without the ability to meet its ordinary obligations. Budgeting should mean more than the mere allocating of so many dollars to each of the many activities which go to make up the av - erage Fair, consequently, a careful study is recommended to deter - mine the proper proportion that each subdivision should receive, for it is obvious that a Fair must be well balanced in its appeal to the community it serves. Experience will have shown the most popular activities which would be deserving of continued support and the same close analysis will disclose those departments that need further encouragement through more liberal appropriations of money. There are a few items in the budget of all fairs that might be termed fixed charges, such as insurance, interest, etc. These must be listed first at a figure that can be predetermined upon the basis of previous years' experience. Next in line for setting up would natural - ly fall the partially fixable items such as advertising, labor, judges, etc., following which it is recommended to set up an item for debt retirement or cash reserve as the case might be, and finally we would come to the more easily controlled expenses such as premiums and entertainment. The sum total of these items should be somewhat less than the average income for the previous few years which can be easily ascer - tained from an examination of the records. The following is suggested as being fairly representative of the division of estimated income into a budget for the average fair, the items being listed in the order of their flexibility: ' . .-''■' - 1. Interest — 5% 2. Insurance — 2 % 3. Directors, officers — 5% 4. Office supplies, postage, repairs — 3% 5. Tent, lumber rental, wiring — -3% 6.' Debt Retirement or Reserve — 13% 7. Labor, office and grounds — 4% 8. Electric lights — 3% </seg>

Premiums — 30% 15. Free acts including music 10% 16. Baseball — 10% It will be noted that the two items under the heading of Premiums and Entertainment constitute one-half of the total income. The un - informed critic might attempt to argue that inasmuch as these two classes in combination provide the only excuse for popularity of County Fairs, that the appropriation should be a greater percentage of in - come, but all well informed fair managers recognize the necessity of seemingly high allowances for the various items that contribute to the making of a popular fair. As an example it would be folly to restrict expense money for adequate insurance against fire, wind and public liability; equally so would it be foolish to fail to provide for proper housing of exhibits in tents where permanent buildings are not available. Poor lighting of midway and exhibit building cannot be expected to draw a large evening attendance so that it becomes poor economy to attempt to reduce this item below reasonable limits. The suggested four per cent of Income for judges and superintend - ents might be considered too high by some, yet experience has shown that the best judges are the cheapest in the long run. County fairs are largely educational in their operation consequently a splendid opportunity is thus offered to secure judges and superintendents who by their constructive criticism will aid in developing not only better quality of exhibits but the art of showmanship which is no small part of the attractiveness of any fair. Adverse criticism of the awards can be largely averted by the selection of imported judges of high standing. The item of entertainment is one of the most important in the entire list, for a fair can either succeed or fail as the entertainment Pleases or displeases. Under this general class is placed such divisions as free acts, music, public address system. Boy Scouts, games and sports excepting baseball which is listed as a separate class. It is recommended that considerable flexibility be permitted this item of expense as it is oftentimes impossible to plan a full program of suit - able acts in addition to contracting for music. Boy Scouts, or a public address system ut any prearranged figure. It ls highly desirable to so arrange the program that there is sufficient variation from day to </seg>
            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE day to attract the same people to the grounds for succeeeding days. The necessity for a daily change of program cannot be overestimated as an Inducement for pre-fair sale of season tickets as well as continued day by day interest In the amusements. Baseball has proven to be one of the most popular of all attrac - tions. There are two general plans for these tournaments, namely, local baseball league and Imported teams. Much can be said in favor of either plan, obviously a larger allowance must be made if found desirable to attract teams from a distance, in such cases it is doubtful if a tournament calling for large prizes can be made financially suc - cessful the first few years. On the other hand local county teams formed into a summer league playing a tournament during fair week will be found a splendid drawing card. The advisability of setting aside a more or less definite sum for debt retirement or cash reserve for lean years cannot be questioned. Altogether too many fair associations are laboring under a heavy burden of debt, this situation is more the result of over expansion and too much optimism during the golden years preceding 1929, than to mismanagement on the part of the directors. The money allotted to premiums should constitute the largest single item of the budget. There can be no question but what the main purpose of the County Fair is educational. Exhibitors are given an opportunity to compete the, results of their season's labor with that of their neighbors and to learn through this comparison better methods of selection, breeding or handicraft. While it is true that high prem - iums for prize winners has a tendency to enlarge the show yet much can be done to increase interest in exhibiting by intelligent emphasis through newspapers on the prize winners. This very naturally makes the mere possession of a blue ribbon more desirable than the cash premium which accompanies it. As competition increases in the various classes the ribbons become relatively of greater value. Time will not permit the consideration of the remaining minor divisions of this suggested budget. Suffice it to say that it has been my thought to provide for a well balanced fair giving to each main activity a sum of money sufficient to insure a well-managed and a properly balanced fair that can be maintained year after year to the greater service and entertainment of the community. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: I know that if anyone has any ques - tions upon this subject, Mr. Noyes will be glad to answer them. MR, C. Y. THOMPSON, of West Point: I think a point it might be wise to make Is whether a reserve should be carried forward dur - ing prosperous times by a County Fair. There were times when every- </seg>
            <seg id="p077">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS thing was going along smoothly, and we didn't do that. Now, we have all of our Fairs handicapped by a shortage of funds. Ot course this raises the question as to whether if we went to some of our County Boards and made a report that showed we had funds on hand they wouldn't say, well if you have more money on hand than you need and is necessary for your County Fair we won't give you so much next year. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: In Douglas County we' have a debt to pay off so it took whatever we had above bare expenses to take care of that and we've never been able to go on a budget basis, for the County Fair. Our next subject is County Fair Publicity, and that subject had been assigned to Mr. E. T. Winter, of Walthill. Mr. Winter is not able to be here today, and we are going to ask Mr. Howard Rhea to present the matter which he has prepared on this subject. ■' ' ■'-■■'■■; COUNTY FAtR PUBLICITY Mr. Chairman: Mr. Winter had intended to be here to handle this subject and had gone to considerable trouble in preparation. He wrote to county fair managers in all parts of the state asking them to give a brief outline of the best publicity stunt their fair had ever tried. He received about twenty replies from which he expected to select worthwhile suggestions in arranging the material for his dis - cussion of the subject, but before he had this arranged, and on very short notice he was sent to the western part of the state on federal work. He then wrote the secretary as follows: "I have been very suddenly sent to |the west end of the state and will probably work here for several months. It will be impossible for me to get to Lincoln for the 15th, but I have gathered from different parts of the state some splendid suggestions for publicity. This ma - terial is enclosed and I believe that you or someone you designate could work up a good talk from this material quite easily. I'm sorry that I can't be there and I'm sorry that I could not let you know before. As a matter of fact I didn't know of the transfer myself until Monday afternoon. Hastily, E. T. WINTER." As the secretary did not have time to work this over into better form for presentation and could get no one else to do it in the limited time it was thought best to read some of the replies Mr. Winter re - ceived which will undoubtedly bring out some very good suggestions on this subject. I will now read from these reports: </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF NEBRASKA, STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE From Buffalo County We have put on nothing special in advertising only making booster trips to the neighboring towns. This year we took the boys band from here with us, while last year the carnival company furnished us with their band. Then we usually run a page ad in the special editions of our local papers. From Stanton County The best publicity stunt that we have had. perhaps it might better be called good feeling or goodfellowship publicity, in my estimation was when we had a "Paint-up and Fix-up Day." We had leaders or good fair boosters in each precinct or community get busy and talk up the free-work day to his neighbors and friends and then through the county papers gave it plenty of publicity. We had over a hun - dred men on the job, painting up fences, buildings, clearing, and doing a general revamping of the grounds. Lunch was served at noon. Rather than the day of work it was more a picnic, business men and farmers worked side by side. It created real interest in the fair. County League Baseball games have all brot the fair good pub - licity in the county as has rural county choir and other county exhibi - tions in front of the grandstand. From Kimball County. i Probably our best publicity was a county chorus which was sup - posed to comprise something like 300 voices. This, of course, was supposed to and did bring in the majority of the parents of the mem - bers of the chorus, but the attraction itself fell fiat due to weather conditions, heavy wind the first day and poor hook up with the loud speakers. Our early closing date harness races I believe have brought more people to the fair than anything we have had. For three or four weeks we would make as a matter of news for our paper the names of the horses that had entered and give a brief history of them, the names of the sires, the record of the horses entered, and if they had ever raced in the big money state a little something about that, and if the sires of horses that were to race here had sired others that had made exceptionally fast records we would give the names of these horses and mention the fact that they were by the same sires of horses that were entered at our races. If the owners of the horses had a pretty large stable we would mention that fact and if they had ever owned horses that became prominent in the racing world we would say something about it. People got it into their head that we were having horses out of the ordinary and they came to see the races. However, our experience has been that it costs too much to put on </seg>
            <seg id="p079">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS good harness races in this part of the state, our population being so small compared with counties farther east that we can't get the at - tendance to pay out. I believe by forming a good shortship harness racing circuit, especially in the east third of the state, properly ad - vertise it in your papers, and you will find the home papers will print as a matter of news matters as referred to above, that it will go over big. From Suunders County In reply to your letter, wish to state that we believe that one of the best ways to advertise the County Fair is to issue to each child of school age, a free ticket to be delivered to each child by his teacher through the County Superintendent's office, that is, where the Fair begins after September Ist. Our other publicity stunt is the Fair Queen sponsored by a local newspaper about a month or six weeks prior to the opening of the Fair by printing a coupon which may be cut out, signed and sent back to the local newspaper for a definite number of votes for a certain lady between the age ot 18 and 24 as a nominee for Fair Queen. The County is divided into certain districts, each district being entitled to a number of nominees. The entire county may ballot for any ot the nominees. The one receiving the highest number of votes is the dis - trict nominee. We generally have five or six candidates from the entire county, each nominee representing a district in which she re - sides. These five or six nominees are then voted upon during the days of the Fair by the general public paying admission either at the main gate or at the grandstand. The election is handled the same way as a general election, having printed ballots, judges and clerks and a canvassing board. The one receiving the highest number of votes at the election is then crowned Queen on a certain day, with proper ceremony, all the candidates being on the stage at the time The runners-up also receiving prizes from the Fair Board, local papers and merchants in the way of cash, presents and merchandise. We believe that this is a very good stunt providing you can get sufficient number of candidates interested. We have followed this for the last three years and will again put it on. The local paper doing all the work by putting on a subscription campaign and granting addi - tional votes for each new or renewed paid up subscription. From Sherman County. The outstanding stunt at our fair this year was about six 3-round boxing matches and they proved extremely hot and we had the largest evening crowds this year we have had for ten years. We had sev - eral such matches a week preceding the fair in Loup City as an ad - vertising stunt and the fighters or boxers were worked up to a high </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pitch. We had worked up rivals from every town iri the county and everybody felt their community at stake. From Thnyer County. Our best publicity stunt was a musical revue comprising groups of young ladies from ten neighboring towns, under the direction of a director who drilled them at home for two weeks prior to the fair, with a big drill on the grounds the Sunday before the fair started! This big revue was put on as the principal part of the show each even - ing of the fair. Over 200 young ladies took part in the production. From Butler County. I will say I think the best advertising stunt we ever tried was our Cardinal (Red) Shirt Club that we tried last fall, but it rather fell through at Fair time, as it rained all week. Even though we held over Saturday and had Fair on Sunday, it was a bad year. We didn't charge anything to join but got everyone to join and gave them a but - ton to wear. Every day as they only were supposed to wear the Red Shirt on Wednesday and Saturday. From Cuming County. I do not believe we have ever used anything for advertising the fair which you could call a stunt except one year when we gave away a Ford car through the merchants of the county, but as lotteries are tabooed that would not do to even talk about now. This year we did a lot o'f broadcasting for the Fair and I am sure it was the cause of our large attendance. As you know the Secretary of the Cuming County Fair is in the merchantile business and since the 31st of last May there has been a studio in West Point located in Baumann's store broadcasting each week day morning from 10:30 to 11:00 by remote control over WJAG Norfolk. For exactly a month before the Fair opened the writer who is also the chief announcer from this studio gave a message about the fair each morning. And on Sunday before the fair opened gave a program over the air for 1 1-2 hours. We had the Bancroft band here - with a chorus, some talent from the Hazel McOwen Co., and also a good Piano player. With the opening of the program I gave a "Fair" (not fair but good) spiel and then after each musical number I talked "Cuming County Fair". I do not know if anybody else thinks it helped but we had a good attendance— the big crowds were pleased and I have convinced myself that the broadcasting did the work. I have always contended that each Cuming County Fair is the best advertisement for the next Cuming County Fair and we tell the world that "Better Cuming County Fairs are coming." </seg>
            <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS From Webster County. In answer to your letter of November 25 will say that perhaps one of the best advertising schemes ls our home talent play contest. We have put this on in the form of a contest, offering a set premium for each community or night play given and then offer a first, second and third prize. However, our rodeo has been very good advertising as well. * From Nance County. In this county we have used almost everything from a booster tour to loud speakers, but believe our best stunt was this year, simply doing all our ad in three county papers, with plenty of news stories which were published free by these same papers. Our advertising for 1933 was $30.00, and we seemed to have our usual crowd. From Dodge County. Our fair has not used any straight, what you might call publicity stunts. However, I believe the greatest publicity getter we have had which was not put on as such, was our home talent entertainment. From Dixon County. In reply to your letter of today Its a hard one to answer, I think we have tried everything these last years and I don't know what to say, I believe the best publicity stunt we have tried is this one, we had a county baseball tournament of county teams only. We charged them $20.00 to enter and issued them 20 tickets, season tickets to sell and keep the money for the club. This went over good and ad - vertised our fair all over. The latest and best stunt I have tried. From Douglas County. To build up a Saturday crowd our last day we held a public wedding a few years ago and drew a big crowd. The last few years we have run a Queen contest and held a coronation the last day of the Fair. This has been a good and profitable drawing card for us. From Custer County. I do not think that our Rodeo-Fair has ever used anything which would really be classed as a "Publicity Stunt". We do lots of ad - vertising in a great many ways. The thing which we figure brings the greatest return for the cost is the Bumper Signs for cars. We have these printed locally and just as inexpensive as possible and then try to get them on every car that we possibly can. We try to arrange our program in such a way or manner as to attract ail kinds of people. As you no doubt will recall we were the first to put on a bull fight. That was a year ago. We gave this lots of publicity and </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE were given lots of publicity all over the country as the humane soci - eties and officials endeavored to stop it. This year we put on a horse show and played it up in all our advertising. We used the Clay Center and Norfolk Radio Stations some this year. It was impossible to tell just what the results from this were, but it was advertising. We use some small reader advertisements in a larger number of papers and give all county papers considerable space with display advertis - ing. We used some stickers for autos this year in the shape of a Cow - boy Boot which we figured were good as after one had been read they knew from the shape what it was. From Holt Count y Our best publicity stunt is a children's parade. We use about twenty-five dollars in Ist, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, sth, 6th, 7th, Bth, 9th and 10th prizes. The first prize is usually $2. We limit the age to twelve years and under. Ask the kids to bring their pets, dolls, dogs, cats and anything they have. After giving the prizes for the clowns and the best boy and girl, best song, speech, we give a cigar box full of dimes, and every kid gets a dime. We advertise in the local papers. Any kid, anywhere is elligible. From Furnns County. This year we asked the business men of Beaver City to stage a free barbecue feed to the County Fair Patrons as an expression of their appreciation of having other towns and residents of the county attending the county fair at Beaver City. We had the greatest crowd of people on the grounds that we have ever had at any one time. It cost the community club less than $100.00 and was worth several times that amount to the business men of Beaver City for the good will that resulted toward the town. The barbecue was prepared several days in advance and placed in borrowed roasters and pans. On the day it was to be served it was taken to the bakery (early in the morn - ing after the bread was baked) and roasted. Served piping hot at noon along with hot gravy and several slices of bread. A real stunt. Sure brings them in. Everything free. Coffee, too. From Knox County. Our best publicity stunt has been a circular describing the fair activities, giving a brief resume of the premiums offered and listing the amusements. These are mailed to every box holder In the towns and rural routes of Knox and adjoining counties. The cost is not excessive as the editors mail them under their permits and it brings the advertising to almost every home that is interested. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS From Richardson County. Outside of a brief announcement of the dates of the fair we don't do any advertising. The fact that our fair is an absolutely free fair in every way is the best advertisement we have. From Dawes County. Our best advertising stunt was one worked up here by the Chadron Chronicle about four years ago. They sold a tabloid size newspapers, about the size of the Nebraska Farmer and filled sixteen pages with advertising by local merchants and separate news stories on each de - department of the fair and program. I say that was the best because it produced the biggest crowds we ever had here at a fair. That year we took in over $2200 at the grandstand, our outside gate being free, at 50 and 25 cents. This paper went out under the third class ruling permit, addressed to box holders on every rural route within sixty miles of Chadron and was distributed house to house in town, in the major cities in western Nebraska. I believe that 7500 copies were printed and distributed. The plan is much the same as the press bulletin for the Nebraska State Fair, with advertisements of local merchants for either fair week merchandise specials or ads inviting the people to come to Chadron to the fair. While the advertising was the most thorough, we had the pro - grams to go with it. Such features as the soldiers from Fort Robin - son, a rodeo, running races, dog races, as well as free acts, including a "slide for life from off an automobile", two dancing horses, a trick mule and other features I just don't recall now. There is no question but what the plan of putting plenty of in - formation concerning the fair and program in the hands of every resi - dent in a territory will make them want to see the fair. This stunt can be put over anywhere in conjunction with a live newspaper. The 1 cent each, third class mailing permit under this plan allows addressing to rural route box holders and box holders in towns and cities where there are no city delivery, thus getting dis - tribution easily. The name of the box holder need not be placed on the folder. Only the route name and consecutive numbers on the folder is all that is necessary. For instance: Box Holder 1, Route one- Box Holder 2, Route one: etc. I will find a copy of this folder and send it to you. It may be of value to show to the meeting." </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: We are deeply indebted to Mr. Winter for this work and great care with which he gathered this material. There is a great deal of it and and it can be of great value if our people would study it over. If there is no discussion we will pass on to the next subject. Con - cession Charges and the Best Way to Collect Them, discussion to be lead by R. C. Johnson of Mead, Nebraska. ___ ' ' CONCESSION CHARGES AND BEST WAY TO COLLECT THEM Discussion led by Mr. R. C. JOHNSON, Mead, Nebr. Mr. President, Fair Managers of Nebraska: I don't just like the way this subject is stated. I would like to change the wording of that subject to a Good Way to collect, rather than the Tpest way. I think it was an oversight on the part of the Secretary when he hud these programs printed. You know concessions are an important thing, to any fair. I sometimes think they are like our wives, hard to get along with and hard to get along without, but we have to have them anyway. I don't know whether in discussion of this subject I should relate some of my own experiences, in dealing with concession people or I should just give you men some advice that I think would be helpful. In the past few years it has been my pleasure to deal with these concession people. I have met some of the finest people and made some of the best friends I have ever had among concession people and have met some of the worst people to deal with among the concession people. The first part of the subject is in regard to charges. I imagine all fairs have a certain charge that they make for foot of frontage. That charge has varied considerably the last two or three years. I know we have had to change our prices, and I imagine you have had to change yours. I have always been an advocate of collecting the charge we have ' agreed upon and I have always tried to enforce it, and we do collect 100%. It might sound to a lot ot you men who have dealt with con - cession people that that is rather a broad statement, but we do col - lect. However, at many times we have refunded, but we show them that we do collect. Maybe we collect and then the next day or so come back and refund 25%, but we have showed them that we do collect. We have more than one charge for our frontage. We have a carnival midway and an independent midway. We always reserve about 200 feet on our carnival midway that we have a privilege to i </seg>
            <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS sell and up until the last year we got $2.50 per foot and the last year we have cut it down to $2.00 per foot. Some might say, you don't have anything to say about the carnival midway, but we do, it is understood when we make our agreements. We have found this, that the professional concessioner wants to be spotted on the carnival midway, and that many times the amateur concessioner doesn't know where he wants to be until the fair is over and then he tells us where he would like to have been. On our independent midway the last two years we have charged $1.50 per foot. You might be surprised when I tell you many of the concessioners who have bought footage on the independent midway have come and told us that they made good money. As a rule the ones on the independent midway are folks who do not follow the concession business up, from fair to fair. They might be some local church or some local man in the city. We also have a minimum charge of $10.00. We let no one in unless he pays the $10.00 minimum. A pop corn machine, it it is only one of these small Peerless, they pay $10.00 for the three or four feet they occupy. Now, you might ask do you charge $10.00 for a man running around selling monkeys on a stick or balloons. No, we don't like to take their money at all because they are running around selling something that a novelty concessioner might have. My advise would be to put them in a spot and keep them there, or else don't take their money. We have been demanding half down when we spot them, and we always, since we have adopted that rule, we have taken half down when we spotted them. We take half when we spot them and then don't bother for a couple of days and then we collect the other 50%. I don't mean that we collect 25% the second time, we collect the other 50%. We have all had experience in the past few years run - ning around collecting a dollar now and a dollar later. What do we say when they say we don't have the money? I have only run across one man in the last five or six years who didn't have the money. I have had men turn their pockets inside out and show me and when I told them what I was going to do in 15 minutes, come back and close them up, they would ask me to change a twenty-dollar bill. They always have friends where they can borrow. I always look at it from this standpoint. Our fair is one of the last fairs in this state. If these men come and can not pay 50% down when we spot them, at the end of the fair season in Nebraska, how do you expect to collect 100% at the end of the fair? It is easier not to spot them than it is to close him up if he will not pay. I believe in not letting in too many concessioners of the same kind-. I heard of one instance where there were 12 pop corn machines at one county fair. Do you think at the average county fair you are </seg>
            <seg id="p086">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE justified in taking in 12 poppers. You realize that these, men must make a living. I believe in limiting certain concessions tb so many. I always tell them when I spot them that whenever they cut prices, whenever they sell 2 bags of corn for a nickel or two hamburgers for the price of one that they will be closed up. That isn't fair to a con - cessioner, and another thing I don't believe in allowing the conces - sion men to get together and organize and charge 10^ for pop. It kills your fair, it doesn't maybe kill your fair but it causes people to talk against your fair and if they talk against the fair it eventually hurts your fair. Now you might say, what do we do when we collect 50% when we spot them and it rains or .. they run and hide and put their wife in there and never show up. We have experienced that but have never had much trouble with that. When I spotted the concession they agreed to pay the price I asked. It is a verbal contract and my word is good and theirs should be good. Many times we have collected 100% and they never knew that they were going to get a refund. And another thinjj, many fairs let them slip by with 50%, 60% or 75%. They come to the fair or - ganized. They might pay 50%. You can break that up easily. Just close up one or two joints and watch the others come across. This year I started at 11 o'clock to collect the last 50% and was through at 1 o'clock. It was easy to collect because the crowd was coming in there. lam in favor of one man having charge of the concessions. I don't mean one man running it all. One man should spot them and what he says goes. He should have one man along to receipt and take the money, do nothing but receipt and take the money. I find this, if the Secretary has charge of the concessions and someone else spots and someone else collects it opens the way for a lot of trouble. They will say Mr. so-and-so told me that. Whether the Secretary or the other party said that or not I find half of them tell you that just to get out of paying. I like to treat these people fair because they are human and most of them are respectable folks, and you have to treat them as such and want them to come back next year. If you are going to "rim" them they will go out and knock your fair. If you can keep the good will of your concession people it will help your fair a lot. We have almost come to this conclusion at our fair, that we are going to collect 100% when we start and be through. We believe that we will get the best class of concessions if we do that. We do not believe that there will be many that will turn us down. Now, if they have played the fair season, and we happen to be the next to the last fair in Nebraska, if they can not pay $10.00 after playing the whole season, well you run a slim chance of collecting the other 50%. I thank you. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS CONCESSION CHARGES DISCUSSION :.', . R. R. VANCE, Adams County I have handled concessions in Adams County for twelve or thirteen years. My idea doesn't, quite agree with those advanced by Mr. John - son. Several years ago a couple of young fellows dropped in at Hast - ings and I didn't have a spot for them. Everything was full to the last piece of ground. They told me that they didn't have any money but they did have a good clean little lunch place and they would like about a fourteen foot space. 1 had one spot over by the red cross building where we had never sold any space. I took them over and showed them that. I pointed out to them that the people couldn't get in and out of the red cross building without going by their place and if they had a nice clean lunch room they would catch the trade. They set up here and they did just fine because in a few days when I went by they motioned to me and said, "Come in and have a cup of coffee". One said to the other, "Hadn't you better get that bag out" and they gave me around $80. Now when some body comes in like that who hasn't anything at all and you have some space that wouldn't other - wise be used I contend you are taking no chance at all. For we had nothing to lose even if we hadn't gained anything at all. Couple years later those boys dropped back in and they put up the same story that again they were broke; this time I had plenty of room and again I let them a sixty-five dollar place and again when the time came they called me over and ask me to drink some coffee and paid me the sixty - five dollars for the space. Another thing I don't agree with is having two midways. I don't think you should give the carnival companies one space and then give a bunch of independent attractions another line. But we place these at a stated price and we tell them what they have to do and if they don't do it that way, we change them. R. C. JOHNSON, Saunders County: I think one thing that should always be avoided is having more than one rate or scale of rates among the concessions. You let any body in on the midway without paying down or without paying a stated rate and it will not be very long until it is noised all over the ground that they got in without paying and you are going to have a lot of trouble.

We have been getting the money. We know that we have been having good shows. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: I understand the mayor is here now and we will hear his address of welcome. MAYOR FENTON B. FLEMING: Gentlemen. When this engage - ment was made for two o'clock today it was overlooked that it was upon a Monday. I am busy every Monday with the regular council session. That has had to take precedence. Now you know that it isn't necessary for the city of Lincoln to really send anyone here to welcome you. | We are always glad to have a convention such as this one select our city as its meeting place. This year Lincoln is going to try to help the State Fair put over a program. We are going to try to help them get out of their difficul - ties. They seem to be in some financial difficulty. Our citizens know that w^e cannot afford to let the State Fair suffer. The appropriations In the past, if they have not been enough, we will have to make up the shortage. On the other hand we have several million dollars worth of work going on through the C. W. A. We have got to go ahead and carry on this work and perhaps worry later about the money being paid back. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Now we know the State Fair has appreciated the patronage which it has had in the past and that they have appreciated the support that they have had from the County Fair people. But they realize that no organization can do more for them than you people can do. The County Fairs must be supported in order for the State Fair to be a success. So the City of Lincoln is indeed pleased to have all of you Fair people meet with them. I thank you. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: We thank the Mayor for his splendid address. And we will have a few remarks in response by Mr. R. C. Johnson, our vice-president. Mr. President. Hon. Mayor Fleming and Fair Managers: It is indeed a pleasure for me this afternoon, in behalf of all the Fair Managers of Nebraska, to respond to the hearty welcome extended by the Mayor of this great city. When we hear the name Lincoln we first think of that great states - man and President Abraham Lincoln. Second, we think of our State University, which has been of such great benefit to the citizens of Ne - braska. ' And again when we hear that name Lincoln we think of the greatest Capitol building in the world; and furthermore, when we hear the name Lincoln we are reminded of one of the greatest state fairs in the nation. Now I know that there is no other place in Nebraska, where we fair managers would sooner meet in their annual convention than in Lincoln. Fairs as we know are agriculture institutions, and when agriculture prospers, fairs will prosper. So when 'fairs prosper this great city will prosper. In behalf of the Fair Managers of Nebraska, I thank Mayor Flem - ing for his welcome extended to us while here in his city.

Moved, seconded, voted and carried that the foregoing report be accepted and placed on file. Home Talent Entertainment. EMERSON R. PURCELL, Broken Bow The subject assigned to me tonight is that of Home Talent Enter - tainment. I doubt if lam really well equipped to handle the subject. At our county fair for quite awhile I have helped put on quite a few programs even though some of them did not satisfy but I might re - view with you a few of the things that we have put on at our fair. One of the chief aims in seeking the use of home talent enter - tainment is to reduce the expenses and at the same time maintain in - terest in the program without using the high price acts. It is true you can cut out some expense and you can materially increase the local interest. Usually when the fair is over the officials get to - gether and try to figure out how much money they may have saved. There are a good many places you can cut these corners. For instance. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE when it is- over you find that the race program has been heavier than you figured. The acts have been a little stronger in price than had been figured and consequently perhaps you had a deficit. So plans are started to reduce even more the next year. I might say that the grandstand is quite a serious problem at most all fairs. I think the reports this year may be a little better than for the preceeding year. I know many of the Boards have suffered disappointment but they can only plan for the receipts next year to be better. I know in a lot of the counties they can't do anything about the race program so we will have to consider some other phases that are more commonly applicable. Now we do know that people tire of the same program in the afternoon and evening. Even if you have numbers under contract to perform for three or four days it is nec - essary to arrange them so they may be presented for the sake of variety. I might mention one act that we had at our fair that proved to be the best thriller. A couple years ago we planned a bull fight and If anything ever stirred up wide spread interest that number did While the mayor at Broken Bow received dozens of letters and the Governor received hundreds of letters against this inhuman spectacle. people came not only from near by but far off states to see this thrill that they figured could not otherwise be seen outside of the city of Mexico. Of course we took advantage of this sudden spurt of interest and we broad cast our advertising in some forty newspapers in and near our territory. But this of course, is unusual in handling home talent acts. . 0t " C ° urse we tr * to maI *e a diversified program so that the local act will be acceptable to our people. I will try to sketch over a few Phases that have been found to be of keen local interest. There is the old used car race. Where men put in cars that have been appraised to be worth not over fifteen or twenty dollars and maybe ten dollars and this assures that nothing but old rattle traps will be used in such a race that it doesn't matter much what hap - pens to any of the cars entered. Another drawing card is the Ford relay race. It attracts more interest than sometimes a horse race A parade is a wonderful feature on a county fair program. We have put on parades that were quite outstanding. You can put in a little touch of rodeo and you gather what I mean by a little touch. „7" tW , e * mlnutea of tha * type. You can get some pretty good Present*, ,f ,° r * Panide - * haVe Seen SOme S **«™ P*°^ presentations, displays of old vehicles of all kinds and you can get some pretty good horses thrown in the parade. This little touch ot </seg>
            <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS rodeo is a feature that you can depend upon pretty well. You can get some good broncho riding; some good calf riding; and some pretty good touches of western. The tug of war with a number of teams on each side is something that will attract interest from the various communities that may be involved. I have been trying to give you a number of examples of features that will make attractive entertainment for programs where you do not draw upon professional entertainment. I think one of the most attractive things that can be drawn upon is the staging of pageants. I know we have had some competitive pageants that have been of great value to the night show, for in - stance we would have one community put on a pageant Wednesday night, another would take Thursday night, another would stage their show on Friday night. There would be a keen competition to see which community could furnish the most people interested in this local venture. Considerable interest could be aroused by old fid - dlers exhibition. One of the best drawing cards we have had was a wedding. $50.00 might be offered for the couple married publically on the platform. And in one instance six couples made application, and wanted to be married. One couple was chosen. It was not generally known in advance who was to be married. They were the recipients of many presents. Another feature of interest was the boys and dog race. Once I had a little private advertising announcement made of my own. About two hundred dogs showed up. There were about a thousand people out in the streets and we had some difficulty in getting the event properly staged. ' ' Competitive bands from the various communities and the towns have been quite an attraction. Perhaps three or four towns will each furnish a band and they can see which entertainment will bring the biggest crowd of people. Old time fiddlers, local orchestras, groups of players, dancers and accordion players all make up an array of local talent that can be available at moderate costs. Local boxers and wrestlers are good attractions and we could go on indefinitely listing the many classes of local features that are well worth placing. Now before I close I want to emphasize one feature. That in the use of home talent the use of advanced publicity should be given. It is very important to get the people educated to a knowledge of what you are going to present after you have arranged the program. It is not availed to have a good rodeo program. and not have the people know of it in advance. I can sight one instance where we put out </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thirty thousand of what we thought was a very high class folder. With all these pictures of the rodeo type It created wide spread interest. Along that line another stimulant for interest that we have found valuable is a small attachment that we put on the auto bumper. I have seen these that cost 25 or 50 cents. We put out a bumper sign that only costs about a cent a piece. And we didn't put out just five hundred of them but we put out ten thousand for the last two years. Now with a feature like that you can cover an extensive territory and get the benefit of some very intensive advertising. I think more stress should be put on getting the details of the program properly advertised. The people should know what you are going to offer and then they will be interested. MR. KUHL, of Knox County: What kind of a lighting system do you use? MR. PURCELL: I might say that now you have a good flood lighting system available in almost any locality at reasonable and proper costs. At least you can get an infield lighted up so that you can put its touch of rodeo at the night show without any undue expense. MR. VANCE: I just want to ask what you think is the best that you have ever had? MR. PURCELL: I think our battle royal in 1929 was one of the best we have had. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: Now as we close the discussion upon this subject I want to remind you that while on the printed program it speaks of the banquet tickets being 85? that we have secured a price of 75^ for these. The next number on the program this evening will be a dis - cussion on "How to Make Every Day a Big Day." This topic has been assigned to Mr. E. M. Baumann of West Point. HOW TO MAKE EVERY DAY A BIG DAY E. M. BAUMANN That's some problem — and I do not expect to be able to tell you how it can be done. I'll admit however that we have been striving to do that In Cuming County and feel that we have succeeded quite well although we do not know whether we shall be able to continue to do so in the future. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS I shall therefore simply give you an outline of how we have been operating the Cuming County Fair and hope that you will get some good out of the story. When Mr. Marshall, the secretary, wrote to me and asked me to handle this subject he did not mention the length of time I should use in presenting same so I have brought a lot of figures along and a lot of notes and after I hit along on the high spots of the history of the Cuming County Fair and you want to hear any more about it I shall be glad to answer questions. In the first place back in 1923 we started the Cuming County Fair by selling Life Memberships at $25.00. "The first year there were 238 ot these Lite Memberships sold which netted the Society $5950.00. That year we received $3,000. from the County. For land and grading same we spent $2,711.45 and then started to build. Materials $5,126.97 Labor 1,065.90 Concrete work, coops etc 547.06 6,739.93 Total for the Permanent Improvement Acct 9,451.38 Disbursements for operating Fair 3,910.80 Total - $13,362.18 Besides the amount received from Life Members '. $ 5,950.00 And from the County 3,000.00 We received from ticket sales 3,161.60 And from advertising, concessions, etc 1,272.70 A total of $13,384.30 Which left a net balance the first year of $22.12. I am giving the figures to show you that the people of Cuming County wanted a Fair at the time. Continuing I want to say that the first meeting of the Life Members was held May 28th, 1923, at which meeting seven directors were elected one from each supervisor dis - trict. June 2nd this board met and elected officers. Several meet - ings following and the middle of July the corn was cut from the 10 acres bought for the Fair Grounds, the grading and building started, to be in readiness for August 20th less than six weeks away. Events moving as fast as they did the newspapers were full of Fair every week and people were talking and arguing and claiming the grounds and buildings would never be ready by fair time and all that was advertising and ladies and gentlemen advertising, the right kind, is one of the big things in putting over a fair and in making every day big day. A little later on I want to talk more about advertising. </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Right now I want to emphasize the fact that our Life membership is a very important factor in making every day a big day at our Fair. At this time we have about 445 life members and issue approximately 1500 tickets for them. Then we sell about 2000 season tickets, we have sold over 3000 of them in one year, well that means we are going to have about 4000 people on the grounds every day, a mighty good nucleus to start from. Old fair men told us that this life mem - bership would be the ruination of our Fair but we find that Ihe more life members we have the larger the gate grows. At least we feel that the $11,150 we have received from this source is better than operat - in a free fair it is a barrier in our county for a free fair. Now I want to stress advertising. lam a merchant and believe in advertising, even after the last few tough years. I believe in news - paper advertising and patronize the newspapers — I also like to. get all the free advertising from that source possible and I want to say that we do get a lot of it from the papers especially in West Point where the fair is located. We get out a lot of premium lists which we distribute over the county and even into the neighboring counties. In these lists we pre - sent the free acts and tell them the story of the fair. Shortly before the fair opens we get out a circular, we get these at a low lost for we use a large part of the set up from the Premium List and in the cir - cular have the official program. There are 5 papers in our county and we advertise in all or them and then go outside and have a small announcement for two weeks before our Fair in 15 other papers in the neighborhood. This year we did considerable radio advertising. Perhaps I should explain that we have a studio in West Point which is located in the Baumann store and the secretary of the fair is the chief an - nouncer. These broadcasts are by remote control over WJAG Norfolk, which station has a lot of listeners all over our territory. Starting a month before the opening of the fair this year a message went out over the air every morning about the Cuming County Fair and eoniing direct from the secretary, it seemed to be effective. Just a week be - fore the fair opening, a program of an hour and a half was put on over the air on Sunday afternoon. This program featured a band, with chorus, some musical numbers from the stock company that was to play at our fair and a piano soloist. At the opening of the program between the musical selections and at the close, a message went out about the fair and this message or the messages took the people from the opening of the fair to the close. Each morning of the fair a message went out about the events of the day at the fuir. The ads in all the papers called the attention of the people to the broadcasts for particulars. Newspapers as a rule do not like radio advertising but </seg>
            <seg id="p097">97 NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS folks I want to say that I have been advertising for about 30 years and during a good share of that time published a store paper, with .most satisfactory results and I want to emphasize that radio has a place in the advertising field. But folks our best advertising is the fair itself and we claim that each fair is our best advertisement for the next fair. We claim that we have an exceptionally clean fair — we allow no questionable char - acters on the grounds — we just encourage these professionals to move right on. I could elaborate quite a bit on our fair but will tell briefly of some of the reasons our fair has been successful and why we do have a well balanced attendance for every day of the fair. In the first place our fair grounds which now comprise 20 acres is adjacent to Neligh park which is West Point's city park and contains 25 acres more. The grounds are beautiful and getting more so every year. There is a lot of shade in the park and quite a bit on the fair grounds. We encourage re-unions during our fair and many people who have moved away make it a point to return to the old home town at Fair time, they know that they will meet a lot of friends there. There is always a lot of entertainment at the Cuming County Fair, something doing all the time. And that entertainment must be of the highest order. There is a lot of interest displayed in horse pulling contests and our county has developed some state champion teams. We feature a lot of baseball und I want to say that I have seen as good baseball during our fairs as I have seen anywhere. Last year in one game there were three runners cut off at the plate, when they tried to score on fly balls, two of them caught in deep left and the 3rd in center field. As perfect throws as any human being could make. Last year we had one game called on account of darkness after the 12th inning, it was the 2nd game of the afternoon. The next day the two teams battled for 9 innings and ended with one score apart. The free acts are of the highest order and we have found it necessary to have a Revue to have the entertainment more diversified to keep the crowds coming back. We have fireworks Monday, Tuesday, Wednes - day and Thursday nights, each night being different brings crowds back for more. After the fireworks we have free picture shows in front of the grandstand and at the last fair this included talkies. A dance and tent show is also on after the fireworks. And while we entertain royally at the fair we always keep in mind that it is an educational institution. We have wonderful school exhibits at the fair and a mighty fine building in which to display the exhibits. There are a lot of 4-H clubs in Cuming County and, folks since February, 1929 the Cuming County Agricultural Society has been financing the county's part of the Club Leader or County Agent. Our board has felt that a real service has been rendered in the county and that the young folks have been receiving a lot of extra education </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that would not have been available. This work has been the direct cause of bringing the grand championship for baby beef at the Ak- Sar-Ben show to Nebraska for the first time. Yes it has cost us some money, over $9,000. up to the first of last October, and we are some - what in debt but we are confident that times are getting better and that we will have "every day a big day" at our fairs in the future. Going back to the advertising value of getting attendance at a fair, I want to add that each year we made some permanent improve - ments at our fair which would always be completed about the last day before the fair started and some times not even then. But the idea in swelling the attendance is to get stories in the papers and getting the people curious to see just what is being done. All but three of the eleven years we have operated we made extensive addi - tions and improvements. Our total outlay tor this account has totaled $46,724.37 and we have an exceptional set-up with all buildings in excellent shape. Each year the city has been making improvements in the park and we always stress this in our advertising; also. There is just one other item I want to mention. Quite a number of fairs have been using Home Talent for the entertainment. We have been reluctant to try this. One reason perhaps because it entails a lot of work. Another is that Home Talent is used in the different schools and by other organizations in the county to raise funds. We might interfere there. The patrons of our Fair come from a large territory and we fear that a large percentage would not be interested in such talent and it would hurt jour attendance. And in addition the means of making a living would be taken from a lot of Free Act performers if all fairs were to carry out this plan. We have passed through the era of cutting out this and cutting out that but the government is now teaching us through the CWA 'and Emergency relief that it is essential to give work and personally I am strong lor it. Perhaps I should apologize for rambling along as I have but instead I invite you to ask questions, if there is anything else you would like to know about the young fair that has grown rapidlv in Cuming County. </seg>
            <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS BOY'S AND GIRL'S CLUB WORK AT COUNTY FAIRS K. C. FOUTS, Seward PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: As Mr. Fouts is detained in Denver for the Live Stock show the discussion which he prepared will be pre - sented by Stanley Matzke of Seward County. (Mr. Matzke read paper ) . "The county fair these days is indeed a rare one in which the activities of the boys and girls in their teens are not very much in evidence through their 4-H clubs. It has been my pleasant experience in the last fourteen years to assist with the program of some twenty - five county fairs in every part of Nebraska. In many of them I have worked in the early and late years of this period and in most cases I have been- impressed by the progress In useful endeavor made by many fine young men and women of today with whom I became acquainted but a comparatively few years ago. I recall when they stood before me to give reasons in some judging contest, perhaps rather bashful, and somewhat awkward when hands or feet refused to assume a position that would permit peace of mind. Sometimes the card before me indicated that the contestant knew his business quite well when placing the animals of a class, but when he attempted to tell me why he did it. the words just wouldn't come. A few ques - tions, framed more for restoring confidence than for seeking answers usually unlocked the story. Again, I recall many of these boys and girls as they drove swine or led calves out for placing. In some counties, I've returned for several years to note the progress made in selection of animals, in lilting and in presentation in the show ring On one occasion I yielded to the request that I place the girl's stvle show. The girl's style show was and Is a popular activity and while I rather enjoyed the outcome. I concluded the 4-H activities were too many for one to try to keep up with all of them. Some two weeks later when the little lady I had placed at the top was awarded a medal during the Wednesday evening program at the state fair contest, my satisfaction was complete, —so much that I never tried that job again." J "Now as I attend the same fairs, I find these former club members as well as some of the older club members, serving as clerks in the various departments and as superintendents. They take a keen inter - est in their work, they radiate good fellowship and they insure activity wherever they are." "Before going into the county fair 4-H club relationships. I should ike to recall some of the objects and purposes of 4-H club work as brought out by the agencies fostering it. as well as some of the ob - jects and purposes claimed for our county fairs, if we are to consider </seg>
            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the law under which we seek county appropriations. As a subordinate organization to the State Board of Agriculture, the county fair or - ganizations send delegates to the State Board of Agriculture 'for the purpose of deliberating and consulting as to the prospects and condi - tion of the agricultural interests throughout the state*. The law under which provision is made for premium money for county fairs states that 'the money so raised shall be used for the purpose of paying premiums and for permanent improvements for such fair and for no other purpose whatsoever", with provisions for some expenses of free fairs. Awarding of premiums for the improvment of soil, crops, tillage, manures, implements, stock, articles of domestic industry, and such other articles, productions and improvements as they may deem proper, and performing all such acts as they may deem best, calculating to promote the agricultural and manufacturing interests of the county, are within the authority of the respective agricultural societies. This last clause permits the fair management to develop in almost any direction of its choice. The last few years we have seen the develop - ment of the idea exhibits in which productive methods are recognized as of value from the fair stand point, as well as the product itself." "Quoting from the National Committee on 4-H clubs, we find that 'Boy's and girl's 4-H club work is a publicly-supported and directed educational enterprise of the United States Department of Agriculture, state agricultural colleges and county governments cooperating. It is designed to teach through doing and is so organized as to teach better practices in agriculture and home economics, and the finer things of rural life, while at the same time developing wholesome, industrious, public-spirited boys and girls'." "Boys and girls are taught in club organizations that 'the object of this club shall be to improve ourselves, our homes, and our com - munity by the organization of a club; through its meetings, demon - strations, judging contests and exhibits'. It would appear that a fair program recognizing these goals and purposes should have attractive features for every member of the family. As a community activity, with these things in mind, the fair and the 4-H clubs might go hand in hand with more satisfactory results than might be expected were eacli to attempt to promote its program separately." "I am not unmindful of the fact that the greatest problem eon - fronting any fair is that of finances. A few years ago most of the fairs got along quite well, unless perhaps they tried to be too big. Now most county fairs have restricted budgets and must plan their programs with more care than formerly. Briefly, the most noticeable change in the county fair program is that we have learned to do more for ourselves instead of hiring it done for us. The willingness to meet the situation in this manner is very likely to be the determining factor </seg>
            <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS in whether or not some of our fairs continue to function much longer. I believe that many counties are finding that the willingness ot 4-H club people to help with the entertainment program at our county fairs is easing the load for the managements. There may be some question whether the type of patron who comes to the fair grounds just in time for the program in the grandstand and who leaves the grounds as soon as that is over, figures that he gets his money's worth. On the other hand, there is not enough of him to pay for the things he wants. But for Mother and Dad, their friends in the neighborhood; those who visit around the grounds and spread the picnic dinner, they are going home pleased at the recognition given for any member of their community for their part in the program." "In the matter of premium money to be paid for 4-H exhibits and activities, there is a great deal ef difference in opinion. The county 4-H committee and the fair board will do well to make a survey. Con - sider the 4-H enrollment within the county and the probable con - tribution in the way of exhibits and activities at the fair. A percent - age of the total premium money might well be set aside for 4-H club work and this divided equitably among the classes." "The policy toward admissions and fees should be worked put. A stickler is the question of the exhibitor of 4-H livestock competing in open class. I think we have enough experience with this problem that we may safely say that when the 4-H club member elects to com - pete in open classes, he should be granted no concessions but. meet upon class exhibitors on an equal basis. In the matter of calves, pigs, sheep and poultry in 4-H classes. It is rather common to find three to five times the number of animals competing than there are premiums awarded. Such is not often the case in open classes. Yet, if we are interested in promoting the welfare of our boys and girls, we should encourage these large entry lists. An animal exhibited will likely be dead and gone within a few months, but the experience gained by the youthful exhibitor may last a life time. Some folks think that a 4-H club member with an exhibit hardly able to land in the money has no business at the fair. That may be alright for district, state or inter - state competition, but the door of the community fair should be wide open for the youngster who is sure to take something home, if not a prize. It appears to me that stall room and admission should be pro - vided without charge and possibly a small prize given each exhibitor whether he placed or not. The inspiration given in this manner was the first experience of many a young man today able to make competi - tion hot for all comers." "While exhibits are conceded a place at fairs, the trend today is to recognize 4-H activities. Judging contests are provided for the girls in their homes projects as well as for the boys in farm projects. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The girl's style show is worthy of a few moments before the grand - stand. Many counties use the 4-H song groups. Demonstrations, while hardly suitable to be carried on before the grandstand, are worthy of consideration in the fair program and space should be provided for them. Many county 4-H committees have carried on these demonstration programs under difficult conditions. I believe this is one phase of 4-H club work that has not received the consider - ation due from the fair management. Many times 4-H club mem - bers and their leaders have sought the stage of some tent show, of which the management generously donated its accommodations. At one fair, a miniature train snorted past between the audience and the stage, while demonstration teams put on their program. This was simply the result of a lack of appreciation of the other fellows work and the 4-H youngsters was quick to sense it. On the other hand, some fairs have provided ample accommodations. The Custer County fair has a very large building donated at 4-H work aside from livestock exhibits. Wayne County has a dormitory for the exhibitors of baby beef calves. These are but two examples of the recognition given 4-H club activities." "It would appear that the fair management fostering a good 4-H club program should feel some responsibility in the matter of conces - sions. If the same tests were applied to concessions that were ap - plied to any home business, it is very doubtful whether we would have many objectionable concessions. Today, the boys and girls do not have much change to jingle in their pockets, and this removes a good deal of the possible unpleasantness for this source. Nevertheless, it is hardly consistent to promote 4-H club activities and a questionable midway at the same fair. The Nebraska State Fair made its choice a good many years ago. I heard a former secretary say that that iirst years choice cost the Nebraska State Fair $3200, but that they had no cause to regret it." "The last thought I should like to leave with you is that these 19 and 20 year old boys and girls in the last years of their club work have been taught through club work to take responsibility, and the management of the fair will find in them, willing and able assistants when assigned under kindly supervision to any tasks they may have delegated to them. These older club members and the former club members are taking their part in the scheme of things today. Their success justifies this 4-H movement being continued." Boys 4-H club work in Nebraska in its earlier years centered mostly around swine clubs, and one but has to look over the records of the 1933 swine show at the Nebraska State Fair to see evidence of that early influence. In the future I think the management may look for better exhibits, more and better activities and in all, find the 4-H club a greater asset to our county fairs each succeeding year." </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. MATZKE: I want to say that I have felt signally honored to have the opportunity of presenting this paper ot Mr. Fouts* to this gathering. Last year I was privileged to substitute for Mr. Smiley of our County. Some of these years lam going to deem it a real honor if I can address this organization upon a topic assigned to me in my own right. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: It may be that Mr. Matzke said that in a spirit of levity but nevertheless we really appreciate that we have such a man as Mr. Matzke come forward in this organization to take the places of the older men. But I trust that the program committee next year will select him for a place on our annual program. Now we have with us this evening another young man who has made a mark in this state and he is here with a message that he wants to present to this gathering I am referring to — Honorable H. Malcolm Baldridge of Omaha, ex-congressman. MR. BALDRIDGE: Gentlemen, I am pleased to be here but I wonder if I am ever going to live down that ex-congressmen business. . I came here tonight to speak for a wonderful organization from Omaha. AK-SAR-BEN. We have built up a wonderful plant, but things aren't going well with us. Omaha, is. concerned with the loss of the Pari Mutuel racing machine. As late as 1928 when this institu - tion still thrived benefits were coming to the county fairs from its proceeds. Now the grass is growing up there. Something must be done. I come here tonight to see if you people would be interested in the restoration of this situation. I am advised that in the six years we had this racing in Omaha there was paid to your county fairs something over $85,000.00. Now we want to know if you people would be interested in getting back such a benefit as $85,000.00 in a six year period. Before I go further I want to say along this line that in 1932 five states have taken steps for the restoration of legalized races, — Texas, Vermont, Michigan, California and South Dakota. I state that to give you an idea of what is going on elsewhere in the United States. Now coming to the legal phase it will require a change in the con - stitution of our state. Provision will have to be made with the leg - islature. Making a change in the terms of our statute. To accom - plish this would first necessitate a petition signed by 10% of the elec - toral votes and that means fifty-seven thousand names. Then we would have to go before the legislature to modity the law. This means a heavy undertaking, and before those interested can tackle that task they want to know something of the sentiment of the people, to know something of the degree of interest that will be manifested and of the amount ot support that will be accorded to such attack. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Ak-Sar-Ben has no money with which to put on a campaign. We will have to appeal to friends to help us. Gentlemen, this means a lot to Omaha, and yet Omaha wants to know if it doesn't mean a lot to the rest of the state. If it is a good thing for Omaha it seems to us it will mean a good thing to some of the rest of the state. Now I am very anxious tonight to find out whether this group will be interested in the advancement of this particular proposal. We want to know whether it will appeal to you people or not. The ques - tion is that this is not merely something for Omaha but we want to know if the fairs of the state want this. If it is a good thing for Omaha perhaps it is a good thing for the state and for your fairs through the state. Now If it is going to appeal to you I shall be glad later on to come to each one of your communities and meet a body of your citizens and go over this matter with them and we should then want your support and assistance in properly circulating these peti - tions in your respective communities. Now I would like to have any expression from you people either way. Whatever the news is good or bad, I want to take it hack to our people. I .''■•■ A COUNTY FAIB DELEGATE: Could you tell us what per cent is usually returned to the county. A. I was not so familiar with the working of this law prior to 1928, so lam not sure that I can just answer that question. I know the reason was to develop interest in local horses coming in to Omaha. Now I know that our people are very much interested in the develop - ment of 4-H club activities which are becoming a major function with the Ak-Sar-Ben. Q. BY A DELEGATE: How many county fairs demonstrated when these checks were sent out. MR. BALDRIDGE: I said I wasn't really familiar with the work - ing of this law at that time. It's administration and the details of it were left to a racing commission. MR. VANCE OF ADAMS COUNTY: I think our county got part of this money. I think we got about $1100 but there were some condi - tions tied to it and in meeting those we afterward wondered whether we should have done it. If you were to bring this matter up again I would say that in my opinion that it would not go over again in Adams County. In other words, I think it would be impossible to put it over again in Adams County. MR. BALDRIDGE: Thank you. We are interested in hearing, tonight, just what your attitude is and what the ideas are of the rest of Nebraska, in regard to this matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS MR. R. C. JOHNSON: I think we should be able to find out with - out much difficulty. Of course only a few of the county fairs have racing any more. Even Douglas county don't have a race track and many of the other counties don't have the proper facilities any more So it may be that there would have to be some inducement besides the revival of racing before these county fairs in general would have rea - son to be interested. MR. E. J. MITCHELL of Deshler: lam from Thayer County Of course I think if this pari mutuel system is a good thing for Omaha it will be a good thing for the State Fair and County Fairs If it is a good thing for Omaha it will be a good thing for the/rest of the My understanding is that this gambling is unconstitutional and what ,s being asked of us is to go to the legislature and have our laws changed and have gambling legalized. We have taken a great deal of pride in the fact that our State Fair and County Fairs do not have any gambling, and games of chance and all of those things. I believe the development of the 4-H clubs has been a wonderful substitute for all of that. As far as I rTsioZrTn i" ed are " 0t ° n the riEht traCk When the^ P™P°*e to lestore this gambling. MR.

PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: Gentlemen, we have now reached the place where it says QUESTION BOX. I still think there are some topics that might be profitably taken up. For instance we have had some wonderful ideas tonight about home talent entertainment. I think there are some gentlemen present who could offer different things which were not covered in the excellent and comprehensive remarks of our friend Purcell. I believe we could hear from Seward County at this time. EARL B. SMILEY, Beaver Crossing: Mr. President, I know that we have tried numerous stunts that have not been mentioned here. We have used Fords and pigs in races. We have had some races that were very inexpensive. And they created a great deal of interest. We have had a riding cup fight. We have had the balloon fight. MR. STANLEY MATZKE, Seward: I agree with Earl that we have had a lot of stunts that haven't been mentioned here. I've been wonder - ing if it wouldn't be a very beneficial matter if we could have the various secretaries write in to the office of this association and give a list of these various stunts that have successfully created interest and then dutline the publicity that was used in connection with it. I would like to see some steps taken so that the members can. get the benefit of this information. MR.

SECRETARY MARSHALL: The roll call shows only the addi - tional presence of a delegate from the Phelps County Junior Fair That perhaps is a matter for the credentials committee. (No action taken on this matter and delegate Randall permitted to be seated.) PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: The first subject up for discussion this morning is— A Free Gate at Our Fair, by Mr. Schiefelbein of Wahoo. A FREE GATE AT OUR FAIR E. S. SCHIEFELBEIN, Wahoo. As I understand it this subject should really have been entitled, FREE GATE vs. PAY GATE. However, as my observations will be based mainly upon the ex - perience of our own county. I will take it as it is worded. I might say that we had just about come to a point in our county where we had to do something like this. We just about had to come through an experiment of a free gate or else close up shop. Along with some other members of the board I had been rather opposed to this idea. But we got to the point where we consented to try It. We had just about got to the place where it didn't seem to make much differ - ence but I am glad to report that it came out all right. In our county, the county board had the power to cut down the allowance to which the county fair was entitled with the result that the year before, instead of an appropriation of $3800.00 we were" </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE held down to only $2000.00 which was not enough upon which to carry out our activities on the scope formerly followed. In some respects we were very reluctant to hold a Fair at all until we began to make progress ln outlining our program. It was less than thirty days before the Fair was supposed to open, Sep. 20th when we difinltely decided to have a Fair. As everybody knows conditions in our county were not in very good shape. We had had a great many bank failures. There was only one bank operating in Wahoo. In view of all of these conditions we desired to make our money go as far as possible. We all know that a Fair is a"h educational institution, and we really ought to go ahead whether or not it is entirely self sustaining. So taking that view point we decided to continue. Many of our boys and girls want to embrace the educational features so taking the fair as a governmental subdivision and treating it as an educational institution we decided to continue. We have heard very much recently about the forgotten man. I believe the forgotten man is the one who hasn't got enough money when he comes up to the fair gates with his family and his flock of children. Anyway we con - cluded that he had probably already paid his way into the gate. So based upon this conclusion that a man was entitled to go in we con - cluded so far as Saunders County was concerned it would be a pretty good idea, after we permitted entrance at the main gate, that the patrons should have but so much left that he could use. And there perhaps should be a small charge for the grandstand. We also felt that we should put on a small charge for parking a car because an automo - bile can't see the fair. Therefore we concluded a charge of about 25&lt; for parking the car to be proper. We also imposed a small charge upon the quarter-stretch as well as upon the grandstand. In the year 1931, in the State of Nebraska according to the re - capitulation sheet on the county fairs we gather some interesting com - parisons between the success of free fairs and pay gate fairs. I might say that in the year 1931 a great deal of the loss sustained chargeable to free fairs was chargeable to Sheridan County .where their loss was almost $1000.00. As the recapitulation sheet shows in 1931 in all of the 84 fairs held in this state their operating net was $1094.51. Now coming to the report for 1932 we have fourteen free fairs and of those fourteen county Fairs that had a free gate ten of them showed a net gain of $7243.74. And in two fairs in 1932 a loss was shown of $568.60. While the net gain of the state of Nebraska that year was $6075.14. This made a good showing for sixteen fairs out of 84. In 1931 the particularly unfortunate fair had been Sheridan County. In 1932 it had been Washington County at Arlington. Of course I do not desire to single out any particular Fair as an example but this whole tabulation shows that in the years 1931 and 32 that the free gate fairs bore much more than their share of the burdens. It doesn't </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS seem right that a man should be asked to pay to get in to see his own calves, quilts and stock that he has raised and fed or the family have prepared for exhibition. G. I. PFEIFFER, Arlington: Some mention has been made as to the plight of Arlington Fair in 1932. I might say that such stuff as we have had was due to the fact that we were totally rained out. No fair can overcome these conditions when it is totally rained out. But we didn't accept these conditions as having any particular bear - ing as to whether we should make some charge at the gate or not. C. Y. THOMPSON, Cuming County: I notice on the program that the subject "How we succeeded with a pay gate" has been assigned to Senator Wherry. I don't know whether Senator Wherry is in the hall or not at this time but it seems to me that we ought to hear that side of the question then perhaps we can have a better balanced dis - cussion upon this whole subject. D. W. OSBORN, Pawnee County: I don't Know whether Senator Wherry can be here or not this morning. But I might say that we had a big crowd at our Fair last year. I think we charged 50? for the tickets and they were good for the grandstand after 4 o'clock. Per - haps in part our success was due to the advanced ticket sale. We had been selling season tickets, for something like a month before the fair I think one season ticket was sold for $1. and we sold another for $1.50. I think there were ten to fifteen thousand people there on Thurs - day. MR. RANDALL, Phelps County: We have been fortunate out at our place in that our county seat has an auditorium for the city and a live stock pavilion and we were able to rent the two for about $40 00 a day. Through the cooperation of the Chamber of Commerce and the County Board we were able to put across our Fair at a pretty reason - able price. We really couldn't charge a pay gate. I don't believe it could be done. A DELEGATE: May I ask the gentleman from Wahoo, What is your appropriation? A. Two thousand dollars. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: Mr. Schiefelbein has mentioned the fourteen or sixteen counties that have had some experience with this free gate during the past two years. Other Counties which have rep - resented us here have had some experience with the other side of this question. I think the subject is very important, and merits further time at which we have at our disposal due to the absence of one of the </seg>

The following responded: :-.•■ ■ I .' ': FRANKLIN COUNTY, O. C. Thomas: lam hardly in a position to make a final report, of our experience as to free gate or pay gate. Prom an experiment in 1932 we didn't make any money and we didn't lose anything particularly, so in 1933 we went ahead) and I think our report shows a gain of about $1600.00. However, due to other cir - cumstances that could not all be credited as a gain for a free fair. As some of it comes from back taxes so I cannot say for sure as to 193 4. GAGE COUNTY, H. F. BRANDT: We have wonderful crowds in Gage county. I think on Wednesday there were 25,000 people present. I call that a pretty good crowd. And as to whether a free gate is con - cerned it isn't so much a problem of whether you get a free gate or not as it is the distribution of expense, whether it is met when they come in at the gate or distributed after the crowd is there. You have your cavalcade of automobiles and I believe 2500 to 3000 cars should bear their expense, in maintaining the program OTOE COUNTY, Mr. West: Our Fair is organized- a good deal as a street Fair. The main purpose is to center upon the 4-H Club work. We had very good crowds and very good success, being on the streets of the town it naturally is a free gate matter. It couldn't be any - thing else. RICHARDSON COUNTY, Mr. Shubert: The old standby who usually speaks up for Richardson County is my friend Frank Peple of Humboldt. Falls City, the County Seat didn't maintain the Fair right so it was moved over to Humboldt, a town of about three thousand people. There they maintained a free gate because the Fair is held upon an open square. It has to be a free Fair because it would be impossible to hold any other kind. They don't spend money for premiums but they have a system whereby one merchant gives coupons for oil, another for groceries or for whatever product the merchant handles and these are redeemable in the place of premiums. That little fair has put on some wonderful programs in the way of pageants and parades. They keep the four sides of the square filled with people. They have a continuous program that runs in the af - ternoon until the dance at night. When you get something like 20,000 people gathered in a town like Humboldt I think you have an institu - tion that merits consideration. I / SEWARD COUNTY, By Mr. Welch: There has been a great deal said about free Fairs. There has been quite a lot said about programs </seg>
            <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS in Seward County. I don't know what I would add unless it would be something about the origin of the Fair Idea with us. We have a nice Fair Ground right at the edge of our County Seat. We worked out a plan whereby our County Board and our community organizations joined in the use of these grounds. As picnic grounds. In 1932 we yielded to the pressure to put on a free Fair. Practically every one of the business men were against the idea, but it worked out so that in 1933 the sentiment had turned the other way. And we got a lot of support. MR. VANCE, Aams County: I suppose you might say that Adams County has a sort of a half free fair. We reduced our price at the gate to 250, just half the former price. We figured that if they spend less at the gate they would come inside and spend the rest on the carnivals and other attractions and give the people inside a chance. These con - cession people are human. They ought to be given a run for their money. If less is spent at the gate more can be spent inside at the grandstand, or on the rides. We have had our shows on a percentage basis and I might say that the Miller shows gave us a very fine program. If it hadn't been for a loan of $6000 that we made about three years from the bank at Hastings we would have had a clear gain of $2000 last year. We had paid back about $4,000 on this but the members of the board thought it was good business policy to see that the rest of this was paid back before we took care of any thing else, especially inasmuch as we had stood responsible to this obliga - tion. MR. GRAFF: Mr. Chairman, since coming in here this morning, I have heard a lot about the existence of free fairs in the State of ■Nebraska and the condition of our county fairs as they have actually been operated. Some of these facts surprise me. They got me to thinking about something that may work out eventually something that no one knows. I just got to thinking that if this kind of a plan is going to work out so good with County Fairs, the first thing we know it will be applied to the State Fairs. Did it ever occur to you that probably whatever the population of Lincoln and Lancaster and a few adjoining counties might be that that would be a fair indication of what the attendance might be at the state Fair if all gate charges were removed at that institution. .v.. MR „, R ' C ' JOHNSON X think had a very splendid discussion on th s subject this morning. Along with Mr. Graff I don't know where this matter may end. But I believe that we can say that in our county it has worked out as Mr. Schiefelbein has pointed out here today. I don t think there is any doubt but what our county will stay by the plan adopted for the last couple of years. </seg>

We took forty-four calves and came back with thirty ribbons. lam sorry I couldn't have been here last night and heard the discussion on Boys and Girls Club Work by Fouts of Seward County. I saw him out there in Denver so I know what he had in mind on this subject. MR. PONT of Stanton County: This may not be germane to the subject that has been under discussion but I have been somewhat puzzled recently by an incident in our county when hostility was shown against the boys and girls club work by the local organization of the Farmers Union. They seem to think that there was some hostility because ot some partiality to the Farm Bureau Association on the part of the Boys Club Work. MR. HUNT of Otoe County: lam connected with Farmers Union Work and of course the prime purpose of our fair has been the promo - tion of the 4-H Club work. If any place there has been some hostility on the part of the farm Bureau, I think -it has been a purely local situation. C. Y. THOMPSON, Cuming County: Of course the prime function of the Farm Bureau Work has been cooperation with the county agent. I agree with Mr. Hunt that if traces of hostility are found between these three organizations mentioned it is no doubt a local situation especially if the Farmers Union members have looked on the Farm Bureau as a rival organization. It has been the purpose of these organizations to work in 100% cooperation. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: Is there any further report to come from the committee on credentials? CHAIRMAN MIILLE: I think not. PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: Is there any further report from the grievance committee. If not we will entertain a motion to discharge these committees.

            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION I ANNUAL MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS* ASSOCIATION C. Y. THOMPSON, West Point. Nebraska. While conditions generally are much improved over what they were at this time last year, we are still in the throes of a depression, such as this country has never before experienced. It would- be impossible to put a finger on any one thing and say that is the cause of the de - pression, for there were many contributing causes. While many of us will point a finger of scorn at Wall Street and the international bankers and charge them with being the culprits, who's inordinate greed and avarice were the cause of our predicament. Others say our antiquated methods of distribution are at fault, taxes are too high, we are producing too much, etc. etc. I am not going to take up any of your valuable time discussing the many contributing causes of the depression. The momentous question with the farmers is, how can we survive until the rising tide of prosperity reaches us and bears us along on its crest. The Agricultural Adjustment Act was put into force on the theory that there is an over-production of agricultural products. Of course, some contend that it is under-consumption rather than over-production, that is the cause of our troubles. But whether it be over-production or under-consumption, the result so far as the farmer Is concerned is the same, and the question might arise as to the justification for support of an association, such as the Nebraska Crop Growers' Asso - ciation, that has for its object "the advancement of the interests of agriculture in Nebraska, by increasing yields of corn and farm crops, thru improvement in the seed, improvement in the methods of tillage and seeding, and the conservation of soil tillage and soil moisture." The fact of the matter is the question has already arisen, as. those of us who have been in the thick of the fight to preserve reasonable ap - propriations for this work can well testify. A surprisingly large number of farmers feel that the depression is largely due to scientific research, agricultural teaching, and improved farm machinery. A few years ago I attended the annual meeting of the Corn Belt Committee, which comprised representatives from fifty or more farm organizations in the central west. Some of the more radical leaders literally frothed at the mouth in their denounciation of the Farm Board and the Agricultural Marketing Act. It was a crime, they said, to advocate curtailment of production when some of our people are starving. Besides, it was inconsistent to advocate curtail - ment of production on one hand, while our colleges were teaching us how to grow two blades of grass where one grew before. What they </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE demanded was cost of production and they were not concerned about how much it cost, as the government was expected to pay the bill, and they did not propose to have the government or anyone else dictate to them how much they could produce. They stood for rugged in - dividualism in the matter of production, but they wanted the govern - ment to pay the price and have the tax payers pay the bill. Every intelligent farmer knows that this scheme is not practical. These farm leaders are still spreading this propaganda in a futile effort to belittle the agricultural administration program, and the Extension Service in particular, and consciously or unconsciously they are work - ing hand in glove with unfriendly and sinister interests who have at their disposal a large slush fund for the ostensible purpose of fighting appropriations for the support of agricultural colleges and extension work. Had it not been for the good fight put up by the friendly farm organizations, appropriations would have undoubtedly been cut to such an extent as to make research and extension work ineffective. The reason for opposition to agricultural research and the extension service is, first, that the majority of farmers do not make personal contact with the county agent or the experiment station but they pick up ideas and get improved varieties of seed from their neighbors who do come in contact with these sources of information. They get bene - fits from research work so indirectly that they do not know it and are unwilling to pay taxes to support institutions that do not as they think, do them any good. I will venture to say that there is not a farmer in the state of Nebraska who has not received some benefit either directly or indirectly from the reasearch work done at our Nebraska Experiment Stations, yet how many there are who do not realize it. Second, opposition is due to befuddled thinking, inability of many to distinguish between efficient production and greater production. I do not want to anticipate what Mr. Gross might have to say along this line, but it seems to me we are justified in stressing this point con - siderably. It is just as important as any other project, that we get farmers to thinking straight in this matter, because until we do, it will be impossible to get the necessary co-operation from the majority of farmers, to make the merits of efficient production generally rec - ognized and we will have to continue our fight, for appropriations to carry on the good work indefinitely. I started to farm in 1900, and I have kept in close touch with the work at the college all that time, and I found that their program to introduce higher yielding and better adapted varieties of grains and farm crops, to teach better management, more efficient production, making two blades of grass grow where one grew before was always sound. And it is as sound today as it ever was. I think that Dr. Geo. F. Warren was right when he said "Scientific research, agri- </seg>
            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION cultural teachings and improved farm machinery are the major ways in which the depression can be met." For regardless of what farm products bring the farmer who produces at the least cost has the best chance to survive the depression. Ordinarily when a farmer finds himself in difficulties, he will farm more land and work longer hours in order to meet his obligations. Unfortunately when all farmers are in the same predicament, and all increase production, lower prices for farm products will be the in - evitable result. When prices get below the cost of production the more we raise the greater is our loss. Therefore, especially at this time, it is very important that we mix bruins with brawn and cut production down to the very lowest point in the easiest and most efficient manner possible. That means good farm management, up - to-date machinery, improved varieties of grains and grasses rather than increased acreage. As far back as 1903 the Nebraska Experiment Station found that the smooth utility type corn outyielded the ordinary rough type grown at that time. In 1921 extension workers in crops and soil introduced corn type demonstations on 21 farms of the state. Rough type ears and an equal number of smooth type ears were taken from the farmer's crib, and planted side by side. At husking time the corn was husked and weighed and for'the 21 demonstration the smooth type corn outyielded the rough type seven bushels per acre. That means seven bushels of extra corn per acre without any labor except to harvest. In the corn yield contests, sponsored by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, the smooth type has almost invariably proven its superior yielding ability over the rough type corn, until today the rough type is conspicuous by its absence from our annual state shows. And for the first time in the history of the International Hay and Grain show the smooth utility type won the Grand Championship prize, at that show this year. The Nebraska Crop Growers' take consider - able pride in this achievement because we feel that we did our part to make smooth typed corn popular, and we are glad to see our ideas of show corn, which is utility as well as beauty, recognized at the Inter - national. If this publicity brings about a more general use of utility type corn, hundreds and thousands of dollars will be saved to the corn growers of the country by more efficient production. We also take pride in the fact that the Nebraska Crops Judging Team and the 4-H Judging Team won first at the International, because we not only encourage this work, but we were largely responsible for the team being able to enter the contest. It is a great accomplishment to be - come proficient enough to win first at the International and we con - gratulate the boys on their achievement. With the knowledge they have gained in this crops judging work they are bound to be an asset to the future of agriculture in Nebraska. Since the superiority of the smooth type variety is generally conceded, variety trial demonstra- </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tions have been sponsored by our association. We had a splendid demonstration on the Ben Stalp farm in Cuming county, where the National Corn Husking Contest was held this year, and we passed out pamphlets to approximately four thousand farmers who were inter - ested in the demonstration. Since the variety trial demonstrations have been conducted, a few hybrids have been included, and some of the very best have consistently outyielded the ordinary strains 15 per cent to as much as 30 per cent. Several of these hybrids were made available to farmers this year. Seed was sold at 250 a pound The seed was not certified this year, but several inspections were made by college representatives. Possibly next year the Nebraska Crop Growers' will start certifying hybrid seed corn. THE FRENCH ASSIGNATS 1 700-1 7»fl L. B. SNYDER Following the French Revolution in 1789, France found herself in serious condition. It is true that she possessed a constitutional form of government, but she also had a tremendous national debt of 2 400 million livres and a treasury deficit. Business men had lost con - fidence in the future, capital had vanished from sight and national stagnation had set in with the result that unemployment and poverty were evident on all sides. As a consequence, legislative remedies were sought by politicians and reformers. One group of sincere men who believed whole-hearted - iy in the efficiency of more money began to clamour for paper monev Other prominent men realized the dangers of such issues and vainly attempted to stem the tide. The influence of the many debtors and the speculators was too great, and in April, 1790, the national assembly voted to issue 400 million livres in paper money. Some of the argu - ments advanced, applied only to the French Assignats. as these notes were called, but other arguments have a familiar ring. 1. The confiscated church lands were to be held as security for these notes. The government said they were to be redeem - ed by turning over this land to persons presenting the notes for that purpose. 2. They were to be issued in denominations too large for cir - culation, but suitable for land purchase; i. e. 200. 300 and 1000 livre notes. ' ' 3. These churc- lands were valuable security and capable of producing 4 per cent returns per annum. 4. The assignats were to bear 3 per cent interest per annum. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION . This was expected to make them more valuable than specie and to lead to their being hoarded and to specie being brought into circulation again. , 5. They argued that the people of France had progressed be - yond the simple state where natural laws of money still func - tioned, and had reached a glorious stage where they could make their own laws of money circulation. 6. Although despotic rulers always made the mistake of over - issuing paper money, a democracy such as France had become would never make such an error. At first the results of this issue were all that the most ardent supporters could wish. The national treasury was relieved at once, a part of the public debt was paid in assignats, creditors were encour - aged, credit was revived, ordinary expenses were met, and trade in - creased. By September, 1790, five months later, less desirable results became evident. The treasury spent its 400 million livres, and was again in difficulties. The price of goods managed to keep a bit ahead of incomes. Demands for relief poured'in from all sides. What was more natural than for the politicians to have recourse in the same remedy that had given temporary relief earlier. Like the man who gulped down the entire bottle of pills, France was ready to try the whole bottle immediately. One of the strongest statesmen of France, Mirabeau, had not sup - ported the first issue. After witnessing the eagerness of the people for paper money and the slight recovery effected by it, Mirabeau re - versed his previous position, and came out for paper money. He even proposed that the government pay off the entire debt in assignats. His opponents called attention to the depreciation of the assignats as evidence of the operation of natural laws. Tallyrand, while not op - posing them, did make the statement that the government could force a person to accept 1000 livres in paper for 1000 livres in specie, but could never force him to give 1000 livres in specie for 1000 livres in paper. On September 29, 1790, the assembly approved a second issue of 800 million livres of assignats: thus definitely committing France to a policy of paper inflation. During this earlier period supplies of small change were inadequate. To remedy this the people were urged to bring in their gold and silver wares, and to turn them over to the government. Copper utensils were next requested and finally the gov - ernment confiscated the brass church bells for use in small coins. Even such low value moneys as copper coins were more valuable than the paper notes, and consequently disappeared from circulation. Cities felt the need of small denomination money, and printed small assignats </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for local use. In order to avoid the confusion resulting where many issues of money are in use in the country, the government voted in the latter part of 1790, to issue small denomination assignats. Issue followed issue in rapid succession until 45,000 million had been issued, and some 40,000 million were in circulation. Following each Issue a short period of business activity ensued. Each succeeding period of apparent prosperity was shorter than the last. The value of the assignats diminished with each issue. Speakers and officials blamed everything but overissue, for the depreciation, and suggested various queer remedies. It was claimed that people were ignorant of the value of these notes, so an extensive system of education was car - ried on. Others thought that merchants were deliberately attempting to discredit the notes. As a remedy, it was suggested that a few traders be hanged as a means of inspiring faith in the others. Great Britain was accused of maliciously forcing the value of the assignats below par. Tullyrand said that "exports were too low and imports were too high." To correct this, tariffs were raised and certain other trade restrictions imposed. Certain French nobles had become alarmed over the situation and had left France during or after the revolution taking all their movable property with them. These men were accused of attempting to discredit the Republic so as to increase their own chances of returning to power. To check such a move, all of their available property was confiscated by the government. Their lands formed the basis for more note issues. No explanation or remedy was too wild to be accepted by the French government, but in spite of them all, the value of the assignats declined. An indication of the dec-line in value of the paper money can be obtained from this table. A gold livre was worth about 19.1 cents.

            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION With such fantastic prices for farm products we would expect farmers to work long hours and produce large crops. Had it been possible for the entire price to be paid to farmers, this might have been the case. Unfortunately for the nation, this was not possible. Each dealer had to increase his own margins because of the uncer - tainty of the money situation. Then too, wages had lagged behind prices, and even the fully employed workmen were unable to buy enough food for their families. Many farmers refused to sell food at market prices, but preferred to hold for the rising prices certain to come. Bread lines were necessary in all cities. In desperation the government passed the "law of the maximum" to prevent holding products. This law fixed prices of products and services as follows: 1. Price of each necessity 1 1/3 its price.in 1790. 2. All transportation to be added at so much per league. 3. 5 per cent to be added for the profits of the wholesaler. 4. 10 per cent to be the profit of the retailer. These provisions seemed reasonable to the deputies and the people. The first result was that every means of evasion was attempted: farm - ers brought in as little as possible, and merchants either quit handling certain goods, or illegally charged higher prices. Manufacturing was more seriously cut down than before. To enforce the law, authorities were instructed to burn the dwellings of any one found guilty of violating the law. If a farmer were found guilty, his produce was seized, and he was lucky to escape with his life. To force people to accept without question, all the assignats offered, it was decreed any one accepting assignats at a discount be beheaded and his property confiscated. In May, 1794, one became subject to the death penalty if he even asked what money an account would be paid in. Among the effects that troubled the French people were: 1. Disappearance of gold and its migration to foreign countries. 2 Diminishing of prosperity as paper issues increased. 3. nosing of factories and discharging of laborers. 4. Failure of real wages to increase as note issues increased. 5. Increase in speculation among all classes of people. Upon whom did the loss fall? Whoever held the assignats when France returned to hard money suffered a loss. By 1795 most of the wealthy people had converted their money into fixed assets such as land. The middle classes had been forced to sell their property in order to live, while the laborers had not been able to live from their </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE current incomes. Farmers refused to sell their products and even stopped producing more than for their own needs. The French government decided to try another expedient: namely, issuing a new paper currency called mandats, more limited in amount and to which the assignats were convertible at the ratio of 1 mandat to 30. This did not give the desired strength, and only increased the difficulties of the country. Finally after almost six years, the ma - chinery used in printing notes was all destroyed and France returned to hard money a sadder and wiser nation. Before France could fully recover, it was necessary for a Napoleon to take over the government. Napoleon insisted upon a pay-as-you-go policy, which necessitated heavy taxes at home, and heavy tribute from conquered nations, and in addition he insisted upon hard money. UNITED STATES NOTES, 1801-1870 H. C. FILLEY General Beauregard attacked Fort Sumpter, April 12, 1861, and captured the fort two days later. The next day, April 15, President Lincoln called for seventy-five thousand volunteers. The war had begun. The North was not ready for the struggle. The standing army was small, and only a part of the troops were in northern states. There was an immediate need not only for men, but for rifles, artil - lery, munitions, ships and other war supplies. The Federal treasury was practically empty. Existing legislation made no provision for raising large sums to care for rapidly multi - plying expenditures. The government had had no experience in financ - ing such expenditures as the carrying on of the Civil War entailed. The measures which were rushed through Congress did not provide sufficient income to meet expenditures. The treasury in desperation resorted to an issue of paper money in the latter part of 1861. The United States notes, or "greenbacks" of the Civil War period were demand notes. A five dollar note for example pledged "The United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand five dollars." Since the real reason of the government for issuing the notes was the lack of gold or silver or any other money with which to make payments, it can be readily seen that the greenbacks were at the time of issue an unredeemable paper currency. The law re - quired that they be accepted at their face value in legal payment for all debts, public and private, except duties on imports and interest on </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the public debt. They were really a forced loan without interest. Gold has value aside from Its value as money in the markets of every country in the world. Gold dust and gold nuggets have served for money in mining camps times without number. The value of paper per pound is so small that it can not be used for money in the same way as gold. It is the promise written or printed on the paper, and not the value of the paper itself that gives to paper money its value in exchange. Whenever the sellers of goods begin to doubt the ability of a country to redeem its promises, they quite naturally ask higher prices for their goods. The greater their lack of confidence the higher prices rise. If a unit of paper money, whether a dollar, or pound, or mark, is worth less than a gold coin of the Bame denom - ination, it naturally follows that everyone will pay his debts in the cheapest money that is legal tender. Gold.i and for that matter silver disappears from circulation under such conditions. The expenses of the Federal government during the Civil War increased more rapidly than taxes could be levied and collected or than bonds could be sold. A part of the cost of the war was due to the increase in the price level. This increase was due in part to the increased demand for goods, but in much greater part to the depre - ciation of the purchasing power of the paper dollar. This is illus - trated graphically in Figure 1. </seg>

Due to the paper money issues, the quantity of money more than doubled in three years. This increase in money would have caused an increase in the price level even if it had all been gold or silver. Since gold and silver did not circulate freely, the actual increase of circulating media was not large. The value of the greenbacks measured in gold fluctuated rapidly, and as a result prices fluctuated rapidly. Southern victories, which decreased the possibility of the greenbacks ever being redeemed, or at least of their being redeemed within a few years, lowered their value. Northern victories increased the confidence of the public in the Federal government, and increased the value of the greenbacks. This fluctuation in value is given in Table 2. Table li.

The low point was reached in 1864. The average value for the year was less than half that of gold, and at one time when Grant's campaign against Richmond was not progressing favorably, a paper dollar was worth only 35.1 cents in gold. The value of the greenbacks increased after the close of the war The public believed that ultimately they would be redeemed There - was a general confidence in the honor and integrity of the United States. In 1866 an act was passed by Congress permitting' the Secretary It, Il!Z Ury l ° ret ' re " lfn ' ited al " OUnt of •Shellbacks each month. After $44,000,000 of greenbacks had been retired, . this act was re - pealed in February IS6B. For the next few years the retirement of the greenbacks was an undecided question. A strong sentiment de - veloped in favor of Hat money. It became a political issue. In January 1574, Congress passed the Specie-Resumption Ac. which provided that United States notes would be redeemable in gold' on and after January 1. 1579: The contraction of the notes out - standing was authorized by Congress. The amount was fixed by statute in May, 187S, at $346,681,016. When it became evident that the treasury would be able to re - deem the notes when presented, they increased in value, and were at par from December IS7S to the spring of 1933.

Because of their effect on prices their ultimate result was to cause an enormous increase in the cost of the Civil War. Millions of people suffered while prices were going up, and other millions prospered. When redemption of the flat money became certain prices in terms of paper money fell, and as a result many thousands of people lost and other thousands gained. Unfortunately the periods were so far apart that the persons injured when prices were rising were, as a whole, not the same persons who were helped when they fell. Almost the best that can be said about the greenback experience is that the men responsible for their issuance were honest and well - meaning, but woefully ignorant of the effect of their action. They were faced with an emergency, and in meeting it used a method which increased the costs of the war, and brought suffering and finan - cial disaster to hundreds of thousands of persons. GERMAN MARKS, 1014-1023 A. W. MEDLAR There are at least two kinds of German marks and probably three classes should be considered. There was the gold mark which ac - cording to the World Almanac, had practically the same value in terms of the dollar throughout the 9 year period under consideration. It was worth 23.8 cents when Germany entered the war and it was worth 23.82 cents when Germany stabilized her currency in 1923. It had an exchange value of 4.2 marks to the dollar. Then there was the paper mark issued by the Reichsbauk. At the beginning of the war it had an exchange value of 4.2 marks to the dollar, the same as the gold mark had. In 1923 when Germany finally stabilized her cur - rency, it hud an exchange value of 4,200,000,000,000 marks to the dollar. Finally there was the token mark either metallic or paper issued by Chambers of Commerce, industrial corporations, individual business men, and municipalities. This mark was never intended for exchange but was used in limited areas and in reality had only assumed value. The gold mark was based upon its intrinsic value and had the same value anywhere any time. The Reichsbank paper mark fluctuated throughout the period in accordance with the ability of the German people to redeem the paper money in gold and with the confidence of the German people and of the rest of the world in the integrity of the German government. The token mark issued by various authorities fluctuated in assumed value from the value of a Reichsbank mark to zero. As the amount of these marks increased, their assumed value </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE decreased until at the reorganization of the monetary system the whole amount printed had practically no value. These token marks rep - resented an assumed wealth of $107 quintillion, mostly held by citizens of Germany. They had exchanged labor, goods, property, and securi - ties for these marks and were left with the valueless marks in their possession to show that unless money is the carrier of value or is di - rectly backed by standard money it has no value. The, German people entered the war with a sound monetary policy; one in which token money and paper money were freely accepted both by her own people and thru foreign exchanges. The Reichsbank, which had legal control of both currency and credit, stood high in the confidence of practically every nation. During the early years of the war the German nation managed its internal affairs on one basis and its foreign affairs on another basis. Their people, the same as any other people during war, were educated to do what seemed best to the directors of the national destiny. If they were asked tn give up their gold to the nation, to give their raw materials at pegged prices, to surrender their bronze, copper, and bismuth, to accept token money — both hard money and paper money — they did it for their country. They did not inquire why heavy taxes were not laid, why wage earners enjoyed luxuries, or why no one objected to the amassing of fabulous fortunes. They were ignorant of conditions outside their own country and fully believed that their ruler and his helpers would bring their national troubles to a favorable close. The history of what the controllers of German money and credit did will give the causes of the fluctuating value of the paper mark. The following steps tell in a brief way what was done by the directors of the Reichsbank who had sole authority to issue money and extend credit either by their own acts or by granting this power to others. 1. At the beginning of the war the obligation of the Reichsbank to redeem its notes in gold was suspended. 2. Treasury bills and bonds of the Reichsbank, of not over 3 months from maturity, were admitted as part of the cover for its notes (money). 3. Note tax was abolished. 4. Darlenknskassen or Loan Offices were created to aid in the issuing of money and in extending credits. (a) They issued token money against goods, securities and other valuables pledged as redemption for the token money. (b) Token money was admitted as a part of the cash to cover Reichsbank bonds. 5. Gold was concentrated in the vaults of the Reichsbank (1914, </seg>

(b) Citizens were educated to turn gold to Bank by training in the schools, preaching in the church, and addresses in the civic centers. 6. September 28, 1914. All contracts payable in actual gold were declared invalid. Soon the government fixed prices on foods, fodder, and raw war materials, yet prices and wages did not advance. 7. In November of the same year punishment was decreed against all premium dealing in German gold coin. 8. Export of gold was forbidden, use of gold in industry was restricted and purchase of gold objects was prohibited during the period from 1914 to 1917. 9. On account of the withdrawal of the circulating money in - dividuals and corporations were unable to meet their obligations. They demanded a moratorium on their debts but were refused by the directors of the Reichsbank. Later their demand was partially met and at the close of the war and afterward the privilege was greatly abused both by individuals and corporations. 10. Practically none of the German cost of war was met by taxa - tion (England 20%. Germany 6%). Evidently Germany anticipated ;the enemies would pay the enormous cost of the war. 11. Note circulation increased from a' normal of 2 milliards or billion to 4 milliards marks by the first of 1914; at the close of 1914 it was 7.2 milliards; 1915, 9.7 milliards; 1916, 12.9 milliards; 1917 19.5; and in 1918, 28.4 milliards marks (17. Reichsbank notes, 9.6 Loan Office notes). Per capita circulation rose from 100 to 430 marks. 12. The debt of the Reichsbank at the end of war was 48 5 milliard marks (48.5 billion marks). 13. In 1916 when the deficit in the Ordinary Budget had reached 500 million marks a tax was laid on tobacco, way bills, and turnovers greatly to the displeasure of the consumer and industry. 14. While internal affairs were gradually growing worse Germany maintained her standing in the foreign exchange by sale of gold marks which were not delivered, mainly to Holland, Sweden, and Switzerland and by the pledging of foreign securities obtained from her own citizens. 15. Supplementary emergency currency, Notgeld, was issued by </seg>

No authority knows the amount of these promises to pay, but it was estimated at 20 billion marks in 1922, and in 1923 at between 400 and 500 quintillions marks. 16. One hundred thirty-three printing offices, 1.783 machines, over 30 paper factories, and 50 thousand people were working exclu - sively for the Reichsbank to print and deliver money. 17. .Break down of German government, November 9, 1918. 18. Tax revision, readjustment of government debt and payments and finally complete failure to pay debts. 19. Government gold given to Sweden, Holland and Switzerland for food and for her own citizens. Private gold seized by France. 20. Notgeld paper and token money valueless. 21. August 25, 1923. Reichsbank declared itself ready to adopt a stable currency. H. Schscht placed in charge with full responsibility for its success or failure. (a) Benten marks issued theoretically equal to gold mark. Exchanged for paper marks and an entirely new system of cur - rency established. (b) No Notgeld received in exchange for Renten marks. Therefore, emergency money lost all value. (c) Transfer to Renton marks to foreigners was forbidden November 16, 1923. (d) Speculation in the mark was killed and the paper mark was stabilized at 4.2 trillion to the dollar. 22.

References: Money Helfferick, Infield, Gregory. The Stabilization of the Mark. Schacht. THE STABILIZED DOLLAR KARL M. ARNDT We are always trying to achieve the nearly impossible. But the fact that some of our objectives are almost too distant to reach does not diminish the enthusiasm with which we work toward them or destroy the usefulness of our efforts. To abolish ignorance, poverty and illness may be more than we can accomplish, but we try never - theless for even the slightest progress .3 a great victory when won against these social enemies. It is therefore unwise to dismiss with the word "impossibility" those comparatively lesser proposals for the stabilization of the value of money. Though we have been unsuccess - ful in the past, and may not have the present power to perform so great a task, we realize that any success in keeping money's value stable is great success. ' What are we to understand by the value of money? What do we mean by "value" when we speak of the dollar? A money has two rather independent values. The former and more fundamental of the two, the "real" value, often called the internal or domestic value, is the purchasing power of a unit of money over commodities and services,--over wheat, gasoline, the integrity of politicians, and every - thing else offered for sale. Expressed or reflected in the level of prices, in rises when the average of prices falls, it falls when the av - erage of prices climbs upward. One can not Beriously question the desireability of reducing to a minimum fluctuations in the buying power of the medium of exchange. Everybody is affected by changes in the general price level. Debtors, creditors, business men, work - men, and consumers generally gain or lose as prices rise and fall, but, in general, the losses far outweigh the gains. Though many ad - vocate an immediate inflation of prices to clear away some of the wreckage produced by the fall since 1929, the proper objective of long - range monetary policy is stability. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The other value of money, sometimes called its external or foreign value, is its command over the moneys of other countries, as expressed in the rates of foreign exchange. Though stability in this second value Is of importance, especially to importers, exporters and the so - called international financiers, it means less to most of us than a stable price level, and will be dropped from this discussion. It must be emphasized that the amount of gold in a money unit, or the amount of gold for which a money can be exchanged, tells of itself nothing about the commodity purchasing power, or true value of that money, though it may serve as a basis for setting the rate at which it exchanges for other moneys. Value means command over goods in general, not over gold alone. To stabilize the value of money a nation must stabilize prices: it must rule the price level. What a vast and insurgent kingdom that is! The daily business of the United States is conducted at millions of different prices, each subject to a combination of influences peculiar to itself. Most obey to some degree the law of supply and demand; many are controlled for long periods by contracts; some are ruled by custom; others are regulated by monopolists; a few, in - creasing,in number, are under the discipline of law. The majority of prices arte gypsies by nature, wandering, often aimlessly, . from point to point. To the extent that any one price is influenced by supply and demand it is subject to frequent change. There is practically no trans - action in business that does not affect, and stir into movement, one or more prices. Nor do prices always travel together. Though there is a well established tendency for all prices to follow a trend, upward or downward, large groups of prices often stubbornly resist the will of the majority, and move in the opposite direction. Farm prices especially show their independence in this way. Can any workable method be developed to bring this compex of prices under one management? Yes — a nearly perfect one. We need merely relinquish the few remnants of capitalism that remain in this country, place the government in uncontested control of both produc - tion and consumption, and prices, individually and collectively, can then be set by Federal decree. Or by Professor Tugwell. But should we continue to cherish the scattered vestiges of our old individualism we most tolerate a rather free and active price structure. A price system under government dictation implies a business system that is the slave of the state. Can anything be done, however, to restrict price level anarchy without abandoning all of our present economic institutions? Some economists think so; in particular, Professor Warren who, following the ideas of Professor Fisher of Yale, has been championing a simple </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION plan to achieve price stability through changes in the gold content of the dollar. This scheme seems to have the support of the federal gov - ernment, and for that reason, if for no other, deserves examination. What does Professor Warren propose? Brieflly, his stabilization plan would leave our existing money system in most respects as it is. The familiar — to some people — coins and paper currencies would con - tinue to circulate; most payments would be made as now with checks on banks. Gold coins would not be in evidence. All money units, of whatever kind, would be legally redeemable in variable weights of gold, the amount of gold being changed at regular intervals in ac - cordance with the movements of the general price level. Every month, if such should be the interval between changes, the special commission in control would decrease the amount of gold for which each dollar could be redeemed if prices had been falling, or would Increase the amount if the price trend had been upward. In other words, it would increase the price of gold with lower prices, and lower the price of gold as the price level ascended. To prevent speculation in gold, as well as to protect gold banking reserves from runs by the public, the actual exchange of money for gold, or the purchase of gold, would probably be restricted to such large sums of the metal that most people could not exercise their rights to redeem money. Gold would move only in international payments. The purpose of such changes in the price of gold (under the con - ventional gold standard the price remains stable) would be to counter - act the general price movements already under way. Absolute rigidity of the price structure would not be provided by the plan— lt is gen - erally recognized that price stability must be relative— but it is be - lieved by Warren that any definite and continuing trend of prices away from a pre-existing level would be arrested before much damage had been done. But why should an increase in gold prices, following a slump in the general level, stimulate all prices to rise? Why should all prices fall because of a fall in the price of gold? Explanations are various, but some supporters of the scheme do not explain. They assert: "There is an economic law that all prices move with the price of gold. No more need be said," or, "Money is gold, gold is money. By virture of economic law, the less gold in the dollar, the less the dollar is worth, and the higher prices must be " Economic laws, however, are too frequently pure creations of those modern metaphysicians, the economists, who can on very short notice supply any number of laws to prove any contention. An economic proposal such as this must be more realistically supported; we must have described, step by step, the process by which altered gold prices can tame the price level.

            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Warren plan assumes correctly that a decrease in the gold content of the dollar will cheapen the dollar in terms of other moneys— that is will cause a rise in the rates of foreign exchange-and will thereb&gt; - elevate the prices of all goods bought or sold abroad.

            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS* ASSOCIATION sound theoretically. It does not look good even on paper. We can - not expect to harness the turbulent ocean of prices by changing the gold content of the dollar. In the first place, individual prices (and therefore the price level) are subject to numberless forces, big and small, that arise and operate outside the monetary system. These price influencing factors — usually summed up in the words "supply and demand" — can not be disciplined by the simple device of varying the weight of vaultburied gold dollars. In the second place, the expedient of altering the weight of gold money does not even give us effective control over the money side ot the problem. Though it permits us to manage for - eign exchange rates, it does not of itself make it possible to regulate either the volume of money or the speed of its circulation. In even those nations which are said to be on the gold standard, money and gold are largely different things. In the United States, from the point of view of the buying public, gold money is mere history. The media of exchange in actual use consist of about five and a half billions of subsidiary coins and paper currencies, and nearly forty billions of bank deposits. The gold stock, somewhat over four billions at face value, hidden in the Federal reserve banks and in the treasury, is not only withheld from circulation now, but will probably be guarded from the contaminating touch of the public in the future. What hap - pens therefore when the price of gold rises? The reserve banks and the treasury have more gold money — a little more, inactive and un - spendable. The farmer, the business man, the workmen are in pos - session of no more buying power than before, have no more effective demand for goods. Prices can be stimulated to rise only by an in - creased offering of money for goods. Is it possible to multiply the actual money of circulation on the basis of the expanded gold reserves produced by higher gold prices? Yes. By an increase in debt. The cherished dollars in our pockets and our bank accounts are almost all evidences of debt, of hank and Federal liabilities. Bank notes and bank deposits, the most important in the matter of volume, can be increased by the simple plan of hav - ing the banks go further into debt-^though, in all fairness, it should be added that banks supply us with more notes and deposits mainly through loans, and an increase in bank money implies an increase in the borrowing of business. We can, in other words, have all the bank money we want — merely by borrowing it. It is all very easy. What Professor Warren's plan needs, therefore, to function as intended, is a reliable method for the control of bank credit — for the regulation of the creation and retirement of bank deposits through loans and the repayment of loans. In addition, the rubber dollar would work better if we could easily influence business profits, which </seg>
            <seg id="p138">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE so effectively control the demands of business men for bank loans. In Professor Warren's reasoning, the cart must precede the horse. The heart of the matter is this: If we ever develop the ability to manage the volume — and the activity — of bank credit money, we shall haye no imperative need of experiments with the price of gold; but until we discover the secrets of credit control our tampering with gold reserves by changes in the weight of the gold dollar will produce none of that price level stability we so much desire. But our intention remains noble. We wish for and we should have a stable money, though we must not delude ourselves into the convic - tion that all economic problems can thereby be solved. We must ex - periment to learn how to stabilize, but we should be careful to at - tempt only those experiments which are approved by realistic argu - ment. If, gullible and rash, we accept any scheme offered, we may lose faith not only in economists, but in the government as well. ARE IMPROVED FARM PRACTICES AND THE ADJUSTKI) PRODUCTION PROGRAM CON Flit CTING AND CONTRADICTORY? D. L. GROSS In recent months we have repeatedly heard the statement that col - leges of agriculture, experiment stations, and agricultural extension workers have been for years recommending practices which would increase production, and that now, with the wheat allotment plan, and the corn-hog program, they are making an about face arid are urging reduced production. Very intelligent people have made such remarks. Even some of our brilliant editorial writers in the daily papers have played with this idea and have at time given it no little space. They seem to have arrived at the conclusion that here is a great inconsistency and that something should be done about it. The difficulty with all of us at times is that we assume a false pre - mise, and from that point reason ourselves into a false conclusion. It is time for us to consider an important question of this kind and to give it analysis. All of us want to think straight. We like to tackle a problem and reason it thru to its proper conclusion. We' cannot do this when we assume many things to be true which are not true. The remark that agricultural colleges have in recent weeks made a com - plete about face in regard to production is entirely false. The state - ment that agricultural colleges in former years have been promoting greater production is likewise false. The program of agricultural re - search and teaching is the same today as it was in past — greater effi - ciency in unit production, but not greater total production. Improved </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION - crop varieties, well planned rotations, proper methods, and time of seed bed preparation, a greater control of disease and insect pests a greater yield of products from our livestock for the feed consumed soil erosion control, more efficient use of machinery, and a healthier happier farm life— these are the aims and the purposes of agricultural extension work. They are more important now than they have been in the past. With low prices for our farm products, the need for still greater efficiency in production is apparent. Higher yields per acre more efficient use of feed by our livestock, these are the avenues farmers must take if production costs are to be held sufficiently low that a profit may be realized when the goods are sold on the market. Is not this a program that we should foster, especially in times such as the present? Is this not a program that deserves extension into the future? Are we not proud of the fact that American farmers are the most efficient in the world? Do we not want to see that efficiency increase as time goes by? If that efficiency has resulted in such an abundance of our agricultural products that the farmers cannot receive a profitable price for them, should we therefore set out to destroy that efficiency? Should we not. on the other hand, ever __I?£s wv, TT* that efflclenc - v an &lt;* then should surplusses re - sult, attack that problem in a sane and practical manner?

            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The program of acreage reduction embodied in the Agricultural Adjustment Act is designed to reduce the size of the agricultural plant to that point where production and demand are correlated in such a way that the producer can operate at a profit. It is contended that this program interferes with nature and that it is sinful to reduce production while people are starving and in need. The question might be asked, why are these people starving now when we have a greater abundance than in all history? A continuance of our present production or even a greater production would not alleviate this suffering. If a bushel of wheat sold for a penny, the cost of a loaf of bread to the city dweller would be but little less than at pres - ent. If the farmer were to turn his livestock to the packer for noth - ing, the hungry could not buy a meal. Processing, handling, and transportation costs are the big factors in the cost of living. Rather, it might be said, that it is sinful for us as a nation to pro - duce an over abundance and thus violate nature by draining the fertility of our fields to no purpose. We should, on the other hand, conserve that fertility, use it as our needs demand it, and leave to posterity that which rightfully belongs to it. We should therefor give thought to an orderly use of our land, the limitation of tilled acres, the conservation of soil fertility, proper tillage methods, the use of adapted crop varieties, the feeding and breeding of livestock to the end of greater efficiency in the use of our soil products, and with it all, a market that will return to the grower a just reward for his labor and his management. The development of such a program will mean a prosperous and en - lightened agriculture. When agriculture prospers the bread lines vanish. When farmers can buy, factories are active, and labor is employed. Our program for agriculture should therefore be one that promotes increasing efficiency, yet at the same time involves a plan for acreage control, thus balancing the supply of products to a profitable demand A striving for greater efficiency is a part of our nature. A laxity in this respect is a violation of nature. We cannot allow disease and insects to destroy the fruits of our toil. We cannot condone the use of poorly adapted crops or careless practices. We must use those crops or that type of livestock which will make the best use of our natural resources. We must so till our soil that it will give us the greatest return for our labor, yet in a manner that will preserve it for future use. We cannot do otherwise and preserve our self respect or justify the part we are playing in history. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS* ASSOCIATION OUR WEED PROBLEM — CONTROL MEASURES F. D. KEIM As I talk this weed problem over with farmers, bankers, and others who are interested, and answer correspondence pertaining to the con - trol of weeds, I am inclined to believe as the little school boy did. The teacher says, "Now, Tommy, what is one-fifth of three-sixteenths?" Tommy replied, "I don't exactly know, teacher, but it isn't enough to worry about." So many times the farmer or the land owner sees a small circular patch of weeds in his field and he, like Tommy, says, "I don't know exactly what it is, but it isn't enough to worry about." This circular patch of weeds may be bindweed or little white morn - ing glory, leafy spurge, perennial peppergrass, perennial smart weed, perennial ragweed, dog bane, or horse nettle. Any of the above are easily controlled if caught when patches are small and the plants not well established. If these perennial weeds are let go until they spread over the land they present a far more serious problem than placing a 50 per cent mortgage on the farm. Not only will they re - duce the yielding capacity of the land by half but it will cost from ten to forty dollars per acre to get rid of them. Not long ago a young man came in to see me with discouragement stamped all over his face. He said, "As you know, I have been fighting those bindweeds on our farm for a number of years. I have tried hogs, summer fallow, alfalfa and the chlorates. Most any of these remedies work in part but the job is so great, that I cannot see my way clear to finance this eradication program with farm prices where they are." This young man has my sympathy. Not only is his farm almost completely covered with this bindweed pest but all the farms surrounding him are infested. If he summer fallows twenty acres for two growing seasons and finally gets rid of the weed on this field, the straw which he uses for bedding and feed, the manure, wagon wheels, farm animals, threshing machines, birds, and other agencies carry the' bindweed seed back on this clean field and in a few years the fallowing process must be repeated. Is it any wonder that this young farmer was discouraged? A weed control program, therefore, Is not an in - dividual problem but requires the cooperation of a community. I was writing this paper when N. F. Peterson came in with a large Kockia tumble weed. He had picked it up out of the ditch north of the buildings. In this tumbling weed were a number of pods of the bindweed, some of them were still Intact but others had shattered as the weed tumbled along over the ground. -~, In California Extension Circular No. 54, I find this statement^- - "There are four groups of agricultural pests: namely, (1) animal diseases, (2) plant diseases, (3) insects, rodents, and predatory </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE animals, and (4) weeds. A recent report by the Agricultural Service Department Committee of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the annual losses from weeds considerably exceed the com - bined losses of the other three groups." In this same bulletin. I find that the minimum annual estimated loss caused by weeds in California was sixty million dollars. Indiana estimated in 1920 that its average annual loss through weeds was $210.00 per farm; Wisconsin's esti - mate in 1927 was about $244.00 per farm. &amp;'_&amp; ■■-- -V 3L|--. tt^ AZ_Z / „•_, f___t__tf_4__ _r^m_9 81-_r__-_ Br _____i^_s*^_-_h_J_-_-_-_-__f____l__f _r» febj^g - V___*~-M B Ir m mf^t^k W_H *^__ Fig. 2 -We should know more about weed uleniilication ami control.

I mention these facts not to scare anyone, but merely to impress upon us a truth which I doubt if many of us realize, and that is, the real burden weeds add to human existance. In discussing means and methods of control, five things stand out as light houses on a rocky shore line. 1. Be able to identify these bad weeds, especially the perennials from the start. 2. Sow only weed free seed. 3. Guard against straw for bedding and feed that contains bad weed seeds. 4. Clean cultivation. 5. The use of chemicals such as sodium chlorate. Any good doctor who is interested in humanity rather than mone - tary gain, will tell us that prevention of disease is much better and </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION safer than the cure. The same practice holds with weeds. A few years ago, I noticed a small patch of quack grass under a small cherry tree in my garden. The fact that I knew what it was, and that the patch was only 6 feet square, was of great importance to me in eradicating the pest. As it was, we had a real battle, but with the aid of a hoe and the tile spade and a few minutes each week, the quack grass was eradicated in something less than two growing seasons. A few weeks ago, I received two samples of oats, in one of them I found 8 bindweed seeds per ounce and in the other which was labeled feed oats, I found that at least half of the grains were the true wild oats. We all can imagine the seriousness of planting one of these samples on clean, weed free land, or the danger in feeding them to livestock. During this next spring and fall much seeding will be done on fields that will be taken out of production. One of the greatest time and money saving suggestions that I can leave with you is this — be absolutely sure that these seeds are free from bad weed seeds. Sudan, cane, wheat, oats, barley, and rye are about the same size as bindweed, wild rose, perennial smart weed. These grains and forage crops just mentioned are likely to contain these weed pests. Alfalfa, sweet clover, timothy and redtop are likely to contain Canada thistle, dodder and the plantains. It is not so uncommon to even find bind - weed seed in alfalfa. To have these seeds tested by the state seed analyst is the safest method of precedure. The third precaution, the one in regard to straw and manure con - taining bad weed seeds is one that we have given some special atten - tion this past season. Mr. George Harmon, one of our graduate stu - dents buried eleven different kinds of seed in horse manure, cow manure and straw. The eleven seeds used were velvet weed, bind - weed, perennial pepper grass, sweet clover, annual smart weed, horse nettle, wild rose, cocklebur, puncture vine, foxtail and smooth dock. After one month only the velvet weed, bindweed, peppergrass, and sweet clover seeds remained viable in the horse and cow manure piles. The bindweed and sweet clover germinated after two months, while only one bindweed seed germinated after three months. Most of the seeds were decomposed by fungi -or chemical action. The seeds in the straw pile retained a normal germination after seven months. We have every reason to believe that as long as the straw remained dry and in good condition these seeds would remain viable as long as the average straw pile stands. Seven of the eleven seeds named above were fed to calves, horses, sheep, hogs, and chickens. Mr. Harmon's results show that, from all the seeds fed, an average of 23.1 per cent was recovered from the calves, 12.9 per cent from the horses, 10.7 per cent from the sheep, 24.1 per cent from the hogs, and 0.3 per cent from the chickens. The average percentage of viable seeds of each species passed by all animals is as follows: velvet weed 6.G per cent, </seg>

Grains containing bad weed seeds should be ground and manure left to stand long enough until all weed seeds are discomposed. The fourth method, namely — clean cultivation should be divided Into two divisions. A clean weed free seed bed nearly always in - volves rather extensive preparation of the land before seeding. In the first place it is important to keep weeds from going to seed. If they have gone to seed it is necessary that the land be plowed, disked and harrowed and conditions made favorable so that these seeds will germinate. After land is infested with weed seed this germination and killing process is about the only way to get rid of them. The flax and soy bean grower who plant these crops broadcast or with the drill have had to learn this practice. He has found that if he plants soybeans or flax or even oats or barley, on weedy land that his chances of harvesting a good clean high yielding crop are almost nil. The grain sorghum grower, first disks and then lists the land. When the ground in the furrow has warmed up he throws out these furrows again and plants the sorghum seed in the warm weed free soil. A« a boy, we all had riding cultivators but one of the requirements that my father laid down was that we pull all weeds that we were not able to plow out. He said, "Remember the horses need rest, you fellows need waking up so you don't plow out the corn and none of these weeds must go to seed." As a result we had few weeds to pull except along the ends of the field. What a different picture we have now with our 4-row tractor cultivators. After bindweeds and other bad perennials have become established and cover patches of two acres or more clean summer fallow is recom - mended. Two seasons of clean cultivation whereby the land is culti - vated every week or ten days will usually eradicate these pests. Culti - vation can best be accomplished by the use of over-lapping duckfoot shovels on a cultivator or by the use of special machines equipped with such shovels. Cultivation methods do not involve a large outlay of cash and have the additional advantage of sprouting and killing many of the bind - weed seeds which may remain alive in the soil for some years. Furthermore, clean cultivation or fallow tends to store up soil moisture which frequently results in larger crop yields in later seasons. Where labor on the farm is available it may be practical to cultivate small areas. Whenever the cultivation method is chosen as a means of eradication it is very important that a definite time be set aside each week or every ten days to do the job. If complete killing is desired it </seg>

Cultivating the forepart of the growing season and then seeding to cane or sudan, the latter part may work with a few less pernicious perennials but I do not think that this cover crop system is practical to use with the bindweed. Alfalfa and cane may hold the bindweed in check but these crops are not likely to smother out this weed pest. The use of sodium chlorate or commercial weed killer products, the basis of which is sodium chlorate is to be recommended for small areas in fields and along roadsides. The limiting factor in the use of sodium chlorate is the cost which amounts to from $35.00 to as high as $60.00 per acre. It is felt that chemical methods of eradicating bindweeds from fields are practical only where the total infestation is limited to a small acreage. Certain individuals may be in financial condition to chemically treat larger areas. Chlorates are especially recommended for use along roadsides, and fence lines where the operation of tillage machinery is not feasible. The sodium chlorates may be applied more evenly in a water solution by means of spraying equipment although small areas may be treated by broadcasting or drilling the sodium chlorate over the area in dry form. The College of Agriculture recommends a minimum application ot 3 pounds of sodium chlorate per square rod applied either in solu- - tion or dry, in the fall in late September or during October, although it may be applied at any time after mid-summer. One or more follow - up treatments are commonly required to complete the extermination. </seg>

Effect on the Land — It can be definitely stated that chlorate has a temperoraily harmful effect on the soil. It is very likely that most conditions, crops on land treated the year previous will not amount to much. It seems reasonably safe to say that most crops on treated areas will not do well for from six to twelve months after treatment. Sweet clover seems to be one of the most chlorate tolerant crops for treated areas. Cane and Sudan grass also show considerable tolerance to chlorate. Thc fire hazard warning is always in order as to the serious fire danger involved in the use of sodium chlorate solution and great care should be taken and warning given to users in regard to this danger and to instruct them as to its proper application and necessary pre - cautions. In closing let me briefly summarize these 5 weed control measures. (1) Be able to identify. (2) Sow only weed free seed. Ci) Guard against straw for bedding and feed, that contains bad weed seeds. (4) Clean cultivation including both clean preparation of land for seeding and continuous cultivation to starve out bad perennials. (5) The use of chemicals such as sodium chlorate, and (G) if I might add one more, just for good measure, a careful system of planned rotations. </seg>

GOOD, Attorney General I appreciate the privilege of being called upon to speak to this group of people who are really in the actual field of working on these things. A lawyer who sits back in his office is apt to become too theoretical. I fear that is almost true of the legislators. Any - thing I say I don't want to be unduly critical, or anything of that sort but after hearing Dr. Keim's talk on weed control, I am wondering if the legislature could not have done a better job of passing the law regarding the control of weeds. I did not have anything to do with the passage of the law, it never came into my hands until it had been approved by the gover - nor and become a law, and in what I say I am speaking rather at large about it because I am not a practical man in connection with farming of any sort. I was brought up in a small town, both my parents came from farmers. I have not spent very much time on the farm, and do not know the practical workings of those measures. I think the weed law has a very great value, even though the leg - islation is not ideal. I think it fine that the legislature has started to tackle the problem of controlling weeds and started on bindweed If there are any Improvements to be made, you gentlemen here can tell your legislators, and I hope Dr. Keim and other people connected with the agricultural college here will also advise with members of the legislature, and if it seems advisable, get this bill amended and get it fixed into form where it is more practical. I have in my file some practical suggestions made about it that I hope Dr. Keim will be able to answer. The bill was introduced by Mr Overbe-k of Gage county, known as House Roll No. 74, known as </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION chapter 2 of the 1933 session laws. This bill is not very long, and I can read most of it, I think, to you. The general idea of it is to place the burden on each landowner of getting the bindweed eradi - cated as rapidly as possible and as rapidly as economic, circumstances will permit. The question has been raised by some people in some of the courts as to whether it is constitutional. I don't think there is much ques - tion about that. The courts have always held that where it affects the economic life of the state, the legislature has the power to compel the land owner to cease to harbor on his premises, whether it be an animal or weed, that which is a danger to his neighbor, and which may cause damage to his neighbors; and the king pin is the portion which requires the land owner himself to undertake the eradication. I think it fair and just that he should take care of his own property in order to protect his neighbor. That is the only reason why the legislature could enter upon it. It places the burden upon all public officials when it says: It shall be the duty of the Department of Public Works, which has con - trol of the state highways, the county board, township boards, the road overseers, the county highway commissioners or authorized agents to destroy all field bindweed along the highway or right-of way in their respective jurisdictions. This seems to be without quali - fication, it must be done immediately, and these various bodies should have been getting to work last summer, but I don't know whether they have done it. This act was approved last April, but it didn't carry the emergency so didn't become effective until August 12. We will hope all these public officials who have control of any pieces of land will immediately get to work. That phase of it raises some difficulties. In one county, it was established that it would cost for the elimination by the chlorate method that Dr. Keim has explained, approximately $50,000 in that county alone, and eradicate all the bindweed in that county. That, of course, is an extreme case, in York county, which is the most widely infested county of the state. The county is up against it as taxes haven't been paid, there are extraordinary demands for poor relief, and some counties find it impossible to raise the money. If, after they have taken care of necessary county expense, such as law enforce - ment and operation of the county offices and poor relief and things of that sort, if counties don't have the money, the law will have to remain inoperative in such counties, because you have to apply a rule of rea - son to these difficulties, and if money isn't there, it isn't there. We would not want a county to run into, debt on current expenses. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE These things have to be applied practically. But insofar as their re - sources will permit, so far as the railways are concerned, and the state highway is concerned, there are funds available. So far as the people will permit, we hope the money will go for eradication. The criticism has been made by Mr. Gross of the agricultural col - lege that this is built around the method of having chlorate for bind - weed eradication. The expense is extremely high. The first section of the law says, "that the boards of county commissions or supervisors of the various counties in this state, are authorized and directed, when so requested in writing by fifty per cent of the resident landowners of any township or precinct in such county, to provide material and equip - ment for the eradication and control of field bindweed." That, of course, presupposes there will be additional material. It is built around the chlorate method of eradication. The second section says: "That every board of such county commissioners or supervisors shall pro - vide for the purchase and distribution of material and equipment for the eradication and control of field bindweed, and shall make and enforce rules and regulations for the distribution and use thereof, and shall distribute the ingredients of such materials or mixtures to the persons living in such counties who make application therefor. In purchasing and preparing the ingredients of such mixture or ma - terial, such county boards shall use and require the use of the formula prescribed and recommended by the University of Nebraska, College of Agriculture, or any formula that has proven practicable, and the methods of such application and purchases designated by said county boards shall be such as are proven or recommended by said College of Agriculture: Provided, that the county shall supply such material or mixture for such eradication or control of such bindweed at cost." Now, I don't know how many counties are carrying that out, but it certainly should make it easier and cheaper for farmers to use this method of control, even at that, if the expense runs as high as $35 to $40 per acre. I have skipped around reading this law, but the particular por - tion that applies to every farmer or every land owner reads: "Each landowner shall eradicate or cause to be eradicated all such bindweed on infested land, where the amount so infested is one acre or less on infested land owned by him in said County each year. And in addi - tion thereof, should said land owner have an amount of over one acre infested with bindweed, then said landowner shall eradicate or cause to be eradicated such bindweed, an amount equal to two per cent of all infested land owned by him in said county each year; Provided, that should any owner of bindweed-infested land fail to comply with the provisions of this Act within one year from the date this Act takes effect, the county board of such county shall enter upon </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION said land and eradicate the bindweed in an amount equal to two per cent of the infested area of said land each year at the expense of such landowner; and, provided further, that the county board shall each year eradicate an amount of not less than two per cent of the bind - weed on infested land in addition to that paid for wholly by the land - owners, and otherwise heretofore provided for; and, provided further, that treatment on areas in excess of two per cent of the land infested and shall be paid for out of the general fund of the county and one - third of the amount shall be charged to the property owner." That would mean, of course, that if you have only one acre in - fested, it is your duty, it is made mandatory for you to clean it up yourself without county aid and clean it up immediately. Immediately means as soon as practicable. They couldn't impose a penalty if you got to work immediately and were working reasonably rapidly toward eradication. Then if your land infested contains less than one acre, then two per cent of it has to be eradicated at your own expense. Then if the landowner has more than one acre infested with bind - weed, he shall eradicate or cause to be eradicated an amount equal to two per cent of all the infested land owned by him. If the landowner fails to comply with the law, the county board is to eradicate two per cent of the infested area each year at the expense of the landowner. In addition the county board shall eradi - cate not less than two per cent of bindweed on infested land in addi - tion to that paid by the landowner. Treated areas in excess of two per cent of the land infested shall be paid out of the general fund of the county, and one-third charged to you. The criticism of this feature of the law is that any pasture of bind - weed is apt to spread at least two per cent in any one year, with the result that if this were the limit, you would not keep up with the spread of the bindweeds. This feature of the act may be impracticable. I don't know about the operation of it. At any rate it would help keep it down, and make a start toward keeping it from, taking the entire state. I would think it were the moral duty of every land owner to clean up far more than is proposed by this legislation. This legislation is itself clear in the second section — built on the theory of the chlorate formula method or any formula which has proven practicable or cheaper to use. But it doesn't state that this has to be the method of eradication. I would take it that if any one was making a real attempt to control it, and was really going after it and keeping it down by the use of some other method that didn't use chemicals, if any one was making a real attempt and doing it conscientiously and seriously without any attempt to evade the law, I think it should be accepted by the county board as a substitute for the chemical </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE method. It is a matter which lies at the discretion of the county board. The law was enacted without any penalty. That feature, some one suggested, makes the law entirely Impractical. Of course, the county is required to go in and do the work for you if you don't do it your - self, and charge it to your land. It can't be collected as taxes. In the law there is nothing that says when the county has done the work and has cleaned up, the county is entitled to assess it against your land as taxes. That would have been a desirable thing to have put in the act. It would keep people public spirited and keep them in line, but the legislature did not see fit to put it in the law. If the county board goes in and cleans the bindweed up and you don't pay, all they can do is bring a civil suit against you and collect as any judgment would be collected at law. This is a rather awk - ward way of handling it. It defeats the object of the law, and the county might be unable to collect on account of homestead exemptions. It is a rather precarious way for the county to collect its money. I think that some improvements can be made upon this legislation. I think that among other things that they can make other methods of eradication or control be used instead of or in place of chlorate and chemical methods of exterminating the weeds. I think that in addition to that they should require a larger area be cleaned up than two per cent. I would like Dr. Keim to follow me and say what he thinks of the law. It sounds reasonable that the area is apt to increase more than two per cent, and we wouldn't be working very rapidly on the bindweed of the state if we are eradicating only two per cent. I don't know whether the methods of Dr. Keim would be work - able along highways. It is pointed out that that doesn't do a great deal of good unless the man living along the highways is eradicating also. In fact, it will get out on the highway again. It is useless ex - penditure of money on the part of the county, and railways, unless there is cooperation between the farmer and the highway control. I would suggest that the landowner start to eradicate along the highway and along the neighbor's land. Let him start from the out - side. After all, I assume that the greatest danger to any landowner is from the neighbor's land that immediately adjoins his. If you have a sufficiently wide patch of clear land that Is not infested, along your border, you aren't in much danger — your danger comes from the land that is right beside you. There should be a considerable amount of community cooperation because otherwise if everybody is working at cross purposes, if every- </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION body is developing a piece of land in one place and another one in another place, complete eradication is postponed indefinitely. I wish I knew the practical side of this so I could give you a clearer view of the law. I hope that the county boards will all of them carry out the provisions of the law in a fair and reasonable way. It is left in their control. Such suggestions as I have in my files will be carried to the next legislature and that legislature will see fit to fix the law up so that it has a more practical operation and application to conditions as they are in Nebraska. Discussion Following Mr. Good's Talk on the Weed Law. Question — Does this law apply only to bindweed? Mr. Good — It applies only to bindweed. It might be desirable to have other weeds included. Question — Does the law apply to small towns and cities? Mr. Good — It applies to any landowner. I think you are right, there is an additional place where they should require work to be done. I think that in small towns and cities, the town board should be re - quired to clean up the portion of the street where weeds grow up. . Question — Does not the law require us to keep the roadside clear of weeds? Mr. Good — It only requires you to mow your weeds. It does not require that they be eradicated. Question — How about Russian thistle? There used to be a law against it. Mr. Good — I am not sure about Russian thistle. I was under the impression that there was one directed against the Russian or Can - adian thistle. Mr. Keim — The Canadian is a bad perennial. It does not seed much in Nebraska. Russian thistle is an ordinary annual weed. I think there was once a law against the Russian thistle. Mr. Good — There was a small patch of Canadian thistle growing on the farm of Mr. Berggren east of town when I was a boy. They had a well going and pumped water on it and tried to drown it out. They thought that was the best way of killing Canadian thistle at that time. There was fear at that time that there would be a plague of that thistle throuout the state. In speaking of the sodium chlorate, why is it so expensive? Is it produced In Nebraska? Does it come from a natural resource — is there any possible way of making it a cheap product? </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. Keim — Chlorate is produced at Niagara Falls. The chemical firms that have it to sell tell us that they are selling it at the very lowest possible price. It is unfortunate that the chemical is so high. Question — Are there bulletins on eradication of weeds that we can get here? Mr. Keim — There is a small mimeographed circular put out by Mr. Stewart and Mr. Gross about eradication of bindweed. Question — Do you have good success in using Sodium Chlorate on bindweed where there's no moisture? Mr. Keim— lt seems as if the best time to kill the weeds is under medium moisture conditions. That is, where the moisture goes down rather slowly at intervals. If it comes down too fast, it soaks below the feeding part of the root of the plant. If you do not have any rain at all, of course the chlorate will not work. It has to get down to the roots to do the business. lam quite a believer in the dry treat - ment myself. I think practically all of our work shows it to be just as good. I was reading a new bulletin from lowa the other day which gave the same conclusion. Mr. Good — What do you think of 2 % as being adequate to really control the weed? Mr. Keim — I think it is probably inadequate. I think this weed law has stirred up a lot of interest though. If a man will choose 2 % along the highways, in places where it is not completely infested, it will do a lot of good. I would like to see the percentage raised. Mr. Good — I know how difficult it is to get the attention of leg - islators to do things really necessary. It is not the fault of the mem - bers of the legislature. They are being besieged by many different groups. It is difficult for them to understand and appreciate what is required. I think it better to have a larger area eradicated each year and I think it might be a good idea to apply some method of selection of that area, if it did not border on paternalism or bureaucracy to tell people what portion to kill. Question — I would like to know if there is any dry treatment in the western part of the state which has been successful. Mr. Stewart — I cannot say that we have found any difference be - tween the wet and dry treatment. As a matter of fact, in western Nebraska we have not had very good results with either one. In Scotts Bluff and Cheyenne counties we used both dry and wet and neither of our county agents out there are very enthusiastic about the effectiveness of chlorates in that part of the state. I do not know whether it is moisture or not that makes the difference. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS* ASSOCIATION Remark (from man from western Nebraska) — We have hud good results with the wet treatment. The worst feature is to get a ma - chine to do the spraying. We used a potato sprayer, but there were strips where it was not killed at all. , Mr. Keim — There is a possibility if you lack moisture that the wet method would be better. Mr. Gross — Were those treatments applied at the same time. Answer — No. Mr. Keim — You will find that one year's treatments kills bindweed 85 to 90 per cent and next year not so good, no matter how you put it on. It might be the moisture supply rather than the method of application. In Ames they thought the dry method was just as good as the wet. Mr. Stewart — There is a point to be made on supply of chlorates. We have had some correspondence during the year which pointed out that the Muscles Shoals project in the Mississippi Valley. would be able to produce chlorates very cheaply. I suppose it would take a political program to put that across. We do know that there has been some monopoly control of chlorates, but it might be possible that these individuals would have to reduce their price if there was a little competition. There might be some possibilities in the Tennessee Valley development. If we could get chlorate at 2 cents a pound it would be much better than 10 or 11 cents a pound. REPORT OF THE 1033 NEBRASKA CORN YIELD CONTEST P. H. STEWART and D. L. GROSS Because of the added work of the A. A. A. program, the 1933 Corn Yield Contest was not given the attention it has received in former years. Drouth in the central section resulted in near or complete failure of the corn crop for many contestants who had entered from that area. Seventy-seven growers completed for the state, distributed as follows: 45 in the eastern section, 2 in the central section, 20 in the western section, and 10 in the irrigation group. The boundaries for these sections were the same as in former years. All irrigated land, regardless of location, was placed in the irrigated region. The eastern Nebraska region is composed of that part of the state lying east of the west line of Knox county south to Merrick, thence along the Platte to the west side of Butler then south to the state line. The west lines of Keya Paha, Brown, Blaine, Custer, Gosper and Red Willow counties make up the western boundary of the central region. All counties west of the central region compose the western region. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Rules of the Contest. "Any person more than 18 years of age may enter a field of corn of ten or more acres on which he must submit a report giving rota - tion, cultural practices and labor data. Contestants are scored on the basis of 65 per cent for yield, 25 per cent for profit per acre, and 10 per cent for the quality of the product. Rent was charged on the share basis, this being arbitrarily set at 2/5 in the eastern and irrigated sections, and 1/3 in the central and western sections. Corn was valued at 35 cents for No. 1 corn with 14 per cent moisture. Man labor was valued at 151 per hour, and horse labor at 10 cents per hour, this to cover machinery depreciation. Husking was charged at 4 cents per bushel to cover labor, wagon, team and board. Tractors were figured on a scale ranging as follows: Two bottom plow tractors $0.90 per hour, 3 bottom plow tractors $1.20 per hour, and 4 bottom sizes $1.40 per hour. This also covers depreciation on the machinery which they pull. Except for a few fields which were obviously low in yield, 20 pound samples of ear corn were taken at husking time for shrinkage, shelling and moisture determinations. Yields were figured on shelled corn with 14 per cent moisture." , The Winners of the 1033 Contest. Eastern Section | Total Rank Name County Yield | Score „ i 1 W. W.

Hyde, Gothenburg Dawson The question is asked, "Why have a corn yield contest when we are in the midst of a program of reduced production?" The inference in this question is that high yields per acre are Incompatible with a program of reduction. Nothing cou'.d be further from the point. When an industry finds a curtailment in the demand for its products, it sets about to reduce the production of that product so as to bring </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS* ASSOCIATION the volume of its production and sales into conformity. It may re - duce the number of its plants in operation, or it may reduce the num - ber of those employed. In any case it does not reduce the efficiency of Its plants. To do so would soon bring bankruptcy. On the other hand, a study of industrial plants has shown that during this period of low income and unemployment they have actually increased their efficiency from the standpoint of labor and other costs. The pro - duction per man has actually increased. No one will question the soundness of this change. Had it not been made, these industries would be out of business, the volume of unemployment would be still greater, the cost of the product to the consumer would' be higher, and sales would be further curtailed. Agriculture is no different than industry in this respect. Con - sumers demand that food be delivered to them at the lowest possible cost. Science, research, and efficient agriculture are designed to meet this demand. A low cost per bushel of grain is most easily reached by high yields per acre. The reduction program is designed to bring the volume of agriculture production to a point where the demand will insure a reasonable profit to the producer. This is. to be accomplished, not by reducing yields but by reducing the number of units in production. The two programs, therefore, go hand in hand, the one designed to adapt production to demand, the other to reduce production costs. Low cost ot production will always be the aim of an enlightened people. Agricultural research has made remarkable strides toward this end. The corn yield contest, although designed primarily as an avenue for teaching the results of research, has in itself contributed much in the field of research. It has afforded a means by which those practices, most likely to result in high yields and therefore low bushel costs, have been revealed. Under average costs, the contest during the ten years it has been in use, has demonstrated that high yields are essential to low bushel costs. Farmers with high yields have produced corn for less than 10c per bushel while with below average yields the bushel costs have been as high as one dollar or more per bushel. Labor, power and machinery costs, not including husking, have been found to vary widely between individual farmers. In 1933 these costs varied from $5.42 to $1.17 per acre. The respective bushel cost in these two cases was 17c in one case and 9.6c in the other. The low cost per bushel in both these instances was because of high yields. In another instance the cost of production up to husking was but $2.31 per acre, yet the cost per bushel was 28c due to a lower yield. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is important to note therefore that although machinery and labor costs are important items in the cost of production of a bushel of corn, yield Is of much greater importance. The yield of corn cannot, of course, be influenced entirely by practices within the power of the grower to use. He may do all In his power to bring about a high yield, yet weather conditions may enter in and partially or entirely destroy his prospects. High yields, however, cannot be obtained no matter how favorable the weather unless soil fertility is maintained and good practices used. Low yields due to weather were in evidence in much of central Nebraska this year. Although many growers entered the contest from that section in 1933, but two completed. In many instances the yields In this area were five bushels or less per acre. Some fields produced no grain. Because the cost of a bushel of corn in any one year may be as low as 10c per bushel, one is not justified there - fore in considering this an actual cost. The costs of another year when drouth reduces yields must be added to this cost if actual year after year costs are to be arrived at. On an average yield and cost basis, corn was produced in Nebraska in 1933 for from 20c to 32c in the different sections. It must be borne in mind that costs in this case involved labor at but 15c per hour. Had this labor been charged at the rate of 50c per hour, the relative bushel cost would have come to from 33c to 41c. The trends in labor expended, types of machinery, and methods of production for the ten year period as shown in tables 2, 3 and 4 show a remarkable change. The hours of labor involved in pro - ducing an acre of corn up to husking have been reduced from a maxi - mum of 8.9 in 1924 to 4.4 in 1933 in eastern Nebraska. In western Nebraska the corresponding figures are 4.5 to 2.5. The use of mul - tiple row machinery has increased from 25% to S9%, in eastern Nebraska and from 75% to approximately 100% in western Nebraska. Listing has increased from 30% to well over 50% in eastern Nebraska, whereas in western Nebraska the increase has been from 73% to approximately 100%. While some decry the trend to the use of large machinery as a cause of our economic ills, it is quite unlikely that farmers as a whole will reverse this trend. Modern inventions which reduce the amount of physical labor necessary to provide our wants will in all probability continue to be regarded as a blessing rather than a cal - amity. Were we to return to the forked stick as our only imple - ment of tillage, we would indeed be in misery, compared to our present state. Each step in our improvement on the forked stick method of tillage has enabled each grower to produce more and thus throw others out of employment. Why begin at this stage in our </seg>

            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION THE LATEST IN HYBRID CORN j T. A. KIESSELBACH The year 19 33 has brought forth still greater confidence in the successful outcome of hybrid corn on the part of both the corn breeder and the corn grower. We find this feeling of assurance and the fulfillment of promise not only in this state but In many of the important corn states. Hybrid seed corn was produced commercially by representative farmers in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Min - nesota, Nebraska, and Ohio. Specialized seedsmen produced it ex - tensively in Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota. Experimental yield tests by the various Experiment Stations and in extensive outlying tests in cooperation with farmers would seem to fully justify such seed pro - duction and the growing interest therein. A 15 per cent increase from the better hybrids is a common experience. In private conver - sation it was predicted by one plant-breeding authority that within 10 years, one-half of the corn acreage in the corn belt would be planted to hybrid corn. It is entirely possible that this prediction may materialize for Nebraska. i What Is Hybrid Corn? Although ordinary varieties, as commonly grown, are hybrid in that their individual plants are more or less unlike in their inheri - tance and natural cross pollination among them is the rule, they are not included under the classification of Hybrid corn. This term has come to apply strictly to the crop resulting from the cross pollination of parents, at least one of which has been subjected to an intensive inbreeding program. Under this definition, interest centers about 4 kinds of corn hybrids: (I) The Single Cross between two inbred or self-fertilized lines, (2) The Double Cross between two single crosses, (3) The Three- Way Cross between a single cross and an In - bred line, and ( 4 ) The Line- Variety Cross or Top Cross which consists of an ordinary farmers' variety cross fertilized by an inbred line. While other hybrid combinations involving more inbred lines are possible, these four represent all that have much importance at present and without doubt include the most productive recombinations now available. As is coming to be rather generally understood, the inbred lines utilized in producing hybrid corn are developed by the specialized corn breeder, through successive self-fertilization or inbreeding of Individual plants for three or more generations by controlled methods. It has been found that only a relatively small percentage of the lines developed are particularly meritorious. For this reason an up-to-date breeding program begins with an initial production of a thousand or more lines. The advancing generations of these lines are con- </seg>
            <seg id="p164">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tinued annually from the most vigorous and least defective plants. This procedure represents what is known as selection within self - fertilized lines. Such selection is recognized as a very important phase of the work. It isolates some lines which have a relatively high concentration of favorable growth-factors which go to make excep - tionally high yield and desired plant characters when crossed with other unrelated corn. Maximum productivity results when lines are brought together which are so divergent in their heritable growth factors that their hybrid progeny possess a maximum number of favorable factors. Such constitution causes the plants of a good hy - brid to be superior to those of standard commercial varieties. The extensive development and testing of selted lines is very costly of time and labor and is for this reason left largely to state and fed - eral agricultural experiment stations. It is fortunate if an initial thousand lines will result in 20 really superior lines. After the lines have been produced and favorable hybrid combinations between them established through experimental tests, any one who wishes and is willing to go to the necessary additional trouble, may produce the hybrid seed for his own use or for sale to others. It is this hybrid seed that is planted in the farmers' commercial corn fields in sub - stitution for the ordinary open-pollinated varieties. Advantages of Hybrid Corn .Adaptation of Corn Hybrids Needless to say. we will consider only those hybrids which have been thoroughly tested and found superior and adapted to the con - ditions where they are to be grown. Any corn, whether a hybrid or a standard variety must have suitable vegetative characteristics for the particular soil and climatic conditions. It must not be too late or too early, too large or too. small. A corn plant does best when its requirements are in balance with the growth conditions that the environment has to offer. The loral suitability of any hybrid should therefore be ascertained through local tests before extensive replace - ment for other corn. Hybrids have also been found to vary from year to year, just as do varieties, in their adaptation to the seasonal climatic conditions. The seasons of a given locality may vary as much as the climate of different regions. It is therefore preferable to know the performance of any hybrid for two or more years before praising or condemning it. One cannot expect any one hybrid to be best suited to all condi - tions. However the best hybrids, if adapted, should prove materia ly superior to the best varieties as an average for a period of years. We must anticipate that in occasional years a choice hybrid may not fully live up to its reputation. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION It is not necessary that hybrid seed be produced in the state where it is to be planted provided its local adaptation be first established. Some hybrids obtained from Iowa and Illinois have proved about equal to the best Nebraska combinations when tested in this state. The Nebraska station is ever testing the most promising from other states in comparison with its own in a search for the best there is to be had. It has also been found that the inbred lines from other corn belt states may include some that are highly suitable for use in hybridization in this state. Their value can only be known through testing in hybrid combination. It may be concluded from tests scattered throughout the eastern half of Nebraska, that seed stocks are now available for producing hybrids suitable to all of the eastern third of the state and for the irrigated and subirrigated land of central Nebraska. The best hybrids of the corn belt tend to be somewhat earlier maturing than the standard varieties which they are replacing. This seemed especially apparent this last year when all corn ripened earlier than usual and the stalks dried out and became rather brittle at an early date. The earliest sorts are often at a special disadvantage under null circumstances from the standpoint of strength of stalk and lodge resistance. In spite of this condition, many of the hybrids included in Nebraska tests were superior to the varieties in their ability to stand up at the time of husking. It raises the question whether we should undertake to grow hybrids that are slightly early for our conditions or those which ties more nearly the entire growing period up to killing frost. You growers out in the state should be in a position to advise the Experiment Station regarding this and your help would be greatly appreciated. The inbred lines are now avail - able to produce almost any type of corn you may wish in the eastern half of the state. Yields from Corn Hybrids. So much progress has been made in the last two or 3 years in developing superior hybrids that it is only to he expected that more favorable combinations will be brought forth from time to time. But if we are satisfied with average increases of around 15 per cent in yield of grain per acre, it seems that we need not wait upon the future, for such increases are at hand. Practically all corn breeders throughout the country speak in terms of 15% increase over the best varieties. The prospects in Nebraska may be Illustrated by the results of a number of outlying tests which were in cooperation between the Extension Service, the Experiment Station, the local County Agent, and some local progressive farmers on whose land the tests were made. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Earlier detailed results may be found in recent issues of the Annual report of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Ass'n. The general results of 1933 confirm those of the past. 9 To indicate progress with hybrid corn elsewhere, data from Min - nesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana will be presented as summarized in a paperl read by the writer at the World's Grain Conference held in Canada in the summer of 1933. Uniform Nebraska Cooperative Tests in lf&gt;:?:5. A collection of 30 lots of corn including 24 double crossed hybrids and 6 standard varieties were tested on farms in 3 eastern Nebraska counties and at the Experiment station. Two additional hybrids from the Iowa Experiment Station and 8 varieties from Nebraska farmers were in - cluded in one or more of the tests. The data which are reported in Table 1 were secured by careful methods so that the yields would be reasonably correct and comparable. The seed was planted at a double rate and thinned to the desired stand. The test plats con - tained 3 rows, 20 hills long, and the yields were based on the middle rows. All tests were replicated 4 times on each farm. Samples were saved from each test for the determination of shelling percentage and moisture content. The yields are for shelled corn per acre, contain - ing 14 % moisture. In this comparison the actual yields are given as well as the per - centage that each sort yielded in relation to the Krug which is known as one of the best standard varieties in Eastern Nebraska. .1 1 Kiesselbach, 'T.

All the hybrids grown averaged 7.5 bushels or 15 per cent more grain than all the varieties. The 5 highest hybrids averaged 10.1 bushels or 20 per cent more than the 5 best varieties. This proved to be an exceptionally favorable year for the Roggenbach variety as it yielded 7 per cent more than the next best variety. Of the Nebraska hybrids included in this test. those regarded as most promising are Nebraska Nos. 362, 252, and 238. Of these, seed of only the Nebr. 23S is available for commercial plant - ing. The climatic conditions were not so favorable for this particular hybrid in 1933 as it surpassed Krug by only 5.7 bushels or 12 per cent. The previous year this Nebr. 238 gave the highest yield of any of the Nebraska hybrids, being 18 per cent higher than Krug. This makes a 2-year average superiority of 15 per cent for Nebraska. 238 over Krug. While Funk's 220 was the highest yielding of all. this hybrid was not previously available for testing and the one year's yield is all we have of this and a number of nearly equally high Nebraska hybrids. Nebraska Farmers' Tests with Peck-lot Samples. In the spring of 1933, peck samples of seed of a number of Nebraska hybrids were dis - tributed among farmers scattered over eastern Nebraska. The yields of these in comparison with the grower's own variety were determined for 41 farms. The data are summarized in Table 2. The Nebraska No. 238, which is the only one of these available in quantity for com - mercial planting, was tested on 6 farms, and averaged 19 per cent higher yield than the local variety.

Co - operative tests similar to those reported for 1933 in Table 1 have been conducted during 6 years from 1927 to 1933. The results are sum - marized in Table 3. All hybrids averaged 6.1 bushels or 10 per cent more grain than all the varieties. The 5 best hybrids averaged 11.4 bushels or 18 per cent more than the 5 best varieties. Hybrid Tests at the Nebraska Experiment Station in 1033. Of some 250 varieties and hybrids of various kinds grown at the Experiment station in 1933. the 30 highest yielding in comparison „ the 2 stand - ard varieties. Hogue and Krug, are reported in Table 4. The acre yields and the percentages of the Hogue yield are indicated. As an average the hybrids yielded 22 per cent more than the Hogue. This amounts to 11.6 bushels per acre superiority. Of these 30 hybrids, 20 were single crosses, 4 were double crosses and 6 were top-crosses. ' Minnesota Tests. Extensive outlying tests with farmers have been made in Minnesota during the last 3 years in co-operation between the College of Agriculture and farmers. Three double crosses have been under test in comparison with farmers' own varieties. The per - centage increases in yield of the hybrids over the open pollinated varieties as summarized for 7 different sections in the state by Hayes and Crim are shown in Table 5. The increases for all hybrids tested averaged 13, 24, and 8 per cent in 1930, 1931, and 1932, respectively, with 15 per cent increase as a 3-year average. The 3 double crosses include in the test differed sonfewhat in their degree of superiority in different sections. The Minnesota Station 1 has also had very favorable results with sweet corn hybrids.

As an average of 4 years, 1929-1932, 10 single crosses have averaged at least 25 per cent higher yield than the standard variety of 8-row Golden Bantam at canning time. They are also superior as to uniformity of ear and plant char - acters which are important in a canning crop. 'Doxtator, C. W. Early sweet corn hybrids. The Minnesota Seed Growers, Vol. 5, No. 6. I9J2. Iowa Tests. A very good opportunity is afforded in Iowa for com - paring the yield of hybrid corn with farmers' varieties in connection with the Iowa Corn yield test which has been held annually since 1926 by the Iowa Corn and Small Grain Growers association. That state is divided into 12 sections and the varieties and hybrids which are included in the test of any one section are ordinarily regarded as suit - able for that part of the state. Thus a large number of commercial and experimental hybrids and farmers' varieties have been brought together for comparison. The results for 7 years are shown in Table 6 as presented by Robinson and Bryan' who have been in charge of the tests. As an average for the 7 years, all hybrids have yielded 8.8 per cent more than all open pollinated varieties. This is a very good show - ing for hybrids since some of them yielded far in excess of the aver - age. Some of the experimental hybrids developed in Iowa are ex - ceedingly high in yield and are highly suitable for Eastern Nebraska conditions. 'Robinson, J. L. and A. A. Bryan. Iowa Corn Yield Test. 1932. Illinois Tests. Dr. J. R. Holbert, working at Bloomington, Illinois, has supplied the data of Table 7 to illustrate the possibilities of select - ing selfed lines for resistance to the ear rot disease, Diploidia. The corn crop of 1932 was permitted to stand in the field until January under .conditions of high precipitation. This enabled the ear-rots to develop severely after the crop had reached maturity. The ears har - vested were then classified according to their soundness. Striking differences in resistance to the ear-rot organism is evident. The superiority of some hybrids as to yield is pronounced. One group of hybrids which had had both yield and ear-rot, resistance emphasized in their development, surpassed the average yield of 7 well selected varieties by 22 per cent. Indiana Tests. The comparative performance of several kinds of hybrids from various sources and standard commercial varieties has been reported for 1932 from the Indiana Agricultural Experiment Station by Trost' as in Table 8. The best group of 30 hybrids av- </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION eraged IS. 7 bushels or 27 per cent more than 10 open pollinated varieties. It is pointed out that some of the high yielding hybrids were essentially free from ear rots. What is the Most Practical Form of Commercial Hybrid? While superior single crosses occur more frequently in the Ne - braska Station test3, they are not regarded as so suitable for com - mercial production as are double crosses involving either 3 or 4 inbred lines. The chief difficulty with them is that the seed is borne on relatively unproductive inbred lines and this adds greatly to the seed cost. Inbred lines commonly yield only about 30 to 40 per cent as much as their hybrids. In case of some lines, the kernels are so small that the single cross plants are at a disadvantage in the seedling stage becattse of deficient food reserve stored within them. This does not hold true for all single crosses. Fortunately an extensive corn breeding program uncovers some double crosses which closely approach the best single crosses in pro - ductivity and have the advantage of less costly and full size seed. The seed is necessarily less costly to produce because it is borne on single cross plants instead of on inbred lines. A double cross developed by mating two single crosses is prob - ably more practical than the 3-way cross, seed of which is produced by pollinating a single cross by a selfed line. In the drier regions of the corn belt, pollen is sometimes deficient to fertilize the detasseled plants in the natural crossing seed field if an inbred is used as the pollen parent. The 3-way hybrid is likely to be more uniform and high yielding combinations of this type are more easily found. 'Trost. J. F. Comparisons of hybrids with native strains of corn for resistance and yielding ability. Indiana Corn Growers' Assn. Annual Report 33:24-28. 1933. Yet it should be borne in mind that an extensive breeding program may be expected to develop plenty of thoroly satisfactory 4-line double crosses. Sufficient tests have been made of top-crosses to indicate that the best of them have possibilities far superior to the usual open pollin - ated varieties. On the other hand their constitution is such that they cannot be expected to equal the best double crosses. This is due to the miscellaneous character of the plants in the open pollinated variety which is used as one parent of the top-cross. \ In the case of sweet corn grown for commercial canning, uni - formity of ear character and time of reaching the canning stage of development is very important. Since single crosses are the most uniform of any kind of combination, their use would seem fully justified with sweet corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Other Advantages of Hybrid Corn Increased yield is not the only added advantage of the better hybrids over standard farm varieties. They are recognized for their strength of stalk, superior grain quality, greater freedom from suckers and greater uniformity of vegetative development in general. Given a few years more time it should be possible for the corn breeder to make "corn to order" to fit most any need or any fancy. If the inbred lines used" in making i-ingle or double crosses are fully purified by long continued inbreeding, they or their first gen - eration hybrids should always come true to type regardless of where the seed is produced. In other words they are not subject to adapta - tion to a change in climatic conditions as are the very nlastic open pollinated varieties. If the superiority of any such hybrid is once established for any locality, the seed may be produced elsewhere with - out affecting its suitability when brought back to plant the com - mercial fields. Necessity of Confining Hybrids to First Generation Seed Whereas seed ears for the next year's crop are normally picked from any field of commercial varieties, this may not be done with any kind of hybrid corn now available without lowering the yield of the ensuing crop. Such hybrid seed would he what is known as second generation seed which universally yields less than seed of the first generation. The percentage of reduction varies with the constitution of the hybrid. Nebraska data bearing on this question and averaged for several years may be used to illustrate the general principle. The average reductions were as follows: (1) single crosses. 34%: (2) double crosses involving 4 lines, 20%; eight-line hybrids, 12%; and 16-line hybrids, 5%. While it is possible that second generation seed of a very superior double cross may yield as well as a good commercial variety, that would not justify its use since first generation seed of any existing double cross that yields so well in the second generation would yield 15 to 20 per cent more than the variety. The story of a corn grower of eastern Nebraska illustrates the point. He had saved for seed a quantity of corn grown from a com - mercial 3-line hybrid. He planted this second generation seed on 70 acres and harvested 63 bushels per acre as an average for the entire area. This grower told of his experience to a gathering of farmers who were holding a corn demonstration meeting in the fall at a neighbor's field. He stated that the Agricultural College was giving the wrong information in advising against picking seed ears from the hybrid crop. He "knew" because of his big yield. May I add </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION that our experience with the same hybrid has been a 24 per cent re - duction in the F 2 generation. Thus there would seldom seem to be justification for a corn grower to plant his general corn field to second generation seed picked from a hybrid crop; Producing Hybrid Seed Corn The production of hybrid seed corn on the farm is a fairly simple matter and is rather fully described in last year's annual report of this Association. It is commonly regarded as advisable to have an isolated field available for hybrid seed production in order to main - tain its purity. There is always some danger of foreign pollen drifting in from other corn and thereby bringing about contamination. It has usually been advocated that a hybrid seed field should be at least 60 to 80 rods away from other corn, tho now there is a tendency on the part of practical corn men to reduce the distance required. They ask what difference does it make if one to five per cent of the kernels are crossed with some other corn than that intended to be the male parent. Such kernels would undoubtedly yield as well as those of any good variety and their presence in a small amount would at most serve to lower the acre yield very little below that of the pure hybrid. So then we have something more to think about. Undoubtedly it would be preferable to isolate our seed fields as far as practical and try to produce pure seed. But for those interested seed growers who are unable to provide u fully isolated field it may be permissible to lower their standard to 40 or even 30 rods without serious results. The poorer the isolation, the greater will be the advantage of additional border rows planted to the male parent on sides of the seed field facing other corn.

For a grower of commercial seed, it would be especially important to avoid contamination with corn of another color or with sweet corn. It has been taken for granted that the reader understands the manner of producing hybrid seed by means of the natural crossing plat. To make double crossed seed, the plan is to procure seed of the two necessary single crosses from the Experiment Station or some private producer of seed stocks. These are planted in alternating plats throughout the isolated seed field. Under Nebraska conditions these alternating plats preferably consist of 2 rows of the female parent and one row of the male parent. The female rows are then thoroughly detasseled throughout the pollination period to prevent inbreeding. Their ears are thereby cross fertilized by the male parent, and these supply the double crossed seed for the next year's commercial corn crop. A question arises as to how often one should go over a natural crossing field to remove the tassels from the female rows. While it has been found possible to do the work effectively by detasseling every other day during the pollination period of approximately 3 weeks, more thorough results are likely to be assured if done daily. It is highly important that no tassels whatever be permitted to shed pollen in the female rows since the self pollinated grains will be far less pro - ductive as seed the following year than are the cross pollinated grains. In order that hybrid seed corn may be eligible for certification, thorough detasseling should be made imperative. The tassel is best removed by an upward jerk soon after it comes out and before it sheds any pollen. With a little experience one will learn how to do this without pulling off leaves and without leaving lower branches of the tassel. Cutting off the tassels is unsatisfactory as it is likely to remove some of the upper leaves and is more likely to leave lower tassel branches intact which may shed pollen. Nebraska Grown Hybrid Seed. Nebraska farmers have now had one year's experience in the pro - duction of hybrid seed corn by means of natural crossing plats. Thirty-two farmers procured seed of single crosses No. 253 and 111 from the Experiment Station in the spring of 1933. The hybrid 253 was detasseled throughout the seed plat and therefore bore the double crossed seed which is known as the Nebraska No. 238 double cross. As an average for the two years, 1932 and 1933, this Nebraska 238 has averaged 15 per cent higher yield than the standard eastern Ne - braska variety, Krug. In addition to having a seed supply for their own planting in 1934, these growers have a' surplus of about 650 bushels of seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The seed stocks used by these farmers were purchased at 25 cents per pound. The cost for such hybrid seed stocks ranges in the various states from 25 cents to $1.00 per pound. In a number of states in - bred lines used in hybrid seed production are for sale at $5.00 per pound. The Nebraska' Station can again supply the two single cross parents of Nebraska 238 at the price of 25 cents per pound. Thus an expenditure of $2.00 would provide the seed for a one-acre seed plat. The labor of detasseling would probably not exceed $4.00. There are no other expenses which are not necessary with producing ordinary seed. With corn yielding 4 5 bushels per acre, 3 0 bushels of double crossed seed would be grown since only the detasseled rows bear the seed. This might grade down to 20 or 25 bushels. Such an acre would provide seed for planting about 150 acres the following year. It is understood that the use of superior seed corn which will in - crease the yield of grain per acre is not inconsistent with the Federal Administrative plan to reduce total production. It would be nothing more than good business sense to use any practice which lowers the cost of production. Then if the output is too great, this may be most properly avoided by acreage reduction. Corn growers may help them - selves and the general corn improvement program by planting part of their acreage to recommended hybrid seed and reporting results to their Experiment Station. CHEYENNE WINTER WHEAT C. A. SUNESON (Cooperative Investigations) Bureau of Plant Industry U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, and University of Nebraska I assume that my job on this program is to tell you about Cheyenne, the new baby in the family of Turkey wheat varieties, which this Association plans to certify this year. This variety traces to a selec - tion made at this experiment station in 1922. My story will attempt (1) to give you some typical examples of things we all should keep in mind when we compare varieties, and (2) to present our combined experiences with both Cheyenne and Nebr. 60. Many of you have been hearing about Cheyenne for several years. If you have been interested in its winterhardiness the information im - parted to you has probably been that it is as hardy as Kanred; and a little less winterhardy than Nebr. 60 under average Nebraska condi- '"Cooperatively employed by the Division „! Cereal Crcips and Diseases. Bureau of Plant Industry. U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, and the Nebraska Agricultural Ex - periment Staton." </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION tions. Iii this respect then it should meet Nebraska requirements. In Table 1 you will notice survival comparisons between Nebr. 60 and Cheyenne for western Nebraska where we have had killing in each of the past three years; for Lincoln in 19 32 (winterkilling isn't so common here you know); and from three experiments when frozen artificially. In general, the data agree with what you have been told about the relative hardiness of these two varieties. But what about the exceptions? Those abnormal and very inferior survivals of Cheyenne occurred— just why we do not exactly know. At any rate Cheyenne looked terrible. I do not have specific data here to show it; but instances probably occur in Nebraska when Nebr. 60 survives much less than Cheyenne, however. Recent experiments at this sta - tion have shown that all of our varieties are in continuous adjustment during the winter as regards relative cold resistance. No two respond exactly alike to the variable environmental conditions, i. e., temper - ature, cloudiness, rain, snow cover, etc., occurring in any particular week or month. • No wonder then that on rare occasions your neighbor's scrub Turkey may come thru the winter better than your improved variety. Under such conditions, use your good judgment and remember the years when it was the other way. Think in terms of averages. If you do that in the case of Cheyenne it will prove to be the near equal of Nebr. 60 in winterhardiness under Nebraska conditions. Many farmers in the state are abandoning or have abandoned Nebr. 60 for the same sort of reason they would have quit Cheyenne in 1932 had they experienced the sort of killing we did here in our nursery. In this case I have in mind the susceptibility of Nebr. 60 to Hessian fl &gt;' — when they are about this variety looks very bad. But Hessian fly have been serious enough to affect yield in only three of the last 22 years here at Lincoln so why sacrifice a good proven variety be - cause of one weakness so rarely a factor? But to go pn with the story of Cheyenne — known to many in the state as "fly proof" be - cause of some unfortunate and unfounded publicity last year. Let us look at the Hessian fly records of Nebr. 60 and :Cheyenne in Table 2. Those data certainly don't show Cheyenne to be "fly proof". In each of three years it has matured more "fly" than Nebr. 60 of the fall brood, and for the one year when they were a factor at harvest, nearly as many in the spring. In contrast with these varieties we have others which were practically free from "fly" in both the fall and spring. Of course you will notice that there is ample justification for calling Cheyenne tolerant to Hessian fly for despite the heavy load of infestation which it bore, this variety showed more tillers heading, fewer straws broken over, plumper grain, and a very much higher yield than Nebr. 60. Unfortunately tolerance appears to mean re- </seg>
            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE slstance to some, and resistance complete immunity to others, and so the story keeps getting better each time it is told. Someday, some farmer is going to plant Cheyenne about September 15 in a "fly" year, and both the variety and experiment station will be given an undeserved black, eye in that community. In view of the data I have just shown you, :it appears that the penalty for planting before the fly safe date is almost as great with Cheyenne as for Nebr. 60. On the other hand, our results would seem to show that if your neighbor plants early and catches the fly, but you plant late enough to avoid them that Cheyenne is then by far the best available bet to give you a good yield because the spring response ol' varieties is somewhat dependent on whether or not the plants are weakened by overwinter - ing puparia of fhe fly. Cheyenne, therefore, appears to provide no license for planting earlier than you bave been, but to give you greater protection against careless neighbors' "flies" than any other variety we could recommend at this time, Thus far I have touched on only two things -winterhardiness mid Hessian fly susceptibility — and this chiefly to acquaint you with some of the considerations relevant to the wheat Improvement program and its charitable and proper acceptance and application out state. Now let us turn to more general comparisons With Nebr. 60, tin - one variety with which a majority of the farmers in this state are familiar. Cheyenne has a smaller head, held more erect, on a very stiff straw (for a hard wheat), and averages about two Inches shorter than Nebr. 60. The kernels ate a little shorter. The protein (tin - tent may average a little lower, probably because of the higher acre yield.. Chinch bugs attack Nebr. 00 with greater effectiveness than Cheyenne, tho of course both may be killed when the buns are on the march. The leaf and stem rust susceptibility of Cheyenne exceeds that of Nebr. 00. Cheyenne is also considerably more susceptible to bunt than Nebr. 60 which means that farmers who grow it should be especially diligent in the treatment of their seed. In yield Cheyenne has a very impressive record at Lincoln as shown in Table 3. In only one of six years has it yielded below Nebr. 60 and in the "fly" years of 1930 and 1932 Nebr. 60 has been far behind. At Alliance where conditions have been especially severe as to drought and cold, Cheyenne has averaged 1.7 bushels under Nebr. 60. In that section. despite its favorable combine characteristics, my limited experience leads me to believe that the slightly greater winterhardiness of Nebr. 60 may continue it as a favorite. Because of its attractiveness and obvious superiority under cer - tain conditions, Cheyenne seems assured of a place among the im - portant varieties of hard winter wheat. Like other things in this world it is not perfect. If you are willing to grow it thru its good and </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION bad years, the multitude of experiences of your experiment station suggest that your average acre production will be higher, principally because it is apt to be more consistent — gives fewer failures or near failures in other words. In the future we hope to go a lot farther to - ward this ideal of more consistent production by developing greater resistance to insects, disease, and cold in our varieties. Great im - provements appear to be on the horizon. Time will tell, if we tire not. Table 1. Comparative hardiness of Nebr.

            <seg id="p182">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WHAT IS NEW IN THE SPRING GRAINS? A. ANDERSON In a discussion pertaining to new varietal possibilities in the spring small grains, it may be well to begin by considering what has occurred in the past. Many of you are not only interested in grow - ing improved varieties to increase your grain yields but also for com - mercial seed production. It may be of interest, therefore, to summarize very briefly the re - cent seed certification activities of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Asso - ciation as related to the spring grains. Such information pertaining to the varieties and bushels certified and number of growers and counties where grown has been taken from the annual reports of your secre - tary, Mr. Stewart, and is reported in Table 1 for the years 1930 to 1933. These data show very clearly that more interest has been shown during recent years in the certification of barley than either oats or spring wheat. This doubtless has been due to the recent introduc - tion of a number of new and improved varieties and to the extensive expansion of the barley acreage. The importance of and interest in the distribution of new varieties is evidenced by the fact that 59 growers of barley in 41 counties, based on a 4-year average, have pro - duced over thirty thousand bushels of certified seed per year. Produc - tion of certified seed of all the spring grains in 1933 was materially lower than during the three previous years because of the extremely un - favorable growing conditions prevailing over much of the State. It should not be concluded that all certified seed has been used for plant - ing. On the other hand, considerable uncertified seed originating from certified seed, particularly of the older varieties, is sown each year. I shall not discuss the present standard varieties in any great de - tail since such a report was made a year ago at these meetings (The Spring Small Grains in Nebraska, Twenty-fourth Annual Report, Ne - braska Crop Growers' Association, 1933, pages 71-76.) I wish to discuss briefly, however, some of the possibilities for further im - provement. Efforts toward varietal improvement in the past were primarily concerned with testing relatively large numbers with final selection based on general productiveness. More recent methods involve selec - tion and hybridization for specific objectives such as disease and lodge resistance and quality. Extensive elimination of non-suitable sorts preliminary to testing for general productiveness and other desirable agronomic characteristics is thus made more effective. In most in - stances it appears theoretically possible to combine, through hybridiza - tion, desirable characters into one variety. Practical application of </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION this, however, generally involves extensive selection and testing and frequently proves very difficult. Complexity is further increased by the fact that varieties may and frequently do respond differently to a change in environmental conditions. Likewise varieties showing resistance to certain diseases as the smuts or rusts are not necessarily resistant to all physiologic forms of the same organism. This may be well illustrated by Kanred winter wheat which is resistant to certain forms of stem rust and highly susceptible to other forms. Many of you who grew Burt 293 oats in 1932 were disappointed because of its stem rust susceptibility and low yields. Rust susceptible varieties in years of severe epidemics are likely to prove decidedly inferior. Two comparatively new selections of Kherson oats, Iogold and Edkin. developed by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station and the United States Department of Agriculture, respectively, are relatively resistant to the forms of stem rust commonly occurring in Nebraska. These two varieties were among the highest yielding ones tested in 1932. Iogold appears fully as well adapted to Nebraska con - ditions as Nebraska 21 and is probably to be considered a superior variety where rust epidemics are likely to occur. Three new produc - tive Nebraska selections from common Burt have also shown con - siderable resistance to stem rust. These strains are being increased and if they continue to show promise, one or more may be released for distribution. Barley has generally been considered more disease resistant or tolerant than other small grain crops. Considerable losses are fre - quently experienced, however, from the smuts, rusts, stripe, and scab. The term "blight" has been recently adopted in the Federal grain standards to cover stripe, scab, and similar molds because of the dif - ficulty in differentiating them in the diseased grain. According to recent rulings all such grain containing from 2 to 5 per cent diseased kernels shall carry the regular number plus the notation "blighted" and grain containing above 5 per cent blighted kernels falls into Sample grade. Scab is particularly undesirable since it modifies the composition of the kernel and the diseased grain is more or less toxic when fed to hogs. Very little has been accomplished through se - lection tor varietal disease resistance in barley. Increasing consider - ation will doubtless be given to such factors in the future. Recom - mended disease control practices include the use of sound seed, seed treatment, the plowing under of all crop residues (especially for con - trol of scab), and crop rotation. Due to the increased interest being shown in the malting qualities ot barley, it has been proposed to modify the Federal Grain Stand - ards for barley so as to recognize two subclasses of the common white barleys, (a) malting barley and (b) other barley which does not meet </seg>
            <seg id="p184">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the requirements of malting barley. Good malting barley should be pure; have clean, plump, mellow grain of uniform size which will germinate rapidly and uniformly; and it should be relatively free from blight, ergot, and other diseases, and broken, skinned, or heat damaged kernels. Such characteristics in most instances are more influenced by the environment than by qualities inherent in the variety. Certain varieties, however, such as Trebi, are considered relatively poor for malting purposes, regardless of the conditions under which they are grown. It is obvious that the climatic conditions which generally prevail in Nebraska are not conducive to the production of good malting bar - ley. In this connection, it would be well to bear in mind that the environmental conditions producing the good milling characteristics common to Nebraska wheat are in many lespects just the opposite of those necessary for producing desirable malting characteristics in barley. The malting qualities of varieties suitable for Nebraska conditions, other than Trebi have not been sufficiently well established to merit a recommendation. It would not seem expedient, however, to grow so - called good malting varieties unless they are otherwise well alapted to local conditions. Although spring wheat is relatively unimportant when compared with the other small grain crops, it is still a crop of considerable importance, particularly in the northern and western sections of th- State. For many years. Marquis has been the most extensively grown variety of common spring wheat. It has ranked very high in milling quality. Due to its relative lateness and rust susceptibility, it is rather poorly adapted to Nebraska conditions. Two new varieties. Ceres and Komar, originating at the North Dakota Agricultural Ex - periment Station from a Kota-Marquis cross appear very promising. Ceres has been rather widely distributed throughout the spring wheat area of Nebraska and is probably the best adapted variety which is available commerically at the present time. Humpback has gained considerable prominence in certain sections of the spring wheat area ot Nebraska. This variety, due to its peculiar milling characteristics. is frequently discriminated against on the market and should not be grown where it is possible to replace it with seed of a suitable sort. Much of the Nebraska grown spring wheat has been graded smutty at the terminal markets. Smut can and should be effectively controlled by proper seed treatments. It would be desirable to exercise unusual care in this connection until suitable varieties are developed that are resistant to the forms of smut commonly present. </seg>

            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WHERE DOES THE COR.V CROP GO? J. F. LAWRENCE When we attempt to figure the disappearance of corn in this great United States, we have to begin figuring in large numbers. The ex - pression "a billion" means very little to you and me except that as a number, it is a very large one. When we speak of the corn crop and the amount of the corn crop, we have immediately to be thinking in these billions. The corn crop of the United States has averaged for five years 1910-1914 and for the five years of 1924-1929, two billion six hundred million bushels. Ordinarily when we talk about great numbers, we fail to take into consideration that there may be great size in many things but the relationship of other numbers to those greater numbers is just about the same as if all these great quantities were small. So, in talking about the disappearance of corn, we are going to be able to brush a million bushels off just the same as if it was a speck on our coat. I am asked to tell you where the corn goes. Now, in making a study of the consumption of corn, we have had many ideas put into our minds — most of these ideas absolutely true with a good base for bringing them forward. For instance, we have said many times, and it is pretty well instilled into our minds, that only twenty per cent of the corn crop is moved off of the farm where it is raised. That means twenty bushels out of every one hundred, or twenty million out of every one hundred million, or two hundred million out of every billion. You see the relationship between the twenty and one hun - dred is just the same as the relationship between two hundred million and the billion. This is merely by way of foundation to keep us from getting scared at the great numbers which are going to corn.' before us. I am going to ask that we go back for almost half a century to the year 1891. In that year total production of corn in the United States passed the two billion bushel mark. Since that year there have been only four years when the total production fell below two billion. In the year 1900 the production was estimated at two and one-half billion bushels, and right around that figure it has seemingly stayed for a third of a century. This is by way of saying that taking averages for five years into consideration, we do not see that the corn production has increased even as fast as our population has increased in thirty years, nor does it seem to bear out the argument ot many men that we are unduly increasing our corn crop when the economics of the situation says we should not. Twice during the past thirty years, the corn crop has passed the three billion bushel mark. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Now. for the sake of giving us a clear understanding of just where the corn goes, a chart has been prepared showing the use of corn for the period 1910-14 and for the period 1924-29. Both of these periods were five-year periods and fifteen years apart. The difference in the averages between these two periods is only four million bushels out of a total of two billion six hundred million. Since the average produc - tion is so close that we can call it equal, we can look with care on the use to which it has been put in both of these periods. It is to be noted that In both instances, farm uses predominate, in 1910-1914 using 85% and in 1924-29 using 88% on the farm. Just at present our interest is drawn to hogs on account of the corn-hog program which the government is just starting. In this first period which was pre-war, we note that 36.8% of corn was fed to hogs. Now in the later period, we find that 41.6% or almost 5 % more of the total crop went into hogs. For beef cattle and sheep we find the comparative percentages are 17.2 and 20.3, meaning that 3% more of the total crop is now being fed to beef cattle and sheep. On the other hand, let us look at the horses and the mules. In the first period they used 17.4% and the latter period 13.9%. A difference of 3%% of the total crop which was formerly consumed by work stock now has to be put to other uses since horses and mules have so decreased in numbers. Now, we come to industrial and city uses. In the earlier period 17.7 % of the corn was used in industry while in the latter period 12.1%. This shows a difference of 5.6% of the total crop in favor of the earlier period. This may be defined as a loss, much of which can be explained by the almost complete replacement of dray and delivery horses in the city by autos and trucks. I have given you these figures simply to show that as time has gone on, even though there is no increase in the average production of corn, still there is a very definite change in percentages as to the corn which is used in different ways in our annual consumption but at the same time we would have to come to this conclusion that in - dustrial and city uses are very minor so far as the total crop is concerned. Three hundred million bushels of corn is certainly a great amount. It amounts, of course, to almost three bushels per capita so far as folks are concerned in the United States. Yet, that three hundred million bushels represents the total usage of corn outside of our farms. Now you say, what are these industrial uses and I will say to you that you can name them just about as well as I can. You know from your own experience whether you eat very much corn bread, you know whether the use of corn starch has come up so very strong </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE on your own family, and you know that while there is quite a good use of corn syrup and many bushels of corn in the course of the year go into that product, we can say at the same time that there is no increase in industrial usage which -will make a very strong impression on total corn crop in the United States. We can say without fear of contra - diction that the United States will probably continue to use about three hundred million bushels of corn in industry and that they will slowly and gradually increase but it may take several years for it to get back even to 12.5% where now it stands at 12.1%. The differ - ence of one-half of one per cent would mean thirteen million bushels and even that is a whole lot of corn when it comes to finding some new industrial use for it. Now, this paper was meant to tell you about where the corn crop goes. There was no intent on the part of anyone that I suggest to you what should be done about it. I think probably there was the gen - eral feeling that I might show you of the immense amount of corn which is now. used in industry and that we ought to get our inventors to work in order that they might use up more of this corn crop which; we have here. I am not going to say that, simply because I feel that you, as well as myself, know that inventions come slow and that the habits of people are slow to change and that even though inventions might he made tomorrow which would use up extra millions of bushels of corn, it would take several years for these to he put ,„i the market in such a way that would make eve., a sight impression on the corn crop as we have it now. It is my feeling that in the industrial uses of corn we are going to have an increase that will be verv slow and very gradual. On the other hand. I think we can say definitely that the immense corn crop of the United States is used on the farm. It not onlv is used on the farm, but it never moves off the place so far as eighty per cent of it is concerned. The other twenty per cent goes off of the farm into the channels of trade and a portion of it goes into industry while the rest of this twenty per cent goes into the feed yards of other farmers. If there is a problem here so far as corn is concerned if there is too much corn or if there is not enough corn, there is onlv one way to give it consideration and that is that corn is a farm crop t Is a feed crop, and goes to market on four legs. It is closely and intimately linked with the live stock problem and from that problem can not be separated. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION HORSES AND OVERPRODUCTION HARRY I). LINN Iowa Horse &amp; Mule Breeders Stockgrower's Association Horse At Crop Production Closely Associated Horses and the production of crops have long been closely asso - ciated. For a number of years horses and mules furnished the sole power used by man in producing these crops. Since the period of oxen use, man has produced farm products with only two ultimate "uses" for them. 1st — as a food for man and 2nd — as a maintenance for horses and mules. Horses &amp; Mules Increase from HMO to 1018 Horses increased in numbers in U. S. from 1910 to 1918, or the war period. Since that time the decline was alarming. We do not have to search our memories far to recall how our fathers and grandfathers warned us against giving up our horseflesh and how we laughed or sneered at them as old fogies. Let us review again the horse num - bers on farms over this period. In 1910 the number was 19,833,000: this increased to 21. 555, out) in 1918. About this time, due largely to the high prices paid for livestock and grain, farmers moved into high gear in production. Horses were sold and machinery was introduced in their stead. Millions of acres of the best grass land in the west wits turned over by the plow. Wheat, corn, barley, oats, rye, etc.. were planted and harvested. The production of hogs, sheep, and cattle increased and horses decreased. I do not think we could really he blamed, for by till appearances, we were entering a golden age where man by his keen brain had all forces of nature under control. Win- a Destroying Influence on Agriculture They say. that a criminal always leaves a clue even though he may think he has committed a perfect crime: and we forgot one very important item in this time of tremendous expansion; that is, the part horses and mules play in the consumption of crops. The war had a disrupting influence on farming in many sections with pro - duction cut down to a minimum. Then as the countries of the world started to rebuild we find our markets slowly and naturally shrinking. We are desperate. We have spent our money like drunken sailors. As prices start down we must plant more and produce more in order to meet interest and taxes; we also try to keep up our "standard of living". The mad struggle continues until "blooey" the bottom drops out and we find ourselves in a position where we have, for the first time in 12 or 15 years. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. plenty of time to think over our operations, our position, and our mistakes. Again we think of the statement that there are only two outlets for our farm products, man and the horse and mule. The population of our country has been gradually increasing at a rate of approximately 1,540,139 persons per year until the number figures 127,395,463. We know that the increase in population has boosted the food requirements of our nation. Average Need Per Capita Bureau H. E. Data respecting the acreage required to produce the food for an average person has been lacking until this. year. The Bureau of Home Economics, U. S. Dept. of Agric. has reeelitly completed four. years work on four diets. Dr. O. E. Baker, Senior Agricultural Economist of the Division of Land Economics and his associates have worked out the acreage of land required for each, using ten year average yields as the basis of their calculations. The diets, and the acreage per capita required for each, are as follows: 1st. Emergency restricted diet 1.1 acres 2nd. Adequate diet at minimum cost 1.4 aces 3rd. Adequate diet it t moderate cost ...: l'G acres 4th. Liberal diet .1.!) acres Dr. Baker is of the opinion that our present average is probably diet No. 3 as the diet of the poor people in the south and in larger cities is often far below No. 3. To be on the safe side, and to allow for waste and loss between the time food products leave the farm, and the time they are actually consumed, it will probably he advisable to figure on 1.8 acres per capita as the acreage used by our present population compared with 4 acres per horse or mule. Charles N. Edge, in the Living Age says, "The loss of this 8,000,000 head of horses, which consumed as many pounds of food products as 40,000, - 000 people, undoubtedly was, and still is one of the underlying causes of disaster to the American farm." Horse Requires 4 Acres For Keep Horse population requires approximately a minimum of 4 acres per horse for feed, pastures and bedding. Thus we see that for every horse that is lost we automatically turn 4 acres from use as a source of horse keep of the furnishing of farm power, to the production of grain and animals that must compete on the market. During the past 12 years our nations horse and mule count on farms have de - clined approximately 8,000,000 head. We know that the land and crops that formerly kept these animals has been used to increase the </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION crop and animal surplus. Thus the horse and mule must have on an average of 2% to 2 2/9th times more acreage for their support than the human population. Or in the case of horse reduction our population must increase nearly three times to take care of the acre - age that kept these horses and mules. Loss of Horses Compared with Loss of Foreign Market Today we hear many producers bemoaning the loss of our foreign markets. These same people are probably in another breath advo - cating the mechanicalization of agriculture. "Be modern" they say. Let me give you a few figures comparing our lost horse feed market to our lost grain exports market. The decrease in horses and mules in the last 12 years has destroyed a large market for hay and graini At a most conservative estimate, no less than 40 million acres for - merly used by horses and mules is now producing a surplus of grain and animal products. This means the farmer has lost a market for 4 0 million of acres of farm food products, which is a greater loss than our total net exports in wheat, corn, oats, rye and barley in the heaviest year since 1920. In other words, if we take the heaviest exports of these grains in their high years — wheat and corn in 1921, rye in 1922, oats in 1925 and barley In .1928 — and reduce these exports to an acre basis by dividing bushels exported by yield per acre in those years it amounts to 33,452,936 acres/which is 6 % million acres less than the market lost through the decrease In horses and mules. Let this he remembered and considered. Farmers and city trans - portation users by decreasing the use and production of horses and mules, have destroyed a market for farm products greater than the total export market for the five principal grains in their best years since 1920. Horse Breeding Situation in I'. S. The horse breeding situation in the U. S. is very serious and not - withstanding the kind advice of various groups and individuals, that the present interest in horse breeding is bringing on an over-produc - tion of horses, I would advise the production of colts from every good mare that can be bred. With other types of animals over-productions is relatively easy. Horses and mules however are a long time prop - osition. Because of the age, condition, and type the mares available to the average stallion, and figuring death loss which can not be evaded it is doubtful if over 40 or 50% of the mares bred will have yearling colts to show 2 years later. So I do not believe that it is possible to bring enough colts into being to bring our horse population up to numbers sufficient to satisfy the demand within the next 10 years. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE At the present time there is not a district in the U. S. that is pro - ducing enough horse or mule colts for their own replacement. Only four states, Nevada, Arizona. Wyoming and Montana are raising colts above replacement needs; and only 7 states, Nevada, Montana, Utah. Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas and So. Dakota have enough mule colts. The extra colts these states are producing are only a drop in the bucket compared to the needs of the remaining states, many of which have always depended on the corn belt and west for replacement. The figures given on the charts are very interesting although I do not be - lieve you will feel in a very hilarious mood after you study them. Horse Numbers Depleted in West. The old idea prevalent in the east that there are plenty of horses in the west is being rapidly exploded. Let me compare our situation of today with 1S93 and '94. Colts sold for $10.00; good mares tor $35 or $40.00. Breeding declined for a period, hut as prices again udvanced there were plenty of mates in the country and the west could supply large numbers of horses. Today this is not the case and we face a situation serious to all farmers and horsemen. Be - cause of the economic tie up of the horse with all other business, it be - hooves every one of you to see that horse breeding gets under way at once. I understand that some men high in geological circles ate saying that at the present rale of consumption, the present known supply of petroleum in U. S. can last about 12 mote years. If this he only par - tially true, the importance of horse breeding is indeed serious. Bulletin Farm Horse. Few farmers have any adequate idea of the number of horses and mules in each state and the number raised and the effect of a shortage upon the price of farm products. Those who are interested in tarn. prosperity should write for a copy of "The Farm Horse" published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States Government. It tan only be obtained by purchase, the cost is 10c. This bulletin can also be obtained from the "Horse &amp; Mule Assn. of America" at Union Stock Yards, Chicago, 111. As I opened, let me close by reemphasizing that there are hut two ultimate consumers— man and the horse. Hogs, cattle, sheep, and poultry are of course intermediate consumers but thev are in the end used us human food so they are considered in the diet re - quired for man. Dogs and cats can be ignored as they live largely on the wastes of man. I am sure that many of the figures and statements that I have presented to you during this discussion are not new to you, if, how- </seg>
            <seg id="p193">193 NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ever, by bringing them to your attention at this time I may uave given horse breeding a stimulus in this great state I will feel that my time has been well spent here and I am sure that you who do resume horse breeding will find it profitable in many ways to your self and your community. Cost of Farming Operation The cost of any farming operation can only be measured over a period of years. The cost of using horses for one, two or three years is not enough. We must consider the effect of their use on the supply or price of the products we produce and market. The same theory should apply to the use of the tractor. Today's cost Is not enough. If by its use we improve our farming conditions, raise our prices or add to our profits over a period of years, its initial cost is thereby altered. If. however, we lower our prices and flood our markets the ultimate cost of such practice is absolutely prohibitive. Each farmer and rancher is planning his own business. I hope the plans are for a long time period so that in the end of the entire nation may strengthen, progress, and prosper. PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF GRAIN AND FORAGE SOKGHUMS L. C. AICHER, Supt. Ft. Hays Experiment Station, Hays, Kansas Development of the Sorghums The areas in which sorghums can be successfully grown are grad - ually being extended. This is being made possible by the combined efforts of the plant breeder and farmers interested in feed and grain production. By cross breeding and selection many new and desirable varieties of sorghums adapted for specific purposes are being provided. These desired qualities include resistance to disease: earliness to escape frost: higher sugar content of the stalk: white seeded grain of good quality.; grain free from bitterness: stiff, straight necked, short growing grain sorghums suitable for harvesting with the com - bine harvester: and resistance to insect damage. ';■'.. Atlas Sorgo One of the greatest improvements in recent years has been the addition of a highly prized new variety, Atlas Sorgo, just recently brought out by the Kansas Experiment Station. This variety has all the good qualities of the best sorgo, or so-called cane varieties, and in addition has a very palatable grain. The Atlas is a new kafir-sweet sorghum hybrid which seems to have derived its sweetness and leanness from the sorgo parent and </seg>
            <seg id="p194">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE its stiff stalk and kaflr type head and grain from the kafir parent. The grain is relished by all classes of livestock and the forage makes an excellent bundle feed, for cattle will clean it up stalk and all. Atlas, in just the few years it has been out, is today the most popular variety in Kansas and is extensively grown for silage production be - cause of its high productive capacity and excellent feeding qualities. New Varieties. Resistance to disease is a very important qualification in a variety. Some of the old varieties such as red amber and black amber were highly susceptible to kernel smut, while Feterita has long been known for its resistance to that disease. By the judicious use of the Feterita parents in the production of hybrids much progress is being made in overcoming disease susceptibility! Some new selections originally produced at the Woodward, Okla - homa, Field Station were brought to the Hays Station in 19 29 and grown with the idea that they might make suitable varieties for har - vesting with the combine. After several years trial one of these was named Wheatland and released as a short, stiff stalked, straight neck - ed, high yielding variety suitable for harvesting with the combine. The average height of this variety is 31 inches. These short growing stiff stalked grain sorphums are grown for grain. They can be planted and harvested with wheat machinery. The Wheatland variety is particularly noted for its ability to stand tip after being ripe, without lodging. Unfortunately it is very susceptible to chinch bug injury. Since Feterita is highly resistant to chinch bug injury, this variety has been used extensively as a parent in the breeding and develop - ment of new short, stiff stalked, high yielding types suitable for com - bining. A few promising selections are now being tested and it is hoped that in due time something of value will be forthcoming. Some distinctly early types of these combine types ate also being made available for the high elevations, of the northern Great Plains area. Professor Stewart has had several of our standard sweet sorghum and grain sorphum varieties and promising new selections have been sent to him for trial in your state. We joined him this past fall in looking over a group of these grown on the Johnson Bros, farm at Holdrege. A few of these selections appeared quite promising and no doubt will be given further trial. Where sorghums are grown for silage or for grain, it is essential that they mature before the normal frost period. At the Ft. Hays Station we find that we obtain a better quality of silage from the sorghums if the sorghums are permitted to ripen before ensiling. By </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ripening is meant that most of the seed must be ripe. Immature sorphums tend to produce sour unpalatable silage. Silage Production Where varieties suitable for silage making are desired and long seasoned varieties such as Atlas will not mature, the early Sumac and Leoti red varieties, being two weeks earlier, will prove very satis - factory. Earliness in most instances is obtained at the expense of yield. The ten year average yield and other data recorded for five stand - ard varieties of sorghums at the Fort Hays Experiment Station from 1924 to 1933 are given herewith. Total yield per acre Growing Tons of forage Grain Variety season Height Green Dry Bu.

At Manhattan under more humid conditions 20 tons of silage from the Atlas variety is not un - usual. '; The kafirs are valuable dual purpose grain and forage crops. Of these the Western Blackhull and Pink are outstanding medium sea - soned sorts. These have a white grain, and outyield the best sweet sorghums from the standpoint of grain production. The stalks, how - ever, are not sweet and not juicy and are not cleaned up as readily by livestock. The kafirs do not make as much tonnage per acre as does the Atlas but yield approximately as many tons per acre of dry feed as do the Early Sumac and the Deoti Red, sweet sorghums. The dry stalk kafirs are especially desirable for grinding in forage mills when it is desired to grind the whole plant, grain stalk and all. The sweet sorphums because of sap contained in the stalks do not grind so well. Growing the Sorghums Sorghums are very much like corn in that they respond best on good land, but can be depended upon to produce more tonnage than corn on all soils. </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE £ I n__Ll__M / Figure 5. Blank listing in the fall is a recommended method for preparing land for sorghums the following year. In preparing a seedbed for the sorghums it has been found that the most desirable practice is to blank list the ground in the fall. Listed ground catches snow and freezing and thawing mellows the ground so that it works well in the spring. Blank listed ground warms up earlier in the spring than plowed land. As soon as the weeds have a good start the listed furrows should be filled in with the ridgebuster. Another crop of weeds usually will appear before planting time, and this crop should be killed with the one-way plow, spring-tooth harrow or some other good weed killing tool. It is much cheaper and more satisfactory to kill the weeds before planting than to plant the land hoping to kill the weeds in the planting operation and expecting to get the survivors by cultivation after the crop comes up. Kail plow - ing, early spring plowing and early spring listing are also good methods to use in preparing a seedbed for the sorghums. Listing is the quicker and cheaper method. Yields secured by the different cultural methods from 1924 to 1931 are as follows: Eight year average Method of preparation and planting yield 1921-1931.

The .rows are run east and west as experiments prove this direction of planting produces higher yields. Planting may be done by nosing out the old furrows or planting crosswise the old furrows. The latter practice is now followed on the general farm because of the difficulty of operation and the desire to have straight rows. This general method provides warm, mellow, moist soil in the bottom of the furrow. The furrows are not so deep and narrow as in the regularly listed furrow. The ground is warm and usually con - tains plenty of moisture to bring up the seed quickly and uniformly. The lister may be used in planting and if the old furrows can be found and the soil scours the lister blade, this method will work out very satisfactorily. The common lister planter method, wherein the crop is listed without previous preparation of the soil is the least desirable method as the seed is placed in the bottom of the furrow in cold ground. The furrows are usually deep and comparatively narrow in case of heavy rain the seed or young plants are often covered up or washed out. Poor stands and many weeds are frequently secured from this method and the yields are invariably lower than by the better method. Extra heavy seeding is necessary under these conditions to insure a satis - factory stand. The treatment of seed with copper carbonate at the rate of 3 ounces per bushel controls kernel smut and improves the stand by protecting the seed from molding. Time of Seeding The Fort Hays Experiment Station has for a number of years car - ried on date of seeding experiments with a large number of sorghums. The results from these experiments are very conclusive in showing that time of planting does have a great influence on yield. In fact the results indicate clearly that sorghums over much of Kansas often are planted too early. It would be far better to delay planting 10 or 15 days and spend this time in killing weeds and allowing the soil to become warm. </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The results of date of seeding experiments involving a number of the most prominent varieties, showing yields of grain and dry forage have been assembled in the following table: Growing season g year average.

            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Another singular fact is that all varieties, excepting Atlas, not only produce heavier yields (when seeded on June 1 or June 15) than when seeded earlier but grow faster and require less total time to mature. It will be noted that a delay of 15 days at planting time. May 15 to June 1, results in only 6 days delay in maturity in the fall. Varieties planted on June 1 mature only 10 days later in the fall than when seeded 31 days earlier. These dates of planting are not especially recommended for Ne - braska where the growing season is shorter but have been introduced into the discussion to stimulate interest in the matter of the time to plant the sorghums. They are warm weather crops and it is certain that too early planting in cold ground is not desirable. Rate of Planting In the western end of the state where moisture is the limiting factor the usual tendency in planting sorghums for grain production is to sow too much seed. Since tonnage of forage in this western area is limited to the amount of moisture available, the greater the amount of seed used in planting for a forage crop the finer the quality of the forage produced. If grain sorghums are planted too thickly the additional forage growth is made at the expense of the seed crop. In eastern Nebraska, rate of seeding for row crop is not so much of a problem as there is plenty of moisture available in a normal season, to mature a heavy crop. From 4 to 8 pounds of seed for row crop seeding is ample for any of the kafirs or sweet sorghums such as Atlas if anything like a rea - sonably good seedbed has been prepared. Listing into cold ground without any previous cultivation will usually require the maximum amount of seed to provide a stand. In growing drilled cane or kafir for hay the rate of seeding varies somewhat with the size of the seed. Sixty to 100 pounds per acre have been sown on the Fort Hays Station, Atlas should be sown at a heavier rate than the early sumac us the seed of Atlas is considerably larger. Harvesting Grain Sorghums Harvesting of grain sorghums other than by means of the corn binder or wheat binder has taken on added significance since the new combine types of grain sorghums have been made available. The use of power eulpment in the production and harvesting of short grain sorghums has helped reduce the cost of producing grain in many sec - tions where previous methods of production have been too expensive. </seg>
            <seg id="p200">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE Combining can be done very satisfactorily whether the crop has been drilled with a grain drill or planted in wide rows.

The common grain header or the newer windrow dump-box header, a home made outfit, can he used to harvest the short grain Korphums. The windrow dump-box header method has proven very satisfactory; The grain can be headed when ripe, dumped in hunches at uniform intervals and when dry can either he threshed by a combine or the headed grain hauled to a threshing machine. Storing the Seed Grain sorghums should not be thresh. &gt;d until the excess moisture in the head and stalk has disappeared. It sometimes is possible to combine a grain sorghum crop before frost. Usually, however, it re - quires a severe frost to reduce the moisture content of the sorghums sufficiently to permit safe storage of the combined grain. Sorghum grain with a slight excess of moisture will heat and mold more quickly than will wheat with a similar moisture content. Ex - periments at the Fort Hays Station show that the sorghum grain having a moisture content of 13.5% will keep in bins throughout the winter months but there is danger of heating with the coming of sum - mer temperatures. In storing grain sorghums in bins it is essential that the crop be threshed clean and that it be free from pieces of stalks, as the stalks </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION carry more moisture than an equal volume of threshed grain, and if too much moisture is present the sorghum grain will heat. Harvesting for Silage and Fodder In the making of silage the main consideration, quality considered, is high tonnage of a matured crop. Immature silage frequently makes sour silage and cattle do not do so well on sour silage. Sweet sorghums and kafirs are used annually and they are very satisfactory — if put in the silo when ripe. Dry shocked kafir or cane will make a very good grade ol' silage if plenty of water is added while filling. In the curing of drilled feeds we have tried many methods but finally settled on the plan of curing well in the swath and windrow and then raking and bullraking and stacking into small stocks. We try to make each stack big enough to make one good hayrack load. In the event that we might have more hay .than the winter feeding needs call for, the extra acreage is stacked in stacks not over 14 feet wide and of . reasonable length, and as high as the stacking outfit can make them. We have found that there is danger of wide cane stacks heating despite the fact that the cane seemed plenty dry at stacking time. Kafir hay heats less under the same conditions than does cane hay. Feeding Results The utilization of the sorghums as livestock feed has been given a great deal of attention at the Fort Hays Station. These experiments have been confined almost entirely to maintenance feeding of stock cattle as destinguished from the feeding of cattle for the fat cattle market. This work has shown that the feeding value of the sorghums, when properly cured or ensiled, is high. Some of the more important results obtained in a number of feed - ing experiments will be presented very briefly. Figure 8— Atlas sorghum makes an excellent hay, fodder or ensilage crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In 1926 we obtained some interested results in an effort to deter - mine the relative efficiency of kafir and cane in the form of dry rough - age and in the form of silage, based upon gains per acre produced upon aged steers fed with an average of 2 pounds of cottonseed cake per head per day. Length of feeding period, 90 days. The following significant results were obtained: 1. Cane fodder is 138.2% more efficient than kafir fodder. 2. Cane fodder silage is 115.4% more efficient than kaflr fodder silage. 3. Cane stover is 226.4% more efficient than kafir stover. 4. Cane stover silage is 202.6% more efficient than kafir stover silage. 5. Cane hay is only' 79. 24% as efficient as is kafir hay. 6. An acre of kafir or cane silage with the heads on is worth from 2 to 2J times as much as an acre of kafir or cane in the form of fodder for mature cattle. 7. An acre of kafir or cane silage without the heads is worth from 2 to 2% times as much as an acre of kaflr or cane in the form of stover for mature cattle. 8. Kafir hay is worth more pound for pound and acre for acre than kaflr fodder for mature steers but cane fodder is worth more pound for pound and acre for acre than cane hay for the same kind of cattle. 9. Cane for roughage is worth more than kali.- as roughage pound for pound and acre for acre in all forms except as a feed for mature stock cattle. In the 1927 feeding season an effort was made to determine the relative value pf alfalfa hay and cottonseed cake as protein supple - ments for kaflr fodder and silage as wintering rations for yearlings and calves. Feeding period, 150 days. The cattle were fed all the fodder or silage respectively that they would clean up.

In former experiments 1 pound ot 43% protein cottonseed cake has been slightly less efficient than 4 pounds of alfalfa hay.

            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION THE NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL MEETING Held in the Dairy Building College of Agriculture University of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska Wednesday, January 3, 1934 PRESIDENT DAN V. STEPHENS, Fremont SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, Lincoln MR. H. P. DAVIS: Ladies and gentlemen: The meeting will please come to order. I have the privilege of presenting to you the president of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. He has taken up dairying because he likes It and 1 take great pleasure in presenting to you Dan V. Stephens. Mr. Stephens. MR. DAN V. STEPHENS: I assure you that it is a great pleasure to me to be privileged to preside over one of your annual gatherings. I am very deeply interested in the dairy business, but not so much as a practical dairyman as a public spirited citizen who desires to see the welfare of the people of this state advanced. For twenty years now I have been so deeply interested In this business that I have spent a great deal of my time promoting it. As some of you may know, I was associated in the Dairy Development Society with Carl R. Gray, President of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and his work is promoting this industry in the state. For ten or twelve years I was active in bringing into this state some seventy-five carloads of dairy cattle which were distributed among farmers. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE i I do not know of anything that brought the value of dairying so forcibly home to me as did the Panic of 1920. You will all recall, especially if you are old enough, the very strenuous times we had in 1921 and 1922 on the farms of this state. At that time we discovered that we *had practically no good dairy herds in my home county, generally speaking. Our people were not at all dairy-minded. In fact, they felt it beneath their dignity to fool around milking a cow when they could sell pork, beef, corn, etc., at war prices and they neg - lected the fundamentals of the farm, such as poultry, and dairying, and when we came out of the war we were soon in the middle of a tremendous depression without cash. I recall distinctly how poor the people found themselves, who were on rented land and who had formerly been engaged in growing corn at $1.75 a bushel and wheat at $2.00 a bushel, on land where corn had to be grown at 27 cents a bushel and wheat a little higher. So they found that it was ex - ceedingly necessary to get something to live on and it was then they made the discovery of the cow for the first time. They discovered that the cow was an essential prop to the prosperity of any family. The result was that we began immediately to build up dairy herds in our community, and I became so thoroughly sold on this idea that I have never ceased to be actively interested in it. I established a purebred herd of my own to play along with to see what I could learn about the business and it is amazing what I have learned, and it is also amazing how little I know. I will be as care - ful as I can in my discussion with you not to trespass upon ground I do not know anything about. I presume you have had a great deal of discussion of all kinds this week on public questions — questions that concern agriculture generally, so I do not intend to spend much time on the details of dairying. It is illogical for the fanner to hope for a permanent improvement of his business until such time as he is able to set up a permanent organization for the distribution of his products to the consumer. I have no criticisms to offer on the present system of distribution, so far as the methods that are employed by the distributors are concerned, but I do say it is absolutely unsound to expect a producer to have any influence whatever over his markets if he has no system of distribution under his own control. The prac - tical way to control the distribution of his products is through his own co-operative association, either now in existence or those to be set up for the specific purpose of carrying on this work of passing the production of the farms on to the ultimate consumer. A striking example of the futility of the farmer trying to pro - tect his markets is shown in the packing industry where he has no control over them whatsoever. He turns his product over to the organizations, that possess all of the avenues through which the product is distributed to the ultimate consumer, and these organiza- </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION tions naturally do and must control the prices at which the product is to be sold. Now wo have no war to make on the packing industry as such. It no doubt is efficiently carried on, but to say that it is carried on with a prime consideration of the interests of the producer would be erroneous. It is not. The truth is the packing industry passes back to the producer the losses, if any, that it sustains. The consumer can sit back for a short period of time and refuse to buy, if the price is unsatisfacotry to him. Therefore the packer simply sits back also and takes it off the producer because the producer cannot help h'.m - self. Observe the practice of the producer shipping tens of thousands of Cat animals to the central markets for slaughter. The stockyards, where these animals are assembled for sale, might be termed a market, but it is only a market in name. In reality it is the place where a few men gather and agree among themselves as to the general prices they will pay for the fat animals that are submitted to them for sale. A man must be rather stupid to believe that there is an open and free market at these yards where his products will bring the highest going price. A free market is a place where a man can present his product for sale and take the offer or reject it. as the conditions seem to justify, but no man who ships his live animals to the stockyards for sale has any opportunity to refuse to take the price that is ultimately offered him. If he ships them to some other market he is marked in advance and the buyers are noti - fied that he has left one market to go to another with his products and they treat him rough when he gets there. If he ships them back home to his yards he entails a great loss; so, regardless of whatever he may wish to do, the only practical and sensible thing for him to do is to sell the animals after he has once submitted them for sale at the central market. Last year was one of the poorest years that agriculture has af - forded in many decades, if ever in its history. Notwithstanding this the great packing industry has made a fair profit — a good profit in fact on their business. A good profit for a good year and an ex - cessive profit for a poor year such as last year. It is an additional proof that the packing industry controls not only the consumer's market, but they control also the producer's market. I am not blam - ing the packing industry for this situation. They put their money into the business under the conditions that existed and they have built up a respectable business of large proportions that is making a profit for the capital invested therein, but it is certainly high time that the farmer himself took note of it because, if he does not look forward to the control of the distribution of his product to the ultl- </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mate consumer, he can look forward to the control of his products by private interests that have no concern whatever as to whether he makes a profit or whether he doesn't. The answer to this is for the farmers through their cooperatives to own the packing industry themselves and own all of the avenues through which the meat is distributed to the ultimate consumer. Then they can say at what price they will produce pork and beef and poultry products or not produce them, just as they see fit. They will then control their ultimate markets and the consumer will pay whatever is necessary to pay for it or he can let it alone. When he refuses to buy, the cooperative will be compelled to reduce price. That will be a fair adjustment between producer and consumer. Who else should have control over the distribution of the product of the farm excepting the farmer himself? THE MILK SITUATION The same situation exists in regard to milk. The farmer pro - duces his milk and he sets the can out at the roadside for the truck belonging to some distributor to pick it up and take it to market for him. He doesn't know what he is going to get for it and there is nothing he can do to help himself if he did know. The price is paid to him according to the judgment of the distributor as to whether or not it can be distributed at the price he pays for the raw product after he has processed it. We do not blanie the milk distributor for wanting to make his profit out of the handling of this product. He should make a profit out of it, hut it must be apparent to the producer of milk that no such a stupid method as this can possible continue if the milk producer is ever to get what his product is worth. That is impossible. The situation makes it impossible. First, the consumer will buy or not buy the milk according to how it is presented to him, either in quality or in price; that is to say, he is going to decide whether he buys the milk or not depend - ing wholly upon the story that the distributor can put before him. But if, after all is done and said, the sale of milk falls off the dis - tributor does not worry so much about that, because he merely lops off the price he pays the producer and reduces his outlay. He can cut the price off the farmer at any time he pleases because he can't help himself; he never did help himself to any great extent and it remains to be seen how long it will be before he has sense enough to ever help himself. When the farmer once becomes thoroughly posted on the situ - ation he will see that he cannot possibly turn his product over to an independent organization and have it control the avenues of dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p221">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION tribution and still receive his cost of production. The farmer must control the avenues of distribution whether it be in milk or beef or anything else that he produces on his land. If he doesn't control it he cannot get the utmost out of it and he becomes a subject of all of the slack that must be taken out of the market. If there isn't a profit for the distributor, what does he do? Does he raise the price on the consumers? No, not if he. can help it, be - cause that always starts a row but it is just perfectly easy to take the cost out of the farmer because he sits back and permits anybody to take anything from him that they want to take. The thing to do is for the farmer to get up and protect his own markets by organizing his own cooperative associations, so that he can pass this product straight through to the consumer himself. Then he will know exactly what the business is, what it costs, what it is worth and if he has to sell his milk for a low price, he is willing to sell it for a low price because that is all the people will pay for it, but if it is sold to the people at a high price and he gets starvation prices for his product, then there is something wrong in the system of distribution and he had better find out what that error is and correct it as soon as he can, if he ever hopes to make a living out of his business. REDUCTION OF HERDS Milk producers have had dinged into their ears continuously for the past several years the desirability of cutting out of their herds the waste timber, the cows that are unprofitable. Just why any farmer should keep a cow. that is unprofitable in his herd is not under - standable, unless he does it for sentimental reasons. If he keeps the cows lor pets that is another thing, but If he keeps them for milk, then it seems quite difficult to understand why farmers will continue to feed animals that are making them a loss every year. Every farmer ought to take an inventory of his cow herd and just arbitrarily, without any 'ifs' or 'ands' about it or any further con - sideration on the subject cut them out and send them to the block. TUBERCULIN TEST Every milk producer should make it his religious duty to give every cooperation, that is humanly possible, to the work of testing the herds for tuberculosis. It is utterly criminal and inexcusable from every standpoint to knowingly permit animals to contlnua in the herd that are not absolutely free from any contagion. Why quarrel over a thirty dollar or forty dollar or a hundred dollar cow? If the animal is not well she will be a total loss anyway, sooner or. later, and she should he immediately disposed of before other damage is done. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Dairymen should keep their herds perfectly clean and free from diseases. By doing so they will increase greatly the sale of milk and the profits of their business. It should be the ambition of every dairymen to make Nebraska an accredited state. The spectacle fur - nished by the dairymen of northeast Iowa in their opposition to testing the cattle of that section of the state is one pf the most 1 lamentable and regrettable incidents that has occurred in this country in the last century. It stigmatizes the farmers engaged in that pro - test as ignorant and incapable of handling their own business. It places their herds in great danger and imperils the health of their own families and the public as well. Let us make Nebraska an accredited state and keep it that way. VALUE OF MILK 1 '"''•■". Man in all his wisdom has never yet been able to concoct a food that would replace milk. It is essential to the life of the infant and adult alike. We accept it as a matter of fact .without the slightest sense of obligation for this great gift to man. The truth is, man without the use of milk, has not sense enough to feed his own young. If he had no milk he would not raise enough of his offspring to con - tinue to propagate the earth. The marvelous consistency of milk, with vitamins, fats, sugars, proteins and minerals is all so perfectly balanced that without thought we pass it on to our children, knowing they will thrive upon it. ' It is only a short forty years ago a German scientist took milk apart and after separating fats, sugars, proteins, and minerals, he made himself a synthetic milk out of the same elements he found in natural milk. Then he fed it to his white rats, and they very promptly starved to death. "Gott in Himmel!" he no doubt exclaimed. "What did I leave out?" This question led another scientist to the discovery of the vitamins — those God-given factors of health and growth that make the young romp and play, and that gives the frame to the body. Milk— that is so vital to health, to growth and strength of the child; so necessary to arrest decay in the middle aged; so vital to the old. I salute it as one of God's greatest gifts to man. It should be the sacred duty of those who handle milk to pass it on unpolluted to the helpless little children and the mothers of the land that trust us with this vastly important duty. There is no duty so sacred as that devolving on the milk producers and distributors for the lives and safety of the people, and especially the little children that are entrusted to them. MR. DAN V.

ROLAND RAMSAY: In the absence of Mr. Daft. I will read the report which this committee has prepared: 1. The Nebraska State Dairymen's Association wishes to thank the speakers, Mr. Lewis W. Morley and Dr. C. Y. Cannon, and all others who have assisted with our program. 2. The members of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association wish to express their sympathy for Mr. Crowe and to offer him their sincere wishes for a speedy recovery. Mr. Crowe has been secretary of the Dairymen's Association for the past several years and has served it faithfully and well. 3. We recommend that the Nebraska State Dairymen's Associ - ation demand that our Congressmen urge the present Congress to take action against the importation of. vegetable oils which are manu - factured Into butter substitutes and sold in direct competition with butter, thereby causing surpluses of butter to accumulate on our markets and lower the price of butterf.it to our producers. 4. In view of the fact that there are large stocks of butter in storage, we recommend that the Nebraska State Dairymen's Associ - ation urge the Secretary of Agriculture to put into effect a plan for reducing production by the culling of all dairy herds by removing the diseased and low producing cows. 5. The Association favors Dairy Calf Club work and wishes to encourage it in all its phases. We wish to thank the 4-H Club De - partment and its workers for the splendid showing that was made at the State Fair and at the Waterloo Dairy Cattle Congress by the judging and by the demonstration teams. Also for the unusual suc - cess of the 4-H Junior Bull Ring Associations. 6.

Now we have the business part of the program behind us and we will proceed. It is a great pleasure to me to introduce to you the next speaker, Lewis B. Morley. Secretary of the American Jersey Cattle Club. Mr. Morley was formerly from Lin - coln and a part of this institution and was in the employ of Mr. Davis' department. All of you who know H. P. can readily appre - ciate how Mr. Morley has come out of the kink since he left here. You can see what Jersey milk can do. Mr. Morley. MR. LEWIS W. MORLEY: It is always a pleasure to meet with the dairymen of Nebraska. You people are noted for doing things for leadership and for progress. Had the invitation to speak to you come later I should probably not have accepted because it is popular just now to agree with all that is being done in behalf of the dairy farmer. Frankly, I do not find myself in entire agreement with all the plans that are being proposed at the moment. May I quote the previous speaker, "I will give my personal viewpoints and you can take them or leave them.'' Progress in dairying must be made primarily by the dairy farmer himself, there is no 'royal road to learning' and likewise there is no easy road to profitable dairying. The dairy farmer who wishes to succeed will have to work, probably more than thirty hours a week, with his hands and then do at least as much "head work." It has been said that our dairy cows produce on the average of 170 pounds of fat per year. Most investigations indicate that the average production must be near 300 pounds of fat and under some condi - tions more before a profit is realized. Can we as dairy farmers ex - pect help from our government if we are not more efficient in our own business? The fundamental laws of economics which have been in force since history was first recorded have not been repealed, though temporarily they have been somewhat obscured by seemingly new laws. Every investigation, every study and all practical proce - dure indicate that the first principle of progress in dairying is to learn what the cows are doing. No other factor in care or manage - ment is as important, yet, in spite of all that has been written and </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION spoken emphasizing this factor, the production of only a fraction of our cows is known at the present time. There are available today three types of testing for production from which the dairymen may choose. First, the Herd Improvement Association, formerly known as the Cow Testing Association. This test is conducted by the cooperation of twenty or more farmers who organize, hire a trained tester and make all necessary arrangements to have the tester visit the farm once a month and determine the production of each cow in the herd by the use of the milk scales and the Babcock Test. The amount of feed each cow consumes is also noted and a book left with the dairyman showing all of this infor - mation carried forward from month to month, and summarized at the end of the year. The second type of testing is conducted through the cooperation of the colleges and breed associations, and is known generally as the Herd Test. In this system the test is supervised by the College and all cows that have ever freshened are placed on test and all production information is sent by the tester to the College and after being ap - proved there is forwarded to the breed association headquarters. At the end of the year, the breeder is given a certificate showing the production of fat and milk of each individual cow in the herd, and the average production as well as the total production of the entire herd. This test though comparatively new, is rapidly gaining in popularity. One great advantage of this test is that it gives an ex - cellent progeny test on the herd sire. The third system of testing is carried oh by the breed associations with the colleges supervising the tests. . This is known as Register of Merit testing by the Jersey Association, and as Advanced Registry in the other breed associations. Through this system one or more selected cows within the herd are placed on test and the production supervised through a visit to the farm » once a month of a tester appointed by the college. With these three tests available, only a very small percentage of our cows have been tested for production, though as stated before it is one of the first fundamentals of progress in dairying. Have we as dairymen a right to ask the Government to spend any money in our behalf until we have learned the producing ability of more of our cows? The matter of disease control is of utmost importance, indeed some feel that it is of first importance. Certain it is that a diseased herd will not produce as much as a healthy herd, other conditions being equal. The two diseases of greater importance to dairymen because their annual toll runs into millions of dollars are tuberculosis, and Bangs Disease, more commonly known as contagious abortion. Through years of cooperative effort, between the Federal Government, </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I the State Governments and dairymen, the Tuberculosis Eradication program has been so advanced that this disease is no longer a serious menace to dairying. Bangs Disease has been considerably harder to deal with for several reasons; first, because it has taken science longer to learn a sufficient number of absolute facts regarding the disease; and second, because the blood test has not sufficiently gained the confidence of dairymen. Because of these two facts we have not made as much progress with this disease. With respect to the Governmental help to farmers in eradicating diseases, it should de - pend on the attitude of the Health Departments. Local, state and federal governments early took the stand that Bovine Tuberculosis was a menace to human health. It was. therefore, logical that money be appropriated to partially reimburse farmers from these losses. The opinion has been far from unanimous with respect to Bangs Disease with the result that comparatively little assistance has been obtained from the Government and not as much progress made as would seem highly desirable. Feeding dairy cattle has been the subject of innumerable lec - tures and farm paper articles during the past century, yet the first fundamental is often overlooked, namely, that the cow is a manu - facturing machine and requires a certain amount of feed for body maintenance before milk is produced. The number of under-nourished cows one sees in driving through the country is evident that the im - portant principle of feeding is all too often neglected. Government help will not overcome this neglect on the part of numerous dairy - men. There are of course, details of feeding dealing with minerals and special elements that are applicable only to certain localities. One other factor of prime importance is the dairy sire. The oft re - peated saying "the sire is half the herd" is not as yet taken as seriously by the great mass of dairymen, as the facts would seem to justify. One of the biggest obstacles to greater progress in eco - nomical dairy production is the fact that we continuously allow our milk herds to be replenished by heifers whose sires do not have the hereditary make-up which by any stretch of imagination will pro - duce high economical production. There is little excuse for such conditions to continue. Dairymen with but few exceptions can ob - tain sires that will increase production. Our information and knowledge, and methods of determining the probable production of the daughters of any sire have materially in - creased during the past decade. Furthermore bulls with relatively high hereditary make-up can now be secured at such reasonable prices that there seems little excuse for longer using an inferior sire. It is not a fact that the dairyman cannot afford the use of a good sire, but rather that he cannot afford not to use a good sire. The only accurate way of determining the value of the herd sire Is by the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION duction of his daughters. So far we have directed our attention in this discussion entirely to the production side. The marketing side of the business has been sadly neglected by most producers of all agricultural crops. The in - dividual dairyman cannot of course have any great effect by his in - dividual efforts, on the national price base, but he can and should through his individual effort and cooperation with his fellow dairy - men see that his product is sold as advantageously as possible. At - tending a few meetings of producers for discussion and action re - garding marketing problems, has often been time most profitably spent. The spread between the price which the dairyman receives for his product and the price which the final consumer pays is very great indeed. This is increasing indication that the Governments greatest value to dairymen at this time is not in a limitation of production which will necessarily mean a processing tax, thereby raising the price to consumers and decreasing consumption, but in taking action whereby the spread between what producers receive and what consumers pay may be just as narrow as possible. The depression years have not developed any short cuts to success - ful dairying. They have instead served to emphasize the principle on which progress has been made in the past. There is no "Get Rich Quick" formula for the dairyman. His progress depends upon eco - nomical, but proper feeding, testing for production, disease eradi - cation, production sires and a greater attention to the marketing problem. MR. DAN V. STEPHENS. We thank you for your splendid ad - dress and I assure you that it has been profitable. We are now going to have a change in the program for a few minutes. It is to be a demonstration presented by 4-H Club workers. This demonstration has been coached by Miss Woodward.

I take pleasure in presenting to you Miss Woodward, who will in turn present the team. Miss Woodward. MISS GLADYS WOODWARD: We are very proud to have two demonstration teams from Lancaster County that were first-place teams in the State of Nebraska. The Dairy A Demonstration, which was composed of Harry Liebers and Ellis Smith placed first in the state demonstration contest. The two top medals of this display were won by these boys, who also placed second in the national contest. They missed the first place by one point. So we are very proud of these boys. The Dairy A Demonstration was on production. The girls who are demonstrating for you today placed first in the state contest with their demonstration on the use of Dairy products. They missed the first place in the national contest by two points. So we are equally proud of the girls. The judging team brought home the plaque and every one of the seven members of teams from Nebraska brought home some medals. I am happy to introduce the two girls on the team, Dorothy Reed, and Julia Velie. "The Use of Dairy Products in the School Lunch" DOROTHY: I am Dorothy Reed. JULIA: And I am Julie Viele. DOROTHY: We are representing 2.472 cooking club members of Nebraska who are emphasizing value of dairy products in prop - erly balanced meals. -, i JULIA: We will demonstrate "the use of dairy products in the school lunch." DOROTHY: The first main thing is cleanliness so we must wash our hands thoroughly before we begin our demonstration. Julia has been my over-night guest and we have decided to prepare an at - tractive and suitable lunch for my little sister. As we live on the farm she will carry her lunch to school. Until the time comes when she may have a warm meal or at least a part of a warm meal, we shall have to make the cold lunch as nearly a substitute for a well-planned hot meal as possible. JULIA: I am certainly glad we learned to plan well-rounded nutritional meals for our family in our cooking club. Dairy products provide essential foods such as calcium, phosphorus, protein, vitamin A, also G and some B. And when supplemented with foods rich In iron, bulk, and vitamin C we have a well-balanced diet. Dairy products are easily prepared, and we like to use as many products from home as possible as it is an economy of both time and expense. </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION DOROTHY: You know it is wise to plan the lunch the day before, for at the busy time when the children are hurrying off to school it is not always easy to give it the attention It needs. Too often the lunch is neglected for other seemingly more important things. JULIA: The school lunch is really more difficult to plan than the hot meal served at home because there are a limited number of foods which are palatable and attractive after they have been packed for four or five hours. Extra care Is necessary to prevent sameness and monotony. Some of the foods which are most undesirable in the lunch box are highly seasoned meats, pickles, doughnuts, pie, rich frosted cakes, fried foods, and hot breads. DOROTHY: There are five groups of food that should be repre - sented in the diet every day without an excess from any one group. These are minerals, vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, and fat. The minerals are needed to build good teeth, bones and blood. Their or - ganic acids aid in the digestion of foods. The vitamins are essential to promote growth and health. The protein foods are muscle builders. They also help to repair the parts of the body that are weakened and worn by work and play. Carbohydrates and fat are fuel foods which keep the body warm and give it energy for work and play. Each child needs foods from these groups so as not to burn up his own tissues. JULIA: I think this is a tasty and well-balanced lunch we planned last night. We had it on our picnic last week and we found It very satisfying. It consists of: two cottage cheese and raw car - rot sandwiches made with whole wheat bread and lettuce. The sand - wich is an example of a good balance of the food essentials, as the cottage cheese supplies protein, calcium, and phosphorus, and the iron is supplied by the whole wheat bread. The deficiency of milk is supplied in the vitamin C and bulk of raw carrot and lettuce. Cream and butter supplies vitamin A and fat. A combination of cottage cheese with the crisp carrot and lettuce gives a pleasing chewy texture and interesting color. Baked custard supplies sugar, protein, and minerals, which builds and repairs muscular tissues, promotes growth and supplies heat and energy. Cookies contain sugar to supply energy in a quick available form. A tomato supplies phosphorus, calcium, bulk and is an excellent source of vitamin C, which promotes growth and health. Milk has mineral nutrients as calcium and phosphorus and is an excellent source of vita - min A. It also contains vitamin G especially for boys and girls be - cause their bodies grow so rapidly. Milk is one of the greatest body </seg>
            <seg id="p232">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE building foods and one quart is required each day for growing boys and girls. DOROTHY: This menu provides a healthful and delicious lunch, which is easy to prepare and pack. If you achieve flavor and color combinations that have appetite appeal the lunch will disappear like magic. Healthful foods should be delicious foods. For after all, what good are healthful foods if they are not eaten? Let's make the sandwiches first. Whole grain flour Is better than white flour, we are using whole wheat bread. The whole wheat is richer in minerals and vitamins. The bread is much easier to cut if it is at least a day old, and I made this yesterday. The bread should be cut thin and for school lunches the crust should not be removed for they are good for the teeth. When I make "sandwiches I always spread the matched slices, and always be sure that the butter reaches the edges of the bread so that it will not become dry. Good home - made butter makes a tasty sandwich. JULIA: So we prefer to use home-made butter for we make our own at home anyway. Besides making the sandwich more tasty an even coating on both sides of the sandwich prevents the filling from soaking the bread. DOROTHY: Cottage cheese is appropriate for the lunch, and it is easy to prepare, and the products are always on hand. You find in most cases it is inconvenient to prepare variations of sandwiches, as the products may not be on hand, and it may take up too much of Mother's time. We frequently have meat left over and this may be used for the protein food in place of our cottage cheese sandwich, or we might use other forms of cheese. The cheddar cheese which may be made at home is convenient. Some mothers prefer to use a soft cheese which may be used as a spread. Left-overs are used to a good advantage if care is taken to have them palatable and at - tractive. A school child needs a good substantial lunch so she will be able to study. And protein is a good body builder, and a healthy body makes a healthy mind. JULIA: For the filling of one sandwich I used two teaspoonsful cottage cheese, two teaspoonsful grated carrot, and two teaspoonsful cream. Be sure and use plenty of filling and cut the sandwiches into convenient sizes for handling and eating. I always try to vary the shape of the sandwich for a child always welcomes the lunch hour if he knows that some new delight or surprise has been included. Sand - wiches are used in practically every school lunch and they have possibilities for the making or an attractive lunch. Do you think we are preparing too many sandwiches? DOROTHY: Oh, no! The quantity of the lunch should be sufficient. A comparatively large quantity of food is required by a school child </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION because of his rapid growth and his activities. When a growing child does not eat enough to meet his energy requirements, he is stunted in growth. In order that he shall eat enough, the school lunch should be delicious and appetizing. Such a lunch is an asset, because very often it is a deciding factor as to whether or not the child will eat enough for proper development. JULIA: I always like to wrap the sandwich in heavy waxed paper. It keeps them fresh and protects them from germs and dust. It in - sures an appetizing lunch which will be devoured to the last crumb. Rubber bands may be used to hold the paper in place. Mother al - ways taught us to bring the wax paper and rubber bands home. The wax paper can be frequently used over, and the rubber bands may be used day after day. Oh, let's wrap the cookies next. DOROTHY: If one is going to have cookies as the dessert it would be best to have a heavier cooky such as an oatmeal cooky, but In our case it is to serve as the surprise, as we have the custard for the des - sert. For the school lunch I always cut the cookies with a fancy cooky cutter into the shapes of animals or flowers for the surprise. Other surprises might be in the form of a few pieces of home made candy, figs, dates, or raisins. The children are always delighted to find these in their lunch. You know a simple dessert adds much inter - est to the lunch for a child too. This might be something left from the evening meal of the night before, such as stewed or canned fruit, custards, pudding, cookies, and cup cakes. Then too, there is great danger of a child getting too much sugar and spoiling the appetite. Sugar is less likely to be used in excess when taken only In simple desserts. JULIA: Raw fruits and vegetables are always nice In the lunch. Of course they must be washed carefully before packing them. DOROTHY: You remember we learned In our cooking club that raw fruits and vegetables contain vitamins which are destroyed by cooking, and so it is best to eat one of these each day. They also serve as appetizers. Often times hunger is due to the absence of vegetables and fruits in the meals, and children who crave more foods find their appetites satisfied when these are served regularly. JULIA: Let's wrap the tomato in wax paper too, so that it will not bruise so easily. DOROTHY: Yes, I think that all the food should be wrapped in wax paper, it helps it to keep its freshness. JULIA: I am so anxious to know how our custard turned out that we made last night. DOROTHY: Custard is always nice to put in the lunch because </seg>
            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it may be packed In the cup In which it is baked, and it is a much more healthful dessert than pie. Let's sprinkle a little cinnamon on top, and add a small amount of jelly. It will add color and color catches the child's eye you know. JULIA: It is good for growing children and it contains milk Aren't there just lots of ways in using milk. We make puddings, soups, gravies, beverages, and use it with vegetables. DOROTHY: I always put the milk in the thermos bottle. It stays so cool and will not sour even on the hottest days. If it is convenient to heat foods at school milk may be often converted into a cream soup a vegetable chowder, or a warm chocolate drink. If at all possible one hot food should be made available each day. JULIA: The bottle and cork have already been scalded so as to keep its contents sweet, but of course it must be rinsed out with cold water. DOROTHY: We use whole milk in the lunch for milk fat is an important kind of fat needed by the growing child. JULIA: My, what a nice lunch container. You know then- are several types which are satisfactory. The best are those which can be easily cleaned, for a daily scalding is necessary to keep a lunch box in a sanitary condition. A good sunning and airing adds also to the cleanliness. The tin pail which is so generally used, is improved by punching in five or six holes it. the sides for ventilation. Ventilation is important so the foods will not become tainted or stale. DOROTHY: The cold lunch should be packed to look as delicious and tempting as possible. The heavier foods are best placed at the J™™ «mf Shm , ,ld P ' aCed S ° that they Wi " be c ° m "«« t" Invent nrTsno H n f ' !" *?

The paper read: 3 o'clock, music, so I hope I am In the right meeting. (Mr. Klliot played four numbers). MR. DAN V. STEPHENS: We thank you Mr. Elliott for this vari - ation from our program. I am sure it thoroughly enjoyed. We are now coming to a more serious part of the program. I will take pleasure in presenting the next speaker. This gentleman will talk to you on the subject of "Some Problems of Dairying We Must Face." The gentleman is Mr. C. Y. Cannon of Iowa State College. We ought to recognize also that he has a very great Institution over there under his direction and he has done us a very great honor by accept - ing this invitation to speak. I take pleasure in presenting, Mr. Can - non. MR. C. Y. CANNON: I appreciate the fact that this audience has been disappointed in not having O. E. Reed of the U. S. Department of Agriculture here and I realize my position. It is a pleasure for me to come to Nebraska and Lincoln again and visit with Professor Davis, because my first acquaintance with him was when I was on a farm in Idaho before Mr. Davis came to Nebraska. He was then at Idaho. Consequently I always enjoy visiting with him. While Mr. Stephens was talking about the cooperation of the farm - ers it brought to mind the story of the two old farmers who were driving a Ford home, after having indulged in some "white mule", and one said to the other, "Say, Henry, you are running the car in the ditch." To which Henry replied, "I thought you were driving it." </seg>
            <seg id="p236">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Some of us as farmers have taken that stand regarding our own busi - ness. We have thought the other fellow was driving our "Ford" and, therefore, have paid no attention to it. I was interested in a comment which Mr. Morley has made and I have some material on that subject. The comment was, that it would be a fine thing to reduce the number of cows milked. In Iowa we have adopted the slogan of "Not more cows, but fewer and better cows" and we are driving at this. Mr. Morley said the average cow produced 175 pounds. In the reports of Iowa, I came to this. "At 30 cents a pound for buterfat under 1931 conditions, such a cow would not pay anything over, the feed cost. A farmer would have to keep an indefinite number of cows to make a profit of $1000. But when the cows produce 2S9 pounds of fat. the average production in Iowa, the farmer will have to keep 51! to make $1000 profit under 1931 conditions. If he owned cows that made 400 pounds of fat. he would have to keep only 28 cows. One man keeps 28 cows and makes $luon. and another keeps 50 rows to make $1000. The fifty-six cows yield one-third more butterfat totally than the 28 cows." If everyone would keep 28 cows it would give the same piofit. but with one-third the amount of butterfat which is going on the market at the present time. We are consequently urging our farmers to make such change through breeding and feeding so as to make theii ws mote produc - tive and take butterfat off the market. I am not sure that I agree with Mr. Morley in his attitude toward the "New Deal". I am an experimentalist and I would like to see this program continued to see whether it is right or wrong. Maybe mine is the wrong attitude, for maybe we should go back to the advice of the old negro preacher who said, "Put your trust in the Lord, put vour Ford in the garage, put your family in the field, and get your bread bv the sweat of your brow." There are several angles of this new deal Iron, whirl, I am inter - ested in seeing the results. You cannot prove anything until it is in practice. Under our present conditions I would like to see it go through. I am of the opinion that if corn and hogs improve butter - fat will do likewise. I have the feeling that our situation in the dairy game will improve if we can get these other things out of the way I recognize the fact that with dairying we must look to the future and to the improvement of our breeding program. The testing of cows is not sufficient, we must look to our future stock for our heifers must be of an improved quality. And yet, we must be mindful of this fact, that the question today has to do with the cows that are now in our herds. Our breeding programs will be felt in the next cow-gen - eration, and that is coming here very fast. In the Iowa College herd the average age or lifetime of a cow is six years. The actual productive </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION life is about three and one-half years. The general run of the cows tested in the Iowa Cow Testing Associations averaged about five and one-half years old. This turns them over pretty fast. It takes about 25 to 30 per cent replacement every year.. You can understand then why bulls can wreck or improve a herd so quickly. However. I am going to deal with the feeding problem rather than the breeding problem'. The thing that we face is getting as much out of these cows we now have, as we can. I am mindful of this, that agriculture is confronted with a serious situation. I believe that unless agriculture hooks up- with science and very closely too, that it will have a hard time making the needed adjustment. Practically all big corporations have a research department included in it. They are not depending upon the state for that work. They appoint their own men to work out for them any new angles of their business. Take the "General Electric Company" for instance; they have a tremend - ous research plant. Staffed with expert men delving into problems of that particular corporation. Some of these discoveries may have no particular use today, but very frequently discoveries are used years after they are found. We tire faced in agriculture and in dairying with the necessity of hooking up with the scientific side of our business. The state has put a lot of money into research where many new things have been found, yet many farmers are hesitating to step out of their old ways of doing things to accept these new things. Oliver Wendell Holmes told the story of a son who had beaten his father and after he had dragged him out through the fields to ;i Certain tree, the father spoke up and said, "Don't take me any farther, because this is as far as I dragged my father." Our fathers cry out to us not to go beyond what they were. But, we should catch the vision of the possibilities of the new ideas and facts of this dairy game. I tun not sure whether I am going to accept all the sug - gestions made. I want to understand fully before I accept any of them. 1 wi.s very interested in the demonstration given by the 4-H club girls. To me it was a very splendid thing and it has a definite rela - tion to what I will say to you today. The chart outlining the food ration for humans is just as true when applied to dairy cattle. Cattle do have need of vitamins, energy and protein, that substance which is so vital in the ration of the dairy cow. Don't you realize that when the dairy cow is producing milk, about one-third of the total of the milk solids is protein? You have to supply the cow with a tremendous quantity of protein so that out of it she can make milk; and might I say this, that a cow cannot make anything out of only air. She must get feed from which to furnish her energy so that she will have the where-with-all to keep her body going and to make milk. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Recently Maynard and McKay published a bulletin on the value of fat in the dairy ration. In it the statement was made that for the best production of milk, the amount of fat fed to the dairy cow should be somewhat near the quantity of fat produced in the milk. From the chemistry of this you will understand that butterfat is trans - ferred into the milk with less energy cost if it comes from the fat that is fed, than if it is made from the carbohydrates of the feed. People have thought that fat wasn't much needed in the dairy ration, so we have allowed fat to be extracted in an excessive manner from our commercial rations. Fat does have a definite and useful part in the welfare of dairy cows. Everyone has been telling you about the needs of minerals. I am mindful of this, that Dr. Forbes, of Pennsylvania State in some work said that the limiting factor for milk production was the ability of the cow to assimilate minerals. He suggested that average cows could produce 17 pounds of milk on the minerals they could assimi - late. Some cows produced more than that during certain parts of their lactations. But I will call this to your attention, that of all the ingredients of milk, minerals are the most constant .in amount of any. You will find less variation in them than in any of the other milk ingredients. Fat varies 100 per cent even in animals in the same breed. Sugar varies, protein varies, but minerals stay very nearly the same. When it comes to the comparison between breeds, If you consider the highest milk producing Holstein and Jersey cows, and take their total milk production, you will find that one produces around thirty-seven thousand pounds, and the other near twenty-three thousand pounds. That is a very wide range. The milk contains about .7 per cent of ash in the case of the Holstein, and .8 per cent in the case of the Jersey. From these figures find the amount of minerals yielded by those two cows, and you will find that they are approximately in proportion to their weights. Exactly what are we trying to breed into our dairy cows? Eckles has pointed out that the essential difference between a good and a poor dairy cow Is measured in her ability to consume feed. Of course, this raises a fine academic question as to whether a large consump - tion of feed causes a heavy milk flow or whether a heavy milk flow stimulates the appetite of the cow so that she becomes a heavy feeder. This question need not be discussed for the essential lact is that heavy milk flow is correlated with a large appetite. Then we must breed large feeding capacity Into our cows. Many cows already have larger capacities for both feed and milk production than their owners realize. These cows are on a low level of production because they are not being fed properly. The Iowa •Cow Testing Associations have furnished a number of examples where </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION the total production of the herd has remained about the same even after a number of cows have been eliminated from it, because the smaller number which remained have been properly fed. I recall hearing of a breeder of range beef cattle who wanted to get a good dairy cow. He had been milking range stock with poor results, so he bought a splendid dairy-bred heifer. He milked this dairy-bred heifer two years, and then he became disgusted with her yield and turned her out on the range for beef. A real dairyman who knew this heifer's breeding, happened to see her on the range and asked the owner what she was doing out there.' The owner said that she was no better as a milk producer than his range cattle. This dairyman and the range man struck a bargain, and the young cow went to the dairyman. He fed the cow properly, and two lactations later that cow broke the state record. Was she genetically a better cow'.' The whole thing conies down to this, if you are going to breed cattle you must learn to feed properly. You cannot keep them under the old conditions. You must change the environment of these cattle. This is neecssary so that you can see the difference between them. The range man had leveled the cattle off so that he couldn't see what the individuals were capable of doing. For instance, if you had several men on a race track and put up a barrier in front of them and moved the harrier slowly along you could not determine the fastest runner, hut if you moved the barrier faster than the men could run they would gradually spread out and arrange themselves according to their speed. I know you have been taught to feed cattle well. You have been taught how to balance feeds; so much proteins, carbohydrates, but there is another angle in this thing. Some have thought they should feed these cows all they will take. There is a limitation in this. In the following slides, rations are discussed. (Mr. Cannon showed several slides which discussed in detail dairy rations.) MR. DAN V. STEPHENS: Thank you very much, Mr. Cannon for this most instructive address. The meeting is adjourned. The following address was given by Mr. C. Bechtelheimer at a joint meeting of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association and the Live - stock Breeders. THE WAR OF FATS AND OILS I feel I am coming before a sympathetic audience even tho more of you may be Interested In beef more than in dairy production. I know that that statement would not have been true a few years ago as It Is today. </seg>
            <seg id="p240">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We are all brought up face to face with a condition that has be - come more of a problem in the last few years than it was some ten or fifteen years ago. The question of utilization of fats and oils has made such rapid changes in the past ten years that what we consider an in - edible fat and what was considered edible fat has completely re - versed itself. In fact, perhaps we have more inedible fats and oils of domestic origin in the way of tallow and some fats from other live - stock than we have from imported vegetable oils. In other words, vegetable oils a few years ago considered inedible, today through re - fining processes have become absolutely a competitor of all our edible oils in this country. They have refined cod liver oil to such an extent that it can be taken without any bad faces, and we don't really realize that we are taking medicine. A few years ago, I remember at least when I was a youngster, it was about the worst thing to take there was, even worse than castor oil. so far as my own palate was con - cerned. We are confronted with a condition in this country which no doubt has been brought to your attention many times this past week. But I am going to reiterate that we are confronted with a condition of a surplus of almost everything in the way of agricultural products. This Is particularly true with fats and oils. Normally, we have enjoyed an export market for lard up to as much as 700.000.0oo pounds per year to Germany alone. That market has been almost entirely shut off. Our exports to Germany this year will probably not exceed 50, - 000,000 pounds. The tariff is so high we cannot possibly market it over there. Now, gentlemen, every pound of fats that we previously exported can be used in this country either as edible fats or in other channels of commercial trade. We import annually approximately a billion and a half pounds of foreign oils and fats. The soap industry is per - haps our biggest user outside of edible purposes that we have. Prior to 1910 cottonseed oil and various animal fats were used almost exclusively in the soap business. Then soy bean oil came into the pic - ture, and until 1921 when a tariff of 2% cents per pound was placed •on soy bean oil, it was the principal source of oils used in the soap Industry. Since that time cocoanut oil has almost entirely replaced soy bean oil in the manufacture of soap, so far as vegetable oils are concerned. It has been the contention of the soap industry that some of these oils were vastly superior to animal fats in the manufacture of soap. I remember the time, and many of you do. when our grandmothers made quite a satisfactory soap from fats produced on our own farms. There are many farm women making soap today from surplus fats they have in their own homes, and they find it even superior to the </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION commercial laundry soap they find on the market. The question of the use of various fats and oils has been a matter of controversy between livestock producers. I remember a few years ago when the dairymen were insisting on certain protection for butter as against margarine. Certain elements raised considerable controversy between producers of beef and pork and the dairymen and the pro - ducers of cottonseed as well, as to what the dairymen were trying to do to protect themselves against competition with the cheap oils in the manufacture of oleo-margarine. I know that among the thinking farmers in this country that argument did not have much weight, but we did have lobbyists in Washington who were continually raising the question as to what would happen to our markets in the south, for instance, and for pork and lard business if we insisted on certain measures and certain taxes on margarine. Now the big question before all agriculture in this country is how to protect ourselves against importation of these foreign fats and oils that are coming in direct competition with every one of us. Fish oils and whale oil coming in practically duty-free are direct competitors of every producer of any kind of fat in this country. The same is true of vegetable oils coming in. The modern pro: esses of refining oils, hydrogenating them so they become solids at certain temperatures, has placed practically every one of these foreign oils and fats in competi - tion with every domestic fat producer. The fats and oils are almost interchangeable in every industry except a few that are used in the various varnishes and paints as drying agencies. I am going to give you a few figures that perhaps most of you have heard before, but I want to call your attention to what is really hap - pening and then if possible we may come to some agreement as to possible remedies. In 1912 the soap industry used 601.000,000 pounds of domestic, and 140.000,000 pounds of imported fats. In other words, 18.9 per cent of all fats used in the soap industry were imported. In 1928 the soap industry used 937.000,000 pounds of domestic fats and 707 - 000,000 pounds of imported fats and oils. In 1928, 43 per cent of all the fats used in the soap industry were imported. Now, I don't care whether the soap industry uses animal fats or vegetable fats If we could get for our own market the soap industry of this country we wouldn't have any surplus lard, simply because cottonseed oil and soy bean oil that are being used very largely in the production of mayonnaise, in the production of margarine, and in the production of shortening compounds might hav. gone into the production of soap and then we wouldn't have any over supply of lard. Up to 1919 a very substantial part of the imported oil was soy bean </seg>
            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE oil. You folks know as to the possibility of development of soy bean industry, particularly now as we have this program of acreage reduc - tion in corn and wheat and cotton. We have got to use these acres for something else and we certainly could produce enough soy bean oil to take care of the requirements of the soap industry, so far as that one oil is concerned. With the establishing of the Emergency Tariff Act. of 1921 which placed a duty of 2% cents on soy bean oil, the soap industry began to look around for a cheaper source of supply, and since cocoanut oil came in from the Philippine Islands free of duty and palm oil and palm-kernel oil from Africa with very low duty, increased amounts of these were imported to use in the soap. Aow the soap manufacturers have proposed that fats and oils rendered unlit for use he admitted free of duty. This was in the con - troversy of 1929 when the National Cooperative .Milk Producers Fed - eration made their memorable stand before the tariff commission as to what we could do for protection against these foreign fats and oils. not only the dairy industry, hut producers of other fats and oils in the country. Now because of the duty on soy bean oil. the soap manu - facturers went to the use of cheaper fats and the development of the cocoanut oil industry in the Philippine Islands has been most marked since that time. At the present time the available oil for export in the Philippine Islands is in excess of one billion pounds per year. The development of cocoanut groves in the last ten years has tripled. There are at the present time more than 1,200.000 acres ot cocoanut trees and most are bearing. Now as to remedies. We know that under the (emergency agri - cultural act the President has power to even place an embargo on im - ports of fats and oil from foreign countries with the exception of the Philippine Islands, at least we have been told time and again there is no way of protecting ourselves from imports from the Philippine Islands. We contend that this is not true. We have some protection against agricultural products from the Philippine Islands right now. Rice, for instance, cannot be produced and imported from the Philippine Islands into the United States without duty. Only a small quota of tobacco and cigars and sugar can come into this country duty free. Yet we have been told time and again we cannot put a tariff on vegetable oils coming from the Islands. I am reading from the Tariff on Oils and Fats, certain extracts here. "The Tariff Act of 1902 levied duties against imports from the Philippine Islands at the rate of 75 per cent of the duties levied against products of other foreigu countries. "The Tariff Act of 1909 provided for free trade between the Philip- </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION pine Islands and the United States except as to rice, a limitation of 150,000,000 cigars, 300.000 pounds of wrapper and filler tobacco mixed, 1,000.000 pounds of filler tobacco In addition, and 300,000 tons of sugar. This Act also contained the provision that no product shall hi considered a product of the Philippine Islands if there was Incorporated In its manufacture more than 20 per cent of materials not grown on the Islands." Dairy products are listed among the basic commodities to be handled under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Last fall a delegation of dairymen went to Washington. This was in the summer, in August, and asked the Secretary of Agriculture to develop some plan of pro - tecting the price of butter at that time. The Secretary of Agricul - ture made available $30,000,000 for the purchase of butter to help relieve the surplus that we had at that time. The Secretary, however, provided that this 30,000,000 dollars would be available if plans for production control be developed by the dairy industry within a short time. The committees from the dairy people immediately went to work trying to work out some feasible method of production control. The first thing they ran up against was these cheap fats and oils coming in direct competition against us, and you as producers of cottonseed oil, soy bean oil, peanut oil. They went back to the Secretary and said the only way we can de - velop a real production control that would be of any benefit to the dairy industry was, first to find some way of protecting ourselves against the cheap fats coming in direct competition with us. We cannot improve the prices of lard, butter, cottonseed, soy beans until we do get protection from these cheap fats coming in, being laid down at interior points in the United States for less than three cents per pound at the present time. About three weeks ago the Iowa legislature passed a resolution, a memorandum, asking the Congress to place an embargo on these importations or stiff enough tariff that we could get some protection. So far as the Philippine Islands are concerned, we don't object if the tariff collected against cocoanut oil be returned to the Islands for carrying on government activities as well as educational work or any - thing else they want to use it for. But we cannot find a market for our own fats and oils In this country unless we are protected against these cheap foreign fats. We might, as Secretary Wallace has told us time and again, at least for the present, forget we have foreign mar - kets for all of our lard and our cottonseed oil that we formerly had. These markets are shut off and so far as Germany is concerned, I just saw an item in the paper yesterday or the day before, which out - lined a program which they are developing in that country making the whole of Germany self supporting by 1945. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ; 11 we are going to use our acreage that we have in this country, we have got to get rid of this billion or billion and a half pounds of foreign oils coming In and taking the place of domestic oils and fats of all kinds that we can produce, and will produce If we find it profit - able at all. Up to the last three or four, years as I said, we imported about a billion and a half pounds of foreign oils and fats of various kinds, and we exported almost that same amount. So that from the domestic standpoint we are today producing almost enough domestic oils and fats to take care of our needs. We use all the way from nine billion to 12 billion pounds of fats of all kinds in this country yearly. If we can all work together, every producer of agricultural products in this country, and when you come right down to it nearly all of us are producing some fats on our fa: m in some form. About the only people who are not are the horticulturists, people who are producing fruit in the restricted localities. If we can all g_»t together and go down to Washington. I believe we can gel some protection even against the Philippine imports. The principal problem right now is to pet Congress to see that there is some way of placing a stiff tariff on these Philippine products to protect our domestic supply. I know and you know that the soap industry are some of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington.. They are going to do everything they can to protect that cheap supply ol foreign oils. So far as margarine is concerned I heard recently that one group of the margarine manufacturers are perfectly willing to make all of their margarine oul of domestic fats and oils. Their joker is this, they don't, want any restrictions as to color or sale. They have made the boast that in a couple of years they would he- producing a billion pounds of margarine in this country and are holding that out as a powerful market for beef, pork, cottonseed, and soy bean pro - ducers. Now the only thing that is going to happen if that should come about is that we folks in the dairy business are going to have to go into the production of other fats if we do not find a market for our own, and we are going to be competitors of the animal and veg - etable oils other than butterfat producers in this country. It isn't going to do any good to take it away from the butter and turn it into margarine. Just that soon we are going to have to go into the manu - facture of other edible fats and not butterfat, and we will be your competitors there as we are right now. But there are so many avenues through which we can merchandise the oils and fats produced in this country that we would all feel much better, we would all have a place In the sun, If we can get away from these cheap imports, and that is the job for us to do. «• </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION We believe the Congress has the power, we believe the Secretary has the power right now to place sufficient tariff on imported agricul - tural products to protect our own domestic supply, and the thing is to get our shoulders together and go to Washington and do something to protect ourselves against fats that are coming in, since primarily our export business has been shut off. We wouldn't have a big surplus of lard if normal conditions had prevailed. Germany, Italy, and other foreign countries would have taken their normal supply, but I ques - tion whether we will ever get back to the point where they will take as much of our lard as they did a few years ago. And if we have got to find a home market for it, we have got to cut down our production of hogs more than 25 per cent, or protect ourselves against the cheap fats and oils coming from other countries, and those imports now coming from the Philippine Islands. Everybody knows we can protect ourselves from imports from other countries, but agitation has been so strong from soap manu - facturers that up to the present time Congress; has the idea that we cannot protect our selves from this competition. I think it is our job to go down and tell them what they can do, it is your job as much as it is the dairyman's.

            <seg id="p254">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Butter Exhibit As surely as people look forward to the Nebraska State Fair the first week in September do those attending look for the butter exhibit in Agricultural Hall. This exhibit has been prepared for so many years that it can now be looked upon almost as a tradition that it will be there. The butter exhibit was planned and prepared by Dr. P. A. Downs, assistant secretary of this association. The old-time slab-top stool and table with their hewn legs and the old dasher churn no doubt brought back memories of days gone by for the older people and was of educa - tional value to the younger generation who had not experienced the use of such crude equipment. The enlarged hand-colored photograph of a dairy herd enjoying a noon-day siesta under the trees in a blue grass pasture, in its broad frame of golden butter attracted much attention. Professor R. K. Morgan of the Dairy Husbandry Department of the University of Ne - braska was the photographer while Dr. P. A. Downs tinted the enlarge - ment. §1 E-9HB-I -BiilS BBSS-? ________ .

"I wish to express my appreciation for the wonderful time I had at Waterloo, attending the National Dairy Show which was made avail - able through your generous award for the Nebraska Dairymen's Asso - ciation. It was a trip that I shall never forget, and only wish that I had it to look forward to again. It is through your efforts that these trips are made possible for us 4-H club members, so I want to thank you for the trip awarded me." Sincerely yours, DOROTHY REED, Lincoln, Nebr. "It is impossible for me to express in any writing of the English language my fullest appreciation and thanks to the Nebraska Dairy - men's Association for the trip which you gave to me to the National Dairy Cattle Congress.

And that It would not have been possible for me to have gained what I have, had it not been for your help in spirit and help. I enjoyed the Cattle Congress immensely. The judging and placing of the cattle interested me. Also the fine herds and cattle shown there, from all over the United States. The meeting of many dairymen and the helpful advice and coming into contact with them has meant much to me.

I had a great time even if it was work the first part of the time. The show was by far the best I have ever seen. The cattle were all very good.

This year, as was done last year, two testers were considered outstanding and of nearly equal merit. Rather than to choose between them, the association presented medals for efficiency in testing to Robert Bell, tester for the Board of Control, and to Dale Stewart, tester for the Tri-County association. The con - gratulations and good wishes of the Dairymen's Association is extended to these men for the proficiency they have attained.

            <seg id="p287">ACTIVITIES OF THE HOME ECONOMICS SECTION OF ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE The aim of the association is to sponsor a program that will be of interest and value to the rural home makers of Nebraska. In order to reach a greater number of these homemakers, the program of work for the 1933-1934 meeting was made to include six different phases: 1. Program for Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture at Lincoln. 2. Sponsoring women's sections for the Western Organized Agri - culture meetings. 3. Recognition of leadership by awarding pins to the county chair - men of the home demonstration project work. 4. Financing recreation program for the Mothers' Vacation Camps. 5. Assisting by sponsoring trips to the National 4-H Club Con - gress to winners of home economics judging teams. 6. Making a record of the activities of the Nebraska Homemakers Guild.

' President's Greetings As we open our twenty-ninth session of the Home Economics divi - sion of Organized Agriculture, we greet you most cordially and want you to feel that we are crossing your paths this week, so that wemay be of mutual benefit, one to the other. As president of this division, my contacts witli yon for the past two years haye been pleasant and most helpful to me. Since my term ends this year, I wish to express my appreciation to you for the privilege of serving you. As we begin the program of the week, we wish to emphasize the responsibilities and the opportunities that are ours as homemakers, whether we come from the farm or the city home. We appreciate more than ever before that the farm home problem and the city home problem are not so different — for each homemaker must lay the foun - dation in the best manner possible, for the physical, mental and spiritual development of her family. Perhaps the farm mother needs to take a more personal responsibility toward the achievement of these aims, and if so, she needs more encouragement and better op - portunities presented to her. The time has passed when the rural woman can point to her urban sister and say, "She has more oppor - tunities that I. She lives in the midst of political and social activity; she knows what is going on; let her assume her civic responsibility." Today the farm woman reads the same magazines and listens to the same radio programs as the city woman. Should she not assume more responsibilities along with her increased knowledge and op - portunities? </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Ruth Bryan Owen once said, " 'A woman's place is in the nome but home has expanded much since that was said. We find our hoys and girls moving about in a space as big as an automobile can travel in every direction from the home itself. It would be foolish for me to feel secure in keeping the inside of my house safe for my children, if the community in which they live is not a safe place for my boy and girl." More and more we realize the need of women as leaders in national affairs. This is shown by the calls that come from rural women, ask - ing for studies about citizenship and legislation. Women are being interested as a result of the injustices which they have suffered and by evidence of graft in many public places. Just as we need a woman's viewpoint to solve many problems in the home, we will And that trained and intelligent women placed in positions of public responsibility will cause a reaction that will be favorable to the home. Surely a farm woman, with her background of industry and economy, will be able to show efficiency as well as economy in governmental expenditures. I feel that Organized Agriculture has brought to our nation the most effective and complete service of any, ever offered to the rural home. It is developing a leadership that will make itself felt in our national affairs in a very short time. If you doubt it, I ask you to attend a National Conference of Rural Women, such as I was recently privileged to do. Meet rural womeii from every section of our nation and watch their reaction upon the questions that face agriculture to - day. Listen to their problems, and to their attempts to solve them. These women are truly acquainting themselves with questions of vital interest to agriculture and are acquiring an understanding of the prob - lems facing the farmer, and the nation as a whole. They are studying governmental expenditures and hoping for a tax system that will be adequate to meet the needs of today, without leaving burdens on the shoulders of their children and their children's children. Many of these questions we shall touch upon this week. Through - out our program of the week you will have glimpses of what the Ne - braska rural women are thinking about, for you will have real farm mothers talk to you as well as trained specialists. ' ■• • Beecher said, "As ships meet at sea, a moment together, when words of greeting must be spoken, and then away upon the deep, so men meet in this world, and I think we should cross no man's path without hailing him and if he needs, giving him supplies." As we continue our program our earnest wish is that you may some time during this week receive something for which you have felt a need. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Miss Belle Lowe came from the Iowa State College at Ames, Iowa, where she Is Associate Professor of Foods and Nutrition. Miss Lowe Is a leading authority in experimental cookery and is the author of a recent book on that subject. PROBLEMS IN CAKE MAKING MISS BELLE LOWE In cake-making there is no one method of mixing or making which always produces an excellent cake. The mixing and the pro - portion of ingredients can be varied and the temperature of baking can be varied to a certain extent. So if you have excellent cakes from a particular method of combination, from a certain recipe, or from certain Ingredients, it is better not to change them. But occasionally one likes to try changes, or wishes to use more economical materials. Hence, nearly all of us occasionally try some recipes that are not so successful, or when ,we change some of the ingredients in one of our favorite recipes, the results are not up to standard. As I understand it, this talk today is principally to tell about the use of lard in cake. Therefore, our subject is limited to cakes con - taining fats. However, I would like to take up some problems about cakes in general before considering lard cakes. In cakes containing fat, the principal ingredients are sugar, eggs, a liquid, such as milk, water, or fruit juice, fat. flour and baking powder. This gives a total of six ingredients. Flavoring and salt are added for flavor, but do not affect the texture of the cake as do these other six Ingredients. The proportion of each can be changed to a certain extent, which gives us different recipes, but there is always a limit to which any ingredient can be increased and beyond which the texture of the cake becomes poorer. This means there must be a balancing of certain ingredients. If sugar is increased beyond a certain limit, without increasing the length of mixing at the same time, a cake that falls is the result. The cake is coarse, gummy, sticky, rather good tasting, yet one that we apologize for. Too small a proportion of flour will increase the tendency to fall when sugar is increased. We often say such a cake is too rich and lay the blame on using too much fat, when it is really the proportion of sugar that causes the trouble. The quantity of egg can be too small or too large, the latter usually being more serious. If too large, the cake tastes "eggy" and has a tendency to be rubbery and tough, unless increased egg is counter - acted by beating the egg very thoroughly, which may increase the crumbliness of the cake. Too much fat decreases the volume, but it does not fall, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION crumb is greasy, though very tender. Too much flour increases the dryness and the texture is called bready. Baking powder is one of the very important ingredients in cake, as we all know. But I wonder if any of us realize that very fre - quently too much baking powder is used. I remember that a long time ago I thought if I rounded the teaspoons of making powder that it would improve the texture of the cake. It was only gradually that I came to realize that in many recipes the texture of the cake is im - proved if the baking powder is reduced. The function of the baking powder is to produce gas. If too much gas is produced, the cake rises in proportion to the amount of gas. The cell walls of the batter are elastic, until set by coagulation ol the proteins. They will stretch, but they are like balloons; if stretched too far, they break. When too many cells break, the cake falls, after coming up high in the pan or running over the top of the pan. If only a slight excess ot baking powder is used, there may be a slight depression in the center of the cake. Few of us use a large excess. It is the slight excess that causes the trouble in most in - stances. The cell walls are stretched until more break than should In order to have a fine-textured cake. The cake is very porous; that is, the crumb is more coarse and the cake crumbles readily. In fact, crumbliness is one of the best indications of using too much baking powder. Such cakes are not so good on the second day and are much better If eaten while still warm. There is a quality about a good cake which is often called "velveti - ness" or silkiness, that increases the pleasure of eating the cake. If cakes have this quality they keep better and do not stale so quickly. A cake with too much baking powder stales more rapidly, the speed being related to the excess of baking powder used; the more baking powder, the quicker the staling. The crumb of cake with too much baking powder has a slight harshness, a more flinty feel on the palate or to the finger, which may not be so noticeable, unless compared side by side with a velvety cake. '. ■ .. ■■■■■ Methods of Mixing Anyone who is accustomed to preparing food knows that methods of combining and the technique of the operator are Important, but because fairly good methods have been worked out through the years, we are apt to minimize the importance of combining ingredients. Have any of you ever obtained from one of your friends a recipe for a product that you thought excellent, yet when you used the recipe, you always had poor results with it? The fault may have been in the method of combining. I have several recipes that have certain tricks in combining and when someone asks for them all I would need to do </seg>
            <seg id="p294">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to insure that they would never have success with the recipes is to not mention these techniques, even though all the ingredients and the correct proportions are given. Excellent cooks often have techniques they do not even know about. If you ask them for a recipe, they give the proportion, but fail to mention certain things that they do, which they suppose every - one else does. I have a fairly good scientific training, but one soon finds that pure science does not answer all the questions about cook - ing. It is only in the last ten years that we have obtained a better understanding of the effect of method of combination and other fac - tors upon colloidal materials, but many things have to be tried ex - perimentally to find out how they will work. There are too many factors involved for a pure science to give us the result without a trial and error method. I have watched good practical cooks, and as I mentioned before, they usually are not conscious of the most important part of their success — that is, their technique. All excellent cooks whom I have watched beat eggs well, so they are light and foamy to blend with dough mixtures. They blend fat and sugar thoroughly and often have particular little quirks for adding the flour or liquid. They give more care to certain points of combining which some of us may slight. Lard Since you raise a lot of hogs in Nebraska, you have probably heard a lot about corn, hogs, and lard. In Iowa, we have heard a great deal, because we raise a large number of hogs. In the late spring of 1932, among other things, we were asked to find the value of lard in cake making. Why did housewives use Crisco, Snowdrift, or some other fat if they did not use butter? Why did bakers not use lard in cake making? We had done some work with lard in our experi - mental laboratory, but up to this time had not succeeded in obtaining good cakes with lard. In fact, they were usually poor. Do not mis - understand me, for by poor I do not mean they were not edible, but they were certainly not superior. The Animal Husbandry Department started to produce lards of known history, that is, from animals whose history and feed were known. There was nothing for our laboratory to do but come across with some method that would produce cakes from lard, with textures equal to those from butter, hydrogenated oils, or hydrogenated lard. The question was, how? We had determined some factors which influenced the texture of cakes. We had cut the amount of baking powder to a minimum, though at that time we had not yet determined the optimum amounts of different brands of baking powders. We also knew the effect of </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION temperature' of the materials on cake texture. If the materials are too cold they do not blend readily. If too warm, the dough develops rapidly so that unless mixing time is decidedly shortened, the cake is tougher and more bready. The optimum temperature for the ma - terials seems to be around seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit, which is about room temperature. Have you ever tried to spread hard butter on bread? It does not mix in a batter any better than that when it is hard. Sugar dissolves more rapidly at a higher temperature. Flour proteins absorb water more rapidly at room temperature than when cold. Have you ever noticed anyone take milk, eggs and fat from the refrigerator and use them immediately? When they do, they are decreasing the chances for a good cake, even with fats that are rendered plastic in their manufacture and the amount of work is also increased, and particularly if the refrigerator is a mechanical one, for it is colder than the old ice type of refrigerators. If a fat is hard it does not cream and it requires a long time to soften it. After it is softened, the operator is often tired and is too worn out to cream it well. It is easier and quicker .to set the materials out in the room for a time so they may reach room temperature. By actually measuring the amount of air enclosed in a creamed mixture we found that if the fat were very soft, air is enclosed more rapidly. For each fat this meant that it should be soft enough so that a spoon could be pulled through it easily, leaving a mark, yet not quite melted enough so that this mark disappeared too rapidly. We also found that it was a waste of time to stir the fat alone, for more air was enclosed after some of the sugar was added. If cream - ing is done by hand with a spoon, add some sugar at the start and keep adding sugar gradually, but for a mixer all the sugar may be added at one time. Eggs also beat to better volume and more readily if at room temperature. Since we had found that the conventional type of mixing cake did not work so well with lard, it indicated trying some other methods. I had never actually counted the number of ways by which a cake might be mixed before we started this work. Since baking powder is usually mixed with flour, there are five main ingredients, namely, fat, sugar, eggs, flour and milk. If the order of mixing is varied, that is de - pending upon which ingredient is added first, second, third, fourth, and fifth, there are one hundred twenty possible methods of mixing. If each material is divided, then the number can be increased ac - cordingly. For example, half of the sugar may be creamed with the fat, the other half used with the eggs, whereas flour may be added in different proportions. •'.'•.••■ We had fifty-six lards to test. In addition we were using eight commercial fats and oils for comparative purposes. Forty-five of </seg>
            <seg id="p296">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE these lards were rendered from individual hogs; that is, the fat from each hog was kept separate from that of other hogs. In addition the kind of feed that each hog had received was known and the lards were all rendered alike. In addition the chemistry department determined thirteen chemical and physical constants, such as melting points, smoking point, etc. One of the culinary tests was to use the fats in cake. In addition where were creaming tests, four shortening tests and two frying tests. The time was too short to work out the best method of mixing for lard, before the lards had to be tested. Therefore, we had to find a method that gave good results with lard, use it for a standard to test the fats, and then test other methods later during the winter. There was not much chance of our hitting upon the best method for the first trials. We were testing recipes for a lard bulletin. Our first suggestion for mixing came from a spice cake, contain - ing lard but no eggs. This spice cake made with lard was exceptionally nice and velvety. We then remembered that when we added egg yolks or beaten whole eggs to the creamed lard and sugar, that they caused separation of the creamed mixture. It became soft and more liquid. This suggested that in plain cake we might try adding the egg towards the last of mixing, instead of following the conventional methods. We tried two variations. In the one, the whole beaten egg was added to the milk, stirred eight or ten times, then the flour and milk - egg mixture were added alternately in three portions to the creamed mixture. For the other variation the beaten eggs were added last. In the first few tests the method of adding the beaten eggs to the milk gave better texture cakes and so Miss Martin, who was making the tests, called it her standard method, because she used this method as a standard to test the various fats. This method proved successful with other fats also. During the year it consistently gave better results than adding the beaten eggs last. Many lards are rather soft, and when creamed give a soupy mix - ture. So Miss Martin thought if she added a small portion of flour to the creamed fat and sugar, especially if the lard was very soft, that it might stiffen the batter and give a better textured cake. She tried this and observed two things. By adding as much as half the flour to the creamed fat and sugar all the air was forced out of the creamed mix - ture, yet the cake volumes were larger than by the conventional or standard methods. This was interesting, for in publications previous to this time, it was stated that good cake volume depended upon good creaming volume. Yet tests showed that it seemed necessary to cream the fat and sugar to insure good blending of the materials. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION . The second observation was that this method of adding part ot the flour to the creamed mixture, improved the texture of cakes made with soft fats or oils, but did not work so well with butter or hydro - genated fats. While Miss Martin was working on this method of adding flour to the creamed mixture, we had a report from a meeting of the Bakery Engineers' Society, which met in March, at which someone reported practically this same order of combining ingredi - ents, calling it the Flour-Batter method. Since Miss Martin's order was so similar she used the same name for the method as that given by the Bakery Engineers. But Miss Martin was not satisfied, she thought that if the air in - corporated by creaming were preserved and the best of the Flour- Batter method incorporated that the cakes might be improved. After several trials, she divided the sugar in two portions. The fat and one portion of the sugar were creamed together. She found she obtained a larger creaming volume when only half the sugar was used with the fat. Next she folded in a small portion of the flour with a spoon. Then she added flour and milk alternately in three portions. Lastly she took the second portion of sugar, and added it to the whole egg gradually, beating it thoroughly until light and foamy. The whole egg and sugar gave a mixture that had small air cells, and looked much like the meringues of sugar and egg white, except for the yellow color. This rather stiff, viscous, foamy mixture was folded into the cake batter last. One name might have been as good as another, but since Miss Martin started by trying to modify the Flour-Batter method, she called this last method the "Modified-Flour-Batter" method. However, it was two or three steps removed from the original Flour-Batter method. This Modified-Flour-Batter method seemed to work equally well with both soft and hard fats. It also gave the best cakes we have ever ob - tained with oils. We have further tested this method in a series of butter cakes this last summer and fall. One of the outstanding char - acteristics of this method is the velvety or silky texture of the crumb. Classifications of lard depend upon the location on the carcass of the fats used in the lard, the method of rendering, and the method of cooling employed. This can give many variations as can be seen. A very small proportion of the lards on the market are made from leaf fat alone. Other lards are made from mixtures of leaf, cutting and killing fats, two or more of these fats being combined for rendering. The term cutting fat refers to the fat trimmed from hog carcasses, whereas killing fat refers to the fat taken from around the internal organs. The methods of rendering are open kettle, prime steam, and dry rendering. Commercially the open kettle rendering is similar to the </seg>
            <seg id="p298">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE - method used on the farm. Prime steam rendering is done by turning steam into the fat, using pressure, and finally letting the fat float to the top and draining it off. By dry rendering the fat is placed in a kettle under vacuum, which draws off the moisture rapidly. The dry rendered lard is very similar to the open kettle rendered lards. The bulk of the lard made commercially is prime steam lard. On the Chicago Board of Trade, prime steam lard is known as standard lard. Prime steam lard is often bleached, which lessens its keeping quality. I wonder why housewives have been taught to buy a pure white lard. The creamy colored lards are usually preferable. Smooth lard is obtained by cooling the lard quickly. Grainy lard is obtained by cooling slowly in a vat or vessel. Carton lard is usually smooth lard, for by quick chilling, the oil seems to separate from the lard less readily. ' By the way, do all of you know that the term "leaf" in the name of a lard does not always' indicate that the lard is made from leaf fat. If there is no space between or if a hyphen connects the rest of the word to leaf, it does not indicate a lard made from leaf fat. For example, Silverleaf lard is, a prime steam rendered lard and con - tains no leaf fat. The word Silverleaf is written as one word, with no space between Silver and leaf. Also Laurel-Leaf is a prime steam rendered lard. But this brand name lias a hyphen between Laurel, and leaf. The firmness of the bird depends upon the feed which the animal received as well as other factors. Feeds Affect Firmness Some of the lards we have used from hogs fed certain soy bean mixtures are nearly as soft as oils. Even at refrigerator temperatures they are like thick soups. Some of the firmest birds from our experi - mental lots were produced from corn-fed hogs. Small grains we're not included in large amounts in our experimental rations, but I under - stand from work done at Nebraska, that wheat, rye, etc., may produce firmer lards than corn Although lard is extensively used, it appears to be about the least uniform of any product marketed in such large quantities. It lacks uniformity in firmness, odor and other characteristics. Personally, of these different variables, I think the odor is the most difficult with which to cope. Lard always has some odor. I like the odor of open kettle rendered lards, which are mild. To me, prime steam lard has a more disagreeable odor. One of the most interesting observations we have made in our study of lards from different animals is the wide variation in odor, even when only leaf fat and an equal weight of back fat are used and the lard is always rendered in the same way. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Many of the lards from hogs fed soy bean mixtures were disagree - able in odor, the odor varying considerably in strength and kind. Some had a nauseating odor, others had a disagreeable odor. The nauseat - ing one more nearly resembled barnyard odors. But proof that it is not entirely due to the feed was shown by the fact that lard from two pigs on the standard ration had nauseating odors. One of the men on our campus suggested that some pigs might be bothered with B. O. as well as some humans. Probably a fitting suggestion. The most surprising thing about these disagreeable lard odors, which were not rancidity or typical lard odors, was that they were volatile and escaped during the mixing and baking. Thus they were not noticeable in baked products, even by the individual who has the keenest sense of smell of any one in the department. Yet after I had had these odors fanned up in my face during mixing, I had some - what of a complex against tasting the baked product, and in fact often induced the other fellow to try it first, and would be surprised that the odor was not present in the product. The typical lard odor often remains in the product, but I am referring to certain disagreeable odors encountered in some lards. I can understand why some house - wives dislike to use some lards. Of course when these lards are mixed with other lards, the disagreeable odors would be lessened. The firmer lards and softer lards can be used with equally good results in pastry. By changing the method of mixing, both soft and firm lards can be used to produce cakes of excellent texture. But the odor problem seems to me to be the problem of the producer and manufacturer of lard to solve. TUESDAY AFTERNOON MRS. MARSHALL ROSS, PRESIDING Our meeting was opened with music under the direction of Mary Hall Thomas, who presented the Hartley School Glee Club. They were assisted by Mrs. Lucy F. Medlar, Reader. The program of music used was that of Christmas Carols presented in old Mummer's costumes and lanters as were used in early times. The following was on their program: "Home" by the Glee Club "Silent Night, Holy Night" with Mrs. Medlar reading the story concerning the song, which follows. "Tenderly Sleeping" "The First Noel" "Silent Night, Holy Night" "Who brought you into being, Song?" </seg>
            <seg id="p300">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This question with its answer, in the form of a motto, is set high over the door of the simple old school-house residence in the tiny Aus - trian village of Arnsdorf. Here this best loved of all Christmas songs had its birth. On Christmas eve, 1818, Franz Gruber arranged a simple melody to fit the words of a Christmas poem written by his good friend Josef Mohr; this was the well-loved "Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht". That evening it was sung for the first time, in the parish church of St. Nicholas at Oberndorf. Josef Mohr, author of the poem, was the pastor, and Franz Gruber, composer of the music, was church organist and also school-master in the near-by village of Arnsdorf. For these facts and others of equal interest we are indebted to Miss Hazel Gertrude Kinscella who interviewed in his own home the grandson of the composer, and wrote the story for the Christmas number of Better Homes and Gardens last year. This simple song circulated from its little valley to the great towns of Europe, whence it traveled on its way about the world. Though the English words constitute a very free translation of the original "Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht," we find in them the same spirit and atmosphere. It is, as Miss Kinscella says, "a hauntingly tender Christ - mas song which the world will sing as long as the Festival of Christ - mas is celebrated." I I think that Josef Mohr, pastor of St. Nicholas, must have been a very devout man, very sensitive to the presence of God. How clear to his spirit was the Christmas picture, and how he paints for us its simple beauty in these three brief stanzas. The back-ground — silent night, holy night; set in radiance, the Child and His mother; shep - herds in fear of heavenly voices; the light of love from his Savior's face — redeeming love— love divine, coming down at Christmas; and over and all around, — silent night, holy night! "Silent night! Holy night! All is calm, all is bright; Round yon virgin mother and Child! Holy Infant, so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace. "Silent night; Holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight! Glories stream from heaven afar, </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia! Christ, the Savior, is born! Christ, the Savior, is born! "Silent night; Holy night! Son of God, love's pure light, Radiant beams from thy holy face. With the dawn of redeeming grace, Jesus, Lord, at thy birth, Jesus, Lord, at thy birth." ( The words of the song were read as the choir hummed "Silent Night.") As the programs for these meetings are arranged each year, the Program Committee try to include some special number which will emphasize music, pictures, art, or books. This year emphasis was given to good reading. Mrs. Norma Kidd Green, who is a home - maker of Lincoln, a student of English literature, and who has read extensively, gave helpful suggestions for worth while reading. Mrs. Green showed a timely exhibit of books in which homemakers would be interested and gave generously of her time for conferences with homemakers who wished to confer with her after her talk. BOOKS ARE FRIENDS MRS. NORMA KIDD GREEN I shall begin this more or less rambling discourse somewhat after the manner of a sermon. (Not that I would infer that sermons are rambling.) I shall, however, borrow from the manner of a sermon to the extent that I shall take a text. It is, after all, the way most dissertations on life begin. From finding a terse, penetrating com - ment which brings us up short with its impressive statement of some truth, we go on to muse upon it and to think over the various ways in which we feel it is true. So my text, although not from chapter this or verse that, is from a bit of poetry, in fact only a motto, called "Books". It is by Emilie Poulson who chiefly wrote for children, but who said many things that adults may well consider. "Books are keys to wisdom's treasure. Books are gates to lands of pleasure, Books are paths that upward lead, Books are friends — come, let us read." So, — Books are friends! Now as in everything else we cannot make our statements too </seg>
            <seg id="p302">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE general, for we know that all books are not friends to even the most bookish people and that maybe no books are friends to some people. But nevertheless, I maintain that books, some books — many books, can be friends to anybody if that person will put forth a little effort and cultivate those friends. You do not become friends with another woman without ever speaking to her, without visiting her and finding out what she is like, what she enjoys and what she thinks. No more will you make friends with books so long as you feel that they belong only in book shops, on library shelves or placed decoratively on your parlor table. With people we think that the other person should come half way in making friends and often our pride holds us back from making even fifty-one per cent of the advances. But with books the author has gone all of his "half-way", or really about three-fourths of the way, for a book will quickly bring you all the changes of mood, the finest thoughts and the deepest philosophies that it takes you years of companion - ship to find out in your human friends. Now the next thing, of course, that everyone will say is, "But I haven't time to read." Well, to be sure, the person who is always looking forward to when he will have time to read will never be a great reader, because if books have not been necessary enough to fill in the little moments of time, they will not be the things which will occupy the hours when he has them at his disposal. I know you are busy, for I keep house myself, and for a fair-sized family. There were a number of years when about all the reading I did was while I nursed the baby. I believe that because lately I have been talking about books and can discuss a few of the newer publications, most of my friends visualize me as spending a full eight hours a day with my nose in a book. While I hardly ever read longer than thirty minutes at a time, often it is only five or ten minutes. It is beyond a doubt an advantage to read quickly, which may part - ly be a matter of practice, but may be something in the method. Walter Pitkin who is writing a good deal now as to the way in which we can make the most of our abilities and energies, has written a book on "The Art of Rapid Reading". It contains some very practical suggestions as to speedily covering the printed page. But making use of little moments can be of advantage to the busy housewife. I find you can read some while you iron or even while you mend. Prop an open book or your magazine beside you — read a paragraph or a sentence or so, and think it over while you set the patch in the overall knee. This assumes, of course, that your reading is something which is worth thinking over. </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION After all. that is probably the secret of whether or not we read — is it worth thinking over? Which brings us to the consideration of what shall be the fundamental attitude toward books. Are books just something to help us pass away the time which is not pressingly filled with, other duties, or are books something to help us find our way through life? Few of us would consider that our friends are only to keep us from being bored, but would admit that friends are worth while because we share with them our greatest moments as well as our more trivial ones. You enjoy receiving a tiny npte from a friend; often seeing some - one drive by and wave to you will brighten the day. Just such little refreshing glimpses can be gained from books without the expenditure of more than a minute or two. , Occasionally it is confusing to try to select the books we would most enjoy. To be set down suddenly in a library or book shop would be like happening in on a big church dinner made up almost entire - ly of strangers. But libraries and book shops, as should all regulated social affairs, have what we might call assisting hostesses, who see that people are properly introduced to one another. So out of the crowd comes a kindly person who says, "Do come over here, I want you to meet Mrs. Smith. She has just finished a quilt of that pattern you showed me last week. She says it is called the 'Rocky Glen'," or "Here is Mrs. Jones with whom I know you will enjoy visiting, be - cause she has the most beautiful variety of perennials of anyone in this neighborhood. I have always remembered your beautiful delphin - iums last summer." Now it is just as possible for someone to say, "Have you read Ruth Finley's book 'Patchwork Quilts'? It has diagrams of over one hundred quilt patterns and the most fascinating stories of how some of the old patterns received their names"; or, — "Wouldn't you be interested in Ortloft's little book 'Perennial Gar - dens'? It is so practical and has charts of garden plans and many good pointers on the care of-different perennials." But you may not often get to a library or a book shop, — so then the review columns of your magazines will serve as the steering com - mittee. So many magazines give some discussion of books and others probably would if their readers demanded it. Then the Library Com - mission will help you, the workers in the Extension Service, and I would be only too happy to send you lists and comments on different books. A lending list in one's own neighborhood might be fun, for with six women each buying one book, you could pass them around and everyone have the fun of reading all six during the winter. So you can be introduced to these friends formally and informally and if you will but go beyond the introduction, you will find much joy and satisfaction. You may not discover very close friends right at </seg>
            <seg id="p304">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE first, or you may find that when first introduced you do not feel drawn to that book. Haven't you sometimes found that people improve on acquaintance and that those are usually the ones best worth knowing? When my children start on some of the older books, the ones that are not written to catch one's attention with the first sentence, but to lay carefully a background for the action even though it takes one-sixth of the book, I always say, "Well, read ten chapters and then if you aren't interested, put it aside." But the new friend usually improves on acquaintance and they finish the book. ,You, no doubt, have friends who differ very greatly from you in many of their points of view, who Have certain interests for which you do not care at all, but then in other ways you are most companion - able. You wouldn't think of insisting that they make themselves over just to suit you, but you enjoy the things that you do have in com - mon. So don't demand that everything about a book should appeal to you or that you should agree with everything in it. I havfe been reading "Out, of My Life and Thought" by Albert Schweitzer. Schweit - zer is an Alsatian who has plunged deeply into a variety of fields. He is a teacher, a philosopher, a preacher, a writer of religious books, a musician and a medical missionary. I do not know enough of music to appreciate his long discussions of just how one should lift the fingers from the keyboard to obtain just the right effect; but, I have greatly enjoyed his comments on life in general, his ideas as to what place religion should have in our lives and have stood amazed at his ideal of self sacrifice. Just so, we do not wish to cast a book aside because we do not agree with the first chapters. John Ruskin said that the easy thing to say. the thing we want to say about a book is, " 'How good this is,' or 'That's exactly what I think.' Of course this is natural, for we all like to have people agree with us. It is particularly flattering to find that the great or the near great hold the same opinions as ourselves. I'm sure that is why I enjoy Gamliel Bradford's Journal, because he feels as I do about reforms and about moving pictures." Ruskin went •on to say, however, "But the right feeling is, 'How strange that is! I never thought of that before and yet I see it is true, or if I do not now, I hope I shall some day! — at least be sure that you go to the author to get at his meaning, not to find yours. Judge it afterwards if you think yourself qualified to do so; but ascertain it first." And so further with Bradford, I have not yet been able to put into practice entirely some of his ideas as to how one should read fiction, hut I shall keep trying and maybe sometime I shall come to it. I would not suggest that you always seek the books which are different and contrary to your thinking. The friend who stirs you up and stimulates you to different lines of thought is only one of the kinds of friends you need. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION We would all, no doubt, first think of our old friends, those who are tried and true, whose memories go back to our own girlhood mem - ories, who can with us, as Bradford say_7 "cover the barren places with the soft snow flakes of 'Do you remember so-and-so?* " I like to look around on people's book shelves and I nearly always find a corner of rather well worn books, of the old friends, probably, Little Women, Hiawatha, David Copperfield, Alice in Wonderland, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, or The Count of Monte Cristo. Their owners probably seldom read them now, parts of them may be almost memorized, but it is like having photographs around, just the sight of the book recalls the friend. The old friends aren't entirely children's books; they are the great ones of the ages, the ones that are still worth printing and worth reading over and over again. How much more valuable to hold to such friends than to those who are here today and gone tomorrow and are noticed because they are new. Some months ago a certain review was announced in Lincoln of a book which had been published twenty years or more. A woman said to me, "Why is anyone reviewing that now?" Well, why not? One of my old friends is a copy of Stevenson's poetry; its olive green leather cover is well rubbed and scarred from having been packed often in trunks and traveling bags. It is almost like taking certain trips again when I think of some of the times and the places it has been with me. I like in the evening to read — "Evensong." The embers of the day are red Beyond the murky hill. The kitchen smokes; the bed In the darkling house is spread, The great sky darkens overhead, And the great woods are shrill. So far I have been led, Lord, by Thy will; So far I have followed, Lord, and wondered still. The breeze from the embalmed land Blows sudden toward the shore And claps my cottage door. I hear the signal. Lord — I understand. The night at Thy command Comes. I will eat and sleep and will not question more. Whether they be old friends or new friends we enjoy those with a sense of humor, who see the happy things of life even when they be from the point of view of amused indulgence of "What fools we mortals be!" It does us good to laugh even though sometimes it may </seg>
            <seg id="p306">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE J ' uo u.i our own expense. I would recommend to you, Wodehouse, O. Henry, A. A. Milne, and at some times J. B. Priestly, for example; a bit from O'Hern's "Sociology in Serge and Straw". Christopher Morley reminds us that there are two things we forget about, the things we never see and the ones that we see all the time. If this be so, it may be that the women living in the open country may occasionally need to be reminded of the beauties of nature as much as the women who live on a crowded city street. Some people bring us a fresh breath of outdoor air and so do some books. One woman wrote to the publisher after reading Gladys Hasty Carroll's "As the Earth Turns" and said that she had had to lay the book down and go out-of-doors to look around her to appreciate the beautiful things which she had been taking too much for granted. Might I also call your attention to the "Nature Lover's Knapsack." a collection of out - of-door poetry, which can be tucked into a pocket for a walk or tucked up on the kitchen window sill where it will be right at hand. While we are glad to grow in appreciation of the things close at hand, many of us still turn out- thoughts a bit longingly to the far distant places. How many would love to travel and see the strange wonders of the world! In all probability only a few of us will ever venture very far from our native land, yet we can go through the experiences of others. I know of a woman who is becoming an auth - ority on small ocean shell flsh, yet much of the time she is too ill even to go down to the shore. The ocean is brought to her a bucket full at a time by the other members of the family. But with her micros - copes and her patient study, she knows much more about the ocean than many a traveler who has sailed miles and miles on its surface. Many people know more of distant lands than the traveler who, drop - ping in at a sea coast town, tries only to find American food or a sou - venir to take home. There is a host of books to serve such purposes. For instance: "The House of Exile," by Nora Wain, which gives one an intimate picture of Chinese family life; "The Daughter of a Samurai" is the biography oi Madame Sugimoto who tells delightfully of her early education and childhood memories in old Japan; "Pageant", by G. B. Lancaster takes one to Tasmania to follow the fortunes of one family for some generations; "Dr. Luke of the Lab - rador" introduces one to a courageous neighbor to the north; or one may follow Dr. Dickey to the head waters of the Orinoco in his "My Jungle Book." More important than gaining different points of view, than learn - ing of things far away, or even of enjoying things near at hand is the adjusting of our own thinking and philosophy as to our own parti - cular Job and our own particular corner in the world. Some people never seem to have much trouble doing this and others struggle and </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION fume, do a lot of wondering and a lot of worrying before they come to see just how they can best make the most of their own bit of living. Of all the friends that are good friends, the best are those who can help us in this adjustment. I think usually it is a friend that is a little older than we are, someone who has done about the same things and gone a little further on the road where they can look back and see the forest and not the trees. -For the younger homemaker there is nothing equal to the friendship of an older woman whose family is grown around her and yet who can remember some of the per - plexities and the problems of her earlier days. Truly the counsel of such women can be precious words of wisdom. I am over and over thankful for one woman to whom I often turn when I cannot quite see how to handle some situation. Yet one of the most illuminating things that has ever come to me in the matter of my job of home - making came from a book. And that book — in fact that paragraph or so, has been a friendly hand many a time. Dorothy Canfield Fisher has thought deeply and written much on family affairs, but 1 was surprised one day to find in one paragraph all she had said in a half dozen novels. That paragraph reillumined the message of the novels and clarified a lot of the things I had tried to think out about my own family. In the chapter called "Moral Sunshine" in her book "Mothers and Children," Mrs. Fisher says that doctors and nurses have educated us to see that the tiny baby needs only clean milk, sterile nursing bottles and warm feet. That it is for our own satisfaction only that we add embroidered petticoats and be-ribboned bonnets. But, she feels that no one has been quite so clear or so insistent in teaching us just what are the really essential elements for the proper growth of older chil - dren. So, Mrs. Fisher goes on to list these essentials, which, she says, "can be secured in a little five room house, in any moderate sized American town or village, or in the country, as easily as in a mil - lionaire's mansion." I would like to add that some of them are more easily secured in the small town or country than in the city. Here are those essentials: "Peace and harmony among the adults of the family; an atmosphere of purposeful, cheerful industry and clear - sightedness towards the children; and for them (the children) a life of intellectual freedom and physical activity." I do feel that the "physical activity" is much more easily secured out of the city and the "purposeful industry" can be much more apparent to the children on the farm, for in the city father's activities are often so remote as to be very vague to the child and there is the constant temptation for mother to buzz a great deal with a certain pseudo-industrlousness that she must admit to herself and the children soon come to feel is not very purposeful. .-'-•*' </seg>
            <seg id="p308">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE But don't you see how this paragraph out of a friendly book can come to be a sort of measuring stick to use for family plans? You can say, "Will doing, buying or thinking this way, add to or detract from the peace and harmony that must abide between me and mine?" "In doing this am I really maintaining a cheerful and purposeful in - dustry?" "By planning this way am I really being clear-sighted to - ward my children, is this going to help them to grow up to be in - dependent and self-reliant or am 1 acting thus because I like to feel that I am important to them?" "Will this new house or this new piece of furniture add to the children's chances for physical activity or will it be so important to me that I shall always be saying, 'Don't, Don't, Don't'?" "Am I urging my children to spend much time on this or that because they like it or because I do?" and so you can go on, having friendly counsel at hand in all your planning. Re-rending I have said little about re-reading and yet we can't have friends whom we have met but once, so it stands to reason that if books are to be friends, we read them again and again. Charles Bray says, "Books, to me, are ever new; the books may be the same, but I am changed. Every seven years gives me a different, often a higher appreciation of those I like. Every good book is worth reading three times at least." Let me tell you of one book that I read over and over, in which every seven years or so I see something different because I am differ - ent myself. It is Dorothy Canfield Fisher's "The Bent Twig". It is a novel showing a home which has all the essentials which Mrs. Fisher outlines, although to the rest of the community, it seems "queer". But the twig, the elder daughter of the family, was bent in the right direction, although the parents did not always feel sure of their work, just as you and I do not always feel sure of ours. As a contrast to this bending, there runs the story of a boy, a distant connection of the family who had wealth and travel and "advantages" but who lived in an atmosphere of laziness and adult anger and intrigue, and she depicts the pitiful result of that bending. When I first read the book I saw only the college days and the girl's desire for a home "like other people's" later her attitude toward her suitors and her struggle to decide between wealth and character. And of recent years I can read it over and over to catch the picture of the mother and why she had that kind of a home and how cour - ageously she puts forth high ideals and then stepped aside to let the children feel their own way until they measured up to those ideals, not because they had been told to, but because they knew from ex - perience, influenced, of course, by their training, that those ideals were the best. Yes, books can be friends! </seg>

"IT ALL GOES IN A LIFE TIME" IN THE SAND HILLS OF NEBRASKA FROM 1880 TO 1033 MRS. LULU KORTZ HUDSON "Among all peoples land is the basis of existence; its ownership in - volves the social spirit of a people." When people settle in a new country they study to protect themselves from the pitiful hardships of life, they learn by hard experience how to live off the new land, how to shelter themselves from storms and defend themselves from dangers, how to provide themselves with food, what is good, what is harmful. Two of the essential foods of this new country were grain and cattle. The Union Pacific had extended west across Nebraska. There were no north and south railroads. There were vast herds of cheap cattle in the South grown up from Civil War times when the owners were away at the front, and no one was left at home to care for the stock and brand the calves. A strip of land a mile wide, later called the Chisholm trail, was surveyed from South Texas to Dodge City, Kansas, as a right-of-way for the boss, his trail-drivers and his herd. No damages were collected within its limits. Sometimes it was necessary to drive off the trail to a home - stead for water, then $10.00 or $20.00 was usually paid for dam - ages. If cattle became exhausted on the trail the next trail-driver rounded them up and brought them north for their owner. A trail - herd was 3,000 to 5,000 head of long horn cattle valued at about $3.00 each. I have often heard my husband say: "I surely liked to hear the clink of the horns and the rattle of the hoofs just all day long as they moved. When a herd of cattle moved up over a hill, they flowed down in the valley like a river swaying in and out between its banks." </seg>
            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION . The trail bosses had contracts with the Indian Agencies of Rose - bud, Pine Ridge, Standing Rock and Lower Brule for 40,000 cattle a year. The cattle were taken to the Agencies in the fall, weighed out, and turned over on foot to the agent. They were then branded by the government with a hair brand. In a hair brand the hot iron burns only the hair — not the skin. When the hair is shed, the brand dis - appears. Perhaps some of the cattle may have found their way back and were then resold to the agency. On April 14, 1880, Fort Niobrara was established to furnish pro - tection to cattlemen trailing their herds from Texas to the Niobrara river, Nebraska, there to grow them out on the nutritious native Sand Hills grasses. Thus began the great range cattle industry of the United States. Fort Niobrara was one hundred sixty-miles west from Oakland. Nebraska, at that time the end of the Fremont. Elkhorn and Missouri Valley railroad. The cattle brought the troops, the troops brought the railroad, the railroad brought the homestead settlers and the homestead settlers drove out the large herds of cattle. Sam, my husband, was with a trail-herd which started from Rich - land. Texas under a Scotch-Irish trail-boss named Fitzgerald, headed for Dodge City, Kansas, and thence to Wyoming and Colorado. They had 3.000 steers, a mess-wagon with a tail-end cupboard and an end - gate that let down into a mess-table supported by a hinged leg. Every night a five gallon kettle of beans and side meat was cooked over the campfire, hung on a hook from a tripod. Sometimes they had beef not always — no potatoes, but such vegetables as they could buy along the way. About ten or twelve miles was a day's run. Always the boss scouted on ahead to locate a camp for noon or night where there was water for men and cattle and a sheltered place for bedding down. No man was allowed to own his own saddle horse. Thus he could not so easily become dissatisfied and turn back since he was afoot except for the company mounts. At daylight when the herd began to stir, the herd leader started in front of them. Two pointers at either side and ten men stationed equal distances apart moved on either side and the lag, the inexperi - enced driver, brought up the rear. Following a day's drive, the cattle were not long in bedding down. After the first one dropped down soon the whole herd was settled for the night. That was the time when the cowboys sang to them such songs as "Sam Bass", "The Lone Prairie", and the "Cowboy's Lament". Perhaps they were the first crooners. I pass over the days of the Cattle Kings — not in a real sense community builders. The blizzards of the early and late eighties wiped out many of the big herds since no hay had been provided for them. Then some </seg>
            <seg id="p312">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 01 me trail-drivers and herd managers took homesteads in the hay valleys and had free range for their, cattle on the government-owned hills. This free range ceased with the passage of the Kinkaid home - stead law, giving six hundred forty acres instead of one hundred sixty acres to a homesteader. Many built up their herds and ranches on money borrowed with interest in advance, when cattle were selling at $2.75 and $3.00 per hundred pounds. They could better pay their three per cent a month than farmers can now pay eight and ten per cent per year, for they owned no land, no fences, paid no land taxes, put up no hay, had very little overhead, paid their help $35.00 a month and the help furnished his own bed and cooked his own meals. Chancellor Huntington, of Nebraska Wesleyan University, refused to charge more than seven per cent annually and his banker son Tom was authorized by him to loan his money at that rate to "Christian gentlemen". I recall a circumstance from the year 1888. Money had been borrowed at two and one-half per cent a month, seed wheat bought and planted. It made a luxuriant growth and in July it swayed and billowed in a gentle breeze, ripening yellow in the friendly sun- Shine. A little cloud appeared, it grew yellow and green and black, the rain pattered and the hail dashed and rattled. The pioneer mother stood in the sod-house door and saw the wreck of their wheat field and wondered where they would get their winter's bacon and biscuits. There was a quick recovery. She said: "Let's make ice-cream." With a milk bucket and a syrup pail for a freezer and hail stones for ice, they froze ice-cream and in making merry, rose above their present grief. Those were the days of Doc. Middleton, Kid Wade, and numerous horse and cattle rustlers, who stole for the most part Indian ponies to sell to the homesteaders. The Indians, to recoup themselves, took horses from the cowboys and each was afraid to invade the other's territory to recover his stock. As a result the Vigilantes were or - ganized. '.-'■.■ : .'•■ .' . ' ' : : ■'■'■■'" ' '.' The outlaws were often homesteaders who visited at the far scattered ranches, talked to the children and brought them gifts. Like modern buccaneers in business they were good fellows among their friends. Two things that helped in the development of our sand hills were the Military Post at Fort Niobrara, Nebraska and the Sioux Indian Reservations at Rosebud and Pine Ridge, South Dakota. The soldier's pay and the government issue to the Indians brought money to this region. They both made markets for what the homesteader had to sell — wood chopped on the public domain, cattle and an occasional </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION hog, and grain. Truth compels me to state that many of the uuiutr steaders were kept warm in Waukepaumanie blankets and suits from the Indians and in muskrat caps and mittens bought for little or nothing from the soldiers. The Army post contributed social forms and niceties of living and the reservation sometimes furnished wives for reckless youths, home - sick and believing that civilization would never overtake them. Some of these mixed marriages have turned out well, their children now being influential citizens. Like the Virginia cavaliers, the trail-drivers were mostly gentlemen adventurers without families. No new country is ever developed by bachelors. Whence came wives for them? Some went back to Texas and married their sweethearts, some married the daughters of home - steaders, or young widows, and there were always school teachers who made excellent pioneer wives. In the early eighties a colony of homesteaders from Sullivan, Indiana, under the leadership of a young Methodist minister, Rev. Scamahorn, came to Gordon and settled in Cherry and Sheridan coun - ties. They established churches and schools and set about building orderly communities. The cowboys and the preacher first met at the crossing on the Niobrara River near the twelve-mile cow camp of Zake Newman. The cowboys lined up on the bank and covered him with their guns. They shouted: "Preach." He stopped in mid-stream and delivered the best serman he had. They shouted: "Pray." He prayed. Then they dropped their guns and told him to go on. But he did not go on. He told them he was a Methodist preacher who always took up a collection when he hold religious services. He passed the hat and they threw in silver and bills, a generous offering. It was only a prank and they -knew a good sport when they met one. While the pioneers were waiting until such time as they could make money, they made joy and companionship. With apologies to State Historian A. E. Sheldon, I paraphrase his poem: In those days we used to neighbor All along the Sand Hills road. From Daniel's house to Rowley's And on the Rocky-ford. There was Quigley's ranch At Boiling Springs And Stetter's farther on i And Ballard's and Gillaspie's And another one that's gone. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">KEPORi OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We went forty miles to a funeral And sixty to a dance And everybody eager. Like it was his only chance. A-shaking hands and swapping news And talking heart to heart Before so many houses pushed us all so fur apart. The neighbors now across the street Are kind enough today But it's nothing like the neighbors That lived twenty miles away. No, there's nothing like the neighboring That in early days was seen Before so many people built their houses in between. As I have seen a new country develop, it seems to me the six things that have mattered most are: 1. The tradition and earlier education of its people, their ac - customed occupations and ethical ideals. We believe with the eminent economist, Jesse Macy, that "Human opinions are the real facts. What people believe is important, whether it is true or not. Since the davs of Portia, it is well to maintain a sharp distinction between facts and the interpretation of those facts. The character of social and political institutions is largely determined by opinions, beliefs, and sentiments. and it is the plain duty of every member of society to maintain all his faculties at their maximum of efficiency for the attainment of cor - rect opinions." 2. The climate, soil and lay of the land, whether it is plains or mountains. 3. Natural resources and kind ot roads. Those things determine what will be produced and how it will get to market. 4. Amusements, especially the amusements in a new country - saloons, horse racing, drinking, gambling, card playing, church going basket dinners, picnics, and sewing circles. It is surprising how many of our pleasures center around talking, eating and sewing. 5. Unconventional truthfulness — the long-spun varus of the plains. 6. Reticent self-effacement of the Pioneer. No class of people were more temperamental than early plainsmen. Of the colonies which settled in the Sand Hills each made its own contribution: </seg>
            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The Texas-riders brought courage and adventure; the Virginians brought conventional manners and love of sightly homes; the Germans brought perseverance and thrift; the Danes brought deep family affection and a skill in needlecraft, also good methods in gardening and dairying; the French and Swiss brought success in raising fruits and flowers; the Syrians, in later years, brought fruits and color and music; and the Missourian brought good fellowship. People shared with each other and learned from one another and finally we became a new something, a Sand Hills Region of America. The unbroken sod promised an altar for our household Gods. The youth and strength and vision of men joined hands with the promises of nature in a pledge of unquestioned equality and security for our homes. The center of that home was mother and child. Men and women had struggled for economic freedom so the mother could be safe with her child. Mother "Was there ever a name that lived like this, Will there ever be such another, The angels in Heaven have reared a shrine, To the holy name of Mother. Motherhood is inclusive and exclusive. It brings both inspiration and perspiration. For "So long as we love we serve, and so long as we are loved by others I would almost say that we are indispensable." All people need mothering. The aunt of an Emperor said: "The Emperor had no one to whom he could turn after the death of his wife." The Emperor, she knew, needed someone to mother him. She said, "All men, after all, are children to their wives. The strongest man in certain moods is only an overgrown boy. Emperors are no exception. I know from my own personal observation extending over a period of years that the Emperor hates to change his clothes." In nature, among wild things the ideal of the mother is usually realized in the child. What she is, the young may and probably will become. The young of all wild things obey the mother: The status quo is all that is expected or desired. But with the human child we desire and expect progress. You have all heard of the little girl whose friend said to her: "You have a lovely mother, do you intend to follow in her footsteps?" "Oh, yes", replied the little maid, and, after some hesitation, "But I expect to make a few tracks of my own." Your ideal and hers become strangely blended. I have heard children say all of the following things about their mothers, their unconscious expression of ideals: </seg>
            <seg id="p316">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE i. First there is blind faith: "My mother says so. It is so if it isn't so." 2. Confidence: "I think my mother is the best woman in the whole world. She can make things right when no one else can." 3. Companionship: "My mother and I are good friends. She always understands — she always backs me up." 4. Pride: "My mother knows a lot — you know everyone thinks she Is keen. They listen to what she says." 5. Admiration: "Say, do you know my mother is beautiful. Her eyes are so kind, her little curls are pretty even at breakfast. When she goes to a party, 'O Boy!' " 6. Contentment: "Say, I am glad my mother is my mother. Everyone likes to come to our house. She always has time for mv friends." So as the years go by, the expression of the ideal changes, but never the essence of the ideal and she measures you with the yard - stick of values which you have placed in her hands. She sees you in your relation to the home, to the church, to the school, to the com - munity, and to God, and she believes that you are good. So I re - peat, "was there ever a name that lived like this? Will there ever be such another? The Angels in Heaven have reared a shrine to the holy name of Mother." Anna Stees Richardson says, "At the International Congress of Women held last June, two defects marred their otherwise excellent program. One was the unmistakable ignoring of the influence that mothers exert on the social body. All emphasis was placed on the importance of social service rendered by trained workers and on highly specialized group leadership while the influence of the individual mother on the individual family and on the community received no recognition whatever. Possibly those who planned the program had forgotten that of the thirty six million women in this country more than half were homemakers, budgetmakers, purchasing agents for their families and the economic, social and spiritual guides of their husbands and children. The other defect was that during the seven days of International Congress meetings, not a single appeal was made for Divine Guidance." It seems the greatest need of women and their greatest contribution to life is beauty — not just prettiness, but beauty of mind, beauty of form, beauty of color, beauty of sound, beauty of flavor, beauty of cheerfulness, and beauty of heart. Man builds the house but woman fashions the home within. Our modern quilts are beautiful. I am </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION making one, the Horn of Plenty, from a pattern two hundred years old. But whereas our ancestors fashioned the design from a scanty piece-bag and bought maybe a yard of turkey-red or ultra-marine blue and by putting a little of this color in each block brought it all into beautiful harmony, we now send to Priscilla and get our pieces all assorted and the foundation muslin stamped. We only copy the beau - tiful designs they created. Theirs was a struggle to create beauty in drab surroundings. Many, many times I think of the beautiful bloom - ing plants they raised in the deep windows of the sod houses. One of the early surveyors in Cherry county was Joe Esterbrook. He homesteaded in west Cherry county, built for himself and family a sod house with a dirt floor and a pole roof covered with sod. His wife was a real helpmate and "they lived luxuriously on boundless hope", but nearly all sod roofs leaked, in fact the only dry spot in their home was in the center of the room under the ridge log. There they placed their bed. One night they were wakened by water drip - ping on their faces. "Joe," said the wife, "get the dish pan and fasten it by the handles to the ridge log." It was done by the sleepy Joe with - out much thought of how the pan might sway and tip when it filled with water. "We hear not the airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen" and the homesteaders enjoyed a dreamless sleep until the pan filled to overflowing, gave one lurch and emptied its contents. Their good nature was shock-proof and water-proof. They are living now on a prosperous ranch in California. Theirs was the beauty of cheerfulness. When we came to Cherry county we had no roads, no bridges, no schools, no churches, no mail service. For roads there were just cattle trails. We soon learned that an old cow made a fairly good civil engineer and that one could drive with a team and wagon wherever there was a well-defined cattle trail and that cow trails always lead to water. The first schools were subscription schools maintained for three months before any public money could be drawn. They were usually held in a claim shack and often taught by some homesteader, whose education and training back East, had been better than his present circumstances would indicate. The church services were usually union services and the sermon read from some paper sent to a home - steader by home folks, but everybody could and did sing. The music was both sweet and strong. To get a mail route a community must first carry the mail three months free before the government would consider a petition. At Boiling Springs ranch, fifty miles west of Valentine, a nail keg was fastened up on the outside of the log ranch building. Anyone going to town brought the mail for the neighbors and dumped it into the </seg>
            <seg id="p318">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE nail keg. Each man came along and sorted out his own mail. Finally a government agent was sent out to inspect these pioneer postoffices and he said if they didn't move their nail keg inside he would report them and they would lose their postoffice. I know a woman home - steader who, to save the work oxen, walked seven miles to the post - office to get a letter from back home. Luckily the letter was there. Her husband afterwards became a well-known judge. People who are established and prosperous seldom become settlers in a new community. A new community, such as ours, was just a lot of people thrown together, not because they had had the same train - ing and interests and liked to be together, but they gathered at one spot for one reason — a desire to make nature yield each a competence. Universal equality and mutual dependence and helpfulness were encouraged. Abilities little suspected by their owners developed under pressure of community need. Teaching, preaching, singing, meat cur - ing, blacksmithing, dressmaking, the care of sick, cooking, every talent was shared. Did one own a buggy, everybody borrowed it for the .infrequent trips to town thirty miles away to file on land to be had as a tree-claim, pre-emption or homestead, to defend a contest claim. or to meet a sister or brother from the East coming out on a visit. Ours was a land of open sky, long roads, and free hospitality. My mother, a graduate of an eastern medical college, did not in - tend to resume the practice of medicine in this new country, but a man unloading their household car said: "That box smells like medicine." But what could one do? — thirty miles to the railroad and to another graduate physician, young women in the throes of their first experience of motherhood, men cut on barb-wire fences, legs broken by stumbling saddle horses and the thousand-and-one ills of childhood. First and for several years a labor of love, then registra - tion with the State Board and a country practice developed, finally floating down stream in a wagon box, when the driver missed the ford on an icy cold day, dressing the burns of a child, trying to fill a mother's place to her orphaned brother and sisters, a fourteen-mile drive home in wet clothing and asthma for thirty-five years. Did it pay? Who knows? What was the coin? An old pioneer said, "We hear much of the necessity of providing recreation and amusement for the young. I cannot remember ever hearing the matter discussed when I was young, nor can I recollect that I ever thought anyone should provide entertainment for me. The days were not long enough for all the fun we had and could have and most of the work we were expected to do was as good as play." We helped to round up, brand, dehorn, vaccinate, ship, trail to the markets,, eat at a chuck-wagon and catch horse thieves. We shared in big neighborhood feeds, egg races, potato races, calathumpians, horse </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION racing, tournament riding, gathering wild fruit, hunting antelope, deer, prairie chickens, grouse and quail and wild geese, fishing, basket meetings, picnics and swapping yarns, laying up sod houses, planting gardens and a few flowers, curing meat and tanning hides, riding fences and putting down wells. No sleigh riding, for the sand always worked up through the snow, but sometimes if there was a lake, a young man would hitch a hand sled by his lariat to the horn of his saddle and take the girls and boys for a ride "round and 'round on the frozen lake and all would come in to a bountiful supper of hot biscuits, wild grape jelly, home made sausages (maybe of pork and jack rabbit), French-fried potatoes, coffee and doughnuts. We trapped coyotes, skunks and muskrats and had the thrill of catching a mink or discovering a white blackbird or a white grouse or seeing, at Thanks - giving time, a long string of Sand Hill cranes like a whip-lash in the sky. We knew the wonder of seeing the little phalarope of which the hen bird wore the bright neck-piece and the little cock incubated the eggs, or we watched the swans float lazily upon the lakes, beautiful and un - afraid. There was joy in finding the nest of the prairie chicken, visit - ing it each day until there were fifteen eggs and the hen was so broody that one could pick her up and set her down a few feet from the nest to see her spread her wings and fluff her feathers and come at one like an angry barnyard fowl. It was joy to find a big leather - back turtle, step on his back and ride from the lake to the marsh, or go fishing, build a fire in the wet sand and fry one's catch and eat it with bread, bacon and pickles with the appetite of a carefree youth of twelve. Oliver Wendell Holmes says: "The true essentials of a feast are fun and feed." One was no weakling. One could rope a calf or bull-dog a steer or ride a bronc straight up. One knew the neighbor who could lift with one hand a wheel of a wagon loaded with saw-logs if it mired in the mud. We came together and builded our America. What have we done? We have churches in every village, and our schools are accredited to the State University. This year we have twenty-two boys and girls attending University at Lincoln. Some of our school boys and girls have been chosen in the Good Citizenship contest sponsored by the American Legion and the World Herald. One of our girls is an inter - nationally known child psychologist, another is a professor in home economics in an eastern university and has had special degrees con - ferred upon her in Paris for artistic skill in food decorations. We have developed a great naturalist and a writer of mystery novels. We have many minor poets and those with a fair appreciation of music. We have many happy homes in small houses and always there are the cattle, developed from the Long Horns of Texas, which now com - pete successfully in the markets of the world. Our beef has increased </seg>

We have hospitals, doctors, dentists and X-ray specialists, daily mail, homely visits with friends, and some leisure to enjoy our comforts. I quote: "The years that bring us many Ills and that pass so stormily over us bear away within them the ugliness, the weariness, the pain, that are theirs; but the beauty, the sweetness, the rest they leave with us, untouched, for these are eternal. As the mountains, that near at hand, stand jagged and scarred in the far distance, re - pose in their soft robes of purple haze, so this rough present fades into the past; soft and sweet and beautiful. "If this world is a 'vale of tears', smile till rainbows span it." RECOGNITION OF COUNTY CHAIRMEN In the absence of Director Brokaw, Dean Burr of the College of Agriculture gave the principal address to the county chairmen. He called attention to the importance of leadership and to the extent to which Extension project clubs have grown in recent years. He laid stress on high ideals for Nebraska farm holmes as a force of influence in solving the problems of these trying days. The list of present County Chairmen was read and all who were present stepped to the front of the room. A charge to leaders was then read. A few words of appreciation of service and congratulation for this honor were given by Miss Mary-Ellen Brown. She then presented to each new County Chairman a Leadership pin in recognition of her service and the honor bestowed upon her. In behalf of the County Home Extension Agents' Association, Miss Clara Noyes presented each Chairman In attendance that morning with a rose bud as a token of their appreciation to helpful leaders of the various counties. This service was closed by all standing and singing together one verse of "Follow the Gleam". The following is a list of all women who have served as County Chairmen in the various counties since 1928. </seg>

            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION THE FARM HOMEMAKER MEETING THE PRESENT NEED MRS. CLIFFORD ESHELMAN The farm homemaker is meeting the present need in many ways. First, I shall discuss the development of her children. Second, there is no greater need today than that of leadership. The farm home is an ideal place for its growth. Considering the Farm Child Farm children are cared for; their mothers, not nursemaids, are the caretakers. It is a heritage to be loved, taught, disciplined and comforted by a busy woman who has herself met many obstacles and has overcome them. The advantages of plenty of work for children with regularity are evident. More and more we are considering the right ways of enjoy - ing leisure. There are wonderful opportunities for the child's leisure on the farm. Lewis E. Lawes, Warden of Sing Sing prison, in his book Twenty Thousand Years in Sing Sing, says, "The majority of people behind the bars are there through the misuse of their leisure time. Ninety-eight per cent of those men never belonged to a 4-H club, Boy Scout troop, or similar organization. If a boy is out caring for his calf, you know he is not getting into trouble. Many boys and girls spend their leisure time in working out 4-H projects and some of them become 4-H club leaders. The matter of educating the farm children today Is a problem. Farm children pass their eighth grade examinations before we feel that they are really old enough to go from home, nor legally old enough to take the family car and drive to high school. I know one woman who has a talented young daughter. Each time she goes to her music teacher for a lesson, she takes instead of the customary silver coin, a well-dressed fat hen. Thus they meet a pres - ent need of the farm. I ■ Studying Fanning Conditions There is an old saying, "Education begins when school days are over." This Is indeed true of the farm homemaker. Never was there a time when one's job needed to be studied more than does the farm woman's job of today. She is Intensely interested in marketing — the prices by weights, by seasons and general cycles. Women are interested in cost accounts for both the home and the business. There are many more account books kept in Webster county than there were two years ago. The woman who can account for every dollar of income and expense at </seg>
            <seg id="p326">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the end of the year is in a position to plan intelligently for the year to come. She can locate the weak spots in her homemaking program. Without records she is tremendously handicapped. The other day I visited with a woman about her turkey project. She knew the poultry cost of her flock, how much each hundred pounds of feed cost, and how many pounds of feed it takes per pound of gain in her flock. In other words, she had an accurate account of the cost of production. This is not ah isolated case. I could point you to many farm homemakers who keep an accurate account, women who, from their particular projects, have helped pay interest, taxes and a pay - ment on the new car. Meeting Financial Needs Second, the farm homemaker is meeting the need financially. She Is a provider. I am glad that she has kept her sense of values and knows that eggs at ten cents per dozen are just as nutritious as if the price wore a dollar per dozen. The same is true of the. value of all home products— cream, milk, pork and beef. Doesn't the house - wife often look at the eggs and milk and wonder how she can serve them over again with the appearance of variety? She cans in winter and summer. Her cellar is never empty. Farm wives now can prac - tically all the summer meat as well as all the winter vegetables. "We will grow our own food in 1934" might well be included in the New Years resolution of every farm homemaker. Sometimes along with being a provider, she might be even classed as a manu - facturer, when she is making soap or cheese. Recently I visited the Farm Bureau in McLean county, Illinois. Now McLean county was recently awarded a loving cup and a one-hundred dollar prize for having more members in the Farm Bureau than any other county in the United States, and when I saw what the women there were doing I felt very humble. There were actually storekeepers, keeping as fine and up-to-date food stores as you ever saw. The women dressed in white, were selling dressed chickens by the hundreds, eggs, cheese, hams, butter, lard, direct to the consumer. One woman there with two high school children told me she sold all of her own and all of her neighbors chickens over her counter. The farm homemaker can easily know about her husband's in - come, even if he be a non-communicative individual. She can read the markets on grain and livestock, and she is perfectly aware of the grow - ing conditions for crops; perhaps this is one reason that the farm homemaker accepts a very limited income from the head of the house and offers no complaint for she has seen the tremendous effort put forth and the tragically poor compensation. Under this financial head comes the question of saving. Now sav- </seg>
            <seg id="p327">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ing alone is not enough. She may patch her husband's clothes and rock the baby and be happy, but there comes a time when patching isn't enough. Every farm homemaker would much rather put in her time earning a new dress than patching her elbows repeatedly. The earning power must be increased. I do not mean that the farmer and his wife must put in longer, harder hours; far from it; but the compensation must be more. We hear and read lots of re - ducing the Burplus. This does not mean inefficient production. Every acre that- is cultivated should produce to its capacity; all livestock should be raised under sanitary conditions and be well fed. Fields grown! up to weeds and livestock that is not thrifty will never solve the farmer's problem. With the low prices of cream, eggs, and hogs and the increased cost of feed, the farm homemaker when she is thinking over finances may sometimes feel like the centipede. "The centipede was happy quite Until the frog for fun Asked 'Which leg comes after which?' It threw him into such a fright That he lay distracted in a ditch Not knowing how to run." Lastly conies the development of the homemaker herself. No one can be concerned about the good of others and work for others without developing herself. Farm women are taking magazines, buying labor-saving devices, attending rural clubs or study meetings. They are no longer content with quilting and sewing carpet rags. I am a farmer through choice and I hope that most of you who are farmers are so through your own choice. I see for the farm home better times ahead. Let us then face our work without complaining and ever and always with fresh hope. COUNTY CHAIRMEN LUNCHEON MISS MARY-ELLEN BROWN, PRESIDING At this luncheon about thirty past and present County Chairmen were in attendance. All present were introduced, both by name and by the county they represented. The principal topic of discussion was the kind of project for women's work most desired in the com - ing year. Suggestions were made showing the general approval of the miscellaneous project plans of the Living-at-Home projects. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON MISS BESS STEELE, PRESIDING The opening music for this session was a group of tenor solos by Mr. Gerald O. Mott, accompanied by Mrs. Mary Hall Thomas. The numbers were as follows: "Thora" "Look Down, Dear Eyes" "Little Mother O* Mine" We were fortunate in being able to have with us this year - Miss Grace Frysinger, who is Senior Home Economist for the Central States in the Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C, Miss Frysinger has represented rural women of America both abroad and in our own country at meetings held for International Conferences Of Rural Organizations. It was interesting to hear her interpretation as to the part rural homemakers are to play in the New Deal for Agriculture. THE RURAL WOMAN IN THE NEW DEAL FOR AGRICULTURE MISS GRACE E. FRYSINGER Throughout the ages women have made certain well-defined con - tributors to civilization and today, as never before, woman is chal - lenged to make her contributions if those things for which she has striven are to be preserved for the generations to come. Primitive woman's first contribution to civilization was giving con - tinuity to the race, and secondly to its maintenance by providing sustenance. The primitive woman did this through gathering wild grasses and seeds in season and in preserving them against the time when famine, attack by other tribes or the warring trekking of her own tribe might occur. Another contribution of our woman ancestors was to push the barriers of civilization onward and onward, and early woman went with her mate into the wilderness to subdue nature and establish new homes that the opportunity of her children might be greater. Still another contribution was the development of the peaceful arts. Early man warred and defended his tribe. He fished and hunted. But primitive woman developed most of the peaceful arts and accepted certain routine of work which definitely contributed two more steps in our march toward a stabilized civilization. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Otis T. Mason in his book on "Primitive Culture in the united States" says that the American Indian woman established twenty-one peaceful arts including painting, healing, curing of skins, milling, the raising of agricultural products, etc. He adds, "All the peaceful arts of today were once woman's peculiar province." These contributions of early woman were handed on down to gen - eration after generation of women in all countries through the cen - turies, but it remained for the American rural woman to make the final contribution of intelligent free choice, for nowhere else was the rural woman really free. The development of our American standard of living has been due in no small measure to this free intelligent choice of rural women. American agriculture has passed through many periods of stress and storm from that first bitter winter in New England, the experiences with savages and disease in the Virginia colony and the Civil War down to the past twelve years of depression. During all these years rural women in the United States have stood shoulder to shoulder with their husbands, continuing to contribute her inherited functions and increasingly to add her discriminating judgment. In our review of American agriculture, we must not fail to re - member that although there have been times of stress, there also have been times of satisfaction such as the bountiful harvest that prompted the first Thanksgiving day, the opening of homestead lands, the more recent opportunities of education which prior to the World War made possible a fine type of life on our American farms. But 1920 and 1929 did come, and in their trail has come tragedy and want throughout our land. Now as never before comes the chal - lenge to American womanhood to utilize her inheritance, her experi - ence und her resources that civilization may be strengthened, not lost by the present challenge. Throughout the centuries women have been concerned for the social, physical and spiritual welfare of the human race. Man has in large measure devoted his energies to promoting Its economic wel - fare. Women have had to have the long-time view — the patience and resourcefulness of motherhood, the quality of step by step leadership, in order to bring her ideals to fruition. Man has needed physical strength and daring to meet his responsibilities, and so the ages seem to have developed these traits in the sexes. The aftermath of the depression shows economic security lost to millions of our citizens and economic insecurity for millions more. What, then, is left? The equally Important demand of every human being is for security of affection, and while many other institutions </seg>
            <seg id="p330">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have been tried and found wanting, the American home is still the same sure source of comfort and refuge, as it always hasbeen. Today American homemakers must rise to the challenge that is j theirs — as women, as homemakers, as rural people, and as citizens of j the world. A new era Is at hand when we must no longer think in terms of just our own babies, for unless we think of all babies, we cannot even save our own babies. And thinking in itself is not enough — action is needed, for as some - one has said, "Thinking without action is futile and action without thinking is perilous." In my judgment the women of the world have the key to the situa - tion, for we know that unless there is a social objective, a sense of social fairness, and a plan of social justice behind our economic en - deavors, such tragedies as we have seen may be recurrently expected. In the United States we can plan for a society which will guar - antee to all our citizens security of existence, security of recompensed work, of health, of opportunity for maximum development and for security of government for the good of all the people. Women, through their centuries of experience in just such planning for the family, must make their contribution to finding the way into this definitely possible and practicable way of life. To do this, intelligent choices must be made and they must begin in the home where standards of character, of human relationships, of group experience and of social justice are set. Standards of work, of rest, of constructive use of leisure times, of citizenship responsibilities, of public affairs, of international relation - ships must be defined and taught around the hearth fire. Rural women have been real heroines during these past twelve years and the manner in which they have faced their difficulties have won for them nation-wide acclaim as they have saved and earned and maintained the morale of themselves and their communities. However far-visioned any economist or sociologist or statesman in the United States, no one foresees a time when the home is not to be the central theme in national and individual progress. Because the home is informal in its processes, its importance tends to be over - looked at times, but the basic demand of human nature for human affection makes the home and family life essential to the security of society, and if the tendency of national thought and action is toward the development of social consciousness and individual responsibility among people, the home will come into its own as the supreme source </seg>
            <seg id="p331">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION of human satisfaction. Dr. Valeria Parker recently stated that, "The family is the strongest force in life today, love is the greatest need in life today, and family life is the golden key that opens the door to the finest expression of human character." Seaman Knapp, founder of extension work, once said, "The greatest schools for the human race are our homes. A country home, be it ever so plain, with a father and mother of sense and gentle culture, is nature's university, and is more richly endowed for the training of youth than Yale or Harvard." Frank Crane says, "The real unit of either politics or economics is not the man but the Home. The Home is the natural thing. It is founded upon instincts. Hence, it is eternal. It was in the world before any other institution — the State, the Church, or the school; it will be present when all these have changed, fallen, and have been re - shaped a hundred times." The rural home is the barometer of our social progress and the standards set in family life in a large measure determine the quality of our standards for public office. In this New Deal for Agriculture, then, I hope that rural women are seeing the possible realization of their dreams, not only for econ - omic justice, but for guaranteeing social well-being to all. generations yet to come. Yesterday Miss Brown told what 18,600 rural women of Nebraska, aided by home demonstration work, have done to make rural life richer and finer during 1933. I would like to tell you some of the heroic achievements of the 800,000 women members of home demon - stration groups throughout the United States who have recognized that satisfying homes are the strongest bulwark against discourage - ment and radicalism and that an intelligently informed adult popula - tion is the only guarantee of sane public action. ,- - ■ -. No one of us can transform rural life into our desired Utopia but each of us can have our hopes and aspirations and can meet our op - portunities one day at a time, for opportunities can never be saved to be used later, but must be used as they come. In speaking of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Secretary Wallace said: "I believe that when you extension people take the offer of the farm act out to the people you will do well to explain to the women as well as the men how a controlled crop production, a retreat from surplus acres and from surplus toil will give to the whole family not only more money, but more time in which to live."

Leisure was a vice and on and on they toiled until all too often death came before the hoped-for leisure was ever attained. The new acts, the AAA and the NRA and the resulting codes, pur - pose to gain such leisure and to hold it for labor and agriculture alike, each being dependent upon the other. If out of our experience of these bitter years shall come national application of the Golden Rule to the affairs of everyday relationships, civilization will have taken a great step forward. If this is to.be achieved, the rural women of our nation must make their definite and vigorous contribution. Some of the specific things which rural women can do to insure the socialized life are: 1. Do your own thinking, based upon unquestioned facts. 2. Become intelligently informed as to the farm situation. 3. Adjust family living to meet the situation, not by living less well, but by making the farm contribute more largely to the family needs. 4. Develop skills that will reduce family expenditures. 5. Become an intelligent and efficient consumer of those goods that must be purchased. 6. Utilize and develop talents that make for familv and com - munity social satisfaction. 7. Stimulate adults and young people to have concern with spiritual growth and service to others. 8. Stress the satisfaction that comes from good reading, from constructive discussion, from reflective thinking. 9. Give service to constructive movements and endeavor* 7 to de - velop leadership abilities. 10. Participate in organized endeavors for the common good. 11. Join a farm organization. If ybu don't like any of those which exist, at least work with other rural people for rural welfare. 12. Look largely at life— think positively and constructively. 13. Think in terms of long-time well-being for the many. 14. Think nationally and internationally, but always in terms of the average farm family and their welfare. </seg>
            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 15. Keep social Justice in mind as the basis for all decisions, re - membering that the age-old experiences of women are needed to help solve the present problems confronting our nation, and that women owe it to humanity to think and to act at this time in order that the dream of America for social justice and equality of opportunity may be realized. Women of Nebraska, a great social experiment is going on in our nation. Your heritage and experience fits you for service and leader - ship in making it a glorious success. It is a challenge worthy of your best selves, which, if successful, will set a new pattern of sane and unselfish human behavior for the whole world. To many it would seem that civilization itself is in the balance! Will you study, think, and then act for this is a time when brains and not brawn are at a premium and in this field women can compete on a basis of equality with men and must accept equal responsibility. In conclusion, to help sustain that fine faith and courage which you have shown all these difficult years, let me read to you the following: AVomen's Part While men warred through a million years, it took a woman to make the Red Cross real, like a sort of Christ of the battlefield that goes behind the guns and salvages lives. Men make nations; women make the men who keep them alive. Men make political parties; women make the civilization which causes them to function. Men make laws and religions; women create the moral strength that makes their enforcement possible and the faith that feeds their flames. Men make houses, women make homes. HOLD FAST YOUR DREAMS By LOUISE DRISCOLL Hold fast your dreams; Within your heart Keep one, still, secret spot Where dreams may go, And sheltered so. May thrive and grow, Where doubt and fear are not, O, keep a place apart, Within your heart For little dreams to go. Think still of lovely things that are not true. Let wish and magic work at will in you. </seg>

Deceits and wrongs and quarrelings We know, alas, we know How quickly fade the color in the west . The bloom upon the flower, the bloom upon your breast And you, this blind hour; Yet keep within your heart a place apart. Where little dreams may go May thrive and grow.

She is a Master Farm Homemaker and former presi- | dent of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. At the two Mothers' Vacation Camps during the summer of 1933 the women were asked to work in small groups and to discuss what they receive for their tax dollars, The discussions proved interesting After these smaller groups had prepared their lists, then the campers came together and had the lists read and combined into one list for the campers. Following the camps, Mrs. Davis prepared the paper which she read as follows: WHAT ARE OUR CHILDREN LEARNING ABOUT TAXES? MRS. S. P. DAVIS Above the portals of the Nebraska State Capitol, we find this in - scription, "The Salvation of the State is Watchfulness in the Citizen " The women, who last summer attended the Mothers' Vacation Camps at Curtis and Camp Brewster must have had this thought in mind when they became so interested in the discussion "What You and I receive for our tax dollar", that they wished they might have a great deal more ime for it. (This talk is but a review and continuation of the discussion started atthe camps.) I hope when we have thought a little more about what we receive from our tax money we will agree with the camper who said she would go home and pay her taxes more cheerfully. Then. too. it is very important that we guard </seg>
            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION our children against forming the wrong attitude toward this one civic duty. I am convinced that children have heard far too much, especially during the last few months, about what the government owes us and not enough about what we owe the government. As citizens, we do have rights, but we also have duties, and let us not over-emphasize the first. Paying taxes is one of our duties and although the rate may be high, even higher than necessary, it is safe to say that every taxpayer in the country receives from the government more than he contributes in taxation. Although the taxpayer receives no immediate returns for his taxes, he has a constant return in the way of protection to life, liberty and property, the enjoyment of public conveniences and the improvement of society. By means of taxes each person bears his part in the cost of government. He gives up a part of his property in order that what remains may be the more secure and valuable, and that he may enjoy many other blessings that would otherwise be impossible. Every one pays taxes either directly or indirectly. The direct tax is a tax on property, such as land, buildings, live stock, grain, ma - chinery, stocks of goods, transportation facilities, stocks, bonds, mortgages and notes. The term "tangible tax" refers to all articles mentioned above with the exception of stocks, bonds, mortgages, and notes. These are called "intangible." The person who owns no property of any kind pays taxes indirectly on goods that he buys. For instance, if he buys a piece of machinery or a package of breakfast food, he helps pay taxes, for, whether made in Omaha or in Chicago, the manufacturer of these articles includes in his price for the same his overhead expense which, among other expenses, includes his taxes. Good citizenship is impossible unless the people understand the government under which they live. Children as well as adults are citizens of our land. Are we at the present time giving them the right impression concerning our government? When children hear taxpayers grumble, in public meetings, on the street, and in the homes, about the high cost ot government, especial - ly the high cost of schools, 4-H clubs, child welfare, libraries, caring for the unemployed, etc., what will they think? Are they given the correct understanding of the government under which they live? Don't you think that we are needlessly worrying the children by this constant talk of the awfulness of the times? Wouldn't it be better if we talked it over with them telling them that running this govern - ment of ours is a mighty big business and needs the cooperation of everyone, themselves included, and how much better it is for us to meet our civic duties cheerfully and with some faith rather than to be always gloomy and full of doubt. This is a Christian land and as </seg>
            <seg id="p336">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE duwu our government is doing the best it can for every one and our attitude, even that of the smallest citizen, is going to have much to do with our retaining in the future the high standards set by the citizens of the past. Importance of Early Recollections Well do I remember my earliest recollection of the word "taxes" and it is not a pleasant memory. During my childhood I cannot re - member hearing my parents or other adults discussing taxes but I do remember how disturbed I became when I learned from our Bible history that because Augustus Caesar issued a decree that the whole world should be taxed it became necessary for Joseph and Mary to travel to Bethlehem in order to pay their taxes. Here because there was no room in the tavern, it became necessary for the Christ-child to be born in a manger. This story has stirred every childish; heart. As I grew older I learned that Augustus Caesar was one of the best of the Roman rulers but still my childish dislike for him remained. Is there not a danger that our children, hearing so much about the in - justice of taxes, may grow up with a like feeling toward Uncle Sam? It is for this reason that I view with a degree of alarm most of the present day discussion of taxes. Some bright person has said that what Uncle Sam most needs to help him through these trying times is a wife, but until he gets this much needed wife I think the women of the land will make mighty able assistants. Some time ago one of the self-appointed leaders in the movement for tax reduction said that women should not meddle with political affairs as they were too emotional. He gave as an example of this that whenever women were present at meetings where tax reduction was discussed nothing could be accomplished because as soon as schools and extension work .or anything affecting their homes and children came in for its share of criticism the women would "rise" right up and no one could make them listen to reason. Another man com - plained because women placed too much stress upon the children and the future. His idea was to let the future take care of Itself, what we needed most was something that would help us right now. I do not mean to imply that men are not interested in our homes and all things that make for better living but I do insist that women are going to have to do their share in helping retain the idealism and high standards set by the founders of our state. The future is going to reveal how well we do this, but are we going to wait and see what kind of an impression the present-day craze for economy has left upon the minds of our children, or are we going to realize that we can never make up to these children the things we have failed to do for them today. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION It seems to me, this is the kind of watchfulness we need to save our state rather than the kind we hear so much about from the self - appointed leaders who have sprung up all over our country the last few months. Perhaps our watchfulness should not all be directed to - ward the self-appointed leaders of our country. Perhaps some of it should be used upon those selected to do our business for us. Last winter while the legislature was in session, I heard one of our law - makers, during a hearing held in the capitol, say that "any law was socialistic that said to him that he had to help take care ot somebody else's kids." Not very elegant language, but his exact words, never - theless. It seems there are too many people directing all their watch - fulness toward their own selfish interests and very little toward the salvation of the state. Have they ever seen, I wonder, the vision of an army of children, their faces turned eagerly toward the future and their hands placed so trustingly in ours? Are we going to betray that trust? There are parents, to be sure, who are every much concerned about the welfare of their own children but not sb~ interested in those belonging to others. And how about the homeless child, the one who through no fault of his own must become a ward of the state? These children taken care of by the state must be regarded by us, the citizens who make the state, as foster children. While an institution can not take the place of a home, we should have enough interest in child welfare generally to see that these children have as nearly as possible an equal opportunity to grow into good useful citizens with those that nature has given to us. This thought by Walter Scott fits here so nicely I want to give it to you: — "The race of mankind would perish did they cease to aid each other. We cannot exist without mutual help. All, therefore, that need aid have a right to ask it from their fellowmen; and no one who has the power of granting can refuse it with.uit guilt." Federal Expenditures Before considering how well our state cares for her people, let us say just a few words about the federal government. Most of the talk concerning tax reduction is directed against the taxes paid the county treasurer, those for which we receive a receipt. This money Is all spent locally, in the county, and in the state. The federal govern - ment gets none of this money. How then does it meet its expenses? The largest part of the federal tax comes from incomes and estates, from stamps on documents, from customs and excise taxes on luxuries, liquor and tobacco, from sales of manufacturers, from non-alcoholic beverages, from transportation, telephone and telegraph, insurance, and other similar taxes. Perhaps it would be Interesting to note that the federal government receives a tax of three or four millions a year </seg>
            <seg id="p338">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE on oleomargarine and renovated butter. Then, too, there is a federal tax of 1 1-2 cents on every gallon of gasoline. State Expenditures Now to go on to the state expenditures. Here we find our tax dollar divided as follows: — ," State tax , 13 County tax 18 School tax 47 City or village 20 Township 02 $1.00 The above table was secured in the office of State Tax Commissioner and Is the average for Nebraska. All information secured was for the biennium 1931-1932. The expenditures for this year, 1933, were uot available at the time it was necessary for me to get this information. As this division of the tax dollar is the average for Nebraska, the rate, all but that which goes to the state, may differ in the different counties. Also all counties do not have a township government so that levy would be omitted. Now where does the state spend its 13 cents? The following table for the biennium 1931-1932 was secured in the office of the state tax commissioner. 1. Board of Control 30.502% 2. University 30.149% 3. Normal Schools 10.298% 4. Executive Offices 6.626% 5. Xddiciary Offices 5.531% 6. /Capitol Commission 4.699% If Code Department 4.660% a. Other Departments: Military V Railroad Commission Tax Commission 4.434% 9. /All other, Legislative and Emergencies 2.020% 10. Miscellaneous: Fair Board, Historical Society, etc 1.060% Total 100 % </seg>
            <seg id="p339">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Board of Control Would it be interesting to note what some of these departments are doing with the money which they receive? Let us take the Board of Control, with its seventeen state institutions first. This Information was secured from the Nebraska Blue Book of l l 932. The penitentiary with its 810 inmates and a per capita cost per' inmate of $257.43 for the period from July 1, 1931 to June 30, 1932, should make us stop and do much thinking. The hospitals for the insane at Lincoln, Norfolk, and Hastings, show the following records: — theJLincoln hospital shows 1,180 inmates at a $198.11 per capita cost. The Norfolk hospital shows the number of inmates 936 at a per capita cost of $204.79. The Hastings hospital shows the number of inmates as 1,492 with per capita cost of $195.35. This institution has the largest number of inmates. ( j. Next comes the institution for feeble-minded at Beatrice. The number of inmates there seems perfectly startling to me and I wonder if spon our lawmakers will not awake to the fact that only by passing proper laws can this rapidly increasing population of feeble-minded be stopped. This institution cares for children and adults to the num - ber of 1,024 at a per capita cost of $147.83*. The school for the deaf at Omaha has for the same period an average number of pupils, 196, at a per capita cost of $404.55. The school for the blind at Nebraska City has 53 pupils and a per capita cost of $518.99. This is the highest per capita of any of the state schools and It can readily be understood why. These children being blind need more helpers to care for them and to teach theam, and the equipment necessary in teaching is very expensive. The industrial school for boys at Kearney had 205 boys with a per capita cost of $333.46. The industrial school for girls at Geneva had 182 girls at a $282.39 per capita cost. The women's reformatory at York had 38 inmates at a per capita cost ot $456.65. The Nebraska Industrial Home at Milford had 86 inmates at a per capita expenditure of $276.9 4. This home gives shelter and protection to unfortunate women and girls. It not only helps them physically but gives them all the moral aid possible. The men's reformatory at Lincoln was established in 1921 for boys and men not less than sixteen nor more than thirty years of age at the time of conviction of a felony for the first time. There were 377 inmates at a per capita cost of $297.55. The Soldiers* and Sailors' homes are at Grand Island and Milford. At Milford there were 130 inmates at a per capita cost of $412.44. The home at Burkett near Grand Island had 258 inmates and a per capita cost of $905.81. While the school for the blind led the list in high expenditure for the state </seg>
            <seg id="p340">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE schools, this leads in the highest expenditure of all state institutions. These homes care not only for the veterans of the several wars and the U. S. military service, but for the wives, widows, or mothers of such veterans as are eligible to admission. The Orthepedic Hospital at Lincoln cared for 81 inmates at a per capita cost of $888.86. This hospital is also a school, regular in - struction for all children being provided. The Home for Dependent Children at Lincoln cared for, during the year ending June 30, 1932, 508 children at a per capita cost of $453.21. Of this number, 48 returned to trial homes, 96 "were placed in trial homes, 11 were re - turned to parents or friends,, 3 7 were adopted, 1 died, 14 attained majority and 23 were transferred to other institutions. At the end of the period 104 children were present in the home. The hospital for tuberculous at Kearney has 152 inmates, per capita cost of $460.41. A record secured from the Board of Control dated February 1, 1933 shows an increase in thirteen of the seventeen state institutions. (In all state institutions February 1, 1933, inmates 7,087, employees 1,114, total 8,801.) Do we regret the spending of so much money? Have we any help - ful suggestions? If we have, let us take them to the proper authorities and not indulge in any wild guessing. I think we would find upon making an investigation that the Board of Control is doing the best it can for the unfortunate citizens of our state. . University of Nebi-uskn Let us pass to the more pleasant but just as much maligned second item — the University. The University was opened to students Sep - tember 7, 1871. There were eight regular and twelve irregular col - legiate students and 110 preparatory students the first year. In 1932 our Nebraska University was one of the great universities of the United States. The total enrollment for the year 1931-1932 was 11,173 students. Up to January 1, 1933 it had granted 21,261 de - grees. The University embraces ten different colleges; Graduate, Arts and Sciences, Agriculture, Engineering, Law, Teachers, Medicine (at Omaha), Pharmacy, Business Administration, and Dentistry. There is a department of Fine Arts and a Department of Journalism in the college of Arts and Sciences and a School of Nursing in connection with the college of Medicine at Omaha. Also the Teachers College High School, the Nebraska School of Agriculture at Curtis, the Ne - braska agricultural experiment station at Lincoln, the experiment substations at North Platte, Valentine, Mitchell and Alliance, the Agri - cultural Extension Service Fruit Farm at Union, state serum plant at Lincoln and the University Extension Division and the affiliated school of music should be mentioned. </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Besides its actual institutional work the University is a great ser - vice institution. The Medical College hospital reports in 1931-32, to 70.6G7 patient days used for 4,074 patients. Many others secure as - sistance from the dispensary at Omaha and the dental college clinic at Lincoln. The 4 5th annual report of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, published in 1932, gives the following expenditures from state university appropriation and cash receipts from sales for year ending June 30, 1931, $240,S69.43. In addition to this $90,000 was appro - priated by the federal government. These funds are used "to conduct original research or experiments bearing directly upon the agricul - tural industry of the state." The Agricultural Extension Service became known as such in 1914, previous to that since 1897 it had been known as the Farmers' Institute. It is financed by state and federal funds. Its purpose is "to further cooperate extension work in agriculture and home econ - omics and to give instruction and practical demonstrations in agri - culture and home economics to persons not ! in attendance at the agricultural college." Last year the University Agricultural Extension Service reached 17.4S8 boys and girls enrolled in 1769 4-H clubs, 18,602 women who did work in project and study clubs, and over 80,000 men and women who received help from the Farm Bureau offices in the many Nebraska counties who now have agricultural and home extension agents. When we realize that the "salvation of the state" depends so much upon the progress of its homes, is it any wonder that we do not want poli - ticians to tell us that we should be able to rear our children with as little help from the state as parents received fifty years ago. The Conservation and Survey Division of the University includes the following state surveys: Soil, Geological, Water and Water Power, Forest, Road Materials and Industrial. "Vocational Education" means! "Training for the common wage-earning employee and a useful productive life." Office space for this department has been provided in the College of Agriculture, but receives separate appropriation by legislature.

The bureau maintains an office and library in the library building on the Uni - versity campus and an office and bill drafting service at the capitol during the sessions of the legislature. The bureau is authorized by law "to carry on research in subjects of special public interest, to pub - lish the same and in every way to promote the diffusion of accurate and reliable 'information upon questions connected with the develop - ment of civic life in Nebraska. The regular publications of the bureau are the Nebraska Blue Book, the subject index to bills and the Leg - islative Manual every other year." It was from the Nebraska Blue Book of 1932 that most of the information concerning state affairs was secured. "The Code Commission and Revision and Purchase of Statutes," is in existence only when necessary. In 1929 experienced persons ap - pointed by the governor "compiled and indexed the Nebraska statutes. The 1931 legislature appropriated $5,000 for the publication of a sup - plement to the Compiled Statute of Nebraska, 1929". Executive Offices Under executive offices we find the governor's office (with three assistants) auditor (with ten assistants), secretary of treasury (with (ten assistants) Department of Public Instruction, State Superintend - ent, Deputy State Superintendent, Director of Certification and Sup - ervisor of Adult Immigration Education, Division of Secondary Edu - cation, Supervisor of Secondary Education, Director of Rural Educa - tion.

The State Library contains 100,000 volumes and is housed in the capitol. "The library of the University of Nebraska being in Lincoln has seemed wise to develop the state library into a law library, although it still contains several thousand general works and bound files of periodicals. As a law library it is reckoned to be one of the best collections in the country." The Public Library Commission had its name changed by the last legislature to the Nebraska Public Library. This library is housed in the Social Science building on the University campus and instead of being in charge of a library commission it is now in charge of a library commissioner, the same one having charge of the University library. You have noticed that no road or bridge expenditure comes out of our state taxes. All state money spent for such purposes comes from federal funds, the motor vehicle license fees and the state's share of the gasoline tax, 1'^. I have often wondered these days when we hear so much about tax reduction why we insist upon, the reduction coming from the source over which we do not have the entire control when there is a gasoline tax, 5i_&lt;? on each gallon, i%£ federal and 4&lt;J state, that we can pay or not as we please and I guess we just do please for there are just as many cars and other motor vehicles on the roads now as there were when we only paid one cent tax. If anything, I believe there are more. This is as nearly as I could ascertain the state expenditure. There may be several small items of expense that have not been mentioned such as the offices of the Bureau of Examining Boards. There are thirteen such boards. They are boards of examiners in Basic Sciences, Chiropractic, Chiropody, Cosmetology, Dentistry, Embalming, Medi - cine and Surgery, Nursing, Optometry, Osteopathy, Pharmacy, Veter - inary Medicine and Surgery and Barber examiners. This bureau is supported entirely from the fees paid by those licensed. However their offices being in the capitol may be some expense to the state. We have many boards and commissions which have not been mentioned as the members of such boards are the officers in the state house and re - ceive no extra pay. For instance, the governor serves on eight boards, the secretary of state on four boards, etc. County Taxes Now that we have made the thirteen cents of our tax dollar that goes to the state give us such large returns, we must hurry on be - cause we still have the greater part of our tax money to spend. While we all send an equal share to the state our county tax will not be </seg>
            <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the same. However, the average for Nebraska! is 17 cents so we win proceed with that. There are two kinds of county government: The commissioner form and the township or supervisor form of govern - ment. If you live in a county with the latter form of government the tax is usually a little higher. The average for the state is 2 cents. As counties are managed so differently, it will be necessary for me to take the record as given by the county officials of my own county. I found our county expenditures divided under these funds. Roads, Bridges, Pauper, County Farm, Jail, Mother's Pension, Soldier's Re - lief, Blind Allowance, Old Age Pension, Taxation Expense, Election Expense, Farm Bureau, County Fair, Jury, Bounties, Emergency and Salaries for the following offices, Sheriff, Register of Deeds, County Clerk, County Treasurer, Judge, County Attorney, County Superin - tendent, Clerk of District Court and County Surveyor. ! . You will notice that in our county we have no county assessor. That office may be abolished by popular vote in all counties except Lancaster and Douglas. In counties where it jhas been abolished the county clerk does the work formerly done by [the assessor. In coun - ties with a population under 6,000 the county clerk is register of deeds and clerk of the district court also. The county commissioners and county clerk and assessor, if the county has one, constitute the board of equalization and serve without extra pay. In looking over our county expenditures I found that the salaries of our officials con - stituted but 8% of the total expenditures and in counties where the general expendiutre runs much higher than ours the percentage used for salaries ran as low as 3%. Now isn't it queer when we begin to look for a place to economize, we invariably begin with the 3 or 8% or whatever the per cent may be that covers j the salaries instead of looking into the 92 to 97% spent on other things. ■I Our table shows that our school tax is .47 and city or village 20 cents and as the size of the city increases its government becomes more complex and expensive. If we live in the country our local tax is simply our school tax but if we live in a village or city our tax money has to cover such expenditures as these: City attorney, clerk, physician, chief of fire department, chief of police, marshal, engineer, electrician, health commissioner or Board of Health, Inspectors, mayor, police judge, street commissioner, treasurer, tax commissioner, water commissioner, board of public works, fire and light commissioner, hospital commissioner, library and park commissioner, plumbers' board, library and council men. You may live in a town with many more departments or you may have less. ■ Our little village has an "amusement fund.f* for its band, concerts and choruses. I believe most towns have such a fund. Then there I is a sinking fund, used for retiring warrants and paying interest and </seg>
            <seg id="p346">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE no doubt very many more of which I have never heard. Something we should remember is that our local taxes are by far the largest part of all taxes paid. Let me give you an example. The largest town in our county pays $42.60 on each $1,000 valuation. Out of this amount $37 stays in the city, $18 for the schools and $19 for the city. Com - pare with that the $5.60 which is county and state tax and see where the greatest saving must fall if saving there must be. Present Conditions It would be very foolish to say that our country is not facing a crisis at the present time but I cannot see how it. could possibly be the taxes we have paid in the past nor yet those we are paying at the present that have placed us where we are. Whatever the cause may be, let us as adults take the jolt and let us spare the children all we can. They will have a big enough job when it comes their time to run the gov - ernment without their having to pay too heavily for our mistakes. We can look back and see where if we had planned more wisely conditions today would be much better, then why not profit by an experience paid for so dearly and build more solidly for the future. There is no need worrying about tomorrow, at least not to the extent that we fail to enjoy the beauty and glory of today, but there is need for careful watching and planning. I am not a pessimist but I do want to urge strongly that we keep in close touch with the affairs of government, especially our education - al system. It does not cost us such a great deal to educate our chil - dren. A record secured from the State Superintendent's office shows that the average per year for the rural child is $4S.87 and for the city child $64.30. This is the average for 1933 and is $10 less than the average of 1932. Are we going to continue to cut this down until schools cannot function efficiently? There are many rural districts with enough money in the treasury to run the school a year without making any levy, which took advantage of the depression and cut the teachers' salaries and other expenses too, until it made the difference of having a school inefficiently run where there was plenty of money to have a good school. . I cannot forget the backward step we have taken in prohibition and that we have taken such a step, not because of the work done by the enemies of prohibition but because of the indifference of its friends. With the propaganda being spread today the same thing could happen to our educational system but I hope and believe we are not going to let it happen. What Shall We Teach Our Children Just what do we hope may come from having discussions with our children concerning the affairs of government? The same thing we </seg>
            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION hope to accomplish by having family conferences concerning our financial affairs. More thoughtful spending, teaching them the im - portance of putting first things first. Why do we not leave all such instruction to the school? A short time ago my twelve year old son was studying his civics. I picked up the book and read parts of it here and there and was both surprised and pleased to see the simple and attractive way in which children are now taught civics but the point which needs to be stressed at this time is one which a teacher is somewhat handicapped in handling. The schools are tax-supported and of course the teacher receives his salary from public funds but we mothers, not having to worry about our salaries, are in a position to take up the defense against the unjust attacks against our schools better than any teacher. As our children in their early teens are entering high school and before that age, the junior high school, they are not too young to begin becoming acquaint - ed with the problems and conditions of the day. What guide-posts can we point out to our children as being safe to follow at all times and in all things. There is one example and only one. Nothing but the principals taught by Christ can produce the type of citizenship we need. These words — "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is first and the great commandment and the second is like unti it. Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." are as true today as they were when spoken. A short time ago my fifteen year old son j asked me if I thought the teaching of Christ offered a solution to alii problems. He had be - come interested in making comparisons because of studies in other religions in his ancient history. Of course I told him "yes" and that all his teachings applied to our present problems as much as they did to those hundreds of years ago. We spoke about the feeding of the five thousand, where the Master saw the neecl of the hungry people and he was not indifferent to it. The multitude was fed and then he had His disciples gather up all that remained, not so much to show His power as to teach us not to waste, and then when the people saw how easily He had provided for them they wanted to make Him king but he straightway departed. This, to me, seems especially applicable today. We must realize the need of those about us and we must supply those needs, at the same time we must .not make it so easy for those helped that they will not care to help themselves. The need today is greater than ever to direct and educate our people to help themselves. We have had grown women in our county who when the Red Cross furnished them flour did not know how to get bread from it. We have had them say they did not want the navy beans included in their grocery order unless they could have them in a can. They haven't known how to remake garments given to them or how to </seg>
            <seg id="p348">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE put a comforter together nor how to put vegetables into a can. Is money spent for education well spent? I think so. Is there still need for it? It would seem so. Shall we then take the word of those crying so loudly that we are being over-educated and no longer need so much free schooling seriously? It would seem if we followed the teachings of Christ that would not be the course to follow. What then would we want our children to learn from the present day discussion of taxes? They will have to learn that soon this prob - lem will be theirs, that in order to be equipped to handle the job that will be theirs they have a right to expect that our conversation be such that by it we teach them to have confidence and respect for our government. They have a right to expect that, if conditions are as serious as our discussions would lead them to think they are, that we display the same patriotism during this emergency as we would should our ..country be at war. We would not, in a public meeting, remain seated while the Star Spangled Banner was being sung, yet we are letting our children listen to discussions where this same Banner is certainly being trailed in the dust. They have a right to expect that we, the builders of the state of today, give of our best of mind, of heart, of hand, so that they, the builders of tomorrow, will continue in the watchfulness that will prove to be the salvation of our state.

The motion was carried. _j Miss Clara Slade who is psychologist for the Lincoln Public Schools has carried on an interesting study of motion pictures and she was willing to share with us some of the findings. The following is an ex - tract from her lecture. Extract From Her Lecture THE EFFECT OF MOTION PICTURES ON CHARACTER IDEALS MISS CLARA SLADE Motion pictures have become a real factor in every American home. Recent surveys indicate that nearly every child of school age sees about one movie a week and is exposed to that movie tor about two hours. Because of the large number of children who attend picture shows from which they gain knowledge, both honest and dishonest, true and false, it seems fitting that some control should be exercised over the production for children. That good, pictures are valuable needs no defense. They are a source of information: they reach all the children, those who can read and those who cannot; they are a great saving In lime because the Information can be presented in a very short time which would take hours to read a description of in corresponding detail. The problem of the pictures is— How can we set-tire the good and eliminate the harmful? That pictures are harmful is just as certain as that they are good. In a study made recently it was shown that such social attitudes as honesty, sincerity, truthfulness, respect for authority, and self-respect are not shown as often as the undesirable attitudes such as dishonestv, insincerity, falsehood, etc. In studying the solution of the problem it was found that in the majority of pictures studied, wrong acts were either condoned or re - warded; that the love interest was shown in a majority of pictures as </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION an abnormal, unwholesome sex problem; that politics were being cor - rupted with gangsters in control; bootleggers, murderers, and gamblers going unpunished. Miss Helen Jeffryes who is a graduate of the Home Economics De - partment of the College of Agriculture, has conducted a laundry study for the McCall's Magazine at the University of Nebraska during the past year. With the use of illustrative material prepared during that study. Miss Jeffryes showed convincing results of good and poor laundry methods. HELPFUL HINTS FROM THE HOME LAUNDRY STUDY MISS HELEN JEFFRYES The study of home laundry problems which was sponsored by McCall's Magazine and carried on under the supervision of the Home Economics Department of the University of Nebraska last year was made for the purpose of finding easier and better methods for doing the family washing — from the sorting of the soiled clothes to the iron - ing and folding of the clean ones. A laboratory was equipped as an ideal home laundry with laundry tubs, a laundry stove, washing machine, table for sorting and all of the accessory equipment. In this laboratory we carried on experiments and then tested our results in a practical way by doing real family washings. Besides the laboratory washings, a group of Lincoln home - makers cooperated with us and used different washing methods under our directions. The laundry process was divided into steps and the problems of each step were studied separately. A few "helpful hints" from the study are shown by our exhibit material. j. Sorting is made easier if the soiled clothes can be placed in special bins or in baskets instead of. on the floor, and if a regular classification for dividing them is followed, such as: table linen, bed linen and slightly soiled towels, body linen and towels, light colored cottons, dark colored cottons, silks and synthetic fabrics, and woolens. Our laboratory experiments for soaking were done with soiled samples — pieces of white cloth, eleven inches square, which we made dirty by putting them in a special soiling mixture so that all of the pieces had the same kind and amount of dirt on them. Case 1 of our exhibit shows three groups of these samples: one group which was soaked for two hours in soapy water before being washed, another group which was soaked for fifteen minutes in soapy water before be - ing washed, and a third group which was soaked for fifteen minutes </seg>
            <seg id="p352">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE m uicar water before being washed. The samples soaked for fifteen minutes are cleaner than those soaked for two hours, and the samples soaked In clear water are cleaner than those soaked in soapy water. Four new white shirts which were worn by two men and then brought into the laboratory each week to be washed, showed, after a period of sixteen washings, that soaking in clear water for a short time before washing gave satisfactory results. We worked out our experiments on the actual washing of white clothes in the same way that we studied soaking — with soiled samples. One way in which we tested our results in a practical way was by washing dishtowels. We bought fifteen new dishtowels and asked three women to take five of them, use them and bring them to the laboratory to be washed. For twelve weeks the same groups of towels were washed in the same way, and at the end of that time the groups were compared with each other. The towels soaked in clear water before being washed were as white and perhaps a little whiter than those soaked in soapy water. The towels rinsed in bluing water after they were washed were a bluish white, while those rinsed in clear water were a creamy white. The towels hung inside to dry were gray when compared with those hung outside. The towels which were boil - ed after they were washed were slightly whiter than those which were not boiled. All of the homemakers who cooperated with us were given new dishtowels, new hand towels, and a garment for each of their chil - dren. They used these as they would use their own urticles and then washed them with their own washing, using a method which we gave them. Some of the women were given a good method, and some of them were given a poor method. They returned the towels to us at the end of each six weeks period and we compared results. Those who were given a method which called for hot water had better re - sults than those who were given a method which called for warm water. There was a marked difference between the towels which had been rinsed well and those which had been rinsed poorly. After several months of experimenting with the washing of white clothes, we found that the following method seemed to make our clothes the cleanest and whitest: 1. Soak for ten to fifteen minutes in clear water — cool or luke - warm — in order to remove surface dirt, open the meshes of the fabric and dissolve stains which might be "cooked" or set by the the hot wash water. 2. Wash in very hot soap suds — 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Most washing machines do not need to be run for more than ten minutes, but this will depend on the machine itself, and the directions </seg>
            <seg id="p353">353 NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION with the machine should be followed. If the washing is done by hand and the clothes cannot be washed in the very hot water, boiling helps to keep them white. 3. Rinse in hot soapy water to remove the dirty water and soap from the clothes. 4. Rinse twice in clear water. 5. Dry the clothes in the sunshine. For our work with colored cottons, we used the children's gar - ments mentioned previously and, also samples from ten different cot - ton materials, ranging in price from 35* a yard to 6%&lt;J a yard. Ot the ten pieces, two of them were marked "not guaranteed color fast." These two pieces faded readily and looked very poor after three wash - ings. The eight guaranteed materials were bright and unfaded after twenty-six washings even though the price ran as low as 10$ a yard for one of the pieces. A few points to keep in mind when washing colored clothes are: 1. Be sure that the material is color fast before putting it In the wash water with other clothes. 2. Soaking in clear cool water for five to ten minutes before wash - ing removes surface dirt and does not injure the color if the garment is color fast. 3. For washing, use clean water which is no hotter than is com - fortable to the hands. Dirty water dulls colors and makes the clothes look dingy. Very hot wuter may cause the colors to fade. 4. Use a mild laundry soap. 5. Rinse at least twice and if the clothes were very soiled, a soapy rinse followed by two clear rinses is desirable. 6. Dry in the shade, Garments made of silk or of the synthetic fabrics (rayons) are usually considered as being special articles and many people wash them by hand. They may be washed in a machine if the action is gentle or if they are first placed in net bags which prevent pulling and twisting. The points to keep in mind when washing these fabrics are: 1. If washing them by hand, do not twist or stretch them. It washing them by machine, do not run it too long — four to five minutes is usually long enough — and put the garments in net bags unless the action of the machine is very gentle. 2. Use clean water. Silk and synthetic fabrics absorb moisture </seg>
            <seg id="p354">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Teaaiiy and will absorb any dirt which is in the water. For this rea - son they should never be washed in soiled water or soaked. 3. Use warm water — 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit — as hot water may fade the colors and weaken the fabric. 4. Use a mild soap. 5. Rinse at least twice. 6. To hasten drying, roll the garment in a Turkish towel before hanging over a rod or line to dry (do not pin to the line). If the gar - ment is to be pressed while damp, remove it from the towel, shake Out and press with a warm (never hot) iron. Woolen materials are probably the most difficult to wash of any of the textiles because woolen fibers become matted or felted together so easily when they are wet. For this reason, woolen garments and blankets must be washed carefully and quickly. We found that we had the best results when we used the following washing method: 1. Use soft or softened water — 96 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit — and a mild soap which could be used with safety as a shampoo. Make a thick suds in the tub or washing machine. 2. If washing the woolen articles by hand, do not rub or twist them, but squeeze the soapy water through them and press up and down in the suds. If washing them in a machine, run it only a very short time — three minutes is sufficiently long for moderately soiled articles, and overwashing causes more felting and shrinking than any other one factor. If parts of the article are very soiled give them special attention. Rub soiled blanket bindings with a brush dipped in soap suds instead of washing the entire blanket until the binding is clean. I 3. Rinse two or three times in warm water — the same temperature as the wash water. If the water is hard, soften the first rinse. 4. Remove as much of the. water as possible, and stretch gently into shape. Spread knitted garments on a flat surface to dry. Blankets - may be spread on a flat surface if it is. convenient to do so, or they may be hung evenly over a rod or line. Do not pin "woolen articles to the line. Dry frames for woolen hose and baby's garments which make it impossible for the garments to dry out of shape may be purchased. The family washing can be made one of the pleasant tasks of home - making if the laundry room is a cheerful and convenient place in which to work, if the work is carefully planned, and if the washing methods which are used make the white clothes clean and white, keep the colored clothes bright and unladed, the silk clothes soft and clear in color, and the woolens warm and fluffy. </seg>
            <seg id="p355">; NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION THURSDAY AFTERNOON GENERAL SESSION The following talk was given by Miss Grace Frysinger before the . general meeting of Organized Agriculture. THE FARM FAMILY LOOKS FORWARD By GRACE E. FRYSINGER U. S. Department of Agriculture "Looking forward" has been the watch-word of rural people throughout the centuries. It has served to make them leave com - fortable homes and friends and go into the loneliness and difficulties of a wilderness to subdue nature, that they and their children might have greater opportunity. It has held them firm when economic dif - ficulties or natural causes swept away the expected returns for a whole year of endeavor. It has held them patient when inequality of op - portunity reduced their fair share of the nation's income and placed heavier and heavier mortgages upon their hard-won acres. "Looking forward" is their creed and it would seem that their faith is about to be rewarded for never was realization of parity for agriculture so nearly within the grasp of farm people, as it is in the United States today. If only farm people can look forward far enough and see clearly enough, and in great enough numbers, the future seems safely assured. I refer, of course, to the need for farmers to cooperate in carrying out the provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. If they do so, recovery in all fields! seems assured — without it, one dares not look into the future! The Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Wallace, has effectively summed up the objectives of this great social endeavor as follows: "A balanced abundance A shared prosperity • An enriched life." • . The American farm family has always been free to make its own choices and it is still free to do so but never in all history was in - telligent choice so greatly needed, and so portent with joy or misery for vast millions of persons. So before we look forward with our farm family let us look back - ward, and then at the world about us today. . Looking backward we see long hours at heavy labor, physical isolation and lack of educational and social opportunity. Work be- </seg>
            <seg id="p356">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE came a virtue and leisure a sin. But the dream of a better future held them to the land. As the Machine Age and transportation and communication developed opportunity for contact, many improvements were made, educational opportunities were increased and home-and farm-life became less taxing as to length of hours and needed strength. Endeavors to aid rural people through grants in aid for educational service, such as the extension service in Agriculture and Home Econ - omics brought about vastly improved economic and social conditions and increased the satisfaction of rural, people. Then came the war. We speeded up production and home con - servation and when the war was over we continued to produce eveA though the countries of Europe were gradually building up a selfi - sufflcing agriculture. Then came 1920! And the agricultural de - pression began. Finally one bushel of barley bought a postage stamp and agricultural prices at the farm were sixty per cent below pre-war prices. By 1932 the farm cash income was nearly the two hundred dollar mark. Farm people began to develop a self-sufficing agriculture not its a matter of choice but because of lack of cash returns for farm products raised. They canned fruit and vegetables; they butchered and can - ned meat; they made sauerkraut and hominy; they made garments over and over almost to the vanishing point; they even washed and carded home grown wool and made it into comforts and mattresses. What was happening in the world about? ' Many changes were taking place as the value of industrial stocks rose higher and higher. There was increased demand for luxuries and retail installment buy - ing increased at a rapid pace. In 1910 retail installment buying was valued at one billion dollars. By 1928 It amounted to seven billion dollars including sixty per cent of all automobiles, seventy-five per cent of all radios and fifty per cent of all household electrical equipment. In 1929 there was two and one-half billion dollars of retail installment buying. Other changes had occurred. In 1900 we had one hundred forty - four miles of hard surfaced roads and eight thousand automobiles. By 1931 we had one hundred twenty-five thousand miles of such road and twenty-six million automobiles. In 1901 state laws limited automobile travel to fifteen miles per hour. In 1905 to twenty-five miles per hour. In 1925 to thirty-five miles and in 1929 to forty miles. The cost of automobiles as recreation in 1930 was four and one-half billion dollars and they constituted the cause of over one-fifth of all major offenses of city crime in 1931. In 1929 people of the United States spent: $ 600,000,000 for jewelry and silverware </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 700,000,000 for cosmetics and beauty parlors 900,000,000 for games and sports 2,000,000,000 for motion pictures and concerts. In 1932 the lineal descendant of George Washington flew in a single day over all the routes covered by Washington in his lifetime. Science goes on contributing services which may be used for our physical and social welfare. Just before I left Washington the Bureau of Plant Industry released information that scientists had discovered that freezing of pears in transit could be prevented by placing sawdust on the floor of the car and soaking it with water. This water freezes before the pear juice, thus liberating enough heat to keep the pears safe. Another item stated recent experiments had proved that by apply - ing certain pollen to date fruits, ripening could be delayed until weather or market conditions were favorable. A third experiment proved that Kieffer pears can be made of qaulity and quantity approaching that of Bartlett pears by gathering them and storing at sixty to sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit. And now in Washington under the leadership of our President, Frunklin D. Roosevelt, endeavor is being made to use scientific ability to socialize industry and agriculture that we may be enabled to solve intelligently the problem of distribution of wealth so that many citizens may have more of our wealth and the few less, without stifling initia - tive and creative 1 ability. This briefly depicts the recent situation — what then of the future? In the past, farming has been thought of as concerned with food and fibers. That is the first great change which is to come in the thinking of our farm family, for they have determined that in the future "folks" will be considered the major factor in farming, with "food and fibers" as a means to an end. Such a viewpoint will change the think - ing not only of the farm family itself but of the nation at large. I think that every American citizen would do well to every now and then re-read the Preamble to the Constitution. It reads, "We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the com - mon defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this con - stitution for the United States of America." What wholesome ideals for a nation! And they are so greatly needed in our lives today! Intelligent free choice! What kind of a life do we want? The high life of 1929? Have we learned a lesson from that experience? A recent statement makes me raise that question for it is said that on </seg>
            <seg id="p358">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the first indication of better times early this summer' over nine million shares of stock were sold and in a single week in July more shares of stock were sold than in any one week during the famous market. Are we interested in these things or in fine character, happy family relationships and hospitality to and from our neighbors and the values that come from self-discipline? Our economists tell us the economic outlook for the farm family is that there will be an increase in income for the farm family in 1934 and that it will more than offset any advance in prices of those com - modities which farm people buy. But whether the Income increase be little or much, the farm family has certain resources which will need to be used wisely and which will contribute to the good life! The first resource which needs to be used effectively is the brains of our rural people. Never has intelligent choice been so needed to utilize the lessons of the past. th,. condition of .the present and the op - portunity of the future lor the benefil of rural people! We need "planned living" as well as planned agriculture and plan - ned industry. We need to be educated not only through class-room and books but also by group discussions and reflective thinking of in- HI VlClUtils. But we need education at all times. 1, is not a luxury but a sound social investment which should be available lor all our youth and adults in a democracy, and it costs far less than the remedial meas - ures and institutions such as penitentiaries, hospitals for the Illsane and incompetents, poor-houses and other publicly supported institu - tions Education has many values. It helps meet the broadened needs of life. It develops knowledge as to available sources of information and services. It develops the ability to use facts as a basis for sound judgment. It functions' in times of adversity as a bulwark against radi - calism and snap judgment. It provides conservative leadership It discovers and develops talents. It trains in needed skills. The second great change is that the farm family determines that in h,s complex life which is evidently to continue, a haphazard scheme of life is impossible. So along with planned agriculture they determine nlannedT? ° hUmane C ° de tacta "»« •"-"&gt;-' work. c.tiLn f , P " ed leiS " re ' Pla " ned re^«t'"".

            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Maintenance of the fertility of the soil is another objective of our rural family. Prevention of erosion and acidity through crop rotation and reforestation where needed is planned. The farm family plan to have maximum of satisfaction from their available cash resources so. they keep farm and farm home accounts and prepare a joint budget each year. Every being finds satisfaction in beauty of environment so the farm family plans to landscape their home grounds and to beautify the home indoors at but little or no expense. It has been stated that soon industry will require but thirty per cent of the working hours of labor to produce the goods needed for the world's work. Farming may never reach that level but there will be undoubtedly increased hours of leisure for the farm family which they plan to use not necessarily for profit-making activity, nor ac - cording to a European pattern but in a constructive type of activity that is truly American. We need to arrange rural picnic grounds, ball grounds, hills for coasting, trees for swings, swimming places, croquet grounds, some of them may enjoy visits to art galleries, study of historical spots, such sciences as botany and astronomy, and one's own genealogy. We need modern versions of the old time social con - tacts such as singing schools, quilting bees, barn raisings and husking bees. Our rural family considers its need of spiritual stability and of leadership and guidance for themselves and their children that we may be ethical in our daily relationships and public affairs. The farm family decides that it will assume its responsibilities as intelligent citizens, so they study their civic duties and the civic system under which they live, and they assume their obligations willingly and earnestly. They study the public budget with the object of making "public welfare" rather than "private privilege" as the basis for de - termining the amount and the use of the tax. The farm family recognizes that we no longer live in a world of individuals only, but of organized endeavor, which can accomplish much that the individual alone can never do, so they form such or - ganizations as are concerned with constructive endeavors for the many. No longer can rugged individualism continue. We must develop individual Initiative and judgment and then gear into society effectively through the balance of cooperative endeavor and group judgment. The farm family determines to join with others in effective farm or - ganization, and to buy, sell and exchange cooperatively as conditions warrant. Recognizing that world conditions affect farm well-being </seg>
            <seg id="p360">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the rural family determines to think broadly, in terms of county, state, national and international affairs with the goal of social and economic well-being for all and human rights fpr all taking precedence over financial rights of the few. At this time the results of the Agricultural Adjustment Act are being evidenced throughout the land in the form of checks to farmers and I know that intelligent choice is being evidenced in the use of those checks. Payment of taxes and indebtedness are reported every - where. In some homes the intelligent choice may be for some creature comforts long deferred. In all events we know that the greatest work for national recov - ery which rural people can undertake is to think fairly and broadb - and to make intelligent choices right In our farm homes. A recent issue of the- Review of Reviews contains this sentence - "Nothing can be more essential to the security of our future civiliza - tion and to the maintenance of our representative democracy than the stability of our farm homes." When President Elliott of Harvard was asked to select the words to be engraved upon the central panel of the beautiful Union Station in the National Capital, he chose these words, which now greet every visitor to Washington: "The farm! Best homes of the family. Main source of natural wealth. Foundation of civilized society. The natural providence." My final word to you is: 1. Continue to look forward to ever-widening circles for self, family, community, agriculture, the nation and the world. 2. Make intelligent choice based on facts of research and upon long-time consideration for planned living and planned agri - culture. 3. Recognize that individual responsibility in private and public affairs is still the basis for national efficiency and security but that it must be geared into society by the balance of cooperative endeavor and that willing, self-discipline is essential to success in a democracy. 4. Strengthen our farm organizations. "In union there is strength" is still the watchword for progress. 5. Have faith, open-mindedness and the resourcefulness and cour - age of pioneers in this new field of social planning for our nation as a basis for permanent economic security . </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION And remember the words of Benjamin Franklin, that great Am - erican philosopher who said: "The taxes are indeed very heavy, and if those laid by the gov - ernment were the only ones we had to pay, we might more easily dis - charge them. But we have others, and much more grievous ones, some of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly, and from these taxes the commissioners can not ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement." The following talk was presented by Miss Mary-Ellen Brown on the State Farm Bureau program. THE NEBRASKA WOMEN DO THEIR PART MARY-ELLEN BROWN Have you heard the story of the young lad who was studying his history lesson and was having trouble with it? As his father watched him, he said, "Son, I did not have such a difficult time with history when I studied it. What can be the matter?" To this the lad replied, "But. father, when you studied history, there was not so much of it and it was not being made so fast." As we in years to come look back to the history which is being made these days, it may be that the past few months will be recorded as one of the great turning points in history. Perhaps a page in the book of world events is being turned and before us is a new page on which will be written history that is different from anything written before. We may now be re-adjusting our values of life and our esti - mate of what is worth while. The human element aud spiritual values may be coming into prominence as never before. The 18,612 farm and urban women in project and study clubs are having an important part in what is happening. If we look back into the life of womeu in the past we find that those of a century ugo who lived along the eastern shore may have had a full social life but not so' with the women who pioneered west - ward, the farther they came the less of the trimmings of life could they enjoy. They had only primitive furniture and clothing. Those were the days when women were doing their part by spinning and weaving the garments. The clothing of that earlier period was heavier and their was more of it. The rooms did not have furnace heat and there were no automobile heaters. Each woman of that time prided herself upon the number and the starchiness of her peticoats. Now our clothing is much more easily made, more easily worn and more easily laundered, but still the women in the homes are doing their part. Not so long ago much c? h^ clothing was purchased ready made, but </seg>
            <seg id="p362">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE with the lowering of the income women began to make their garments and then to make over and over from articles which were on band. When the reports for last year project clubs were totaled recently we were interested to find that 9,289 of the project club women were making garments for themselves. A total of 10.517 members had used the recommendations for improving the care, renovation, and re - modeling of clothing which had "been taught in the demonstration. We also totaled the number of garments which had been brought up-to-date by recommended changes for collars, sleeves, etc. We found that 13,765 such garments had been reported. Going farther with the tabulations we found the members reported they hail made the following: Coats 4,337 Dresses 15.22 6 Other garments 7.SS7 Boys' garments 2,135 Children's hats 2.6SS Total 32,27:; These project club reports come from only a portion of the women of Nebraska. Those outside the project clubs have been doing their part also, but we have no record from them. By sewing and re - pairing in the home women have been saving tho family Income lor other purposes. Refrigerators and cold storage plants as we know them were not known a century ago, so grandmother's menus differed from ours. If she kept the butter cool she may have had to use a well, a cave or a spring house. Mrs. Whiting has described the difference in the menus well when she said: "Grandmother had two sets of menus each year. The one for winter that lasted from October to May con - sisted of meat and potato, dried beans, cabbage (early) and sauer - kraut later; and squash and pumpkins; some roots like carrots and turnips, apples as long as they could be kept in the cellar, and very occasionally grapes and oranges. During these months, except tor cabbage and sauerkraut, the diet was entirely lacking in green veg - etable vitamins. The result was that toward spring a sort of scurvy was prevalent which was called 'spring sickness'; sometimes with children it was called 'growing pains'. It was doctored by the famous brands of Sarsaparilla and the equally famous mixture of sulphur, molasses and cream of tartar. The constant presence of lettuce and other fresh vegetables on the market all winter has made these sick - nesses and their remedies a legend to her descendants." Nowadays women are studying food values and are trying to feed </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION their families well-planned meals so that each member may feel well and be able to live "abundantly." There is much difference between ' being able to "be around" and living abundantly. Today's homemaker realizes that through food much may be done to prevent doctors' and dentists' bills. Last year the project clubs had demonstrations in the cutting, curing and canning of meat. This is not an easy job but homemakers realized what it would mean to their butcher's bill to have home canned meat on the shelf. The report shows there were 350,918 quarts of pork canned in jars which were sealed, while 32,973 quarts were preserved in open containers. We need to remember there were many women who attended the demonstrations and who followed the canning directions but who did not make a report. What an exhibit all of those 38 3,891 cans would make if we could have them here before us! There is a satisfaction in the soul of a women when she sees rows and rows of canned vegetables and meat and jelly on her storage shelves. A total number of 4,860 homemakers made milk into 17,684 pounds of Cheddar cheese, 16,642 pounds of processed cottage cheese and 3.359 pounds of Neufchatel cheese. Cheese added to the variety in the diet of the family. But women have done more than can and preserve food, for hundreds and hundreds of them have helped in the gardens and where they have not worked in the garden they have enthusiastically interested others about what and how much the family needed to raise in order to have well-planned and adequate meals. Whenever one visits with the women in any of the Farm Bureau counties the women tell how much they enjoyed the bread making lesson last March. ' It seemed to me that lesson would not be helpful for so many women were already good breadmakers, but in recent years even many of the good bread makers were out of practice and frequently in the newer homes the women had not learned the art of making good bread. The variations demonstrated in the bread lesson were reported to have been used by 9,644 women. The women on the farms have been an important factor .in con - serving the family income and in making it go as far as possible but it may be in the near future when more money comes into the home she will assume another responsibility. She will have her "*, part in the NRA when she makes her daily or weekly visit to the store. What she buys helps to keep men and women employed, for. her purchases enable shopkeepers to do business and this in turn helps the mills to run. If the women of the country who are the ultimate consumers of about 86 per cent of the retail buying of the </seg>
            <seg id="p364">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE stores, are presently able to purchase "food, clothes, furnishings, houses, or such things as a hair cut, cleaned clothes, or a train ride," they will have their part in the forward movement. The Child Welfare Magazine for December describes this situa - tion so well that I want to quote from It. In p_rt it says: "Consider what the housewife's daily visit to the store means. When the house - wife buys an article from the retail store, the retailer buys another from the wholesaler to replace it, the wholesaler buys another from the factory, and the factory another from the producer of raw products. On the housewife all those producers or distributors de - pend largely for their profits. "Suppose a housewife makes a dollar purchase. Out of that dollar, twenty-nine cents goes to the store for the service it renders —which is that of making it possible for her to buy what she wants when she wants it. Seventeen cents of that dollar goes j to dis - tribution, which includes the wholesaler and transportation. Fifty cents of it goes on to the manufacturer. Not that each dollar is divided into exactly these parts, for with some purchases more of the dollar may go to the store, less to the manufacturer, or the 1 other way around. But figuring averages this is the estimated division. In a sense, then, the housewife becomes the employer of all these industries." The housewife also helps "labor" as her purchases give employ - ment to those who are producing raw materials as well as those who work in industries. Thus her dalljf or weekly visit to the grocery or dry i;oods store is far-reaching in its benefits. Her purchases are a part in keeping men and women employed as the shopkeeper replaces that which he has sold. He is aided in continuing his business; he in turn through the advertising he does, or the financing or the transportation or the many other agencies he calls on in his daily routine as he operates his business gives employment and business existence to others so long as the goods are kept moving. If, on the other hand, the tens of^ thousands of women do not start the circle of employment and production through the purchases for home consumption the inevitable result is that goods stay on the shelves, the retailer does not re-order, the banks do not circulate their monies, the press is not aided by its advertising income, the fac - tories do not employ labor or buy the raw materials. Stagnation chokes the whole circle of "Land, labor, capital, and management" with the tragic consequences which the world has labelled, "De - pression." i- The ljiousewife is not asked to be recklessly extravagant. She is </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION urged to use 'her very best judgment and skill in all of the buying which she does. Her buying needs to be considered a busiuess or a profession and all she asks is for fair prices for all concerned. She needs to compart- prices and to be sure she is receiving a true value for her money. Sirs. Emily Newell Blair, of the NRA, has said: "She musl consider' the matter of quality. She must realize that in the setting of new prices, manufacturers and retailers will be tempted to increase theirj profits by providing an article of inferior quality at the same price others ask for better quality. This is a form of profiteer - ing and it is most difficult to detect. To do it the housewife must inform herself as to standards of quality. She must know the good from the shoddy.' She must prefer the good. Only she, by her knowl - edge of values, can save herself here. "There stifp remains, therefore, plenty of opportunity for vari - ations in prices. The Housewife is quite within her rights in her desire to make-her money go as far as she can by taking advantage of lower prices. "As, -a matter of fact she is really helping the Recovery Program when she does so. Again and again the President has asked that prices be advanced gradually in order not to outstrip the increase in buying power due te- the r^jked wages and shorter hours. By buying wisely, the housewife can assist in keeping prices down. Naturally the pro - ducer and the retailer want to make all they can. At the same time they do not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, which in this case is "purchasing power". Many of them will be content, there - fore, to raise their prices gradually, looking to the return of good business to bring them a steady market. By patronizing these mer - chants and producers, the housewife-purchaser is throwing her in - fluence against the undue increase that will delay recovery." Perhaps you are saying that I am talking as though we had money to spend freely now. We till know that is not true with most of us, but we do need to become wiser in our spending and that is one of the reasons why so many women in Nebraska are keeping home accounts and why 1S2 of these women last year sent their home account books in to the University to have them analyzed. Simply keeping a list of expenditures has little if any value; it is only when these figures are totttled and analyzed at stated times during the year that they bring a return. When these figures talk back to us and tell us stories about how to spend our money more wisely and where to make adjustments, are they worth the effort and time spent on them. More and more women are becoming efficient home managers and are becoming busi - ness experts in the handling of the home finances. How many fam - ilies have gone to pieces on the rocks of poor financing! It is a joy to talk to women who are making the money spent by the homemaker produce its true value. </seg>
            <seg id="p366">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD 0&gt;" AGRICULTURE Another important thing in which Nebraska women have been do - ing their part is in welfare work. They have been helping the needy in their local communities. They have given time to sew for the Red Cross and other welfare organizations, they have helped in canning kitchens where they have canned for relief work, or even better- than that, they have taught others how to can for themselves. ..Women have helped on welfare boards and they have done something toward helping-.such committees in the best use of the foods which afe avail - able. They have also helped with the selection and the proper prep - aration of cheap but adequate food .which may be supplied. They are trying to prevent malnutrition. As time goes on there will be malt? children who will never recover from the effects of having inadequate food. A lack of the important elements in food not only seriously affects the body but it does dreadful things to one's outlook on life and the manner in which one gets along with other people. *• People who are malnourished find it much more difficult to be' good citizens. Up to the present time the home economics trained women. hste 1 flat been used as effectively as they might have been in many communities.' With Dr. Gibbons of the Foods and Nutrition Department of the Uni - versity out in the field, relief committees may have her help if .they wish it. * .. As to the future. Dr. War bur ton has said. "We cannot hope for conditions which will make agriculture profitable for every person who engages in it. There will still continue to be wide differences in the efficiency of individuals but the greatest reward, will continue to be given to those whose operations are best planned, who conduct their business with the greatest care, who plan their operations well- in advance, keep records of cost and income, and adjust their farming to suit the needs of the times. Agricultural adjustment cannot be ex - pected suddenly to make rural life Utopian any more than present - day control of business can be expected to insure success for every - one who engages in it." The same thing is true of Nebraska homemakers, for we cannot hope that all will be equally successful in managing their homes. There are many who plan well in advance, who use home accounts and who adjust their homemaking to meet the present conditions and who are making their lives worth while for themselves and for those around them. One cannot over-emphasize the importance , of good management in the home. Many are overworked because they are such poor managers or do not have the ability to select the worth while and essential things which come into everyday life. But handling of the clothing problems, the food problems and the finances of the home are not all of the homemakers' responsibilities. for there is the education and the training of the children. </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA HUME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION A century ago. the schooling possibilities for women were so meagre that we can hardly realize that Mount Holyoke and Miss Willard's school for girls were about the only ones for the higher education of women. Now think of the high schools, the Junior Colleges, the Teachers Colleges and the! great Universities where girls and women may attend school. It is [since I began to teach ill a rural school that women here in '.Nebraska have had an opportunity to study the science of homemaking. And how vital and how valuable it is for a girl to receive training in the tilings which will be a part of her life work if she marries and goes into a home of her own. We continually hear of girls who have completed the home economics course in the University of whom it is said, "She is an excellent home maker and she does her work easily." One of the best ways to make one happy and useful in life is to be able to do well and easily the job in which she finds herself. In Nebraska many mothers are realizing what the home economics course may mean to a girl and they are encouraging their daughters to study to be happy homemakers. Sometimes one wonders if the gen - eral public realizes the difference between the home economics of to - day and the term "domestic science" which was dropped back in about 1906 or 1907. Domestic Science meant perhaps mostly cooking and sewing but that is not true of home economics. The term home econ - omics includes every probltlm which confronts homemakers. It is much broader than just cooking and sewing. It includes the care of the house; the care and training of children, the study of personality and family relationship, the,' expenditure of money and the develop - ment of the spiritual side ofjthe members of the household. If man - aging a household is a big Job, and we will all agree that to do it successfully is a big one, tlien girls who are going into it need all of the preparation possible fir it. Why not have training one can use every day of the year rather than to have training of which a great part is memorizing facts that will not be used, but will soou be for - gotten. The Home Economics training is one of the best forma of in - surance against the divorce courts for it is said that rarely is a woman divorced who has completed) the home economics course. This state - ment is worth thinking over. We insure against many tragedies. Why not have the daughters insured against the tragedy of divorce? Nearly always when a group of women are asked what kind of talks they wish to have on a program or on the radio or what lessons they wish to have to study,' there will be requests for help on child training. Help along this Held is one of the later developments in the home economics field. The girls who are taking that course now are privileged to help in the nursery school and are studying the personalities of children at first hand. It is not just a theoretical </seg>
            <seg id="p368">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE niuujr out of books. They study the children as they work and play. Can you think of anything that may be used as much in the lives of most girls as to be able to understand and handle children? Then, too, out of the training comes a study of her own personality and of her relationship in the family and to others. Project club women are thinking along other lines than those previously mentioned for they are realizing the importance of play In the home and in the community. Last year there were two lessons on this phase of homemaking. Our records show that 9,353 toys were made and also 5,905 sock dolls. The time is too short this morning to go further into the details of the reports on the Christmas lesson and there is time only to mention that 7,844 people attended the local and county "play days" in the spring. Grandmother and grandfather went to spelling bees, singing Fchools and basket socials, but the women of today belong to various types of clubs and organizations. In Nebraska 14,273 women were enrolled last year in the 892 project clubs and 4,339 in the 221 study clubs, making a grand total of 18.612 members in the 1,113 clubs. If one can visualize over 18,600 women one can realize what a force for good they become if they "team up" for any piece of work they wish to accomplish. These .are the women who want to study and improve their homes. They are willing to spend time in helping the world to become better, for the. progress of the world depends upon the homes. Another helpful activity of Nebraska women is that of leading many of the 1.5S2 4-H clubs which had 17.4SS members last year. Most of you know the value of such work toward building useful citizens. These women are also studying and making themselves better citizens for they are reading and listening to the radio so they are being informed on the topics of the day. Sometimes I wonder if the men of the farms are keeping in. touch with world conditions as closely as the women. No doubt the men think they are, but I wonder if they are right. With women assuming more active duties and greater responsibilities in county, state and national affairs, do you suppose we will in the future at s^ome time have a woman execu - tive in the White House? Think this over, for the place of women In the world is changing. There is a field where the men may well join the women in their activities and that is on the spiritual side of life. One continually reads and hears that there is a decided swing taking place toward a deepening of the spiritual life. Mr. Lojuis J. Tabor said yesterday, "The human mind is groping (toward the infinite." He said that was </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION progress. The soul life is the most important thing in life for "what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul'." There is nothing so important to any of us as our own soul life, our relationship with Gad, our prayer life. All of these other things will pass away, but our: souls will continue on through eternity, and eternity is a long, long, long time. We can well afford to spend time in communion with God, for surely we cannot expect Him to • become a friend of ours all at once if we have not done our part in becoming acquainted with Him here in this life. Because women realize the importance of the soul life they are not only doing their part toward making their homas, in partnership with their husbands, what they want them to be, but they are helping to train their chil - dren to be useful and happy citizens. They are also doing their part to prepare themselves to be worth while citizens in this world and also in the eternal world. We have reason to be proud of our Nebraska women for none better can be found anywhere. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PART II MOTHERS' VACATION CAMPS The girls' dormitory at the School of Agriculture tit Curtis is an excellent place for a Mothers' Vacation Camp. The women of Fron - tier and nearby counties asked to have a camp there again during the summer of 1933, so it was arranged to have it from July 23 to 26. The women in this part of the state asked to have the, camp begin on Sunday afternoon so the family could have the ride and Dad would not have to be out of the field. Campers kept arriving turnout the afternoon and were met by Mary-Ellen Brown and Leona Davis. They were then assigned to their rooms by Mrs. A. B. Campbell. A Bible guessing contest was used to help the campers to become acquainted. The first meal served in the camp was the Sunday evening supper. Following this, till went out to the lawn near the lily pond for the vesper service. Those who have seen the lily pond at the School can realize how pretty it is at sunset. There is a lovely restful view off over the hills. Miss Mildred Nelson, the home demonstration agent of Phelps county, had charge of the vesper service. It opened with a violin solo by Miss Kibben. Mrs. N. W. Gaines sang and then Mis. II. B. Oyer of Holdrege led in the devotional part of the service. The topic, 'What is in Thine Hand?" was ably discussed by her. Following the vesper service the women went inside and Mrs. Gaines began reading the book,. "Forgive Us Our Trespasses." On Monday morning following breakfast, each camper told where she went to school as a child. Many interesting experiences are re - lated and often campers find they have known some of the other campers earlier in life. A part of the forenoon was spent in small groups discussing. "What do we receive from our tax dollars?" Following the discussions each group made a report on what they had listed its advantages received from the tax dollars. The campers agreed they had not realized that our tax money meant so much to each of us. The separate lists were combined into one list for the Curtis camp. This was later turned to Mrs. S. P. Davis of Syracuse who used it when she wrote her paper. "What Are Our Children Learning About Taxes?" This paper is found in another part of this report. The last part of the forenoon was spent in making tooled leather coin purses with Miss Leona Davis in charge. As a "follow up" of the tooling work, several counties which have county home demonstration agents have since had tooling leather in the clubs in their counties. </seg>
            <seg id="p371">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Buffalo, Dawson. Phelps and Burt counties have each made a large variety of tooled leather purses and other articles. In the afternoon there was a quiet hour and then Mrs. Gaines con - tinued reading "Forgive Us Our Trespasses". In the evening the campers had a "kid party". There were many clever costumes and all enjoyed the' garnet and the contest on original stunts. -.' After breakfast Tuesday morning, each camper told of her most embarrassing moment. There are many amusing situations described during this period, and all had good laughs over them. :. I • ■ During the forenoon Mr. j H. Claybaugh gave a talk on the wheat situation. At the close of his talk he answered questions which helped the women to have an understanding of the new plan for wheat. The women then continued their work on the tooled leather purses. In the afternoon Mrs. Gaines completed her book. The women of Curtis then called on the campers. This was an especially fine courtesy on the part of the local women and was much appreciated by the campers. In the evening there was a picnic for the women at Aggie Land and following this the campers went to one of the local churches where 1 they heard John Howard and the church choir give a Seth Parker program. The next morning Mr. H. K. Douthit took those who were interest - ed around the barns and poultry yards, so the women would have an opportunity to know more about the school. Those who had not completed their purses were given time to do so. Later in the forenoon there was a discussion period on "What do we get from the Project Work?" A little time was also spent on the activities of the county home demonstration agents, for it is surpris - ing how many different responsibilities the home agents have. . The campers were sorry to have the camp come to an end and asked to have a chance to dance the Virginia Reel before they left for home. Mr. and Mrs. Douthit made the campers feel at home and helped in every way possible to have them have a happy time. The campers appreciate the good meals Mrs. Campbell serves to them and they also enjoy the comfortable beds in the dormitory. Camp Brewster The camp at Camp Brewster was' held August 8 to 11.

Camp Brewster is beautifully situated and the women enjoy the scenery while they are at the camp. They also enjoy the swimming pool and the good meals which are served. On Wednesday afternoon the women were taken by bus to the Joslyn Memorial. Dr. Paul Grummann explained about the building and then took the campers all thru it. At the close of the afternoon there was an organ recital given in the music hall. The women who attended the Curtis camp were: Miss Greeta Brown, Kearney Mrs. A. A.

December 2. 1933. The Northwestern Corn King is leaving Union Station, Omaha, numbering me as one of its passengers with Nebraska's delegation to the, 12th National 4-H Club Congress, Chi - cago. As a member of thewinning baked foods judging team, State Fair. Lincoln, I am a thankfuT-recipient of this prize trip given by the Northwestern railroad company and the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. The evening on the train, before retiring, was spent on a visit through the train, singing lots of songs and in meeting and becoming acquainted with our sponsors for the week: Mr. L. I. Friable, Lincoln, Miss Helen Suchy, Walthill, and Miss Mildred Nelson, Holdrege; not until the next day did we meet Miss Allegra Wilkens, Lincoln, Mr. Walter Tolman, Lincoln, and Mr. R. A.

After we had our group picture taken at the station, we left bjy taxi to the Harrison Hotel where reser - vations were made for the Nebraska delegation during our stay in Chicago. After breakfast we marched in arranged order to attend central church services. Orchestral Hall, on the way. I received my first desirous glimpse of the renowned Michigan Avenue. In the afternoon, under the direction of our state leaders, we visited Lincoln Park, 1040 acres in area, with its large and varied collection of wild animals, rare tropical and native plants. j Upon arriving at the International Livestock Exposition grounds the next morning, Monday, December 4, an address of welcome was given to the entire 4-H delegation by Mr. B.

This was the day of the Home Economics judging contests, at which my teammate and I represented Nebraska in the baked foods division 9:30 A. M. at the Great Hall, Saddle and Sirloin Club, in competition with twenty-six other representatives from other states. Visiting the various exhibits of the show filled the few hours be - fore 4:00 P. M. when all 4-H delegates left in motor coaches, provided by Wilson and Company to be guests of Thomas E. Wilson for enter - tainment and dinner. Shortly after dinner, I was indeed thrilled, to - gether with my teammate, when our state leader, Mr. L. I. Frisbie, told us that we, as national winners, were to ride in the winners' wagon, to lead the parade of the nation's 4-H representatives, after the Wilson entertainment in the coliseum at the Exposition grounds. i Another day arrived, bringing with it more loads of sights and facts, the girls and boys going on separate trips. The first hours of the morning were spent in a journey through Field Museum, then about 11:00 A. M. till noon at the Adler Planetarium we heard an Interesting lecture with the reproduction of the heavens in motion on a dome 68 feet in diameter. As I stood on the steps, when leaving the Planetarium, a most picturesque scene greeted my eyes. On the left, the dazzling colors and modern architecture of the Century of Progress grounds lay before me. Then to the right, looking over the waters of Lake Michigan, 1 saw a wonderful view of Chicago's skyline. Truly, a vast. array of man-made structures and inventions. For luncheon and a delightful afternoon entertainment we were guests of the Chicago Mail Order Company. Back to the hotel and leaving again, yes, on our way to the Grand Ballroom, Sherman Hotel. for the 4-H members' own banquet and National Rally at. 6 P. M., a great event of the week. Trees, cut and brought from Wisconsin, were used in carrying out the decorations and program. Wednesday, December 6, and we're on a fifty to sixty, mile bus trip to see Chicago, with a lecturer pointing out to us interesting notes about the city. To mention a few of the many facts new and interest - ing to me: the Chicago river is the only one in the »world running backwards, water from Lake Michigan draining into the Ohio river. All parks in the city are artificial or planted and designed especially for that purpose. Chicago has five large and 19 6 small parks; unusual, but there are no "keep off" signs in any of the parks. People may use the parks as they see fit. As we drove through the newly con- , structed shores of the lake, the process of filling in the added land was explained to us, pumping the sand through pipes from the bottom of the lake, depositing it at the shore, then covering with a layer of </seg>
            <seg id="p377">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION dirt. We passed the Merchandise Mart, the world's largest building, covering 92 acres of space, the Board of Trade Building, 609 feet, the tallest Chicago building, the Tribune Tower, having the most number of stories — 48, and then made a few minutes' stop at the Fountain or Passing of Time statute, illustrating the passing of people, Father Time standing still, constituting 156 figures and required nine years and eleven months to carve. We had dinner at Livestock Inn, attended that afternoon's Horse Show, including a polo game, the first one I've seen. In the evening I was present for the gala time we had at the entertainment and Merry- Go-Round party for 4-H delegates at the Auditorium Hotel. Bright and early we arose December 7, the last day, ready for the invitation to Montgomery Ward plant for breakfast at 8:15, with en - tertainment and sightseeing tour of the company. As a winner, I visited and spoke over the N. B. C. network, my first experience. Luncheon, '• courtesy of Marshall Field and Com - pany. National winners again separated from the party had received the honor of meeting Rufus Dawes, president, A Century of Progress, at the World's Fair grounds. On to the Museum of Science and Industry, there experiencing a trip down into the coal mine especially constructed for educational purposes. A complete survey of the mining of coal, very complete indeed, even to the dark side through the tunnels. A club dinner at the Auditorium Hotel with presentation of awards | closed the week's events. About 9:00 P. M. most of Nebraska's dele - gation left for the station to return home on the Northwestern Port - land-Rose, modern and fully equipped in every detail. Morning brought us nearing Nebraska and "Home Sweet Home" and about 9:45 A. M. I arrived In Omaha where I was met by my par - ents, ready to tell them all about my trip and ready to bring home to all Nebraska thoughts and experiences which I received from such an educational and enjoyable week, which has widened my views of life beyond my own community. | And it is certainly with my due respect and thanks to all the donors for and the many helps from the combined efforts of state, county and community 4-H leaders that made it possible for me to win, both the trip and national honors as a member of the champion baked foods judging team, placing second Individually.

            <seg id="p382">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "A VISION OF ORGANIZATION" By R. O. WILLIAMS, Kearney, Nebr. Several years ago its I was riding on the train. I began talking to the woman occupying the seat with me. After a time she asked me what occupation my husband followed, and I replied, "Oh, ho is just a farmer." She immediately took me to task. She said, "Why do you say he is just a farmer? You act as though you are apologizing for his occupa - tion. I think farming is the greatest and most interesting industry there is." But as I look over the program and see the names of those who spoke to you this morning ami who are going to speak to you this afternoon, I feel apologetic and must tell you that I am not a trained speaker but "just a farm woman" hence I am not equal to any flights of oratory. And I am not as optimistic as the young Instructor, who said, when trying to encourage his class in public speaking. "Remember, prac - tice ill speaking makes perfect, the same as in gossiping.'' But because I am a farm woman I am here to till voir something of an organization that I am happy to belong to, because it is so worth - while. It is a service organization composed of farmers who have or - ganized County Farm Bureau. It was organized to represent Ne - braska farmers in matters of legislation, transportation, taxation prob - lems, credit facilities and other subjects affecting the interests and welfare of the farmer and his family. The Farm Bureau Federation is not a competitive organization. It is not sectional. It. is not denominational, it is not political. It Is designed as an instrument to do certain specific pieces of work that can only be accomplished through group action. This organization is ever watchful when the state legislature meets, fighting against any legislation that would prove detrimental to the farmer, and fighting equally hard for legislation that will be a benefit to him. I wish it were possible to get to all you people the information of what is being accomplished by the organization. Much of this Is published in The Bureau Farmer, also the Amer - ican Farm Bureau Federation, official News Letter, which is the official review of the activities of the American Farm Bureau Feder - ation. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I' If you do not read these papers when they come Into your homes, then you are to blame, for not trying to keep yourselves Informed. The Farm Bureau Federation is an organization that has an in - structive and progressive program and one that farm women play an important part in. Woman's place in the field of industry and politics has been slowly won and established but woman's place in ours, the greatest industry, has always been established. The farm woman is the true partner of the farm man so it was not strange that when the farm people of this country set about to estab - lish a Nation-wide institution to meet the social and economic prob - lems of agriculture, that the farm woman should take her place side 'by side, with her husband. There were five women present at this meeting who assisted ma - terially in perfecting this organization. It was decided then and there that women should have all the rights on the same basis as the men in every particular and from that day on. the women have carried their share in the development of Farm Bureau Organization. We find our farm women serving as State Farm Bureau Presi - dents. Vice Presidents, members of State Boards of Directors, mem - bers of Executive Committees and heads of State and National Farm Bureau office departments. And out in the counties they hold posi - tions also. Nearly every state has a Home and Community Department whose work is to interest and enlist the services of the farm family to raise the standard of the farm home, since it is the center of the farm life. The social standard of the farm home is higher and the educa - tional, recreational and cultural opportunities are increasing every year, due to the untiring efforts of farm women. We are told that woman spends about eighty-five per cent of the family income. 1 mean wise spending. It seems, then, that the ultimate goal for our organized efforts is an increased income for the farm family. We want to see every farm woman an intelligent voter, too, so she will help select and elect people to office, who are In sympathy with the program of agriculture and not go on as we have in the past, electing people who are more Interested In other industries. Labor and Industry have been organized lor years, but they are more effectively organized now than ever before. </seg>
            <seg id="p384">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Farmers must become more strongly organized if they are going to receive the maximum benefits. Farmers meet more opposition when trying to organize than any other group. I have been surprised, the last year, at the attacks made on 4-H Club work, Women's Project Clubs and even the Smith-Hughes course in our public schools. Opposition seeks to misrepresent facts and create a feeling of doubt in the minds of the farmer. Anything that will keep him from uniting with his neighber to help put over the farm program. Selfish interests are at work, trying to destroy the voice of Or - ganized Agriculture. Our only hope is to present a united front to those who would trample down the structure that we are building, just to further their own selfish ends. , - GUIDING THE, ADOLESCENT BOYS AND GIRLS By DR. RUTH STAPLES There are many people in each generation who- spend much time and energy worrying over the young people of the times. Since this happens again and again with each generation, we may wonder as to the cause. Doubtless it lies in the fact that t brought ful parents and others interested in the welfare of these young folks are anxious that they turn out to be- just a little better and happier than they them - selves have been. With experience, we learn that the world is made up of many kinds of people, some of whom are much more satisfactory citizens and members of families than others. Also there is more evidence piling up every day which indicates that early training or guidance is one of the determining factors in the character and personality of the adult. While adolescence is not the only important period for parents to consider, it is the one about which we have the greatest concern, probably because it is the end of childhood and we know that it is our "last chance." Adolescence is the period between childhood and adulthood, roughly speaking, the "teen age." The boy or girl is no longer physically a child and yet lacks the experience and judgment of maturity. It is Just this "in between-ness" of the period that causes much of the difficulty and many of the problems faced by the parents of the young girl or youth. One minute they reprove them for acting like babies and in the next they emphasize their inability to do this or that be - cause "you aren't old enough" or "mother knows best." The boy or girl has to learn new habits as he reaches maturity and also has to drop many of his habits or attitudes of childhood. Also the parents have to drop many of the habits they have built up while the children </seg>
            <seg id="p385">385 NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION were small and treat their adolescent sons and daughters i .„„,, should be treated; that Is, to regard them as young people rapidly approaching the time when they will be mature and Independent in thought and action. The psychologists who have made an intensive study ot adolescents have found that the problems of this period center around a few major cravings of the maturing boy or girl, namely, the desire to be free from the parent's supervision, to be independent financially, and interest in the other sex. The desire to be free from the rules or supervision of their elders and to be independent in thought and action lis perfectly healthy and normal in adolescence. To be sure, the symptoms of this urge are often most annoying and at times quite undesirable or even impossible. These symptoms' vary all the way from wanting to have a key, or a car, or to stay out late to being inconsiderate of others and ill mannered around the house. However, if the child is handled sensibly, we may not fear for his future. He may not be perfect, but he will be able to accomplish his aim which is a fundamental need "for society, that is, to think and act independently, unhampered by fears, doubts, and indecisions and not easily influenced. On the other hand, if the youth is thwarted in his struggle to "grow up" he may fall into one or two pitfalls, either he will struggle more violently and his behavior or "symptoms" take on a serious aspect or he may give up altogether and remain un - |mature and dependent for direction by others all of his life. The prob - lem of the parent is to recognize the symptoms as merely symptoms of a healthy urge, and to guide the boy or girl so that he will express his desire for independence and in ways that are socially desirable. 'It is guidance and re-direction that the 'youth needs, rather than "scenes" and thwarting. Allow its much freedom as is possible, saving restrictions for things that really count. Associate with your children in play as well as In every day living. The boy who has the companionship and comrade - ship of his father picks up informally many splendid lessons. Through - out childhood we need to continue our sympathetic, consistent or firm treatment, not firm in the sense of harsh or stern, but firm as con - trasted to yielding to teasing, whining, anger, sulking, or other un - desirable behavior, * Parents should rejneinber that the children are getting grown up and that they no longer need the same care and supervision that was necessary in babyhood. The child should be taught self-reliance from early childhood by doing things for himself and by making his own decisions wherever it is possible. The adolescent should be weaned from his parents and should be able to be happy away from home and to be entirely trustworthy. This training should be begun in </seg>

They should train them to do a thing because it Is the' right thing to do, rather than because they will be punished if they don't. This means careful explanations, firm and consistent treatment and rare and well thought out punish - ment. The sex Interest is another major problem of adolescence and is an expression of a major and perfectly normal urge. In primitive society mating was accomplished at this age as the simple economic situation permitted a youth to provide for a family with ease. At the present time marriage is delayed for a number of years past physical maturity and the boy or girl meets the problem of adjust - ing his normal impulses to behaviour that! is acceptable and socially i desirable to society. As in the case of the urge for j Independence, 1 the sex impulse has various symptoms. The boy or girl is anxious to appear desirable to the other sex. Consequently he is particular about dress, and wishes to do the sort of things which] will favorably Impress the other sex. One boy wanted to have a car to take a girl to a dance. Since the family bad no car and since the girl lived a very short distance from the dance hall, the father thought it foolish to hire one for the occasion. The boy was much upset and distressed his parents by his unseemly conduct. lie did not wish to he un - reasonable, but be did so want to appear as a "fine fellow" in the eyes of his girl. Parents should not necessarily give in to each whim of the hoy fir girl nor should they tolerate impudence or rudeness. They should, however, keep in mind the reason back of the foolish or otherwise un - desirable behavior and help the youth in every way possible to ad - just himself in a way that will be satisfactory to home and society. This can be done In several ways. First, see that the family is a good example of happy relationships. No girl .or hoy can build up a desir - able Ideal of marriage who is brought up in a home whore bickering and quarreling is rife or where love and affection are absent. Then provide opportunity for wholesome recreation and wide acquaintance with members of the opposite sex. The girl or hoy who gets the idea that he or she is unattractive or who sticks entirely to members of the same sex should he helped to make acquaintances. Do no laugh at their first attempts at getting acquainted and avoid forbidding too many things, especially things which are not serious, but merely annoying or apparently foolish. Teach self-control and consideration of others from early child - hood and give such sex education as is suitable for each age. En - lightenment on sex matters doesn't safeguard the boy or girl from every danger, but it is one of the best guarantees yet discovered. </seg>

            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There has been through the last 15 years a renewed development of Interest all over the country in the subject of chemical fertilizers for gardens, lawns and flowers, not that the merits of animal manure are any less appreciated than they were a long time ago- — for they ara not. It still stands as the best fertilizer there is for all. gardens, lawns, flower and greenhouse use. No chemical fertilizer has ever be*n invented that has all of the many functions as the animal fertilizer. FERTILIZERS FOR GARDENS, LAWNS, AXD FLOWERS DR. J. C. RUSSEL, College of Agriculture, Lincoln. There has been during the last 15 years, a remarkable development of interest all over the country in chemical fertilizers for gardens, lawns, and flowers. Not that the merits of animal fertilizer are re - garded any less than formerly, for It was, and still is, where it can be had. the very best and safest general purpose fertilizer. No chemi - cal fertilizer has ever been invented that is inclusive of so many functions. Rather it lb that animal fertilizer, among almost three - fourths the people, has become like its once dependable source, the family cow and buggy horse, a tradition. Livery stables and back - lot barns have been displaced by garages, and manure by the grease and grime of automobiles. Today, such manure as can be had among city folk is the product of an occasional poultry flock, or else it is a huckster commodity. Its origin is suspicious, its quality is in - definite, its sale is unregulated, and the buyer has no recourse unless perchance he is so fortunate as to be able to purchase through a pro - fessional nursery man or lawn builder of guarded reputation. This situation has originated a demand for a substitute. The fertilizer industry, already well established in the business of com - mercial fertilizer for field and truck crops, naturally responded, and accelerated the demand by advertising. Within the limitations of standard trade codes, this is perfectly legitimate and inevitable. It Is an advertising age. The trouble is, if there is a trouble, that chemical fertilizer is a subject matter with which the buyer is not always sufficiently familiar. Animal fertilizer usage is founded on hundreds of years of tradi - tions. There is not much that the modern horticulture, or floriculture, or agronomic scientist can tell the householder, florist, or farmer about manure. But chemical fertilizers are relatively new. The first formula" was prepared less than 100 years ago. They are a manufactured product. Scientists invented them, and they have taken the lead in studying them. Consequently It is to them that the user must and should go for information, at least in the present generation. </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The purpose of this talk is simply to tell what chemical fertilizers are, what their ingredients for gardens, lawns, and flowers should be, how to use them, and how to judge between various brands that i cone to our attention. Plants require from the soil 7 chemical elements as follows: Nitrogen (N) Sulfur (S) Phosphorus (P) !&lt; Calcium (Ca) Potassium (K) Magnesium (Mg) Iron (Fe) They respond to, and possibly positively require, traces of other elements like chlorine (CI)', Manganese (Mn), Boron (B), Copper (Cu) and Zinc I Zn t . The laws of all states recognize the first three, nitrogen, phos - phorus, und potassium, as being the essential Ingredients of any material sold for fertilizing purposes and require that, whenever .he sale price exceeds a certain amount ($3 per ton in Nebraska), the con - tent of 'these elements be stated to the customer. The laws recognize that not all substances containing N, P, and K are equally good and protect both customer, manufacturer, and vendor by requiring that the analysis specifically state the content of available nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium. By available is meant water soluble in the case of N and K, and soluble In certain standard chemicals In the case of P. Tho Nebraska law requires that these available contents be com - puted und expressed in the conventional terms ammonia (NH 3 ), phos - phoric acid (P..O.-, ) and potash (K^O). It is to be understood that neither N. P. and K, nor NH ;l , P.O.-,, or K.O exist as such in any pro.esi.-ed or natural material. They exist In compounds like sodium nitrate, monocalcium phosphate, or potassium sulfate and their legal expression is only a common and accepted base. There is nothing in the law concerning what the manufacturer or vendor may tell or claim about the other Ingredients of his product, or how he may complete or express their contents. It is presumed that the;-p points are taken care of In laws regarding "truth in advertising". Some states require publication of the basic ingredients employed and the amount of filler. Nebraska does not. Every carton or bag of fertilizer sold in Nebraska should bear a i conspicuous label or tag that tells the guaranteed analysis. For example, it may state Water soluble nitrogen as ammonia (NH 3 ) 8.0% Available phosphoric acid (PnO.-,) 5.0% Water soluble pota.h (K;,0) 3.0% Mentally arranging these percentages In the order NPK (It rhimes with I </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAR!) OF AGRICULTURE NBA), If the manufacturer has not already done so, and one has the fertilizer formula. In the above It is S - 5 - 3 The sum of the figures in a formula indicates the grade of the fertilizer, that is, the amount of plant food which it contains per 100 poinds of weight. If this sum is over 16, the fertilizer is generally called high grade, and if less than 16, it is called low grade. This is not necessarily highly important. For example, in the two formulas 8-5-3, and 4-12-4, .the second with 20 units of plant food Is best by "grade", but if nitrogen is desired the first is twice as good from an analysis standpoint. On the other hand, in the two formulas 2-6-2, and 4-12-4, the real worth is proportional to grade for there is just twice as much of any or all elements in the second as in the first. The difference is filler. ! Some fertilizers contain filler and others do not. Filler is inert material put Into a fertilizer for one purpose or another. It may be for the purpose of reducing the grade for there is a certain class of people, who think that 200 pounds of 2-6-2 is better than 100 pounds of 4-12-4 and accordingly prefer a low grade. It is conveniently used to adjust and maintain the grade at some desired formula. More of f en and quite legitimately, it is put in to improve the physical quality, to keep the fertilizer from going lumpy, to make it spread more easily, etc It is desirable that filler be of some value in itself and ground animal manure, neat, and muck are recognized as commendable fillers. Some of the basic materials from which mixed fertilizers are made are as follows: | \ Sodium nitrate (cir, 16% N - 20% NIL,), a, soluble salt mined in Chile, and made synthetically in chemical plants from soda ash and nP.rlc acid. Ammonium sulfate (.cir. 20% N- 24% NH :1 ) a soluble salt obtained as a by product from coke ovens and made synthetically from ammonia and sulphuric acid. Ammonium phosphate (cir. 11% N - 13% NH :l , 52% P.O.-,) a so'uble salt made synthetically from ammonia and phosphoric acid. Ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, cyannmid, and urea, all made synthetically. The latter contains over 40% available nitrogen. Blood meal, tankage, cottonseed meal, and similar nitrogenous animal and plant products called in the trade "organic ammoniates". They range between 8 and 14 per cent nitrogen of slow availability. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Superphosphate (cir. 16-20% available P.O.-.l. Made from natural phosphate rock by simple treatment with sulphuric, acid.

Ground animal bones. 30 to 50 per cent available immediately. Potassium chloride and potassium sulfate (cir. 50% Iv.O). Soluble salt'- mainly imported from France and Germany. Any of the above can be purchased singly and may be used alone or artiiically mixed at home to furnish N, 'P, and K as desired. Each has its own virtues, and experience alone will lead to various pre - ferences regardless of chemical analysis. There are two view points in the use of fertilizer. One is to fertilize the plant, the other the soil. Each element, N, P, or K, litis its own specific functions, each plant its own specific require - ments, and each soil its own specific attributes and deficiencies. Tin- proper objective is to fit the fertilizer to the plant and the soil, under the conditions where the plant is grown. Nitrogen promotes vegetative growth and makes plants leafy and green. On soils so highly deficient in nitrogen that plants are yellow and spindling, a proper amount of nitrogenous fertilizer will make for greater production of leaf, seed, tuber, or root. The tendency of • nitrogen in excess is to make plants "go to top" and mature late, thai is. it reduces the proportion of blossom;, seed, tuber, or root. In particular, excess nitrogen leads to sterility of blossom. There - fore in gardens, excessive nitrogen either natural or from fertilizer, is disadvantageous on tomatoes, egg plant, cucumbers, and all plants that bear fruit or seed. On such, If one is to err, it should be in using too little rather than to much nitrogen. The legumes, like peas and beans and leguminous floral plants are an exception. They require an abundance of nitrogen and rarely suffer from an excess. Nitrogen is used to best advantage on leafy crops like, spinach, chard, lettuce, cabbage, etc., and on foliage floral plants. It is parti - cularly to be desired on lawns because of the luxuriant color It pro - duces. However, it increases the necessity for both clipping and ( water. If water supply is limited nitrogen should be used on lawns very sparingly, and then blood meal or some other organic ainmoniate of slow availability should be chosen. Phosphorus also promotes vegetative growth but not in the same way as nitrogen. It adds to succulence through stimulation of new leaf tissue and makes plants luxuriant, but it does not lead to intense </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE greenness as does nitrogen. It hastens maturity rather than to delay It. It does not make plants "grow to tops" but increases blossoming and seed, or , fruit-set. It stimulates root development, stoollng and tillering. In excess it does not lead • to lodging and sterility. In great excess it only causes burning like any salt that is used heavily. Phosphorus may be used on any plant without detriment even though it may not do good, whereas of nitrogen it is easy to get too much. A cufflclency of phosphorus Is particularly desirable on lawns because it induces stoollng and root development and thereby makes a more substantial turf and reduces the need for frequent watering. Its effect on lawns Is rarely striking as In the case of nitrogen. The latter will turn any pale green lawn to a dark green within 4 or 5 days. The effect of phosphorus is accumulative and only to be seen at Its best after several years. A sufficiency of phosphorus Is also desirable in the case of shrub - bery, flowers, bulbs, etc., for the _ame reasons. Potash deficiency in plants has peculiar symptomology. Leaves develop unique chorophyl deficiencies such as yellow stripes, veins, or borders. Plants develop stalk weakness and break over. Starch does not translocate properly and tubers and ear suffer In the case of potatoes and sweet corn. Susceptibility to diseases is a common characteristic also. Soil requirements are highly variable, and particularly so in towns and cities where relatively much of the soil comes from excavation and filling. There are some sections of Nebraska where practically the entire deficiency is phosphorus and iron. The cities of Lexington, North Platte, Bridgeport, Gering, Kimball, McCook and Chadron are illustrations. The reason for this deficiency is connected with the high lime content of the soil. On such soils a phosphate fertilizer is always advisable above every other. Ammonium sulfate, or nitrate have some virtue in that they tend slightly to make Iron available in addition to furnishing nitrogen, but sodium or calcium nitrates should not be used because they aggravate both phosphorus and iron deficiencies. Ammonium phosphate has the virtues of a nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer combined. Iron sulfate Is to be recommended in addition to phosphate 1 ) on all such deficient soils. ') E. B. Engle. "Some causes and control methods for yellows in plants." On non-calcareous soils, phosphorus is secondary in importance. It is nitrogen that is the primary ingredient to be considered. Generally speaking allimade soils, that is, raw subsoil from excavation or exposure by levelling, should be regarded as requiring nitrogen </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY reinforcement. If they require structual Improvement no chemical fertilizer will take the place of manure or compost. If their structure Is not bad, full dependence can be put In commercial nitrogen. Phos - phorus should not be neglected when one has opportunity to in - corporate it with the soil at the outset. At that time bone meal in quantity for years to come should be used, and thereafter only nitro - gen. If this opportunity be passed a mixed fertilizer containing nitro - gen as primary ingredient and phosphorus as secondary should be consistently used. The phosphorus may not do any good but it is relatively inexpensive and perfectly safe. The writer has yet to discover the first case of unquestionable potash deficiency in the State of Nebraska. The strongest possibili - ties are at Grand Island and vicinity. In all other localities, potash in a fertilizer formula for gardens, lawns and flowers Is probably to be entirely disregarded. Whether or not to use the basic fertilizer materials listed above, or to purchase one of the several brands of mixed fertilizer licensed for sale in Nebraska is, as the writer sees it, generally much more a matter of convenience in purchase and use, than of specific function and price. Any of them are relatively inexpensive to the ordinary householder with a small lawn or garden. A price range of 2 to 10 cents per 100 square feet is a small Item as against the time one may need to spend crushing lumps or transferring to a new container if the bag rots, or even shopping around for exactly what one wants when he wants it. Mixed fertilizers as compared with ammonium sulfate or sodium nitrate are much superior In the durability of their Physical quality on storage, hence can be bought In larger quantities and held over for several seasons. However, be that as It may, the main point to consider is to what extent one brand will substitute for another. For example let us compare the five formulas (1) 20-0-0 (2) 0-20-0 (3) 4-12-4 (4) 8-5-3 (5) 5-8-3 No 1 is in no sense substitutes for No. 2, and vice versa. When nitrogen is the element desired, it would be folly to buy No. 2 regard - less of the fact that it may cost only half as much per pound. No. 3 is in not an exact substitute for No. 4 regardless of the fact that they both contain 16 units of plant food. If nitrogen is desired, No. 4 is the preferable. No.'s 4 and 5 are formulas of two brands made by the same company and often sold by the same dealer </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACR'ICULTURE j at relative prices of about 7 to 5. No. 5 is highest in potash but in Nebraska that is immaterial. It is also more than twice as high In phosphoric acid. But that is secondary. Then the Important thing to note Is that the No. 4 Is twice as high in nitrogen and costs only 2-5 more. Most important, however, is the fact that it will take just twice as much of No. 5 to givel the nitrogen results of No. 4 or 2.4 times as much of No. 4 to give the phosphorus results of No. 5, and it is results you want. AMOUNT OF FERTILIZER TO USE Hew much fertilizer to use is something to be learned by experi - ence. One can use too much and have disaster, or too little and get no satisfactory response. Regardless of formula or brand, it is not out of reason to apply on the acre basis, 20 to 40 pounds of nitro - gen, 20 to 120 pounds of phosphoric acid and 25 to 100 pounds of potash. To go beyond these amounts means to court over stimula - tion effects with nitrogen or burning effects with phosphoric acid and potash and to use less than the minimum indicated results ordi - narily in insufficient returns to repay for the trouble of using them. 1 On the basis of more common measurements for lawns and gardens ' the above quantities are approximately as follows: Per 100 Per acre Per square rod square in pounds in ounces feet in ounces Nitrogen (N) 20-10 2-4 0.75-1.5 Nitrogen as ammonia (NH ;t ) 25-50 2.5-5 0.9-1,8 Phosphoric acid (P_0 8 ) 20-120 2-12 0.75-4.5 Potash (K a O) 25-100 2.5-10 0.9-3.6 The following shows for several different formulas the approxi - mate amounts, as computed from the above, that may be applied per square rod or per 100 square feet.

Not excessive as regards potash. The above rates are reasonable for green house benches as well as for out of doors. For plants in pots, one may compute fertilizer requirements on either of two bases (1) the area of the pot as a fraction of a square rod, (2) the weight of the contents of the pot as a fraction of the weight. of surface soil in one square rod, figured as 10,000 pounds. The latter is the simplest method. For example, suppose the contents of the pot weight 5 pounds, then one should use of the quantities shown In the table above "under ounces per square rod" just 1-2000 as much. If the fertilizer were 4-12-4, the computed amount would be 11 to 2 2 avoirdupois grains, or 0.7 to 1.4 grams. Obviously there is danger with chemical fertilizers on potted plants of using too much. The elimination of this danger is the real merit of a form of fertilizer sold as plant food tablets in which the proper quantity per pot is predetermined. It is better yet, however, for potted plants, to use such fertilizers as blood, and bone meal, and rich com - post in which, because of their lower availability, there is less hazard. FERTILIZERS FOR SUPPLYING HUMUS The outstanding shortcoming of chemical fertilizers, for flowers especially, is that they do not contribute humus or organic matter to the soil. There are on the market several materials classed with the commercial fertilizers that do contribute humus. Pulverized dried sheep manure; sewage sludge, and peat moss are illustrations. From the standpoint of available nitrogen and phosphorus any of these is very inferior to basic or mixed fertilizers, and highly expensive con - sidering that they should be used at the rate of 20 to 100 pounds per 100 setuare feet. However, from the standpoint of organic matter as compared with such manure as sometimes can only be had, con - sidering that they are dry and free of weeds, they are not expensive. Sewage sludge, aside from its freedom from weed seed, is of about the same total value as farm manure. Pulverized sheep manure, be - cause of the artificial drying process to which it has been submitted, .hould be valued more highly. HOME MADE COMPOST Probably the best source of humus is home made compost. Grass clippings, garden debris, even non-greasy garbage (including bones) and a minor amount of hedge trimmings can be converted into good compost by simply accumulating them in a trim, flat-topped pile covered with a sprinkling of earth after each fresh addition and wetted </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE down occasionally. The quality will be improved and decay ac - celerated if several handfuls of air slacked lime, blood meal, and bone meal are added previous to the sprinkling of the soil. If the soil used is calcareous, the lime will not be necessary. A nationally ad - vertised mixture obviates all three, but does not particularly reduce the expense or Improve the compost. Methods Of Applying Fertilizers Chemical fertilizers are not hard or particularly unsafe to apply, but these should not be used carelessly. On lawns they may be sown broadcast by hand on a calm day, or with a fertilizer sower. Prefer - ably they should be applied Immediately before a rain, or in the afternoon and watered so as to wash them off the grass. Prolonged contact with the leaves has a temporary burning effect. In the case of shrubbery and flowers, they should be strewn by hand under the branches at no heavier rate than on lawns. A few plants, such as plantain lilies and others of a similar leaf structure are burned quite easily and do not recover throughout the season. In gardens, ferti - lizers may be applied In the row or hill after the same is opened, and lightly worked into the soil before seed Is planted. An exception is beans which are very sensitive, and which should only be fertilized after the plants are well through the ground. Transplants should not be fertilized until they are well rooted. This applies to flowers, shrubs, and trees, as well as to garden plants. As a rule, shrubs and trees should not be fertilized at all with chemicals the first season. Nitrogen should be generally withheld from shrubbery and trees after mid-fall lest it stimulate sap wood growth and aggrevate its susceptibility to frost injury. Aside from this exception fertilizers may be applied at any time and as often as they seem to be needed. For iawns, early spring and early fall applications are the most suc - cessful. The use of chemical fertilizers in Nebraska is bound to increase. Doubtlessly as they are more widely used specific advantages and dis - advantages not stressed herein will come to light. Very little is known as far as the writer is aware about the specific effects of various fertilizers on floral colors, odors, wilting properitles, profuseness of bloom, etc. It should be an absorbing field for Individual observation, and tvery floriculturist and gardener, amateur or professional, has an equal chance.

            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY cept that the more nitrates there are present the more sugar is pro - duced, and the more likely the plant is to be affected by mildew. Question : What particular chemical fertilizer Is good In the Cass county black soil and limestone localities? Answer: What I have said In general here about considering nitrogen as a basic fertilizer and phosphorous as the second applies there also. Just take the general statements I have made and apply them. JOE GREEN: Regarding your last statement about the effect ot fertilizers on color. We notice such effects more on roses than on other flowers. Certain fertilizers will give them a deep color. I use the correct commercial fertilizer and put it on 3 times as strong as directed. Question: What does the soil around Lincoln need most? Answer: Nitrogen first, phosphorous second and of course I be - lieve at least every garden should have compost. Put your fertilizer into compost with blood meal and bone meal which Improves the quality. Aside from that, I use In my own garden a commercial fertilizer, Sacco, and Weedo. I prefer Weedo No. 4. I have nothing against Vigoro or Sacco and I use much Weedo. Question: There is a tendency of the soil to bake. Would lime help that? Answer: Not very much. The best thing in the world Is a hoe and a little elbow grease. Fall plowing, spring plowing, cultivating. A neighbor merely plowed his ground In the spring and the ground baked just as hard as a rock. Tried to cultivate and it came up In large clods. Our ground is always nice and loose. We had moist dirt in even the hottest driest weather last year. Everything on his ground burned up. Our soil here in Lincoln has a tendency to run together after It has lost Its humus. It should have plenty of compost — there Is no chemical fertilizer equal to it. They use barnyard manure abundantly on the campus and they do not have very much trouble with the soil baking that I know about. Question: When is the best time to apply manure? Answer: I like to put it on as a top dressing and let it stay on for several months. These early spring rains wash the solubles out and disintegrate it. Question: On the farm would we be improving the nitrogen content in flower gardens if we had fresh alfalfa soil? </seg>
            <seg id="p406">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Answer: It would be a fairly good thing but I would rather have sod If I were on a farm where I could get it. I would prefer to have good grass sod. Pile it In a pile and let it decay one season; then use it for compost. You have a soil stock that you would not have at all from alfalfa. Have a layer of sod, a layer of barnyard manure, another layer of sod and at the end of the following season you have the finest kind of dirt for your flowers. I am suggesting this as a sub - stitute for alfalfa sod. It may not be necessary to go to that extreme. Use plenty of well rotted manure and it would not be necessary. MR. SHUBERT: I am quite sure we have all enjoyed this talk from Dr. Russell. 1 am glad to know that such talks as these will come out in the annual report and we will all be looking forward. I am sure,, to the time when we can get one of these reports. Now we have the next speaker who will tell us about some of the. uses of ornamental tress. Or. David C. Hilton. SOME ORNAMENTAL USES OF COMMON TREES DR. DAVID C. HILTON. Lincoln Introductory Trees are of economic or utilitarian, and of artistic or ornamental value to man. Sometimes those values blend, as, for instance, in shade, which is both a utilitarian and an ornamental quality of trees, t My topic dwells on the artistic appeals and ornamental u&lt;es of some common trees. Of these uses the one to which I shall particu - larly .call your attention is that of trees planted on avenues. I shall attempt to stimulate an enthusiasm for the proper use of avenue trees by orienting your minds as to the why and wherefore of avenue plantings, and by whetting within you the acumen for appreciation of the artistic effects that avenue trees challenge us to see and to feel. To discourse on the ornamental uses of trees, is to (leal, with a phase of the manifold soul-stirring appeal of art. In its consider - ation I shall draw on the principles of pictorial art, of sculpture, of i architecture, and of music. A keen discernment of the ornamental value of trees Is fed from several resources of artistic expression. I shall try to raise your appreciation of the ornamental in avenue trees from the low level of the merely pretty, to the higher level of the in - tegrated beautiful, and perchance to the highest level of the trans - cendent sublime. I shall develop my topic by boldly throwing the details concern - ing some ornamental uses of common trees into the fore-ground of a picture in which the background is a blend of pertinent principles and ideals of art. The background comes first. I- </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Principles of Art as Applied to Ornamental Trees Generally speaking, ideals in art are three: pictorialness, beauty, and sublimity. The pictorial ideal is evidenced by the composition of the picture, or the arrangement of objects contributing to unity and interest. Beauty is expressed objectively by delineation in the pic - ture: and subjectively, by its poetic appeal to the imagination of the viewer. Sublimity is experienced if the picture evokes a group of responses in the .viewer that are superlative and force a reaction that transcends the mere artistic ideal. Interest in trees and their environs is, as in pictures, humanistic and naturalistic. "There is a beauty in the forms and colors and lights of nature aside from man and his doing." Nevertheless "what we seek for in every great picture is combined with the human element." "The facts of nature to posses' a serious interest for us upon canvas, require- to be heated with poetic fire, transfused and newly wrought in the crucible of the painter's mind."* The humanistic in art has been further expressed as "Nature seen through the prism of an emotion."** From the creative standpoint, trees and their environment merge into a material paradise of loveliness, like an architectural creation, and principles of architecture apply; that is to say, planning, con - struction, composition, and decoration. Planning is the foundation of de.-ign in plantings as well as in edifices. Planning for trees must, however, look forward to progressive changes In design Incident to growth during the natural life of the trees. Design in plantings may be the fruition of natural selection and survival, or an expression of human planning. Construction is the means of realization for archi - tecture and it has its counterpart in nurture for arboriculture. Com - ppstion is displayed by the lines and masses of visible aspect. In architecture it applies to dead materials that develop mass, propor - tion, and symmetry by accretion, ahd in trees to living organisms that grow into these everchanging qualities of visible aspect by intussus - ception. Decoration is architecture's pleasing details, mostly wrought by tools qf iron, whereas pleasing details inhere by nature in trees and may he more or less Influenced for the better or worse by culture and pruning. The artistic appeal of trees is not exhausted by the eye; it reaches the ear. We must draw on the principles and modalities of music to appreciate it. The "susurrus" is the characteristic song of trees, the term being specifically applied to the whispering In the pine tops. In general the song of trees is most like the chant, the ancient style •John C. Van Dyke. * 'Alfred Stevens. </seg>
            <seg id="p408">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ui unurch song inherited from the Hebrews. The song of trees is a melodic progression resembling choral singing in unison. It is char - acterized by stateliness and dignity, from gentle whisperings to the deafening roar of tne tempestuous forest. Modality and theme in the song of trees invite investigation by the music-minded. Rich rewards have come from research In the song of birds; why not in some measure from an investigation of wood-wind? The ornamental character of trees is disclosed in a synthesis of their aesthetic values. Trees interest us as specimens and as groups, and in the ornamental uses to which specimens and groups are adapted.' That is to say, we are forced to appreciate trees, individ - uality and tree adaptation to environment. Trees as specimens and as groups present ornamental features, such as the bole; the branches and the branching habit; the foliage, the flowers, and the fruit. The bole contributes stability, mass, tex - ture, and color. The bole is concealed characteristically in specimen conifers, which should not be trimmed. It Is partially concealed in deciduous tjrees of the pyramidal and cylindrical types. It stands well revealed in the canopy type; in all forest formations; and In almost all deciduous trees over thirty feet high, by the process of natural prublng or by artificial treatment. It contributes stability by being the lone pillar and support of the tree and its bond to earth. It contributes mass by ponderousness and resistance. It contributes texture aiid color by the feel and appearance of the bark. The branches and the branching habit contribute mass, proportion, .symmetry, color, rhythm, susurrus, texture, and grace; proportion by extension in space and sweep of line; symmetry, by proportionate ex - tension and distribution of mass with respect to a center or axis, which is usually an Imaginary line in extension of the bole; rhythm and susurrus, by responsive movement and voice to the wind; tex - ture by the sense of depth over extended surfaces to which the qual - ity of branches and the branching habit give character; and grace to the extent that they produce an artistic and spiritual influence in the observer that transcends the ideal of a mere tree. The foliage and flowers and fruit contribute mass, rhythm, susur - rus, texture, color, vivacity, and grace; a susurrus of leaf which differs from that ot branch; and vivacity by a wholly different rhythm in leaf from that In branch, the latter having resemblances to the march and waltz, the former to the movements of rollcking children. Avenue Trees In the foreground of my topic I present the most striking details of the artistry of avenue trees. 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY There are three principal types of avenue trees; the cylindrical or spindle, the pyramidal or cone, and the canopy or umbrella. The first is illustrated by the volga poplar; the second by [the pin-oak among deciduous trees, and among conifers by the spruce; and the third by the American elm. The ornamental uses of trees are embellishment, ' shade, and screening. Avenue trees embellish the avenue by ornamental train - ing; and the roadside perspective by ornamental framing and pro - gressive banking. Ornamental framing is inclosure, by adjacent trees, of the scenic perspective between them. Ground clearance of branches and foliage to a sufficient height adds to the breadth of interval clearance and of the view. Progressive banking is obtained by massing shrubs and trees in gradation of height, from a low fore - ground, to a higher background, so as to spread out before the eye an arboreal incline or embankment. Embellishment will be discussed at length, under roadside benefits. Shade on the avenue is furnished most abundantly by the canopy type trees, less by the deciduous pyrami - dal type, and least by the coniferous pyramldals and by the cylindrical type. Shade is a utility in most places, and Is ever ornamental In con - tributing atmosphere, shadow, and shadow dance. Screening is seldom desired on the avenue. It is both utilitarian and ornamental. When needed it is best effected by cylindrical types and next best by pyramidal types, particularly by shade-tolerant, erect, conifers. We should view the avenue with its trees and its surroundings as a kaleidoscope made up of numerous views or scenes, each ot Which is picturesque; and should keep in mind that we are looking from positions on the avenue. An attempt to evaluate the ornamental benefits of avenue trees, whether for creative purposes, or with appreciative intent, must take into consideration the trees, the avenue, and the roadside perspec - tive. The avenue benefits derived from an avenue planting are primarily embellishment of the avenue itself by ornamental fram - ing: and secondarily, shade. Ornamental framing ot the avenue itself is displayed by a succession of unobstructed views down the avenue flanked or framed on either side by .trees which may, if of the large canopy type, furnish an encompassment on either side by massive holes in rank.4. and above by a graceful canopy bathing the avenue in grateful shade. The roadside benefits from avenue trees pertain to buildings with their yards, and to open country, such as parks, meadows, fields, and waste places along the avenue. These benefits are effected by orna - mental framing and sometimes by progressive banking. Small residences near the avenue should be; visible between con - secutive avenue trees. | Two adjacent trees should frame a residence </seg>
            <seg id="p410">REPORT OF NEBRASKA -STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and give a view of the house In the interval. Residences far back from an avenue should be {framed so as to show the house and Its Immediate environs, i. e., the homestead. Large buildings should be so framed by avenue trees j as to display a full frontal view of the entrance. Structures of sufficient height and offwardness from the avenue are susceptible of progressive banking by coordinating the avenue planting and the yard trees. By this means, a low street planting combined with higher yard planting carries the eye without effort to the cornice and roof or, perchance, to the outcropping spire, dome or shaft, and is distinctly artistic. Progressive banking may be used in conjunction with ornamental framing of the entrance to the build - ing, or singly. Open country by the side of the road receives picturesque treat - ment by avenue trees through ornamental framing in two ways. Between adjacent trees there is inclosed a succession of broad, un - obstructed views. Sometimes a vista effect is possible with a glimpse of open country or an interesting landmark straight down the avenue and beyond, between the flanking lines. All kinds of embellishment by avenue trees, whether of the avenue itself or of the roadside perspective, and whether by orna - mental framing or by progressive banking, are covered by the in - clusive and descriptive phrase: artistry of accompaniment. This phrase places an avenue planting in its true relationship to the ave - nue and to the roadside. An avenue planting, although beautiful in itself, is not for its own sake. It should take no glory to itself, for it is subservient by nature and the rules of art to the greater glory of more intimate objects of human interest. The maximum that can be required of an avenue planting is the artistry of ac - companiment. The most that it can give is the beaut if icatiou of the avenue and of the roadside, to both of which it is ancillary. Ornamental framing beckons by trees aligned on either side of the avenue to the centers of human interest; as, for instance, to a building or a home and especially to its approaches and openings, the path, the porches, the portal, and windows. The portal speaks for the presence of the host and stands for hospitality. The windows are the eyes of the edifice and speaks for light, life and understanding. Through the portal we are led under the roof-tree by the light, to the heart of the edifice — the hearth. By ornamental framing the abode of man as host, friend, and counsellor is subjectively glorified, and its sensory organs — the openings- — -are objectively beautified. The highest achievement of the artistry of accompaniment producible by an avenue planting is so to combine the naturalistic and the humanistic expression of scenic or pictorial beauty that the sublime in art is attained. Homes by the roadside call for our best en - deavors In avenue plantings. Progressive banking carries the eye without effort on an ascend- </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ing bower upward to a triumphant architectural feature of the edi - fice, which tells Its human interest story. The canopy type of avenue trees includes many common ones native to the United States: elm, maple, sycamore, hackberry, cotton - wood, locust, and so on. It most quickly gives the greatest ground clearance and takes a trim of two-thirds its height. It possesses the highest and broadest overhang or spread and provides the best shade. It is particularly adapted to city planting In residence dis - tricts for framing effects, if trimmed high and a leader maintained to develop more height. Unfortunately, its mission is only partially accomplished for lack of correct theory and practice in planting and pruning. The pyramidal type gives the least ground clearance, which how - ever, can be made ample for an unobstructed view under the trees after they are thirty-five feet high. Its branches and foliage tend to encroach on interval clearance more than other types do. This type includes both deciduous trees and tall growing conifers. They must be discussed separately. The deciduous pyramidal includes many hard woods: oaks, hard maples. linden, and so on. It takes a trim of one-third its height, and slowly developes a broad overhang after reaching a height of thirty feet or more. Since the deciduous pyramidal is broad at the base, ornamental framing is facilitated by planting the trees relatively farther apart than those of the hlghbraiiched canopy type, in order to provide sufficient clearance of the interval between trees on the | avenue. It tends to uniformity and contributes neatness. The coniferous pyramidal, including most of our tall growing evergreens', should not be trimmed and ground clearance can not properly be expected until It is very old. Ornamental framing should be sought entirely by interval clearance. For perfection In* uni - formity, delicacy, and winter cheer it Is unsurpassed. The pyramidal type is not adapted for indiscriminate use ill resi - dence and business districts and demands most tree-sense for best results. It should be used selectively on streets, where the roadside perspective invites its ornamental possibilities from the first. It is most readily used on avenues through open country. Ornamental framing effects with it are slowly acquired. Broad interval clear - ance satisfies that requirement in parks and open country of most localities in the United States, if trees of this type are planted fifty feet or more apart in the row. The cylindrical type, represented commonly by varieties of close - branched poplars, develops scarcely any overhang and little shade. It may take a trim to one-third its height, and is most beautiful un - trimmed. j It is splendid for uniformity and statellness. It Is Ideal for avenues on which tall buildings abut in continuity. If shade is not a desideratum. When planted in palisade formation, it is an ideal screen. </seg>
            <seg id="p412">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AFTERNOON SESSION JANUARY 2, 1934 Agricultural Hall 1:30 P. M. PRES. J. F. SHUBERT: This afternoon we are to be favored with some talks that I know will hold your interest. I know the program aroused mine when I first saw it. Our curiosity is aroused by the mysterious. Certainly this first talk sounds mysterious. It is a pleasure to introduce Dr. Weaver of the Botany Department of the University here at Lincoln. How Cutting The Tops Affects The Roots Of Grasses. t)R. J. E. WEAVER, Lincoln. It is always a pleasure to talk about something In which one is interested. For a number of years I have been interested in what is going on under ground with regard to the roots of plants. I have had two or three students who have done some work along this line. I will try to explain to you what we have found out so far. I think you will find it of considerable interest. At least, it is of interest to me. I have jotted down some notes, so I will not keep you too long. You know a professor always has to bring his notes along or else people might not know he is a professor. There is no other way of finding that out. We are sure that It is necessary to maintain the proper balance between the top of the plant and the part underground. If either the top or root system becomes too large in proportion to the other half, or too small, we know the plant will not thrive. As far as grasses are concerned we know they develop a better root system when they are undisturbed, are mowed infrequently, than when they are grazed closely and mowed or grazed often. We must remember just one thing and that Is — food for the whole plant is made in the plant and it is made up-stairs in the plant — made in the green part. Sometimes we say rather loosely, "a plant gets Its food from the ground or the air" but of course you and I know it does no such thing. It gets from the air what it needs to make food in the foodmaking parts of the leaf. Anything that disturbs the top or removes the top is going to affect the growth of the plant. This is true of all green plants, whether grasses or shrubs or trees. It is a uniform rule so far as I know. Another thing I want to call your attention to is the need of plant foods to get down into the root system in order that the plant may grow. I will show you by means of slides how the roots develope and how various treatments of the top affect the growth of the roots. </seg>
            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY This first slide shows a young seedling just after It has begun to develop. Notice how much greater the root development Is at this stage than ite at the top. This plant is 16 days old, the roots having reached a depth of 6 inches and the top has just barely started. I My next slide shows a grass plant after it has grown Unmolested for a whole season. The roots have gone down almost three feet. This fact may surprise some of you. I know that people generally have the notion that grass roots only extend down 6 or 8 inches but that is certainly not the case in the open prairie where root and top growth go on unmolested. The grass roots, particularly in a dry season, go down three to four feet in search of moisture with which to supply the top if the top is left uncut or ungrazed. [Here are some, other grasses, native to the Nebraska prairies. You will note that here, too, the root system is much larger than the top. In fact that is almost universally the case where plants must develop without Irrigation. Just how irrigation effects the development of the root system I can't say at present. Our studies have not extended that far as yet; but I am quite sure that where moisture is supplied copiously throughout the season the root system is probably not as large as It would be If there happened to be a dearth of moisture. Next I will show you a young honey locust seedling. Here again the: business part of the plant Is largely underground. The good builder always sees to it that the foundation is well built and strong entlugh to hold the superstructure. Evidently the honey locust is a good builder for it's foundation looks capable of holding up a much larger top growth. j My next slide shows a series ot sunflower plants all started at the satjie time. The difference in their growth is due to different amounts of [water given. This little fellow only had about U as much as It's neighbor on the right. The next one has 4 times as much and this one on the extreme right 8 times as much. Now notice the root development of the different plants. Notice how much larger are thaj roots of the two middle plants and then the one on the right evidently had more water than it could use. These plants illustrate once more the point that a good superstructure depends upon a good foundation. You can't have a good root system without good tops and vice versa. The two go hand in hand. This slide shows another Important step in the development of the rodt system. When the seed germinates it sends down these strong central roots usually one to a plant. Then the top begins to grow and then the secondary roots develop. This is true of wheat, blue grriss and many other plants. Some plants like the black walnut, have only a tap root and the smaller roots branch out from this main root instead of from the base of the crown. </seg>
            <seg id="p414">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE xiere Is a slide which shows the area of the root system in square centimeters at different dates following seeding and also a graph showing the growth of the top. Not that the root system is always from 15 to 30 per cent ahead of the top. In other words the root system develops first and the top correspondingly. Then as food is made by the top it is transported back to the roots there to be used in producing more roots and this in turn brings in more moisture and of course raw foods from the soil and these materials are trans - ported to the top to be manufactured. You can easily see the paral - , lellsm between roots and tops. Now let us see how clipping disturbs this parellelism between tops and roots. We tried in our experiments to find out how the clipping reacted on the plants and we used wheat, sudan grass and blue grass. Since you are Interested primarily in blue grass we will confine our discussion mainly to this part of the experiment. After the blue grass plants had reached the 4 leaf stage (the grass leaves were about 3 &gt; _ inches long) the leaves were clipped off as the inexperienced man would treat a lawn. Nineteen days later the weight and volume of the roots from these plants were compared with similar plants which had not been clipped. We found that the Jjoots from the ntnclipped plants were 4 times as heavy and had T times the volume of the clipped plants; after two clippings the un - dipped plants had 11 times the weight and if, times the volume of roots of the clipped plants. We placed some of the plants in glass boxes so we could watch the development of the roots while the plants were growing. We found that after two clippings of the tops there was virtually no further root development.— evidently there was too little elaborated food sent down to the roots to induce additional growth. Further - more the plants that were regularly clipped failed to form tillers or stools. The practical application here is that if you want to have your lawn thicken up don't clip it. Clipping retards root develop - ment and also the formation of tillers or secondary top shoots. In another experiment we went into the field and secured blocks •of sod. We placed it in large tin cans in good soil. We gave them I plenty of water and good soil to induce a good growth if possible One set was clipped every two weeks and the other went undipped. In late summer we examined the length and volume of roots The undipped set had roots 4 or 5 feet in length, the clipped ones only about 2 feet and the volume of the latter was only 20% as great as those whose tops were not clipped. Now by way of a summary let me state that clipping or close grazing has some very marked effects on the development of the roots. The root system is small, the top growth and tiller growth is interfered with. Some of our valuable native species are fast dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY appearing because of close grazing. Drouth resistance is less and winter-killing greater where there Is excessive grazing or clipping. Each spring the lawn must replace a part of It's root system because a lot of it dies during the winter. In New Jersey the loss is greater than here but even here the roots must be replaced that have died during the winter. If you want a good strong lawn use a nitrogenous fertilizer like Ammonium sulfate or sodium nitrate early in the spring. Dr. Russell has mentioned the methods and amounts to apply. Then spare the lawn mower and save the lawn. t PRESIDENT SHUBERT: My friends, I think that Dr. Weaver has convinced the men that lawns should not be mowed very often.

Lei me ask you a few questions for you to ponder over, not to answer here. I ..'■•,. . ■ 1. What are you doing to preserve for all time the natural, scenic - beauty of your state? 2. Do you have a well developed state park plan? Are your great river beds and valleys controlled and used for recreation? 3. Are you conserving the rich soil of the state from unnecessary erosion? 4. Have you a well-defined land-utilization program in which i forests, parks, and parkways'" take their rightful places along with agricultural production? .&gt;. And lastly, have you a long time highway improvement pro - gram, which makes available and usable by the people of this state </seg>
            <seg id="p416">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and others, the natural scenic and recreational resources just men - tioned? We are in the greatest planning period of the nation's history. Why do you suppose Iowa had 17 CCC camps during the first six months' period and 22 the present, or second? It was because Iowa has for several years had a well defined state park and recre - ational program. This program was made articulate through the re - cently published 25 year conservation plan. In planning for the fu - ture recreation, all kinds become more and more Important with In - | creased leisure, and by the way, perhaps It Is legitimate here to men - tion that this leisure may do something else for us. It may allow us to stop this fast-moving, hard-drinking phase of our existence and allow us to enjoy leisure In such harmless activities as picnicking and just loafing. A town in Connecticut, I believe, retained Its post office simply because a well known writer said it was the only place where the men could loaf. These loafing places of our youth In the future will not be the saloons, the wayside hot dog stands, and the pool halls and speakeasys of today, but attractive, neat, healthful, recre - ational centers, small parks and parkways scattered and spread over the whole country-side in accordance with a well developed state high - way and recreation plan. It Is good business too. Why has Switzerland been so prosperous? Because she realized the business assets she had in her scenery and planned for its con - servative use. Perhaps the most encouraging indication in this direction in recent years is the recognition by State Highway Officials, Engineers, and Landscape Architects throughout the country of the importance and value of landscape planning and improvements. The, President of the American Association, of State Highway of - ficials in an address before the 1930 annual meeting in Pittsburgh said: "For generations we have been cautioned by 'penny-wise' philoso - phers that 'business and pleasure do not mix.' Like every other maxim of Its kind, this one is demonstrating its error day by day. Today, pleasure is one of the largest business producers in the known world. - i "The beautillcation of our highways will be the greatest single factor to stimulate travel for pleasure since the organization of the Improved highway. For every mile fittingly beautified, we can show a definite increase in the use of the motor car for the pleasure of motoring, with a consequent increase in business in general, and an added appreciation by the user of the fine work of the builder. "But aside ifrom these strictly material considerations, it would </seg>
            <seg id="p417">417 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY certainly not be out of place to observe that good craftsmanship de - serves its appropriate background. The modern high speed Improved grade, permanent type of pavement, such as is now being constructed, represents the last word in the highway builders craft. . It is as thor - oughly deserving of a beautiful setting as is any precious stone of the finest water, cut to perfection by a master hand."' Director Horace Albright of the National Park Service comments on these problems In his 1931 report as follows: "Tin- advantages of landscape-planned roads are now apparent to all. Roads, both in alignment and section, now more nearly harmon - ize with the topography than in the days when they were strictly engineer-planned. Besides Improving the appearance, the rounding and flattening of slopes treatment has lowered the cost of road main - tenance. "The Landscape Architectural Division supervises all work affect - ing the park landscape such as location of roads and type and loca - tion of bridges, buildings, and other structures. This work cannot be accomplished by a casual inspection, and one of the needs of the near future is a landscape architect for each park throughout the entire construction season." Lei us see what Mr. T. H. MacDonald, Chief of the U. S. Bureau ol' Public Roads says about highway planning. "Font- major movements are needed ! to beautify and enhance the usefulness of the highways. They are: "First, the complete elimination of commercial advertising signs, not only those within the rights of way but those on private property along the rights of way; "Second, the removal of oil filling stations, 'hot dog" and lunch stands and roadside markets that encroach upon the rights of way and regulation of the distance from rights of way, and regulation of the distance from rights of jway at which such establishments may be located on private property; "Third, the planting of trees and shrubs along the roadsides; and "Fourth, the location, design and construction of the highways (ii such manner as to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside." The fourth item mentioned by Mr. MacDonald whenever possible should be accomplished before the resources of the region are destroyed or blighted. A similar analysis has been .made by Mr. George B. Ford for Mrs. John D. Rockefeller when in discussing the subject from various angles </seg>
            <seg id="p418">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE t iie suggests: (1) Control of advertising: (2) Control of filling sta - tions and all roadside business, debris, and poles; (3) Planting of roadsides and abutting property with indigenous material; and ( -I ) Proper location, design, and construction of highway to preserve and 1 enhance natural beauty and to segregate traffic. Too often our roadside improvement work in the past has been shortsighted and superficial. Let it he dearly understood just what we are aiming at. Note what the President Hoover's Conference on Landscape Plan - ning has to say on this question. "A highway is either a work of an or merely a surface upon which to drive. The usual requirements of maximum gradient, minimum curvature, vision clearance over hilltops, and 'banking' or super - elevation on curves may be met adequately, but the result may he most unpleasant to the eye. Beauty of curvature in plan, the first requisite of good design, seldom is properly studied. Also the grade or profile must be carefully coordinated with the plan so as to produce pleasing lines when seen foreshortened in perspective. This is really the point of view from which a highway is seen by those who use it. These requirements of design are recognized by a land - scape designer when planning a park road or the streets of a residential district. If it is worth, while to give attention to the more or less super - ficial ornamentation of roadsides by planting, it is also important, to design the basic lines and gradients of such roads with duo conslder - iftion for the beauty of the result, and to call into the solution of tin - problem men properly trained in. that field. Such added beauty can be produced by careful planning, in most cases with no additional ex - pense and In some instances with an actual'saving in the cost of con - struction. "The possibilities for beautiful highways, expressive' of the beauty of our native land, are so great that, if once started by minds of vision and great imagination, they will result in a forceful influence on the whole development of landscape planning and planting in our country." '-., Also the Joint Committee of the American Association of State Highway Officials and the National Research Council stated the ob - jectives of Roadside Development as follows at their meeting in Mil - waukee, Wisconsin, October 11, 1933; "Roadside Development should conserve, enhance and effectively display the natural beauty of the countryside through which the high - way passes, as well as provide maximum safety, utility, economy, and recreational facilities to the public by means of proper location, de- </seg>

Are you planning on a generous use of federal funds for this purpose as urged by Mr. MacDonald? After January 1 (yesterday) the Public Works Admin - istration stipulates that "all loans or grants made after January 1, 1934, to finance projects for the construction, repair or improvement of public highways shall contain such provisions as are necessary, viz.: "1. Such trees and shrubs be planted along the borders of the highway and maintained as will in the course of time bring about screening of the highway to the extent planting and screening are feasible. The chief of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, Department of Agriculture, shall determine the scope and apply the means of effectuating this provision. "2. So far as practicable and feasible, as determined by said Chief, width of such highways shall not be less than 150 feet and foot paths to be provided for." Have adequate plans and provisions been made? Have you a trained Landscape Engineer to direct the work or are you still depend - ing on the antiquated hit and miss posey planting, spring clean-up policy of the 19th century?. Roadside Improvement is a major statewide problem deserving official slate support. Eighteen states have Landscape Architecture departments carrying on the work from year to year. It is here to stay. The t raveling American public won't longer stand for the nause - ating vulgarity of the roadside business riff-raff and auto graveyards. The Westchester County Parkway type is not less than 200 feet wide, and in most places much wider. This leaves, as Mr. Jay Downer, Chief Engineer, says: "Not foothold lor blatant billboards, and the panoramic hodge-podge of hot-dog dispensaries, barbecues, and so-called refresh - ment stands that unfold in offensive, jazzy patterns along countless miles of our American highways . . . The old roads may have been hub - deep in spring mud, which became a layer of dust under the summer sun. hut they were flanked by the characteristic scenery of the countryside, unspoiled by the nauseating vulgarity of structural riff - raff and automobile graveyards that are all too familiar in the modern scene." If yon have it state organization for the purpose such as a State Council with representatives from all Important state organizations, such as Farm Bureau. Women and Garden Clubs, Nurserymen's Asso - ciation, etc., it might be of great help in voicing the will and wishes of the people of Nebraska as to whether they really want finer, more &lt;-'- </seg>

Bui we tire glad to introduce Mr. J. II. Rahmlow. secretary of the Wisconsin Horticul - tural Society, who will discuss "Landscape Hardening for Pleasure and Profit." LANDSCAPING FOR PLEASURE AND PROFIT I ■( H. J. RAHMLOW The subject assigned to me. "Landscaping for Pleasure and Profit" Is a very appropriate one because landscaping can give us both pleasure and profit. The practical! man will ask, "If 1 invest $100 in trees, shrubs and flowers, will It pay?" He finds that a foundation planting around the house, trees to frame it, and a shrub border around the garden in - creases the value of his property. No doubt all of us could find ex - amples of where landscaping properly done has increased the value </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY of property to a greater extent than an equal sum of money Invested in any oilier type, of improvement. Another type of gardener admires the beautiful trees, shrubs or flowers he sees and lie says. "1 must have that plant in my garden." He soon gets it and is thrilled by its beauty and by the praise ot his friend- to whom lie shows it at every opportunity. A third type of person likes to try out new spray materials or fertilizers, or graft half a dozen different varieties of apples on one tne and is phased when his friends praise him for his ability. Herd we have hoi h happiness and profit, the great aims of life ful-filled in gardening. We have all noticed the deep feeling of pride With which a gardener will show a new shrub he has grown from seed or a new gladiolus he has produced. I just read In a magazine of national circulation that Secretary of Interior Ickes is a dahlia expert and has patentee] a coral rod double dahlia which is known around Washington as the "Now Deal Dahlia." That makes him one ot us. 1 ' Colored slides were used to illustrate the following points in landscaping. Foundation Planting. The greatest improvement to the home grounds can he made by planting the area around the foundation of Hie house. Evergreens, shrubs, perennials and annuals are used for i his purpose. Tall growing shrubs are placed at the corners of the building and lower shrubs to build down from the tall ones or for planting beneath windows. Shrubs may be grouped at the corners and al any angle of the foundation. Two or three shrubs In a group is usually enough for this purpose. More than one variety should he used. If the entire front of the house, for instance, is planted to one variety such as Spirea it is likely to look monotonous und it is better to use a low growing shrub in front of the windows than to prune a tall growing shrub to keep it low. Plants with highly colored leaves should not be used. Such gaudy material detracts from the picture. Shrub Varieties. It would do very little good for me to name a long list of varieties which might be used. I would recommend that you study the varieties used in your city. As you drive along the streets this spring notice the foundation plantings. Get. the names of those varieties that do well and appeal to you in leaf, flower and fruit. Your nurserymen will tell you which are hardy and which varieties are free from insects and disease. When you have decided which you would like, have them planted, the tall ones at the corners and angles, and the low ones in front of windows. </seg>
            <seg id="p422">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Trees. What I have said about varieties of shrubs applies also to trees. Study the trees in your community. Select the varieties which appeal to you as being the most beautiful and free from disease and insects. As a rule, fast growing trees have soft wood and do not last as long as elms, hackberry, oak, hard maple, etc. A tree should never be planted directly In front of the house. Plant two, one on each side of the lot so as to frame the house. A few years ago when we moved into a new home I found there were no trees In our block. I went to the neighbors and got them to cooperate. Each one bought one tree which was planted about three feet inside the left lot line. The lots are 60 feet wide and the trees, Moline Elms, will frame each house, but each owner purchased only one tree and has ,the- benefit of two. Shrubs in the Border. Shrubs may be used as an informal border along the fence line or as a screen. If the border is not wanted along the entire side of the property, shrubs may be planted In the corners and in masses at intervals along the fence. Buildings may be screened with shrubs and they may he used to mark the entrance to the drive - way or Intersections of walks. Do not use the same variety all along one side of the border. Here again it will be monotonous. Rather try out some of the new shrubs you may have seen or heard about as being unusually good.- In Wisconsin our Garden Club Federation has organized a plant testing club. We recommend for trial each year a number of new varieties of shrubs which the members plant in their borders. There Is a great deal of interest in watching the growth and habits of these new varieties. Flowers in (he Border. The best way of using flowers is in the flower border. Such borders may be adopted for use along fence rows. They may be several feet in width and of any length .-ind are usually terminated by a mass of shrubs. Do not plant too many varieties of flowers. Rather repeat the varieties and have one color predomin - ating. Never use white-washed stone in the flower border or beds or walks. Plant Testing Club May I say another word about our plant testing club in Wisconsin. Our members get a great deal of pleasure in doing this work. In January a committee which has been appointed by our Federation will meet to suggest new varieties. Two committee members will report on new shrubs and trees. Another on ornamental evergreens. Two others will discuss perennials and rock garden plants and another will mention new varieties of annuals. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY I*- From the lists mentioned, three or four of each kind will be selected and recommended for trial. The list will be sent to the Wis - consin Nurserymen's Association. The members will bid on supplying the material. The lowest bidder will receive the contract. The list will be published in our magazine Wisconsin Horticulture, and orders taken and sent to the nurseryman who supplies the material. After a year or two. questionnaires are sent to every member of the plant testing diih for a report. Members are asked If the plant is orna - mental, hardy, free from insects and disease, and desirable in any other way. These reports will be published. Undesirable material will be eliminated and the desirable will be recommended for further trial. There is considerable interest in this work because of the pleasure our members receive in trying the new material and showing them to their friends.

            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 3 Plant Industry Bldg.. Room 10S 0:15 A. M. PRESIDENT SHUBERT: We have a full program, as you all know, and we will have to hurry these different numbers along. We have a few prominent speakers you will want to hear. I was advised not to give my little paper here but 1 am going to do it just the same. However, we want to leave most of the time for the speakers who really have a message. My object this morning is to give you just a lew little ideas 1 have on the major problems confronting the fruit growers in Nebraska. These problems might constitute a program for the Society as they are of considerable interest anil importance to the fruit growers. Major Problems Ciiiil'rttntiiig the Fruit Grower* of Nebraska .Members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society. Ladies and Gentlemen : During the year Hi:;:;, we have witnessed many important changes. not only in the functions of national and state government hut also in the manner and methods of business in general. The spectacle of the national congress conferring almost auto - cratic power upon the president is unprecedented in time of peace. The many governmental organizations which have been set up for the purpose of permitting us to borrow ourselves ottl of our financial dif - ficulties is no doubt a "noble experiment" hut doubtful In practice and contrary to the rules of old fashioned economics. However, it is our duty as loyal American citizens to uphold the hands of our president and to assist in every way possible to hasten the return of prosperity to our country and to out- people. There is at least one outstanding sign of hope. Not for years have we as a nation, or as individuals, shown a greater desire to join our - selves together in a spirit of helpfulness and cooperation looking toward our common welfare. I believe that the greatest problem confronting the fruit growers or south eastern Nebraska and the entire state at the present time is the problem of cooperative buying of needed material of all kinds, the concentration of packing plants and perhaps the more important of all a centralized selling organization to handle all fruit grown within a given area so that all growers both large and small may enjoy the same price for each variety and grade. </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In some measure we must return to the wholesome customs of our pioneer fathers when neighbors joined themselves together to plant their crops and thresh their grain and to lay up supplies of food for the winter season. Of course there are a few growers who do not seem to recognize the importance of cooperation but it. is to be hoped that they will soon realize that better prices are being obtained by those growers who have the courage to try it oiit. Mr. Baker, iwlin is an authority on the subject of cooperative packing and selling, will tell you more about this matter later on. Codling Moth. During the past year, the codling moth has caused a greater damage to the apple growers of Nebraska and adjoining states than ever before, although growers waged a relentless war of extermination against them. Climatic conditions favored the. very rapid increase of the young worms which seemed to come in a con - tinuous cycle up to picking time. Fruit growers should plan by every known means to destroy this pest this year. Dr. Miirneek will no doubt be able to give us much valuable information on this subject. Spray Residue. Spray residue is another serious problem con - fronting the apple grower. Two or three years ago we wj&gt;re told by national and state authorities that we must buy machinery and ma - terial with which we must wash our apples to remove arsenical residue. After buying these machines and material at an expense that we could ill afford, we are now Informed that some inquiring genius has dis - covered that there is also a lead residue that must be removed, but they failed to tell us just how and what chemical to use. In view of the fact that not one single case of arsenical or lead poisoning has ever been authentically reported, this seems to me to be an unwar - ranted expense imposed upon the already overburdened fruit grower. Federal Surplus Relief Corporation. I am informed that this cor - poration has purchased three hundred thousand dollars worth, of C grade apples from the northwestern growers at a price of $25 per ton, out of which $14 per ton or seventy cents per hundred will go to the growers and $11 per ton will go to the processing plants. Nebraska growers should investigate the possibility of placing a large amount of low grade fruit with the Federal Surplus Relief Cor - poration. Distribution. In my talk to the Horticultural Society in 1927 (you will find it in the annual report of that year on page 115), I said "As the production of apples increases in Nebraska, it will be necessary for </seg>
            <seg id="p426">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE growers here to establish more uniform grading and packing rules and live up to them. Then by proper methods of advertising and cooper - ative selling there Is no good reason why we can not sell Nebraska apples to Nebraska people." There must be some method or plan worked out that will help the smaller grower to sell his apples without resorting to the ruinous prac - tice of price cutting. There are too many growers who become -alarmed over stories circulated by irresponsible buyers and are induced to sell their apples for whatever they are offered, thereby demoralizing the market for others and receiving no benefit themselves. 1 believe that with the system of distribution that is now being used by our organization, enlarged and improved upon, that we could sell to advantage all of the apples raised in the state to home people. I hope that this society will give serious consideration to these, major problems that I have mentioned. Upon their proper solution depends the success or failure of our Industry. They are, first: national government in business. Second; cooperative buying of supplies and the sidling of our products. Third, the control of the codling moth. Fourth, spray residue. Fifth, and perhaps the most important of all— DISTRIBUTION. In closing, I desire to express my appreciation and sincere thanks to the members of the State Horticultural Society lor conferring upon me the honor of president of the association lor 1933. 1 have thought for a great many years that this is one of the highest honors that could come to any man in our business. While I am not much of an office-seeker, I: had hoped sometime to he president of this organiza - tion. I sincerely appreciate the honor conferred upon me. While the year has been filled with many trials and disappointments, we should look forward with confidence that 1034 will bring to our slate and to our Industry a rising tide of prosperity. MR. SHUBERT: Next we have on the program this morning. Dearie Baker, who has investigated the subject of cooperative buying and selling. He will tell you of some of the experiences of the apple growers in southeast Nebraska in the cooperative selling of their crop. Mr. Baker. Mr. President, members of the Nebraska Horticultural Society and friends: </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY You will see on your program that I am to give you a report on the progress of the Shubert Fruit Growers Association. Last year I told you of the organization and how It came about, something of its workings and the cost of packing and marketing of the apples. How the cost had been held down until it was less than half what the cost for the same operation had previously been to the independent grower. Also I told you that the members of the associ - ation wore sure they had received at least 10c per bushel more for their apples than if they were handling them individually and each underselling the other. The individual grower is more, likely to listen to the trucker who tells you of such wonderful buys that he can get from your neighbor at a cheaper price. However, we found that the set-up we had last year was not the perfect plan that we had hoped for. A few of our growers objected to marketing methods, some to the packing and grading, some even Objected as to where we purchased our baskets and supplies and some as to whom we hired in the office. So naturally we decided It would he necessary to set up an entirely new organization. The live largest growers were asked to meet. An organization was discussed and finally approved whereby these five growers were the organ izors. and directors of the new association. Then it was decided to submit to all the growers in our territory a contract for the packing and marketing of their fruit. This contract set forth certain charges and conditions as to how the apples would be handled by the associ - ation. It embodied certain privileges and rights for the grower to sell trull to any retail trade that had been established by him in the pasi. However, the prices charged by him were made by the associ - ation. This plan has proven a great advantage over last years association. Wo were able to get more growers to sign up than in 1!»32 and we had better control over the apples, as to how and when they were de - livered, and wo were able to eliminate a lot of shrink in packing. Wo had less than 300 bushel loss in packing out of 100,000 bushels delivered to the association and a lot of this loss was due to some growers using barrels and baskets instead of field boxes In hauling the apples from the orchard to the packing house. By having last years experience in packing, we were able to make changes in our packing equipment that stopped a lot of expense. We packed this years crop, which was twice as large as the 1932 crop, in just a few days longer time for about '4 to '/ic per bushel less than in 1932 with the basic drty wage for labor the same. However, our greatest saving was made in buying car-load lots of baskets, liners, and caps which meant a saving of two to three dollars per thousand. By </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE placing season requirements for baskets we were able to save from ten to twenty cents per dozen. This means something to an associ - ation when packing more than a hundred thousand bushel. The greatest progress that the association made this year over last year was the marketing of the apples. Quite a lot of studying and planning was done before the season opened. Mr. Guy Shubert, Mr. Loy Franklin and I made a careful and thorough survey of our markets! We also visited the largest jobbers and wholesalers in the territory and additional territory trying to find out what they would need as to grade and varieties. We found that they didn't even know themselves what the trade would want. But we did learn some very surprising facts which caused us to develop a sales organization of our own and to oipen a wholesale store in Omaha. Also, to put in effect a distributive system in Falls City. Lincoln. Hastings. Grand Island. Nebraska and Sioux City, Iowa. Those were our storage points. Before We finally decided that it would ho necessary to handle our own fruit in a whole - sale way and organized our own system of distribution, we made a complete study of the marketing in the past and the present and found some very interesting facts which I would like to include in this report. Since there has been a drop of 4tl to 50 per cent in fruit prices dur - ing the past. 2 or :: years, the attention of the grower ami shipper has been focused upon out- transportation and distributive machinery and its comparative efficiency. When prices received at the rami have been compared with those paid ai retail, growers have found thai they are absorbing most of this vast deflation in value. Thesq comparisons reveal that the percentage return of th" con - sumer's doilar to the grower amounts to only about 30 to :;.". per cent. This means that the agencies transporting and handling this business, absorb 05 to 70 pet- cent of this same dollar. Wo found that trans - portation rates, with a few exceptions, remained at the levels when prices were twice as high, and that city handling and cartage costs aiso approximate former levels. Fruit growers in the United States would receive between 120 to 140 million dollars more annually if it would ho possible to have a re - duction of only 10 per cent in transportation and distribution margins, without a change in retail price. (This is not an impossible feat). What we wanted to know, was what couM wo do to help ourselves In reducing some ;of this margin. In reviewing the distributive system during the past 10 or 12 years, we find until recent years the agencies distributing fruits were confined almost exclusively to the independent wholesalers, commis - sion merchants and broker, jobber and individual retailor, all this was entirely of independent small unit trading. Even today, this sys- </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY tern remains tin prevailing plan, a largo number of operators each handling a small volume. As you till know under this system the con - sumer and producer are commercially removed by a considerable dis - i nice from each other: consequently, consumer requirements as to variety, grade, and pack can ho interpreted only indirectly to shipper and glowers. This system of centralized terminal handling is the changing of ownership through successive sales, and the wholesalers confine their operations mainly to one market, thus offering the grower and shipper an outlet limited to a closely confined market or a single city. In the larger cities, carlots tire sometimes sold a second time, or else broken up and consolidated into jobbing lots. From here they are carted in i he retail store. These operations require a number of handlings and navel by a more or loss indirect route to the consumer, which results in added expenses, us well as delay and undue exposure to pre - vailing weather conditions. With the unusual expansion in both production and demand, mar - kets begun reaching out for their needs two or three thousand miles away, ami witli general dissatisfaction among producers and growers, it has heen necessary to find better ways and more efficient methods in handling the fruit. There has boon one change brought about by the entry into the Held of large companies and associations. These included cooperative marketing agencies and corporate chain stores, and finally the volun - tary chain stores. With the cooperative murketing associations and federated growers agencies, many functions tiro controlled from the shipping point to the jobbing markets. In the case of the corporate chains, all func - tions are performed from shippers through to consumer for a sub - stantial part of (he tonnage. These two movements, both of which depend upon a large volume and standardized grade and pack, have in their growth paralleled each other and to a large extent have been dependent one upon the other. Each has aided in shortening the commercial distance between producer and consumer, making possible a more direct interpretation to producer of the consumer requirements. Each has given a marked stimulus to standardization of grades and packs which has meant hotter prices and larger returns. We wore surprised to find that sales through cooperative marketing associations and federated growers agencies are now estimated at from 4 0 to 50 per cent of shipments for the country. Of this tonnage about half is handled directly from shipper to consumer by the corporate </seg>
            <seg id="p430">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE chain stores. The voluntary chains have made very little progress as yet in group buying direct from shipper. Under efficient management these associations have attained a strong position and find economic advantages are realized in such as the following: (1) equalized distribution, both as to time of season and between markets, resulting in more stable and productive prices. (2) Increased bargaining power. (3) Reduced . selling costs per unit. ( 4 ) Larger market outlets through advertising and offering in volume a desirable grade and quality. (51 Saving by converting into by-products of low quality and surpluses. ( (i ) Elimination of waste through superior grading and packing. (7) Production control through closer selection and acreage adjustment. After this survey and formulating our plans we found that contrary to general belief, the benefit from volume buying of fruit is obtained through a large reduction in buying costs and not through lower prices at the expense of shippers and growers. Also having storage points near the point of consumption, we find has reduced costly handling and loss from damage and spoilage. The saving in damage has been placed at more than 2 per cent, while the reduction in cartage expense ranges from $10 to $30 a car in addition to this saving the apples have a higher quality and more attractive appearance when delivered to the store. The Omaha store plan has worked out even hotter than we expected. and the cooperation of the jobbers and commission men has been very gratifying. However, we went to thorn when. we decided to open the store and laid our plan before them. We wore to sell wholesale only, and would carry largo stocks of different grades and varieties, so they would be able to get. fresh stock any time and it would not be necessary for them to have a lot of money invested in apples. In other words we were jobbing the apples in this territory. We furnish each whole - saler, jobber, broker, new price quotations each week, and advise him of the nearest storage point. . This plan made it possible for us to watch each grade and variety and to see just what grade and pack was the most economical and stood up in storage the best. It was possible by this means of distribu - tion to advance the prices as the market would permit, until the Omaha territory has the highest market in the middle west. We have found by mass distribution it has narrowed the spread between the farm and retail prices and has produced larger returns to the growers and shippers through stimulating consumption. It has also served to return to the grower a larger part of the consumers dollar, both as a result of Its own efficiency and by enforced efficiency upon competition. As to how far this beneficial experiment will be extended and made </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY more effective in stimulating a still greater consumption of our fruit, will depend upon the cooperation of the growers. Mil. SHUBERT: We have another gentleman with us this morn - ing. Mr. Rahmlow. of Madison. Wisconsin, Secretary of the Wisconsin Horticultural Society, who was .with us yesterday. Mr. Rahmlow is a very nice gentleman to talk to. 1 had the pleasure of lunching with him a i noon to-day. He is going to tell us how to prevent black root injury of strawberries. CONTROL OF "BLACK ROOT" OF STRAWBERRIES By H. J. RAHMLOW MR. RAHMLOW: The subject of strawberry black root Injury has boon a very important one to the strawberry growers. We have, a great deal of it In Wisconsin and were worried about it for quite a few . y s - ! " fi "' 1 - » "umber of our growers called us in and gave us con - siderable of a raiting because they said we had neglected our duty In Irving to find the cure for a problem that was costing them a great deal of money. We find it also exists in other states. Black root injury can he noticed in the spring when setting out new plants. The roots are black or brown instead of white as healthy plants should be. When you cut the crown you find it to be brown. When such plants tire set out you may wonder why you have a poor stand. It is because these black roots are really dead roots and if i In- crown is brown the leaf buds are virtually dead also. Naturally such plants will not grow. Strawberry growers have suspected for a number of years that "black root" was responsible for poor stands in newly set beds and for reduction in yield, especially in the case of a lack of rainfall during the picking season. When this type of injury is severe, small plants may he entirely dead, older plants have brown or dead areas showing on the larger roots and some of the smaller roots entirely dead. Some of the older plants may appear to be uninjured, but have slightly dis - colored roots duo to internal injury, in the spring on cutting through the crowns of the plants, brown and injured areas were usually found. 1 Uninjured roots should be white in the early spring. This typo of trouble was so common that many growers thought strawberry roots were naturally brown or dark In color. Dr. R. H. Roberts of the Horticulture Department, Wisconsin Col - lege of Agriculture, undertook to solve this problem In the fall of 1932. It was his belief that the trouble was climatic and was not caused by any disease. He further felt that late fall or early winter colds were the cause of the injury. A heavy mulch was spread on different plots on the following dates: </seg>
            <seg id="p432">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE October 5th, October 30th, November 9th, November 12th, December 1st and December 10th. The first freeze up came about November 15-16 when the temper - ature went down to 12 degrees above zero. It was very interesting to note that plants dug up in December from uncovered beds showed con - siderable Injury while plants from . beds . which had been heavily mulched before November 1-12 showed no injury the following spring, May, 1933. In the past it has been a common practice to mulch the straw - berry bed late in the season. In fact, articles on strawberry growing usually stated, "As soon as the ground is frozen drive onto the field and cover the rows with some good tyiie of mulch." It now appears that in those sections where cold weather conies in November this practice may be the cause of the "black root" trouble. The yield of plots covered just before the November 15-1G freeze up were higher than those covered later or not at all. However, plots covered too early as October 5, gave greatly reduced yields, no' doubt due to lack of proper plant development. The variety Premier suffered severely from black root injury be cause this variety usually has a light stand of plants and lacks foliage protection. Senator Dunlap with a heavy stand of plants and good foliage protection suffered much less than did Premier. Some growers find black root even where fields have been mulched. This may be due to too light mulching.— About three tons of well aged straw or fine materials that pack down well should he used. Wide leafed marsh grasses seem to make poor covers. The proper time then, for applying mulch is just before freeze up. This, of course, is hard to determine but by studying weather records for the past ten years one may be able to judge finite accurately. A temperature of 20 degrees F. above zero for several days without snow protection may injure fields having a thin stand while heavy stands with good leaf protection may not be injured. There may he other factors such as soil type having an influence on the effect of the cold spell. It Is interesting to note that protected plants went through a tem - perature of 30 degrees F. below zero in January, 1933 without injury, showing that injury is caused early when the plants are still In a grow - ing condition. New Apple Varieties Your secretary suggested that I say a few words about our work in Wisconsin on apple variety testing. There are strong indications </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY thai the demand of the consuming public is changing. They are no longer satisfied with anything but apples of the highest quality. No doubt the reason for this is that high quality apples have been more available in late years than they were in years past. It is not unusual today 10 hear of an orchard for sale at a low price and on asking why i he price is low, recc ive the answer, "Because of poor varieties." Evi - dently competition with better varieties forces the price of poor var - ieties so low that the orchard is unprofitable. Yet. twenty years ago those varieties must have been all right or the orchardist would not have planted them. Unfortunately the best varieties do not do well in all sections of our state so our search for better varieties is carried on in two ways. First, we are trying to find new seedlings of high quality. Each year at our annual convention we offer prizes for the best seedling apples. In three year's time we have had over 300 seedlings sent to this show. Four or tive of these have unusual merit. They were of good size, color and quality. These seedlings will be studied further, especially as to tree characteristics. The second method is to try out in our state the best of the new varieties created in other state experiment stations. The Delicious for example, does not do well in all parts of Wisconsin. The New York Station crossed the Delicious with other varieties in an effort to find new varieties of better size and color ill sections having a short season. We find that Orleans and Newfane may meet these require - ments in our state. The Mcintosh apple is meeting with a strong demand due to its quality. The Melba and Milton being crosses of Mcintosh, hut earlier, may fill a local market need for an early variety having Mcintosh color and flavor. The work of trying out these new varieties is carried on in two ways. First of all, we appoint a fruit testing committee to study new varieties and recommend those they think are suitable for trial In the state. We then obtain cions of these varieties and send them to our members who signify their intention to cooperate. These cions are top grafted on old trees and usually bear fruit In two or three years so we can have a report on them in a very short time. We also obtain trees of the new varieties for as many of our members as are willing to join our fruit testing club so that In a few years we will be able to study these varieties in many different sections of the state. So far our committee has been very careful and has recommended only varieties which are meeting with favor. There is indication that they will replace many of the older and poorer varieties. I have greatly enjoyed my meeting with the members of the Ne- </seg>

Discussion Question: What time do you recommend that the straw ho ap - plied? Answer: Just before the first cold snap in Hie fall. Question: How early can you put it on? Answer: The grower must figure this out for himself. We give that answer because wo do not know exactly. Take the reports of the weather bureau over a period of In years at Madison, and we find it is somewhere between November 1 and November 14. This is the danger point, at which time we may get a (old snap. Some years wo may get it even later i as late as December 1st). Wo are advising farmers in that section to cover their plants with about three tons of straw about November 1st. later on adding about thai much more. We did find. loo. that we had a decrease in yield whore we applied the mulch too early. I have pictures her,, of the difference in the ap - pearance of the roots from plants [hat were covered and not covered which I might pass around. The Huh- one hero shows the result of cold on late set plants, set late in August or early in September. The young ones were killed out entirely, as you so.- by this picture. Question: How early ,. U ii one apply the mulch without injury'? Answer: 1 do not believe we should cover any earlier than No - vember 1 under our conditions. Wo found there was a distinct cutting down or the crop if you covered in October. The fruit buds are set the latter part of September and the first part of October. Where the sun was excluded from the plants in the middle of October, there was a decrease in yield. Plants covered November 1 had an increase in the root growth even under cover. The roots continued lo grow after the plants were covered. We found that the kind of cover makes a difference. On one of the farms two kinds of covering were used. One a good grade of fine mixed hay. Then some material that was very, very coarse like steins I of cattails, was used. It was very open and the wind penetrated through it. There was no protection from that type of covering. You must have materials that pack down and keep the plants warm. Our man in Madison this winter used a heavy coat of straw. We had temperatures down to 2 or 3 above zero when no frost got underneath that cover of straw. I think it explains that the results you get from a good mulch is protection from the frost. Queslon: Is there any advantage In having a cover so heavy that </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY there would not he any frost in the ground in the course of the winter? Answer: No there isn't. The mulch merely insures protection from early cold spells that come before the plants have become thoroughly dormant. When once they have become dormant temperatures of in or 15 below zero don't seem to injure the plants. I believe the re - sults of our experiments are going to be applicable to other crops, for flower crops— like Canterberry Bells and so forth. It may be that wo will have to revise some of our Ideas on frosts. If you pick up some of the old bulletins and books on how to grow strawberries, you find "After the ground is frozen hard enough to drive on it, put on so many tons of straw or mulch to the acre." You will find that is published in all the older books. I think we will have to revise that statement at least. Question: Did you get the same effect from late spring frosts after the plants had started to grow? Answer: Wo usually do not uncover until danger of late frosts is over and when we do we just rake it off, leaving as much around the plants as we can. Question: What about light soils and heavy soils? Answer: The same results are secured with mulching on light and heavy soils. Question: That being the case, would it be possible to control or in a measure hasten dormancy, by using special drainage in the heavy soil? Answer: This late growth would hardly be prevented by drainage alom . MR. RAHMLOW: I thought possibly if I might. I would say just a word about the work of the Wisconsin Horticultural Society in trying 10 find bettor varieties of apples to grow under our conditions. We find reports from New York as well as Washington and Idaho that tell of pulling up thousands of trees of poor varieties. You may not have poor varieties in Nebraska. Probably every grower plants only the host varieties and you may not have that trouble. But farmers all over the state of Wisconsin have, and possibly your farmers are not so different from ours. 1 find a great many people have planted varieties that are not sell - ing well. We found S2 varieties of apple trees in-one of our counties. That seems to me absolutely ridiculous. There are not that many good varieties of apples in existence. It does not pay to grow varieties that the public will not buy. </seg>
            <seg id="p436">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE In New York they have developed a now Mcintosh and a sweet De - licious. Makes me feel the time is coming when good varieties will he rather plentiful. Years ago we wore able to soil good cooking apples very easily. People did not care so much for color. A bushel of De - licious wi.l last about a week in my family whereas the Ben Davis would last all winter. That condition is one to which the fruit grower should pay some attention. We do not want to sell customers a variety that will keep too long. We want to sell them something that will be oaten quickly. A commercial grower, as a rule, knows heller because he has con - sidered market requirements. For instance the Mcintosh probably is a good quality variety next to Delicious in quality, hut we find thai it doesn't hang on the tree very well. Too. ii is not as lite an apple as we would like, so we tiro trying out some of the newer kinds. Now York state took that problem Up 10 or 1- years ago. Tried to breed a now variety thai would have the same quality as the Mc - intosh or Delicious hut would overcome some of the faults qf these two. So we started a fruit testing club through tile Horticultural Society. First, we tike the recommendations of the experiment stations such as Iowa. New York, and possibly Minnesota, although Minnesota has not yet produced varieties of high quality to meet our southern Wis - consin requirements. They have, lor instance, developed two new kinds of Mcintosh. They are lighter than the Mcintosh. The Cortland is a cross of Mcintosh with Ben Davis. Wo would not recommend il as an apple of sufficient quality to meet the demand, but 1 believe that if they want to plant a good cooking apple. I would prefer the Cortland to some other varieties. It is a good eating apple and also a good cooking apple. But we do not recommend it as the highest. Among the later Delicious crosses we have two that we have recommended very strongly. Orleans and Newfane. Very similar in appearance to the Delicious, in flavor, hut produced in Now York for the purpose of shortening the season. The Delicious does not color up and get size early enough in the season. If you have that trouble, 1 wouid suggest you try out the Newfane as a variety equal to the Delicious in quality but better size and color in the shorter season. Medina is one we considered hut rejected because it does not color up enough. It is a nice yellow. The committee rejected it this year. Mc-Coun is a Mcintosh cross that is quite a hit later than the Mcintosh, hangs on the tree fairly well hut it is so late that even in Wisconsin, excepting in the southern part of the state, we can't pro - duce It. We have some trees at Madison. They are doing fairly well. The fruit is an improvement on the Mcintosh but I am afraid our </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY season is a little too short for them. Of I ho early tipples we have only adopted two, Melba and Milton. Molha is a good eating apple that matures with us about the 1st of August, just a little later than the Yellow Transparent, and I believe thai it is splendid for those who have a roadside market. There is a demand for a good early eating apple. We found that the Melba meets that requirement- We have recommended the Melba as the best early'.apple for Wisconsin. Tile next one before Wealthy is Milton. We recommended Milton us the next earliest to Melba. Both are Mcintosh flavored apples. The Milton ripens a wool; earlier than the Wealthy and is a better eating apple. We have also tried the later varieties such as Orleans, Newfane, Secor and McConnell. I think my time is up. I am glad to have an apportunity to talk lo you growers from Nebraska and 1 want to bring you the greetings from the Wisconsin Horticultural Society. ■MR. SHUBERT: 1 think every one is interested in what causes the dropping of young apples. 1 have heard that subject discussed somewhat but 1 think we are going to have the right solution of that question this morning. I am mighty glad to introduce to you as the next speaker a man who has been here before and who knows his sub - ject. Dr. Miiriioek. of Columbia, Missouri. What Causes the Dropping of Young Apples DR. MURNEEK: I want to express my appreciation at being called hack to talk to you again. I enjoy the progressive spirit you have In your slate compared with the spirit we have in the Ozarks. As I come further west, not only the spirit becomes more progressive, but your tipples become larger too. 1 wish you had seen our apples. Our apples in Missouri this year were very, very small and those that were not small wore very wormy. Apples may got even larger as we go west but their marketing problems also become larger. I have a letter from my friends in the west lamenting the fact that they received very little for apples and pears, Advance prices for a box of pears in Oregon last year was 53c. Advance price of apples was around 59c. You can imagine. You can't grow apples profitably on the high priced hind in those states for -.hat price. Now lor the subject matter — what causes the dropping of apples? I think your very efficient secretary has a sense of humor. He has a tremendous sense of humor. You can deduct that from his writing in various publications, your state publications and also you can judge </seg>
            <seg id="p438">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE from the tit'.e he has assigned me — What causes the dropping of apples? I am sure I am not bringing you a solution or an answer to this question. I will discuss with you various factors involved. Probably your secretary a signed this subject to me because he knew .1 had worked on it — 1 have studied it and published some of my results. And possibly he assigned this subject because I am one of the few scientists still wearing woolen socks. Most of them have grown into the rayon sock stage and of course thereby separated themselves in spirit from the fruit growers. Now, of cjourse in general you know the apple tree that is very often white with flower in the spring will have very few of these flowers really become fruit in the fall. If we have a set' of 5 % or sometimes 3 r r. we have a very good crop. Roughly, you know also that there are two drops, an early drop, and then what we call the June di]op. The early drop is caused by lack. of pollination, and the June drop is caused by some disturbance. ! We believed that at one time. Then we started to investigate more carefully and we found that there are at least 1 drops. 1 will discuss and suggesi some possible causes. The first drop occurs, at least it his in Missouri for the past I years, about a week to 12 days after flowering. Now that drop us - ually consists of very small aborted flowers. The fruit has not swollen at all. This is by far the largest drop. This first drop is caused by .tliree things, as much as wo know at present. It may he caused by other things, but this is at least as much as we know at present. In th|e first place, many of these flowers are abnormal. They look very much like the normal flower but if you examine them you will find them abnormal. They are incapable of being fertilized and forming fruits. They drop off due to a lack of pollination, thousands and thousands of flowers on each apple tree. Bad weather in some years causes many of the normal flowers lo drop. Third, these flowers have been self-pollinated, by the pollen of the same variety and therefore they do not stick to the tree. The first drop is by far the. largest drop. All the drops together in most cases do not amount to 20 "7, as compared to this first drop. These flowers drop on the ground and disintegrate promptly and you do not notice them as much as the June drop. Sometimes one variety will drop 95^J of Its flowers, or fruits if you wish, in this first drop. The second drop occurs about 12 days or 2 weeks after the first drop. Probably a part of the fruit in the base of the flower has already enlarged. It is often a very large drop. We do not know the exact </seg>
            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY cause of this drop though most likely it is due to self-pollination, u is also likely that many of there have been cross-pollinated but be - cau e the nutrition is poor drop off, duo to the fact that the tree Is in a weakened condition, r-hori of nitrogen: also duo to a short tge of car - bohydrates which are necessary for fruit formation. In either case, you may lave tlie second dropping. .:•'■' The third drop occurs 12 or 14 days after the second one. The. fruit has already rounded out, looks more or less like an apple. The calyx has closed. These drops are also quite large in some varieties and may be fairly heavy but never nearly as heavy as the second, which many call the Juno drop. Th.- four 111 drop occurs 10 to 14 days after the third drop. It is very ofteil small — sometimes large. We have still other drops caused by. other things hut these I am talking about are the drops of ininia - t uie apples. The Starl; Bros, Nursery Company apparently have found a bud spoil of 1 he Jonathan which does not drop its fruit. They are still testing it out. .Vow. just briefly, the summer apples such as the Wealthy, Duchess and others, as a rule drop their apples late during the third or fourth drop. They have relatively little first or second drop. The Delicious sets it's fruit like an early variety. It might be Interesting to .-co the picture of how these little apples look during the period of the first drop. Very often you see apples with the stem heni 0111 and up which are the ones which will stay on the tree. Grimes and Jonathan have a very uniform, fairly high first and second drop, and sometimes a third and fourth drop. The third is quite prominent in these varieties. Tie Jonathan and Bon Davis may have four drops, particularly the Leu Davis. The Jonathan probably has only two prominent drops, hui the Bon Davis usually has three and sometimes four. .Now these things, to our surprise, are hereditary. You can't do anything about it You can't change this situation but you can change the relative number of fruits dropped at each time. Either apply nitrogen or insure cross-pollination. Where better cross pollination is provided the second drop is much heavier than the first, the apples stick tighter and a little bit longer. From our studies we find that there is very little relationship be - tween the June drop and the final set. We can affect the final set by the application of nitrogenous fertilizers but how this affects It we are not ready to say. </seg>
            <seg id="p440">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We do know you will have a better opportunity to grow a bigger crop with good soil. You have in your Nebraska apple section, loess soil, the best I have seen anywhere. No better soil than along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. You have a good beginning. Then of course, the proper protection of the plants and many other orchard practices will help make the fruit stick better. This is all I have to say. gentlemen. I wish I were able to speak in more practical terms but we know so little as yet aiiout the dropping of apples. In studying these problems in our experimental orchard we had large cages built to cover the trees. It is very difficult to do this satisfactorily in the open orchard. We do not know what kind of pol - lination. With these cages we could study the effect of various pollen. Little bee hives were placed in each cage to provide controlled pollin - ation. Now I wish to tell you a little story, in regard to the Ben Davis. The Ben Davis is certainly a 4-eylinder apple. We do not emphasize it too much but you would bo surprised how often growers have made a lot of money out of the Ben Davis because of the big yield. Lots of people, because of lack of knowledge or because of being hungry, eat the Ben Davis and enjoy it. London. England, furnishes a market of around 15 or 17 million dollars. Of course we do not get this export trade in the middle of the country. 1 was there and I saw Ben Davis selling as "a nice eating apple, 2 '.', inches In diameter." There are a lot of people enjoying Ben Davis. There was supposed to ho a man who could tell apples blindfolded by tasting them. So he was sub - mitted to this test, using various apples, the Delicious, and so forth. Filially they thought they would give him a piece of soft cork. He chewed it a long time and said, "It must he a Bon Davis, and if it is, it is the best one I ever ate." Discussion Question: Last year my trees were all wind swept. We had that southern storm and three days afterwards, many of the blossoms dropped off. How do you explain this? Answer: You must keep in 'mind that the flower is a very tender structure that is easily killed. PRESIDENT J. F.

            <seg id="p444">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Ol' AGRICULTURE Problems. The out-of-state speakers were Prof. M. F. Miller of Columbia, Missouri, and E. A. Bierbaum, County Agent at Anna. 111. The former discussed the Importance of maintaining soil fertility in orchards and practical methods to use and the latter told of the essen - tials of a successful cooperative marketing association. In addition there was an interesting discussion on spraying to control orchard pests and a talk by Mr. W. B. Yowl of Nebraska City on Crowing Black Raspberries. In general the meetings were well attended and the interest shown was equal to or better than any meetings in recent years, despite the fact that the depression was at It's height. Orchard Tour. In early August the annual orchard tour was spon - sored by the Horticultural Society cooperating with the Extension Service of the Agricultural College. In previous years this tour in - cluded visiting orchards and vineyards in Cass, Otoe, Nemaha and Richardson counties, but this time the last two counties wore omitted. The growers in the south part of our commercial apple district felt that their section should be omitted because the crops were not up to expectations on account of the prolonged drought. Otoe and Cass counties on the other hand had been fortunate enough to receive fairly good rains in July and here the fruit plantings looked hotter. The crowds gathered at W. I!. Manning's orchard at Union: After looking over Mr. Manning's orchard and packing house, the University Fruit Farm was inspected. Then the group visited Dick Kiiiimels orchard near Nebraska City. After lunch Oliver Stevenson took the group through the Otoe Food Products Co. packing plant, whore they saw spinach, soup, and pork and beans- canned the modern way. Fol - lowing this we visited Fred Webber's vineyard southeast of town: then we passed several good looking young apple orchards and cherry orchards, finally stopping at Frank Sim's young orchard. The day ended with the inspection of the packing house at the .Morton Orchards. Here a modern apple washing machine was in operation. Mr. drove Porter the manager, also demonstrated the use of a now type of spray machine called the Liqui'duster. This machine is a combination be - tween a duster and a spray outfit. It works well, is economical of material but is not entirely satisfactory in large trees or on days when there is a strong wind. State Fair Exhibits. The Horticultural Society cooperated with the State Fair Board in putting on a Fruit, Flower and Garden Show. The central feature sponsored by the Society was a replica of the NRA insignia with its Blue Eagle. This feature was one of the main attrac - tions in Agricultural Hall. Because of the depression the attendance at the Fair was not sufficiently large to meet the premiums won by exhibitors. The Horticultural Society Board voted to use about $600 of its balance to help out with the paying of the premiums In the Horti - cultural Department In addition to paying the expenses of the general display. </seg>

            <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARIJ OF AGRICULTURE AFTERNOON SESSION, JANUARY 3 Plant Industry Bldg., Room 10S 1:30 P. M. MR. SHUBERT: Ladies and gentlemen, we are just about 10 min - utes late. We had a fine program this morning and I anticipate one just as good this afternoon. The first thing we have on the program is, "Depression? Not Among the Codling Moths in 1933," by Thomas Snipes, of Lincoln. DEPRESSION? NOT AMONG THE CODLING MOTHS !S. THOMAS SNIPES The codling moth situation in fruit growing sections seems to have remained undepressed in spite of the agricultural and general eco - nomic depression. Because there were numerous differences in the seasonal behavior of this apple pest due to varying climatic condi - tions this last season, it might be well to give a brief summary of the seasonal history of the codling moth by broods. In studying this insect, the insectary division of the Department of Entomology hits confined its activities chiefly to the determination of the peaks of moth flights of the three broods in the orchard and to a laboratory study of the length of the four stages of development of the codling moth with special emphasis on the number of days elaps - ing between emergence of the moths and beginning of egg laying, the number of eggs laid per female moth, the period of incubation, the hatching period, parasitism of the larvae, period of pupation, and length of life of male and female mollis. The peak of moth flights in the orchard were determined by moans of attractant bait traps. These wore made from open lop containers of gallon capacity. The insidos of these pails were lacquered or enam - eled to prevent undesirable chemical reactions. Six such naps were used in the University orchard where the investigations wore con - ducted. The traps were hung in apple trees in various parts of the orchard so that uniform records could ho obtained. The attractant material used consisted of: Black Strap Molasses 1 part i Water : !i parts Yeast (per trap) ........: H cake The containers were filled about % of their capacity and the bait was changed when a sour smell had replaced the fermented odor of the bait. By plotting on a graph the number of moths caught each day in the traps, the peak of each brood was determined and the time for application of the cover sprays concluded. </seg>
            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Considering the codling moth activities by the individual broods: The pupal period of the overwintering members of the spring brood varied from 11 to 23 days with an average of 1G days. The first moth of the spring brood was caught May 16. This was 11 days later than the beginning of the spring brood last year. The peak of this brood occurred June I or 15 days later than it had the previous year. The average length of life for moths of the spring brood was 12 days. Dur - ing this time each female moth of the spring brood laid an average of ■l."&gt; eggs. 7.1 r ; of these eggs were fertile and hatched. In other words, from each moth of the spring brood, 33 larvae of the first brood developed. It can be said that the entire spring brood was from a week to two weeks later this year than it was in 1932. Experimental data showed that eggs of the first brood were laid aboul :: days after emergence of the female moths. These eggs started hatching ."&gt; or G days after they were laid. Then, the larvae of the first brood began to appear S to 10 days after the emergence of the spring brood moths. Those larvae fed on the leaves and fruit and matured rapidly. Larvae of the first brood pupated and emerged as moths In an average- of 10.5 days. These moths lived about 14 days and the females laid ir.7 eggs each. 80% of these eggs hatched or 125. larvae of the second brood were produced by each female of the first brood. Mollis of the first and second brood began to deposit eggs 2 days after emergence and these eggs began to hatch G days after ovlposition. This would be 8 days after the emergence of the female moths. Second brood larvae required 10 days as pupae and emerged as moths which lived 17 days. These second brood moths laid 90 eggs each, 80% hatching. Then duo female moth of the second brood produced 72 larva.- of i In- third brood. Most of these larvae fed to maturity and then wont into winter quarters under the bark of the apple trees. The first brood in 1933 was 11 days later than the corresponding brood for 1932 while the second brood for 1933 was about a week be - hind that of the previous year. This seasonal variance of the broods was probably due to the different climatic conditions during the two years. indications show that the larvae of the second brood are going into hibernating quarters in great numbers. Observations also show that every year the second brood grows stronger and exhibits greater potentialities for damage. The fact that the second brood was stronger this year and that a great number of larvae are hibernating should in - dicate a strong spring brood in 1934. It will be interesting to note the effect of this dry fall upon the overwintering larvae. Observations </seg>
            <seg id="p448">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Ot AGRICULTURE have indicated in the past that in normal falls and winters, approxi - mately 50% of the overwintering larvae die. It is to be hoped that conditions prevailing this tall will increase this mortality among the codling moth larvae to a much greater degree. The accompanying graph shows the relative strengths of the three broods at the Lincoln station this season. The moth peaks as indi - cated for the spring, first, and second broods occurred on June 4, July 29, and Sept. 1 respectively. The beginning of oviposition and the hatching period showing the time for application of cover sprays are indicated. i Discussion Question: Does it make any difference about the time of Hie day that we bait the trap'.' Answer: I don't think it would. We usually examine them in the morning about 11 o'clock hut moths are nocturnal, attracted at night. If youi have this bait in your trap, it is pretty sticky, and there- Is very little danger Of the moths being aide to crawl out of the trap and after sunup you get very little moth flight, if any. Question: Do you have any reason why the period of the time of hatching the eggs was shorter in the first brood than for the spring brood? i Answer: ' 1 do not know of any reason. MR. SHUBERT: We learned the history of the codling moth as indicated one spring and summer. We are going to learn how we should destroy the codling moth and Mr. Henry L. Lobeiisiein. of the extension department in Kansas, will tell us how to do it. Spraying for the Codling Moth in Kansas . ' MR. LOBENSTEIN: I thank you very much — hut I wish some one w-ould tell us. I certainly haven't come up to tell you folks how to do It but in talking to Mr. Hoppert. I think what he wanted was for me to describe the results we have had. Wo feel, of course, we arc In a position to talk about the cooling moth because wo have plenty of them. I think Arkansas has more than Kansas. I was interested in one - report saying the highest number of moths caught in a tree this year was 3S.

            <seg id="p450">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE wicnua, for a six year period starting in 1926 and ending January, 1932. We think the Arkansas Valley Is one of the good apple produc - ing regions of the middle west. That area has certainly, I think as heavy an Infestation of codling moth as any place In the country unless It would be parts of Colorado or possibly northwest Arkansas. The first detailed study we had in Kansas was made at this station. This portion of the state had a large number of worms In practically every orchard and the growers were having a great deal of difficulty in securing control. ■ Dr. Gilmore and his force started their work in the spring of 1926 and they worked, of course, on different phases of control, on actual ways and means of spraying, types of machines, amount of pressure, methods of covering and the amount of material needed per tree, the effect of spraying and the cost of applying the proper number of sprays. I do know Dr. Gilmore got results. This region was just as wormy as any place in the Arkansas Valley and that is saying quite a lot. I reviewed Dr. Gllmore's results there and compared them with some of the more recent 1 developments especially regarding last summer's from other parts of the country. There Is not a great deal of change in the general recommendations he made at the close of his work. Briefly they were to the effect that arsenate of lead was the only satisfactory material for codling moth control. Calcium arsenate gave fair con - trol but was more dangerous to use than lead arsenate because it had a tendency to burn the leaves on several plats in the early brood sprays. However, there were a number of stains on his fruit. He also found that fish oil was just as satisfactory at about a pint to 50 gallons as were other oils at 1 gallon to 100. It is just as satisfactory and some - what easier to remove than is mineral oil. j One of the reasons why other orchard men in this section were not getting results from spraying was due to the fact that they were mak - ing an Insufficient coverage in their orchards. Mr. Gllnn (he was con - nected with our institution several years ago working on his master's degree) made a survey of every commercial orchard in the Arkansas valley. He found that on the average the orchard men were using only 3 gallons per tree per application. This is not sufficient. In all of the orchards of the state it cost 75c a tree throughout the season or about $30 per acre; while in Dr. Gilmore's work, it was $2.50 a tree. Another thing I briefly want to mention is the fact that Dr. Gilmore found that the use of supplementary measures was absolutely necessary if the growers were to secure good results. Pass that on. I might say that while we have had no direct connection with that station we visited it quite often and talked with Dr. Gilmore about it. We had no part in the plan of the work and the operation of the station. We </seg>
            <seg id="p451">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY have conducted all our work Independently, following such recommen - dations of Dr. Gilmore's as we thought It best for us to use. This sea - son I was fortunate In having an assistant in the period from March 15 to October 1 to work on codling moth control alone. At the con - clusion of the work last fall I felt more optimistic about the control of the codling moth in the Arkansas River valley than ever before. Question: Do you keep temperature charts? Answer: They are available. They will be put out when the cod - ling moth report comes out. I do not know how the temperature affects the number of eggs hatched. Question: Do you have any idea as to whether the bait traps alone would cut down the number of codling moths In the orchard? Answer: The moth traps do cut down the number of moths that lay eggs. There is no question about that. In the west. In the Wenat - cbee apple section experiments have been carried on with moth traps to determine whether commercial control could be secured by plac - ing a trap in every tree. The results do not seem to give satisfactory control. But this method may prove ot value as a supplement to other methods in badly infested orchards. In southeast Nebraska the codling moth problem is much less serious than it is in the Arkansas Valley. There were 1100 worms In one band on one tree down there. I have seen not just one worm per apple but 5 worms per apple in a crop in a packing shed down at Wlnfield. A commercial grower brought his crop of Jonathans up to the packing shed in the fall and they went into what the state law called the utility pack. They were basketed and lids put on the basket. They remained in the shed for five days; when he took the lid off of one of the baskets he found 54 cacoons in that cap. Another problem we have been working on throughout the last three years is a more accurate determination of a proper spray schedule. Mr. Patton. my assistant, endeavored to determine this by running bait traps in the orchards of 11 growers located in four counties. He visited the traps three times a week counting the codling moths caught in the traps and also those in each cage. We started those In the early spring and ran them until late September. In connection with the bait trap we ran a codling moth cage. We found the cage gave good results, perhaps a little more accurate determination of the peak of the emergence of the first brood than did the halt traps. He took the worms in the early spring, counted the moths as they </seg>
            <seg id="p452">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE emerged from the pupae stage. After the peak of the first brood, we found the cages were of no apparent value because we had a very defi - nite peak for the first brood but we could tell very little about the peak of emergence In the second or third broods. We tried out various materials in the bait traps to discover if possible the most satisfactory and the cheapest bait to use. First of all, we did some work using the Dimalt mixture used by bakeries and breweries, and which has been quite widely used and recommended as a material for bait traps. We tried it with an equivalent of black - strap molasses. Then we also used 1 part of blackstrap molasses to 20 parts of water. We did use yeast through the month of May in order to secure fermentation but we did not have to use yeast after that. You might have to use yeast up in this part of the country all season long. As the yeast causes fermentation, it means more frequent change of the bait. Those growers, seeing the high catch of worms, immediately came to the conclusion that it would benefit them to put bait traps in their entire orchard. That is proper. Workers in the Pacific Northwest a few years ago said this was not practical but evidently there has been a change of sentiment. 1 saw an article in a recent publication from the northwest saying that it may he recommended as an actual means of reducing the moth population. Another type of work we have been very well pleased with is the matter of sanitation, which I will discuss in my talk tomorrow. I hope you will pardon me for digressing here briefly. I can't help emphasizing right here that where the codling moth is very serious, spraying alone cannot be depended upon to produce a high proportion of clean fruit. Some of you men remember a few years ago that the Iowa growers and those at Doniphan used hogs as a means of combating apple cur - culio. They used the hogs to clean up the drops which contained in many Instances, the larvae of the first brood. Another sanitary measure we used and recommend is treated bands. In the Arkansas Valley this year we used between 60 and 70.000 feet of tree bands and it is an established practice down there now. Growers who have banded their trees are firmly convinced it is one of the greatest aids in controlling the codling moth. Another phase of our work this summer has been the testing of several new materials. You people are quite familiar, of course, with the situation we fellows were in last spring. I am not making any false statement when I say that we were practically forced to change our recommendations on insecticides on account of the spray residue </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY rulings, particularly the lead part of the ruling. It meant virtually that we could not recommend lead arsenate for the late summer sprays. In our test we compared with lead arsenate, such materials as Kalo, a fluorine compound, Manganar, an arsenical combined with man - ganese, Verdol and Dendrol, the former a summer oil, the latter a dormant oil. Very briefly, our results were just about what they have been in other sections and that is, arsenate of lead still gives the best results. Calcium arsenate was not effective. In one of our tests, calcium arsenate gave just as good control of worms but we got more damage from stings. The others gave very excellent results. If anybody tells you that clean apples can not be grown where the worms are bad, we refer you particularly to a man who has three J orchards in the Arkansas Valley. This man this year had close to 99% I perfect fruit while many of his neighbors had 50 to 99% wormy fruit. He uses a lot of good orchard practices. Three people do nothing but pick up drops, scrape trees, prune for the 99% perfect fruit. He used lead alone until the first of July and two applications of Kalo after that. Under his bands we got on an average of three worms per run - ning foot — 18 to 75 per running foot of band for the other orchards we had under observation. Northeast Kansas, particularly Doniphan county, has more codling moths this year than they have ever seen before. Those who used calcium arsenate blame this material. Others say that the lead ar - senate wasn't as good as In other years. Never do they admit that there might have been something wrong with their spraying methods or schedule, nor that they have been lax In cleaning up drops or re - moving wormy apples at harvest time. The trouble in Doniphan county goes back two years ago and pos - sibly in the southern part of your growing section the same thing might be true. We had a heavy crop in 1931, one of the biggest crops we had in recent years. We had a very hot windy week in September and in four counties in nortneastern Kansas 2% million bushels of Jonathans were on the ground at one time. I judge one-third of those apples were never harvested — laid right on the ground. This made conditions favorable for the codling moth. The next year (1932) there was a very poor set of fruit producing a crop 8 to 10% of normal. Some sprayed once or twice, some not at all and these orchards went into the winter of 1932-33 with a heavy crop of worms. The dry June of this year (1933) was an Ideal set-up for a very heavy Infestation. You will agree with me in that original statement of mine, which we must never lose sight of, namely that If we fall to get control of the first brood, we are just in for a hard, tough time of It. The trees had the heaviest over-wintering population of worms </seg>
            <seg id="p454">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that we have had since we started growing apples but I still maintain that our battle against codling moths down there Is to reduce the over - wintering worm population, because if we have two or three hundred worms on the tree go through the winter as against a normal 30 or 40 per tree. It stands to reason that regardless of our spray practices, and our spraying program, we are going to have trouble controlling the codling moth. There Is going to be — there is already — more scraping of trees In Doniphan county than has been done up to the present time. There is going to be tree scraping and banding, more packing sheds cleaned up properly, and more sanitary methods used than have ever been used before. A great many are going to use oil. If you are using it all right, go ahead. In Kansas we are not convinced it pays to use it. We are likewise not convinced that it does any damage. By all means use it in the first brood sprays if at all. When oils are used later there is much more difficulty encountered in residue removal. I think that our spraying program next year is not going to be any different than it has been in the past two or three years. We feel we are going to go back to arsenate of lead, recommending 2 pounds to 50 gallons in our first brood spray. We always have recommended this amount because we can not get control down there with 1 &gt;_. We get better control with 2 % pounds but not enough to justify the extra half pound. We are going to make our recommendations for a little heavier first brood spray next year. We are going to be insistent that proper supplementary measures be used. Professor Dean, head of the department of entomology, made a summary of the Boston meeting during the holidays with regard to the arsenical residue situation. I do not know whether any of you Nebraska men were there or not but you will he mighty interested in knowing that the conclusion of all workers at the Boston meeting was that calcium arsenate can not be depended upon. Everybody said that we are going to use arsenate of lead as we have done in the past and then try to get it off. Proper supplementary measures must be fol - lowed. Quite a few growers were going to use oil in the first brood sprays. All were cautioned against using it after the first brood spray. The Pacific Northwest Is still standing by a talk of several years ago that injured trees would follow when oils were used throughout the season, not only mineral oils but fish oil as well. Personally I feel a little easier in my mind to find a decision that so closely parallels those held by the workers on codling moth control from other sections of the country. I do not know whether you have questions to ask about our work </seg>
            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY with bait traps or banding or any of those things. I would be very glad to try to answer them. Discussion Question: Regarding orchard clean up, don't you think that is a big problem? Answer: I did not say very much about It because I notice I am supposed to talk about orchard sanitation tomorrow. So I thought I had better leave It until then. Here's an interesting thing that one of our leading growers found out last year — practically all of his 35 year old Ben Davis and Winesaps were pretty badly in need of prun - ing. We had a pruning demonstration in that orchard and we cer - tainly worked over one of those big trees. It looked so good to that man that he went ahead and pruned about 2/3 of his orchard In that same manner that spring. He used Ms less spraying material and had better control than before he did this. That has been our experience In several Arkansas Valley orchards. Leave too much small wood and we can't get good coverage with spray material. There are several recommendations I am making to our growers this year in respect to spray coverage. That is to get coverage In the top center of the tree. That is the critical point insofar as codling moth infestation is concerned. It certainly is the part of the tree that is less frequently covered with spray material. We are asking them to determine whether or not they are getting cover actually clear up in the tree. Another thing, I want them to do next fall Is to prune one or two trees as patterns before the leaves have fallen so they will get a better picture of what the tree will look like when gets it's growth of leaves. Question: Is it better to use a tower? Answer: In the Arkansas Valley everybody uses towers. Question: What type of nozzle do you use? Answer: Like every other place, a little bit of everything. The three most common ones are, the single nozzle short gun, the Keith gun, a single nozzle angle gun about 4% feet long, and the 4 nozzle boom or broom as it is sometimes called. Question: The single gun would not be appropriate for a sliding tower? Answer: Yes. </seg>
            <seg id="p456">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. LOBENSTEIN: I wish to mention a few things we discovered in our work with bands down there. It does not pertain to spraying particularly but it does pertain of course to codling moth control. We tried to ascertain when to use the different width bands. We found that the 2-inch band is satisfactory in orchards where the in - festation is light. Where the infestation is heavy the 1-inch width should he used. The two-inch band will take care of 100 to 150 worms per running foot. When the infestation is heavier than this Hie wider bands should be used. Cold treated bands seem to he fully as effective as the hot treated though our tests have boon conducted only one year and we don't know whether this would ho true every year. Young trees -ire likely to ho injured by the hands unless paraffin is used in the places where the bands are to be placed. In one orchard we found S out of 11 trees injured. This is true when applied on the smooth scaffold branches of old trees. The hands should not ho applied In the same place year after year. Mui-lap hands won- also tried hut wore unsatisfactory at least they were not nearly as satisfactory its the treated cardboard hands. Since labor Is the principal item of expense we feel that burlap is not worthy of recommendation except in small homo orchards. The burlap bands will catch the worms but after they are caught the hands must he taken off and the worms destroyed. The chemicals if properly im - pregnated into the cardboard will serve to kill the worms. So we fed our bands are an essential part of the codling moth program down there. Question: What time of the year do you put hands on? Answer: We put them on the latter part of May, just before the mature larvae of the first brood come out of the apples and we take them off in the fall a little while after harvesting. Question: The worms are killed that enter these bands? Answer: We get 9S to 91»% control of the 1st and second brood, 85% of the third and fourth broods. Question: How many tacks are used? Answer: Just whatever it takes to hold the top of the band snugly to the tree. We want to fasten the band on the bottom so there will be no open space. The top of the band will perhaps have to be tacked every two inches. If it is smooth, a tack every 4 or 5 inches might be satisfactory. </seg>
            <seg id="p457">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Question: How long will a spray application remain effective? Answer: The Arkansas average is about 11 days. A few years ago we sprayed every 7 days. There is a growing opinion among some, and it does seem that the codling moth is develop - ing a resistance to arsenate of lead. I am not sure but what there is some truth to It. 1 have been in northeast Kansas time after time when the middle of the season you could walk through a whole orchard and not find a wormy apple on the trees. Then there were whole orchards very few of which were not wormy, due to the more favorable weather conditions, mild winters, hot, dry summers. jThey just have a tre - mendous population of worms building up. MR. HQPPERT: I am sure we all enjoyed that talk. Next we are to have a round table discussion of our spray problems. But first I want to report on the meetings of the American Pomological Society and I ho Illinois Horticultural Society at Springfield, 111., in December. Since- most of the discussions at Springfield dealt with the codling moth problem it is only proper that this report be taken up in connection with this discussion. So if you'll pardon me for just a few minutes I'll give you this report and then we'll follow the printed program. REPORT OP THE MEETINGS AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS By E. H. HOPPERT Illinois Horticultural Society and American Pomological Society Cooperating The Nebraska Horticultural Society Board authorized its Secretary to attend the Horticultural meetings held at ' Springfield, Illinois, on December 13', 14, and 15 and to bring back a report of the important discussions and papers. Since the most important topic for discussion was controlling the codling moth', it is only proper that we start with this subject. Dr. W. P. Flint of Illinois told of his experiments with 234 different mix - tures and materials in the attempt to find something that is more re - liable and more practicable than is the present well known and univer - sally used insecticide acid, lead arsenate. Of these 234 materials, 41 were tested for their effectiveness as ovicides, in other words, whether they could he depended on to kill the eggs, and 9 were tested as repel - lants to keep the moths from laying their eggs on the apples or apple leaves and stems. All of the materials were tested In the laboratory on apples and leaves and 51 of the most promising were then tested under actual orchard conditions outdoors. So far lie reports nothing has been found to replace acid lead arsenate. There are some ma - terials almost as good, however. The best results were secured with 4 pounds lead arsenate, S pounds of hydrated lime and % gallon of </seg>
            <seg id="p458">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dormant ofl to 100 gallons of water used throughout the season. This reduced the infestation from 32% to 4%. Next came arsenate of lead 4 pounds, % gallon dormant oil to 100 gallons of water for the first brood covers followed by oil and nicotine, — *4 gallon oil and % pint nicotine to 100 gallons water used for second and third brood sprays. Then came zinc arsenate and a number of other arsenicals like calcium arsenate and manganese arsenate. How long does a spray remain effective? The best results were secured with arsenate of lead 4 lbs., and soy bean oil % gallon to 100 gallons water. The first week there Were 26% of apples injured, second week 33%, third 40%. In Indiana lead arsenate was also found to.be best; % gallon dormant oil and 1 qt. Nicotine Tannate per 100 gallon of water were next. Dutox gave severe cracking of the fruit on one plat. Nicotine Tannate gave very poor results in Ohio. He told of two surveys made in about 140 orchards in Illinois. There were 63 in one orchard district and GG in the other. In the first district the 10 poorest orchards showed 61 % wormy apples and the ten best orchards showed 0.S% of wormy apples. In the other the 10 poorest showed 41% wormy apples and the 10 host showed 1.7 r ; wormy tipples. The reason for the difference was hard to explain. There was a difference in age. The best orchards average IS years of age and the poorest average 27 years of age but that was not sufficient to make all of this difference. The ten best put on one extra spray and used about 2 gallons more spray per tree than the poorest. The method of applica - tion, thorough covering of the inner part of the trees would make a lot of difference. Dr. B. A. Porter of the Department of Entomology at Washington emphasized the need of complete control program rather than merely a spray program. In a badly infested orchard he found a piece of wood left In pruning. This piece was about an inch in diameter and ten inches long. On digging into it he found 136 overwintering larvae. He urged that a general cleanup be made of the- orchard to remove dead bark, screening packing shod and picking crates, thinning off wormy apples in summer and destroying these. He also summarized the work done by the department in various states. In Arkansas for example, calcium arsenate was fairly close to lead arsenate the? former had 56% wormy apples, the latter 45%. The foliage injury is much worse from the use of calcium arsenate, particularly whore the trees are weak. The fluorium compounds are better than calcium arsenate but difficult to 1 remove. Oil and nicotine are proving a good substitute for lead arsenate but the effectiveness Is only for about 7 days and </seg>
            <seg id="p459">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY hardly that long when it rains. Furthermore some varieties like Grimes, Yellow Newtown and Golden Delicious are badly burnt where these materials are used. Where oils are used not over a 6% total must be used because the oil is taken Into the tissues and deposited in the wood cells. When too much is used during the season the buds are injured. It is much better to use 6—1% oil sprays than 3 — 2% sprays, oils should not be used with sulphur nor with ten days of a sulphur spray. Where oil is used late In the season lead should not j be used as it makes lead removal very difficult. In Indiana 2% oil plus 1 qt. oleic acid was found as effective as oil nicotine mixture. In general oil sprays seem to improve the appearance of the foliage. W. C. Button of Michigan discussed scab control in considerable detail. He has tested a number of different materials that have been promoted as substitutes for lime sulphur with the hope that they will do some good in scab control and not injure the foliage to the extent that does liquid lime sulphur. With a chart he showed that scab control depends for Its success on early applications or pre-bloom sprays and at this time there is little danger from burning. After the petals fall oven the milder sulphurs can control scab because scab finds condi - tions less favorable for Its development. Furthermore mild sulphur sprays may prove fairly good on scab resistant varieties such as Jona - than even in years when scab is favored by wet weather. In all cases though, these sulphurs should be used at the rate of 4 pounds to 50 gallons of water rather than weaker, especially when used early in the season. The primary scab infection occurs on the sepals and later the spores wash down from these spots onto the apple causing lop-sided apples. If this early sepal infection is controlled there is little to fear later on, lit! I If ii is not you may have to fight scab all summer if the weather is favorable for scab. There was one exhibit shown that I wish we could have here, namely the one by the Entomologists of Illinois. It told the story of how the codling moth larvae over winter in the orchard in a way that would certainly make a lasting impression on anyone who saw it. The en - tomologists had dug up 2 5 trees in a badly infested orchard and made a thorough count of every larvae found in and on the tree. In addition they dug up sod, weeds, etc., around the trees to find the number that over winter there. These trees had been banded last June and they had counted the larvae killed by the bands. Here Is a summary of their findings. The trees averaged 100S larvae each. Of these 810 were caught under the band — </seg>
            <seg id="p460">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 97 were found on other parts of the tree, 93 were found under clods and in weeds. Of the 9 7 on the tree — 37 were under rough bark. 29 were in punky wood above the hand, 25 were in split branches, 4 were in crotches, 2 were In pruning wounds. Of the 9 3 on the ground — 27 were in injured roots, 22 were in mummies on the ground, 22 were in dead weeds, usually weeds with hollow stems. 10 were in old pi linings that had not been gathered, 12 were found under other trash. The records would indicate thai a general cleanup of old trees and the burning of woods and old primings would be a job worth while this winter. Another address that held the interest of the fruit, growers was that given by Director V. It. Gardner of the Michigan Experiment Station. His subject was listed as "Marketing Apples." Most every - one expected him to toll about hones! packing and cooperative methods of marketing. 1 did. But he never once mentioned either of those sub - jects. Ho took up the angle that good fruit is half sold. lie impressed upon his audience that if a grower produced large well colored fruit free from disease and Insect injury, there would he no marketing problem. We may disagree with him but yet you will have lo agree that there is a lot of truth in what he says. Mr. Gardner told the audience that with our well known materials and with the spray outfits now available clean fruit can be produced. They proved it to the satisfaction of a number of growers who thought it could not be done. Down thru the center of several commercial orchards where scab and worms had not been controlled for several years, the extension workers took 2 rows of iroes. The trees wore pruned to make thorough spraying possible. Then, the regular spray materials were used and the regular recommended sprays applied and over 90% of the fruit was clean the first year. Clean fruit can be produced by proper spraying with materials now available. Size is important, too. This matter can be solved by feeding the trees and properly pruning them. One of the Michigan workers found that certain kinds of limbs always produce small apples and others always produce large apples. The object in pruning is to remove the limbs that always produce small apples. This worker. I think his name </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY was Rich, found that 5 year limbs that were slender and wean, no larger around than your little finger, just wouldn't produce large apples and that where these 5 year old limbs were the size of your thumb they invariably produced larger apples. The color, too, was greatly improved where these weak branches were removed. Then there is the matter of apple strains. They have found In Michigan that some varieties like Spy and Mcintosh show a great variation in color. About 25% of the trees will produce greenish poorly colored fruit year after year. 25% will produce highly colored specimens and the other 50% are half way between. How much better it would he- If till the trees were like the 25% that always produce highly colored specimens. There are some nurserymen who specialize in certified trees. These are the ones to buy. Another necessary job is to make several pickings of the fruit each year. Ai least three should be made. Irrigation will probably pay big dividends in the central states in 5 years out of 10. Another important step in marketing is to dispose of culls through good cider, clarified cider. The consumption of this wholesome product can ho Increased greatly as shown by some of the experiences In Michi - gan. Mr. Wiggans will tell us and show us about this new product so I will say no more about it now. ■ ROUND TABLE DISCISSION Led By E. H. HOPPERT LOY FRANKLIN: There seems to he considerable variation in discussions on the use and value of oils. Then also there was a sug - gestion that it is dangerous to use. I'd like to get the straight of it. MR. HOPPERT: First of all oils are generally used as a supple - ment to arsenicals. They are not depended upon entirely and solely ■for the control of the codling moth. Oils do not poison the worms but they serve as repellants. They also kill the eggs. As a rule oils are used late in the season. In this section we generally use lime sulphur in our early sprays up to and in normal years including the first cover spray. Where this is the practice, oils can not be safely used for at least two weeks afterward and in very dry seasons there has been dam - age done to foliage a mouth after the sulphur spray was applied. Ex - perience has shown that sulphur deposits remain in the leaves until oxidized. This process goes on fairly rapidly when there Is sunshine heat and some moisture. When it is very dry the process does not go on rapidly. When oils are applied to foliage where the sulphur has not been used up in this oxidation process then severe burning takes place. </seg>
            <seg id="p462">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Oils cannot be used safely throughout the season. It seems that they are absorbed at least In part and when sprayed too often during the season injury results. This injury is not very evident the same year but it shows up the following year in delayed budding and blossoming. Where oils are used with lead arsenate or while there is still a heavy deposit of arsenical spray residue, difficulty may be encountered at harvest time in the removal of the residue. So much for the dis - advantages of using oils. When a heavy Infestation of worms occurs in an orchard there is some likelihood that lead arsenate cannot be depended upon to give satisfactory control. Then oils can be used to advantage particularly late in the season in the second or third spray for the first brood and tor the second and third broods. At this time we can use Bordeaux mixture if a fungicide must be used and with this material the oils can be safely used. MR. LOBENSTEIN: Some of the Kansas growers have had dif - ficulty in removing the lead arsenate when oils are used. MR. HOPPERT: Yes. that is true. Hut this was probably because they tried to remove the residue with hydrochloric acid alone-. When oils are used it is necessary to use in addition a degumming agent like Vatsol. Question: Our experiences in the experimental plats at Shu - bert were similar to those reported by Mr. Lobenstein. Calcium ar - senate is about 75% as effective as lead arsenate and is much more likely to burn the foliage. The adhesive qualities of calcium arsenate are rather poor in addition making the material effective for a much shorter time than in the case of lead arsenate. A GROWER: We have used oil a few times. I have just about decided that if a grower studies his season and the materials and knows how to handle them he can make up his own schedule to suit his condition. No two seasons are exactly alike. A grower must be pre - pared to fight several different pests and he must use different materials for the same pest depending upon the weather conditions. No man can write me out a schedule now which I would he willing to follow next season. We must have a flexible spray program to fit the season and a grower must be prepared to change materials. I know that lime sulphur and in fact any sulphur compound is dangerous when the weather is hot and fairly moist. Then Is when I use Bordeaux If we need a fungicide. Ordinarily we don't need a fungicide in every spray put on after the first of July. But In some years we might have to. </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Question: You brought out in your discussion that we must con - trol scab early In the season if we control It at all. Would you recom - mend a dormant spray? MR. HOPPERT: No. A regular dormant spray is primarily for scale and in this state a true dormant spray is needed only occasionally on a few trees where scale insects have become established. I suppose, however, your question refers to the use of a regular scab spray while the trees are still dormant. In the light of past experiences and ex - periments in Nebraska I would say such a spray would not be of much value. I presume your idea is that the spores would be killed that are on the buds and bud scales. I presume in some seasons there could be dissemination of spores ahead of growth of leaves but that Is so seldom the case that It would not pay to apply such a spray. It is much better to put on a delayed dormant spray. In Michigan, Wis - consin Indiana. Ohio, etc.. where scab is much more serious than It is here the delayed dormant spray Is one of the most Important scab sprays and it may be in some years in this state particularly on varieties like Delicious which scab easily. The time to apply It Is when the leaves show the silvery sheen just before flower buds show color. Investigators find that most of the primary infection developes at this stage and that lopsided apples are produced by scab when the spores wash down from these early spots onto the young apples just after they set. Question: This would mean a spray ahead of the pink spray. Answer: Yes, a lime sulphur spray. This spray would control early scab and also frog eye. One of these two organisms was re - sponsible for the heavy early leaf fall that we had last spring. Question: What do these other states recommend for these early sprays? Answer: Liquid lime sulphur at l ] ,i to 1% gallons to 50% water. There is no danger of burning the foliage at this time of the year. GROVE PORTER: As I see it there are many good materials and methods 'on the market. One grower uses liquid lime sulphur with good success and another burns his foliage with it. I for one am afraid of liquid lime sulphur and won't use It. But that doesn't mean that some one else shouldn't. I know there are growers at Nebraska City who have used it successfully. The past year I used oil and nicotine late in the season and I am sure it did a lot of good. We had fine con - trol of the worms and of the leaf hopper. Perhaps under my condi - tions lead arsenate would have done as well so far as the worms are concerned but we had a bad outbreak of leaf hoppers which can't be controlled with lead arsenate. Therefore I used the oil and nicotine combination. </seg>
            <seg id="p464">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: Would you recommend two sprays before the blos - soms open up? Answer: That would depend upon the season. In a cool wet spring, yes. In a warm dry spring, no. One never knows what the weather will be so to play safe I would start with a delayed dormant spray and if the weather is favorable for scab put on another between the pink and full bloom stage. Question: How about using lime sulphur when the trees are in full bloom? Is there any danger of Interfering with the set? Answer: Lime sulphur could be used at 1 to 50 without danger. Bordeaux 1^-3-50 or even 2-4-50 can be used safely. Experiments have been tried to keep the blossoms from setting, using sprays of different strengths. Lime sulphur at 3 to 50 was used in Maryland I think. But here the damage was more severe on the foliage than on the blossoms. Question: Why do you prefer Lime sulphur to Bordeaux for the early sprays? Answer: There Is less danger of burning the leaves and russetting the fruit. Bordeaux is a very excellent fungicide for scab and black rot. But in cool wet weather it is likely to prove injurious. Bordeaux l%-3-50 has been used in several states at full bloom for controlling blossom blight. There is a difference of opinion in this regard. Some claim fine control, others find it only fair, but no one has reported injury to the set nor to the leaves and fruits. Question: What effects do Bordeaux and Lime sulphur have on peaches in the dormant stage? MR. HOPPERT: Both are used in the dormant stage for peach leaf curl. In the Pacific Northwest Bordeaux is preferred whereas west of the Rocky Mountains Lime sulphur is generally recommended. I feel that these discussions are very much worth while. I know we could go on for the rest of the day exchanging views and experi - ences. But we must continue with our program as we have used up the time allotted to the Round Table discussion. We also owe It to our visiting speakers to give them all the time needed for their sub - jects. Dr. Murneek of the University of Missouri is with us and I know you will enjoy his talk. His subject for this afternoon deals with pruning and thinning. Most growers have rather definite opinions on both these subjects but usually they are the result of observation only. Dr. Murneek has In addition to this the experimental background and In some cases actual data from experiments. It is a pleasure to intro - duce Dr. A. E. Murneek of the University of Missouri at Columbia. </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY DR. MURNEEK: We have very similar talks, most of them about sprays and always one trouble or another regarding spraying. This year, thai is in 1933, we finally got together what we called a round table discussion of the growers. That is. the growers expressed their opinions. They have very good opinions about some of the things they have found in their actual work. As I get older. I feel more and more that not all of the information on a subject originates with ex - periment station men. I believe most of the information is found by the growers and yet we probably get more credit than they because we assemble their experiences and disseminate the information. PRUNING AND THINNING IN THE ORCHARD PROGRAM By DR. A. E. MURNEEK Pruning is an art which the wide awake orchard man learns by experience and observation. Experiment Stations may describe this art in general terms in bulletins. The Extension man like Mr. Hop - pert may demonstrate the art of pruning In the orchard but still the orchard man must be possessed of good sound judgment when he prunes his orchard because no two trees are exactly alike. Varieties differ in their habits of growth and in their pruning requirements. It takes years of experience and keen observation to prune trees properly. Il would be preposlerous for me to try to tell you men how your trees should be pruned. In fact I think most of you who have been in the game for some years have very good notions of how it should be done without any advice from me. 1 am merely going to discuss Willi you certain principles to keep in mind when you prune a tree principles which you might not have gotten from your experiences. 1. Prune the young tree for form. 2. Prune the hearing tree for productivity. We have an old apple orchard at the Missouri Experiment Station which is being removed now. At least 50 per cent of the trees have broken apart because the first main branches were not properly selected. Too often sharp crotches were left and these later on split open. Water ran into these splits and rot organism began growing in the wood. Later on heavy crops and strong winds broke the large limbs at this place. The Delicious variety is one of the worst to make these sharp crotches and by the way it Is one of the hardest to shape in early life. It always reminds me of the young man who is pampered by fond parents. He leads a fast life in his youth only to repent In old age. But coming back to trees. The young tree must be carefully trained so that it will he able to stand up under heavy loads of fruit </seg>
            <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE without splitting. Nature provides the branches with an abundance of growing points which under certain conditions grow into branches. Usually there are too many of these branches on the young tree to allow them all to develop. The art of pruning is to know which of these to remove and which to leave. Experience has shown that the modified leader type of tree is the most satisfactory considering all the advantages and disadvantages. There is a single leader left and 6 to S side branches at various points on the trunk beginning at about 3 feet from the ground and extending up to about 7 feet. In leaving these main branches on the trunk be sure they have a sound strong union If you watch this carefully you should have very little trouble with the crotches splitting when the tree conies Into bearing. As the tree becomes older it reaches the stage when It produces fruit. Most young trees will produce fruit of good quality but as they reach an age of 15 to 20 years considerably more pruning will have to be done to maintain that high quality. The very fact that nature produces so many growing points may result in the production of small fruit. Nature doesn't know that people want apples 2% inches and up. So far as nature is concerned she thinks she does a good job if she pro - duces a 1 Mi-inch apple, with S to 16 good plump seeds and that Is where man must step in with his saw and shears if he is to make nature do his bidding. Man has learned by experiment and observation that the best bearing wood is 3 or 4 year old wood. Naturally as the tree grows older this good fruting wood is farther from the trunk und unless something is done to encourage the development of new wood down on the older branches it won't be long until Hie fruit, is produced only around the outer parts of the tree. In pruning, thin out the competing branches to allow sunlight to reach down toward the center of the tree. Then you will have the proper conditions for fruit production. Remember that sunlight must strike the leaves to produce the sugars and starches that make the apple. As you go over the tree take out the weaker branches, the thin willowy ones with weak spurs and buds. Leave the stronger twigs. There was a time some 12 or 15 years ago when we pruned too much and about 10 years ago a fad was started of pruning veryjiftle. It is strange how we go from one extreme to the other. Perhaps the markets have a lot to do with our pruning practices. When people will not pay for quality we furnish them what they want. Lack of pruning means lots of poorly colored, small apples. That Is what we gave them at that time. Then wo found that where the trees wen? not pruned we had difficulty spraying through the trees. As a result the worms became much more numerous. Now we have gone back to more severe pruning to get more high grade apples and to get better spray coverage to protect against worms. </seg>
            <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Discussion Question: Where is the best bearing wood? Answer: Lower down and on the inside. I would take out some of the larger branches and let in the light. Removing all small branches will not give the desired results. Question: Can't you let enough light into the tree so your bearing wood is down towards the center or the tree is just as vigorous, without cutting too much from the outside? Answer: You can never do it. DR. MURNEEK: I believe I showed you these charts three years ago and 1 have to apologize for doing that again but these things are worth repeating. This is a chart which has been prepared by an ex - tension worker who used it successfully in talking to growers. It has worked out in the field pretty well. It illustrates in general the four conditions we may have in trees with respect to their growth and bear - ing. There are 4 classes of trees. In Class 1 belong the -vigorous young trees. These trees do not bear. There is too much nitrogen in proportion to carbohydrates. Here, also, belongs an old tree that has beeli cut back too much. Class 2 contains trees that are less vigorous but still growing well. They have [urge dark leaves, very strong branches and produce only a few fruits. Young trees that are just approaching maturity, that is the bearing age, belongs here. Class ::. Vigorous annual bearers. Proportionately more carbo - hydrates to nitrogen than the first two classes. Good size green leaf, good annual growth, produce a lot of spurs and buds. More desirable class. Our pruning and other orchard practices should be such as to keep the trees in this class, but unfortunately it is very easy for trees to got into class 1. Class 4. Devitalized trees. They flower abundantly but the set is very limited. Old trees. Have yellow small leaves and are not good annual bearers. The natural direction of -all trees is in this direction. If you leave them alone they will travel naturally into class 4. You can move trees back and forth from these classes, not only by local pruning but by orchard fertilization and cultivation. Question: How could we tell when there is either a deficiency of nitrogen or carbohydrates in these trees? Answer: It is very difficult. The only thing you can go by Is the </seg>
            <seg id="p468">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE growtn of the tree and the amount of fruit it bears. That will vary from variety to variety. You have to be guided by the growth, color of leaves, color of fruit. There is no other way of telling. Not even chemical analysis will tell you. We can not tell the exact ratio. We divide carbohydrates by nitrogen. Experience should tell one to some extent at least In which way the tree is traveling. If the tree makes less than 2 inches of terminal growth, had lots of flower buds and pro - duces a lot of fruit, 1 would say it is in class 4. Question: In pruning would you carry out the Idea that each branch represents a tree? Would that be a good idea? Answer: Yes. a very good idea. That is in general pruning. COMMENT: I had a man come hack from Yakima who worked In big orchards there and he said they put him in a block of Delicious. They did not cut off anything smaller than an inch. They seemed to get best results with fewer mistakes in that type of pruning than they did by more detailed pruning. DR. MURNEEK: Yes, I should say so. You can overdo detailed pruning. If you do not do it carefully you may do too much. Per - sonally if I were pruning an orchard, I would prune the larger branches and consider it detailed enough. Question: Do you mean to cut out the older wood so you would not have more than three year wood? Answer: No. I mean that throe year old wood bears best. The • three year old wood nexl season would be four year old. This old wood becomes less efficient as it becomes older. In pruned trees leaves are loss shaded, Leaves are necessary for the formation of the apple. From 30 to 40 leaves are required to pro - duce one good apple and these leaves must be of good size and receive a proper amount of sunlight. DR. MURNEEK: Now about thinning. I lived in Oregon and California for 9 years. There thinning is a regular practice, just like spraying and pruning. Everybody does it. . But wo do not do that here. What is the object of thinning and what are the results? The practice of thinning is the removal of some fruit in order to increase those remaining, in size and quality. That is the essential object. Does it work? It works. It certainly works. Why? It re - quires from 30 to 4 0 leaves to supply food for one apple. How do we know that? We have performed experiments. We see apples of vari - ous sizes coming on the tree at the same time. Had a number of leaves on the branch. We 'picked all the leaves off. There Is some food In the branches left from last year. This apple drew from this source </seg>
            <seg id="p469">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY but it could not draw enough. Then we left 10 leaves to an apple. Likewise on the same tree we left 20 leaves. 30 leaves and 50 leaves per fruit. We had a corresponding increase In size. With 75 prac - tically the same size. We can see from this experiment that 30 to 40 leaves are required for that particular apple. Had a 1G to 1 leaf ratio on another tree without thinning. We had just thousands and thousands of these small apples selling for 2 5c a bushel. It does not pay to grow apples on devitalized trees. By thinning we remove a large number of these small apples and in - crease the- size of the others. We leave fewer apples on the branch. The apples will have a better color also. By thinning we increase the size and to some extent increase the color. Pruning will do that too. Pruning In a measure is a substitute for thinning but it does not work so well. In western Oregon they say you can't substitute pruning for thinning because you do not leave the proper leaf ratio on the branch. Discussion &gt; Question: We did considerable thinning this year but we did not know the right time. What is the best time for thinning? Answer: After the last drop, the 4th drop, because we can't tell who! her all drops have occurred when the apples are the size of walnuts. You should thin when the apples are about an inch in diameter. Later than that would not be so good although in the west they thin two or three times. Question: How do you thin? Answer: G inches apart but use your own judgment. Question: Where do you find the distribution of these must be in order to benefit apples? Answer: Anywhere on the branch, above or below the apple that is left; as long as there are enough leaves on the branch the apple will get the food. '•'•'■'• We have evidence of the value of pruning in an orchard. We found that pruning in the case of the Ben Davis increased the set only slightly. The pruned Delicious set much better. With Grimes we had a bigger increase by pruning. With Jonathans we got double the set, showing the profitable effect of pruning. We are fairly well convinced that pruning will increase the set of the fruit on most varieties. Question: What is the best season of the year to prune? Answer: Always after the leaves have dropped. Never in the </seg>
            <seg id="p470">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE summer time because % of the nitrogen in trees is in the leaves. If you prune in the summer, you rob the tree of the nitrogen in the leaves that were removed. In the fall the nitrogen goes back into the trunk; that is the time to do your pruning. Question: How late would you prune in the spring? Answer: Until the buds open up, before any appreciable growth has been made. Question: If you had trees say 10 years old, and you really thought they had too much wood, would you recommend heavy prun - ing? Answer: If there is too much I would cut some of it out but trees of this age are less likely to set a heavy crop following such treatment than are older trees. Question: If they had a crop it would be all right to take the wood out? Answer: Yes. You can start pruning after they commence bear - ing. THE CLARIFICATION' OF CIDER ', C. C. WIGGANS Apple juice has long been used as a beverage — indeed it seems only logical to assume that such use dates from the time man learned to separate the juice from the solids of fruits. If this juice is allowed to ferment, the product is called wine and in certain sections of the world some juice is used for this purpose-. Such wine, however, is relatively low In quality when compared with that obtained from other fruits, notably the grape. Unfermented juice is known as cider and is classed as one of the soft drinks. The soda fountains, of the. United States even as early as 1921, dispursed annually, according to one authority, over one billion dollars worth of drinks but unfortunately pure fruit juices made up a relatively small proportion of the whole. There seems to be much room for the increased use of these products and recent developments Indicates that they can be served profitably in competition with the synthetically flavored and artificially colored products which are now offered for sale. In these days of adversity it behooves every producer of apples to utilize every possible outlet for his crop. Possibly a portion of his lower grades could be profitably turned into cider thus lessening the competition between the low and high priced fruit. This paper pre - sumes to offer some information as to a method of preparing cider by which a more attractive and therefore more salable, product can be secured. </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Aside from the actual marketing or final phase in handling cider, the cider maker faces at least four important problems. In order of time, these are 1st — choice of varieties, 2nd — grinding, and pressing operations. 3rd — clarification process and 4th — prevention of fermen - tation. Since these all have a bearing upon the quality of cider, each of them will be discussed and one method of clarification will be shown to you. Choice of Varieties. All apple varieties do not make elder of equal quality. Fruit used for juice purposes should be of marked and agree - able flavor and aroma and reasonably rich in acid so that it has some tartness. Juice that is flat or insipid lacks character and that from exceedingly sour varieties is also unpalatable. Highest quality gener - ally results when several varieties are blended thus combining their desirable characters. Apple composition varies greatly with varieties and also because of climate and season. In general apples carry from 93% to 97% juice and 3% to 7% insoluble solids. Of the juice from 80% to 86% is water, 9% to 18% sugar (of which 1/3 is sucrose or cane sugar and 2/3 invert sugars), 0.4% to 1.6% acid, largely malic and 1.3% to 3.0% extractives, such as pectin, tannin, essential oils, gums, minerals, etc. As given by Chenoweth In his book on "Food Preservation" the aver - age chemical composition of certain apples is as follows: Percentage Chemical Composition of Apples Total Soluble Total Acid Ratio sugar solids solids sugars as Malic to acid Ben Davis 15.56 12.59 9.S6 .44 1:.038 Grimes 17. SS 15. IS 13.00 .45 1:.035 Jonathan 15.19 12. SI 9.93 .42 1:.042 King David 14.98 12. 2S 10.60 .91 1:.0S6 Oldenberg 11.70 7.92 .97 1:.122 Stayman 15. S3 13.05 11.55 .52 1-..045 Wealthy 13. S4 11.73 9.11 .50 1:.055 Winesap 17.42 14.71 12.22 .47 1:.03S Such w.ide variation in solids both soluble and insoluble, means of course considerable difference in the amounts of juice obtained from given weights of various varieties. Also some varieties are known to "press" better than others — that is the grated pulp responds more readily to pressure and thus yields a larger juice flow. Hard ripe fruit yields the largest amount of juice since the very fine pulp of over-ripe apples clogs the pores of the press cloth, thus interfering with the escape of the juice. Fully ripened fruit generally possesses much less juice than that which is just hard ripe. </seg>
            <seg id="p472">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE unnding and Pressing. Before the juice can be satisfactorily ex - tracted the fruit must be put through a cider mill. Here the fruit is grated or crushed between a steel cylinder armed with short knives and a fluted or armed adjustable plate toward which It revolves. Apple tissue Is made up of cells with rather heavy walls and therefore the grating and pressing must be quite thorough. Pieces '4 to V» inch In thickness are satisfactory. Larger pieces retain too much juice while too fine crushing means difficulty with the pressing cloths. It is needless to state that only sound, clean fruit should be used for elder making. The practice of turning rotten wormy fruit into juice cannot be too strongly condemned. The Installation of washing machines generally has greatly simplified the problem of securing clean fruit but has not solved the question of soundness. The equipment used has some influence upon cider quality. Cast iron graters causes discoloration of the juice. Hence steel parts should be used. In the press the parts coming in contact with the juice are usually wooden but here care should be taken that these do not Impart undesirable flavors. The grater and press may be operated either by hand or by some other type of power. By the application of pressure, the juice is squeezed from the crushed cells and thus our cider is secured. The ordinary hand press, as usually operated gives two to two and a half gallons of cider per bushel of fruit while an efficient power press will give nearly double that amount. All things considered the "rack and cloth" type of press is most satisfactory. In this method the grated fruit is built up into cheeses, two or three inches thick and enclosed with a strong, open weave, cotton cloth. Several of these are placed one on top of the other, with slatted wooden racks between them and then pressure slowly applied. Maximum pressure should be maintained for at least ten minutes. Oxidation produces color changes and also brings more Bugars and pectin into solution. Hence more and better cider is ob - tained if pressing can be delayed a few hours after grating. Ordinar - ily however, this procedure is not practical unless only small amounts of elder are needed to supply a steady dally demand. The most efficient press is one of the hydraulic type. Here a liquid either oil or water, is forced by a pump with a small piston into a large heavy walled "ram" or cylinder which Is attached to the press. Press - ures are proportional to the diameters of the two cylinders. About 150 pounds per square inch is a suitable pressure. When this pressure is applied too rapidly, there is insufficient time for the juice to escape and hence bursting of the press cloths Is likely to occur. The pomace Is sometimes reground, built up into new cheeses and </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY repressed but such operations are of doubtful value to the small elder maker. Pomace does have some value as a stock food, fertilizer or jelly stock. For the latter purpose the pectins are extracted by boil - ing the pomace for 15 or 20 minutes with several times it's volume of water and then pressing. The extract must then be concentrated before being suitable for use. Clarification. Cider as it comes from the press contains many solids, including particles of pulp, coloring matter, pectins, tannins etc., many of which will settle out naturally if the liquid is allowed to stand for a time. However, sedimentation, unless unduly pro - longed, will not entirely clear the cider since some of the proteins and tannins are held in colloidal suspension. These cannot be removed by ordinary straining or filtering. It is such material that gives to cider its characteristic cloudy appearance and lessens Its general at - tractiveness. Unless special means are taken to clarify It, elder is always more or less dreggy and compares rather unfavorably with other clear sparkling soft drinks. Considerable experimental work has been done recently, at New York and Michigan Experiment Sta - tions, along this line. There are several known means for clarifying cider. One of the simplest of these is heat. A temperature of 165° F. coagulates the proteins and causes them to lose their power of holding the other materials. Filteration or sedimentation will then clear the solution but unfortunately such heating gives the elder an undesirable cooked flavor. The most recent development in this field Is known as the "flash heating" method. In this process the elder is pumped through steam jacketed pipes so that it remains at a temperature of 180" F. for only 20 seconds and is then cooled immediately, thus preventing loss of flavor or aroma. The apparatus used Is similar to that used in milk pasteurization and is rather expensive to own and operate. By adding from 4 to 6 lbs. of filter aid per 100 gallons of elder and then filtering under pressure a satisfactory juice is obtained. Further fil - tering through asbestos will polish up the elder a bit more and If one uses the Seitz germ proof filter, it will be sterile as well. A second method is known as the gelatin-tannin method. This is based upon the precipitation of the colloids through the neutraliza - tion of their negative electric charge by the addition of some material carrying a positive charge. Gelatin is such a substance and if added in just the right amount will promptly and perfectly clarify the juice. If too much Is used the colloidal condition will again prevail and hence a slight excess of tannin Is usually added so that no gelatin remains. The stock solutions of tannin and gelatin are dissolved separately in 20 % alcohol and after due tests the proper amount of each is added to the cider. After being thoroughly stirred, the juice Is then allowed </seg>
            <seg id="p474">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to stand undisturbed for 24 hours after which the clarified portion is siphoned off. It may then be filtered further or not as the maker chooses. About 5% of the cider volume remains as sludge but this may be utilized in vinegar making. Still a third method of clarification Is by the use of proper enzymes and it is this method which probably is best suited to general use even though it may not be quite as effective as the other two. Both pro - cedure and equipment are quite simple and some recent reports from Michigan indicate that the cost is not excessive and also that the clari - fied juice sells at a large enough premium to justify the extra trouble. It is this method which is being demonstrated today. In this case clarification is brought about through the action of the enzymes upon protein. The latter is digested and hence loses it's colloidal properties so that the solid materials can be filtered out. Two materials are available for this purpose, one known as Pectlnol and the other as Clarex. According to a letter from Prof. Marshall of the Michigan Agricultural College the former material works faster and less of It is needed than Is the case with the latter. Prof. Marshall's directions for making clarified cider are as follows: 1. Add Pectlnol R A (obtained from Rohm and Haas Co., Bristol, Penna.) to freshly expressed cider at the rate of 20 to 30 ounces per 100 gallons. The Pectlnol powder should be placed In a jug with warm cider or water (about 100° F.) agitated at intervals for 20 minutes and then strained through cheese cloth into a barrel or vat of cider. The residue after straining should be discarded. 2. Allow about 15 hours for Pectlnol to do its work (the breaking down and sedimentation of colloidal substances) when the elder will be ready for filtration. 3. Place_ cider in the mixing or supply tank for filtration. Thor - oughly mix Hytlo filter aid (obtained from Johns-Manvllle Co., Detroit) into cider at the rate of two to four pounds per 100 gallons. Allow cider to run through filter until clear (first few gallons will contain some suspended filter aid and must be refiltered). If the elder falls to clear up, look for a leak In the system. The materials mentioned in these directions will cost at the mini - mum about 95c per 100 gallons of cider with $1.85 being the maximum (Pectlnol 10 lbs. — $7.00, Filter aid 90 lbs. — $6.00). The filtering apparatus used is very simple. It consists of a supply tank located from 4 to 14 feet above the filtering appliance, a tube con - necting the tank and the muslin filter, a muslin tube 3 Inches in dia- </seg>
            <seg id="p475">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY meter to serve as a filter and a trough to collect the filtered cider. Cut - offB, spigots, pumps, etc., greatly facilitate the operation of this outfit. The speed with which the cider can he filtered is a matter of interest. This depends upon the height of hydrostatic head and also upon the thickness of the filter cake. For instance Marshall reports that with a 10-foot head at the beginning of the run the flow was 1.80 gallons per minute. A head greater than 15 feet cannot be used because the pressure prevents the proper formation of the filter cake. On the other hand when the flow slows down too much the filter bag can be cleaned and the process started all over again. In a test reported by Marshall the treatment of elder as above described increased its use 45% even though the cost to the consumer was increased by 20%. Sterilization. Unless cider is sterilized Immediately after being made, fermentation begins and proceeds at a rate depending upon the surrounding temperature. Thus under ordinary circumstances the use of cider is restricted to only a few weeks in the fall. If a satis - factory means of preservation was available the consumption period would be greatly extended and the use of cider thereby Increased. There are several known methods of sterilization. One of these is the application of heat. Cider in sealed containers is sterilized if held at 165"-170° for 20 minutes. Such a scheme always affects the flavor and is often otherwise impractical. Another common method is to add benzoate of soda. This chemical is used at the rate of 1/10 of 1% but cider or any other food product so preserved must be properly labeled. Temperatures around 25° F. will satisfactorily preserve fruit juices. The New York Experiment Station workers have recently reported upon a scheme of sterilizing cider by filtration through a Seltz germ - proof filter. Such cider it bottled immediately in sterile containers will of course keep indefinitely. It would seem as if there is some promise in this plan for the maker ot cider. The last and perhaps the latest development along this line is to produce a concentrate containing all the aroma and flavor of the original cider. This is rather difficult of accomplishment but can be done. Low heat first drives off the esters or essential oils which are concentrated by the use of a still. The cider is then frozen or rather the water is frozen out and the residue collected by centrifuging. Then the distilled portion is returned and the whole kept at a reasonably low temperature until wanted for use. Proper dilution brings it back to the original volume. </seg>

            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY THURSDAY, JANUARY 4 Plant Industry Bldg. — Room 108 9:15 A. M. ' MR. SHUBERT: It seems to me we have had a right good pro - gram here the last two days. I have secured a lot of Information and a lot of entertainment out of it as well. I think the numbers have been especially well given. Dr. Wiggan's elder outfit certainly appealed. to me. Since we have a minute or two to spare, I just want to tell you a little about cider. Five or six years ago we decided to have the American Legion con - vention in our little town and a group of business men from Shubert went up to Plattsmouth with the American Legion boys to arrange to have the convention down there. One of the things we told them we would do would be to furnish the boys a barrel of good cider. That was in the fall and the convention was held the next spring. Mr. Franklin made that cider. We made it late — probably in October and we took it down to Falls City and put it In cold storage. On the day of the convention the next May we sent a truck down and got this barrel of elder that had been kept In cold storage and brought it up there. It had just kept perfectly. We did the same thing another time. Mr. Franklin made a barrel of cider and I took it to Nebraska City for a WOW convention. I just mention this to show that cider making would be quite an addi - tion to our business. That Is the point I want to bring out. I was really very much Interested In the demonstration we had here yester - day. If that could just be handled in a big way, I do not see why it could not be a source of considerable profit to apple growers. We should think about this because we might use a considerable pro - portion of our second grade apples. We would have to be careful to sort out the rotten and wormy apples In order to secure a product of good quality. So much for that — but I am interested just the same and I think they will be making those filters large enough, simple enough and cheap enough so we can add that to our business. I think that is the reason we have never been able to sell elder — because it has not been clarified. i This morning we have on the program one of our men who actually goes out In the field and helps do the work. Professor Yocum is going to tell us what fungicides we should use In our spray schedule. </seg>
            <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WHAT FUNGICIDES SHALL WE USE IN OUR SPRAY SCHEDULE? W. W. YOCUM During the 1933 spray season several fungicides were tested at Shubert, for the control of apple scab. Among the materials tested were dry lime sulphur, liquid lime sulphur, apple Drltomlc Sulphur, Kopper's Flotation sulphur, Koloform, and Bordeaux mixture. In all test plats except one liquid lime sulphur was applied In the pink appli - cation. Plat No. 2, which received no pink application, was sprayed the rest of the season with liquid lime sulphur. Plat No. 3 was used for comparison with No. 2 and received liquid lime sulphur in all sprays Including the pink. All plats received liquid lime sulphur in the calyx application also, except No. 8 which received apple Dritomic sulphur. The manufacturer of this material recommended that Its use should begin with the calyx spray. We are thoroughly convinced, and I believe most research workers and experienced apple growers are also convinced, that liquid lime - sulphur is the very best fungicide available to begin the campaign against apple scab. For that reason It was used In the pink and calyx applications in practically all plats. The other fungicides tested, have more or less merit in controlling scab during the remainder of the season if the early Infections have been well controlled by liquid lime sulphur. The purpose of this test was to determine the merit of these fungi - cides for scab control in comparison with the old standard materials, liquid lime sulphur and Bordeaux mixture. Our spray plats included several varieties of apples, among them Winesap and Delicious. It was on these varieties that results were noted particularly. Effect of the materials upon foliage infection was obtained by careful examination of the leaves on certain tagged branches, before each of 3 cover sprays. Control of scab on the fruit was determined at harvest time. The data obtained from control of scab on foliage is presented first. </seg>

            <seg id="p480">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uefore discussing these results perhaps It would be well to recall what, in general, has been our recommendation for apple scab con - trol. Briefly It has been the use of liquid lime sulphur In the early sprays or before the cover sprays and then Bordeaux mixture in the cover sprays. The strength of materials and the time of the shift from lime sulphur to Bordeaux will vary with the seasons. On Table I should be noted first that infection on Delicious ran higher all season than on Winesap. Next note the effectiveness of lime sulphur In controlling early scab Infections. On Winesap foliage on May 29 infection was found on only .9% of all the leaves and on Delicious foliage 2.4%. When the pink spray was omitted the infec - tion was on 1.5% of Winesap leaves and 5.7% of Delicious leaves. After one application of Apple Drltomlc Sulphur, the calyx spray, the Infection was 3.6% and 7.6% respectively on the same date. When results were checked on June 14th just before the second cover spray, control was very good on most Winesap trees. Trees in the Apple Drltomlc block stood out with a high Infection of 11.1% in - fected .leaves. On Delicious foliage the same plat showed 25.9% In - fected leaves. The pink omitted plat. No. 2, was second high with 18.8% infection and Koppers Flotation Sulphur 3rd with 15% Infec - tion. Control In other plats was uniformly satisfactory, with Bordeaux giving the best control on the average. Before discussing the readings taken on July 14th I wish to re - mind you of the period of intense heat and bright sunshine which came about the first of July. You recall that the burning of foliage occurred on many kinds of plants and fruits. This burning was severe in these spray plats and the dropping of leaves which followed caused a marked error in the checking of spray results on July 14th. Our figures at this last reading indicate more the results from burning than from infection by scab. A special survey of all varieties in our spray plats revealed that burning was more evident on these plats receiving sul - phur sprays. The injury was most severe on the liquid lime sulphur plat but all plats sprayed with sulphur sprays showed burning, The Bordeaux plat was quite free from this type of injury to foliage. The figures on the chart show these results quite clearly. The poor showing of liquid lime sulphur on July 14th Is due there - fore, to foliage burning and not to a failure to control scab. When Bordeaux was substituted in the cover sprays the best control of scab with the least burning resulted. One other thing was noticed in our spray plats which the data on the chart do not show. In late June a diffuse type of scab infec - tion was showing on apple foliage. The usual sooty scab lesions were </seg>
            <seg id="p481">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY absent, but there was a general yellowing of the leaves, with pin point spots remaining green. These yellow leaves soon dropped to the ground. Dr. Goss examined a number of these leaves, to make sure , that the yellowing was due to scab. He found these leaves full of scab mycelium. This yellow leaf condition was general on all plats receiving sulphur Sprays. But very little yellowing occurred in the plat where Bordeaux was applied. Two applications of Bordeaux had been given at this time and it prevented or controlled this diffuse type of scab in good shape. Summary of Results on Foliage 1. Ommission of the pink spray caused a marked increase in scab infection, on Delicious especially. 2. i Liquid lime sulphur gave good control of early scab infection. It was not satisfactory in the cover sprays due to excessive burning. 3. The use of Bordeaux In the cover sprays, following lime sulphur in the earlier sprays gave the very best control of scab all season. It controlled with the ordinary type of infection and the diffuse yellow leaf type and the least burning of foliage and fruit resulted from Its use. The results of the various fungicides on control of scab on fruit were obtained at harvest time, and are presented in table II.

            <seg id="p482">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fruit infections show some of the same tendencies as did foliage infections. On Delicious fruit control was much more difficult than on Winesap. On Winesap Control was In general very good, but on Delicious fruit results from Koloform and Apple Drltomlc sulphur were most unsatisfactory. Bordeaux gave very good control on both varieties. In conclusion I would say that this study has brought us back to the place we started planning this test. The former recommendation of liquid lime sulphur In the early sprays and Bordeaux mixture in the cover sprays still seems the best fungicidal treatment for control of scab throughout the season and to keep burning at a minimum. Bor - deaux has the further advantage of being the best material known to control apple blotch and frog-eye during the summer months. Discussion Question: Where you used Bordeaux, what did you use for the first sprays? Answer: We used liquid lime sulphur. A calyx spray of liquid lime sulphur. There were two applications of liquid lime sulphur, the pink and calyx. In all plats except two. Question: Is there more of. a tendency to burn when Bordeaux is used early In the season? Answer: Yes. Bordeaux is dangerous In cool damp weather such as we are likely to have early In the season. Question: Would that be more severe than the burning you get later on with the use of liquid lime sulphur? Answer: Depends upon the season. Lime sulphur is dangerous in hot weather when the humidity is high and the leaves tender. Question: What is the objection to the use of Bordeaux in the summer and late summer months? Answer: There Is no objection In fact It Is much safer to use then than is lime sulphur or even wettable sulphur. Question: Does not some Bordeaux mixture injure the foliage from moist weather? Answer: In most of our Nebraska summers we have very little continued wet weather; very few days in succession when there is high humidity, but if the leaves are kept wet you do get russeting on your fruit. That may occur, although I think It is less apt to occur in Ne - braska than in most other scab sections. </seg>
            <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY MR. SHUBERT: After all we hear, the surprising thing is we come back to the program we have had laid out for the last few years. I, for one, have been a little reluctant to take up with new ideas. Just a little bit old-fashioned. But after all we do find out a lot of new things and I am glad of that. I never lose an opportunity to hear of them and 1 want to take this opportunity to say we appreciate the [work the department has done. I certainly hope they will continue with their spray work. They find out a lot of things, you know. Some of us older growers don't take up with new methods and materials. We have to be shown. This is one way that we can learn about them. Our next number is one by Dr. R. W. Goss of the Pathology De - partment here at the Agricultural College. Dr. Goss has been work - ing with Mr. Yocum and Mr. Hoppert on the control of cherry leaf spot at Nebraska City. I am informed that this disease is one of the worst pests with which cherry growers have to deal. I am sure we will hear something of real value in this talk. Dr. Goss. FIVE YEARS' SPRAYING TESTS FDR THE CONTROL OF CHERRY LEAF-SPOT R. W. GOSS Introduction The disease known as cherry leaf-spot, yellow leaf, or shot-hole, caused by the fungus Coccomyces hiemalis Higgins, has been present in Nebraska for more than 30 years. It was known as early as 1903 to cause severe losses in nurseries but its importance in the commercial orchards of this state was not fully recognized until the last decade, during which time there has been a great increase in the acreage of cherry orchards in southeastern Nebraska, particularly in the Nebraska I City area. The severe defoliation that often occurs early In the season with the resultant weakening of the trees and reduction ot the crop the following year has resulted in many Inquiries regarding the best spray procedure to employ for its control under Nebraska conditions. The present report is based upon a series of spray experiments in which the materials, time of application, and number of applications have been tested during five years, 1929 to 1933, in a commercial cherry orchard at Nebraska City. 1 . * This work was a co-operative project between the Departments of Plant Pathology and Horticulture of the University of Nebraska. The sprays were applied under the direction of E. H. Hoppert and W. W. Yocum of the Department of Horticulture, while the records of Infection and defoliation were obtained under the direction of the author. The orchard used in these tests was provided through the courtesy of the Otoe Food Products Company of Nebraska City.

            <seg id="p485">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Early Richmond and the other Montmorency. In most years the spray tests were duplicated on each variety, as the Montmorency is more susceptible to the disease than the Early Richmond. There was considerable difference in the percentage of Infection on the two varieties, but the effect of spraying was relatively the same on both and for brevity the results presented here are the average of both varieties. In 1929 and 1930 one row of 35 trees containing both varieties was left unsprayed as a check through the center of the orchard. During the next three years the controls consisted of two trees in each spray block which were protected by canvas at the time the others were sprayed. This allowed for a good distribution of control trees throughout the orchard. The amount of infection was determined each year by a count of infected leaves on two marked branches of each of four representative trees in each spray block for each variety and likewise on the control trees. In this manner the changes in amounts of infection at different times throughout the season could be accurately recorded by making C to 8 readings, each one involving 500 to 5,000 counts for each spray block. Even with this procedure the amount of infection at all times after the first reading was actually higher than the figures presented In the following tables, because of the dropping of Infected leaves and the production of now leaves. Such recorded percentages of Infection therefore fail to indicate the number of leaves previously infected and dropped. Attempts to determine the actual amount of defoliation were similarly complicated by the increase in new leaves produced during the summer. In some years, as in 1929, the grsatest number of leaves on the tagged branches at any one reading was arbitrarily considered as 100 per cent and the percentage of defoliation on this basis was thus much less than the actual amount of leaf drop. In oilier years a system of marking the Individual leaves on some of the tagged branches was used. This gave a more accurate result but was a rather laborious method of determining defoliation and was dis - continued in 1932. By recording the relative number of infections per leaf during a three-year period It was found that there was no correlation between the number of spots per leaf and the extent of yellowing and defoliation. Leaves with only one spot often turned yellow, while sometimes 25 or more spots were recorded on leaves that remained green. Like - wise, no definite correlation was established between shot-hole effect and yellowing and defoliation, although the tendency was for such shot-hole leaves to remain green. Relation of Rainfall to Infection The daily rainfall for each season and the percentage of Infection </seg>
            <seg id="p486">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE on the unsprayed trees are presented in Figure 1. In general, the disease in each year of the five-year period was of the following order of decreasing severity 1929, 1932, 1930, 1933, and 1931. In. 1929, the season of highest rainfall (23.25 Inches for the four months), the amount of defoliation was so great that the number of leaves left on the tree after July 3 was too small to make accurate records of infection. On July 27 only 8 per cent of the number of leaves present on June 4 remained on the tree and of course many new leaves had formed and must have likewise become infected and dropped during this period. In 1930 and 1933, the years of lowest rainfall for the four months, 13.50 and 13.67 inches, the amount of Infection and defoliation was relatively slight. In 1932, with 17.21 inches of rain, infection was severe but yellowing and defoliation were not as great as in 1929. While the results for these four years check very well with the relative amount of rainfall, the same cannot be said of -1931. In this year the rainfall was about the same as in 1932 (18.64 inches), but the amount of Infection was the least of any of the five years in spite of the fact that conditions for early infection in May were about the same as In the severe year of 1929. The amount of infection on May 19 was 22 per cent, but after this date the disease did not spread and by July 14 only 15 per cent of the leaves showed infection. It will be noted that in general the most rapid increase in the disease occurred during May and early June and that with a rise in temperature during late June and thereafter the disease did not develop as rapidly. It Is also true that the temperature for June In 1931 was the highest of any of the five years and It is possible that this had an effect upon the failure of the disease to develop in that year. It is evident that some combination of environmental factors held the disease in check during this period, probably by preventing the development of spores In the early-Infected leaves, but it is not possible to determine the exact cause from the available data. Results of the Spray Tests 1020. Examination of infected leaves on the ground showed that mature spores were ready to be disseminated about May 9th. The weather conditions during the month were ideal for the spread of the disease and as a result the leaves of the unsprayed trees were 62 per cent infected by June 4 and defoliation was evident by June 12. Unfortunately the spray tests were not started early enough this first year, the petal-fall spray being omitted on all plots. As a result of the omission of this first spray all of the trees became heavily infected and with the favorable weather conditions for the spread of the disease throughout the summer this tended to obscure any dif - ferences resulting from the different spray schedules. </seg>
            <seg id="p487">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Dry lime-sulphur was used for all the sprays and the results are presented in Table 1. The application of only one spray on June 19 resulted In almost as much Infection as in the checks and while that one spray checked the spread of the disease for a short time the large amount of initial infection and the omission of the last spray caused the most severe defoliation of any of the sprayed blocks. The applica - tion of two sprays still further reduced the amount of infection and defoliation, while the least Infection occurred with three sprays. These, however, were insufficient to check the spread of the infection resulting from the omission of the petal-fall spray. 1030. The tests were designed to determine the relative effective - ness of dry and liquid lime-sulphur and of the application of Bordeaux or Oxy-Bordeaux for the fourth spray after harvest as well as the effect of the ommission of each one of the four sprays. The conditions for infection during May and June were much the same as in 1929 but the low rainfall and high temperatures of July caused a natural check In the spread of the disease that Is evident in the reading of July 29 In Table 2 and Figure 1. Conditions were more favorable for the disease during August, and the final readings show the amount of Infection In each block to be proportional to the infection present before the disease was checked In July. The amount of early infection was much less than in 1929, and while there was considerably more infection on the unsprayed checks throughout the summer there were no significant differences in infection due to the omission of any one spray. Likewise, there were no significant differences due to the kind of spray applied, although it is possible that such differences might have occurred if the conditions had been more favorable for the spread of the disease. 1031. Less infection occurred in 1931 than in any of the other five years but there was considerable difference in the amount of infection on the checks and those sprayed four times. This difference was evident both in the number of infected leaves and in the severity of infection. Conditions were unfavorable for spread during July and August and the percentage of infection remained about the same throughout the summer months with an increased amount in September. Lime-sulphur was applied In all sprays and the effect of omitting the first and fourth spray Is evident in the data presented in Table 3. The effect of the last spray was very noticeable on August 10. 1032. The disease was more severe in 1932 than in any other year except 1929. It spread throughout the summer, and there was a marked difference in the sprayed and unsprayed trees as shown in Table 4 B, as regards both amount and severity of infection and de - foliation as determined by counts of marked leaves. </seg>
            <seg id="p488">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The effect of omitting the first and fourth sprays of lime-sulphur was again tested as in 1931. The application of the first spray was found to be more important than in the previous year, as the block in which it was omitted had a much higher percentage of infection as shown in Table 4 A. The application of the second spray to these trees checked the further development of the disease so that by June 22 the amount of infection was no higher than in those blocks that had received the first spray. There was very little If any effect in this year from the omission of the fourth spray. 1033. The effect of an additional spray after harvest was tested In 1933. Either lime-sulphur or Bordeaux was used for the last two sprays and lime-sulphur for the first three. The effect of omitting either the first spray or the fifth is shown in Table 5. The tagged branches selected for the records in this year were composed chiefly of older branches toward the center of the tree and these did not produce many new leaves. In addition to these branches, counts were made of 100 leaves on each tree selected at random from the current season's growth on the outer branches. In general these new leaves showed considerably more infection than the older, mature leaves, because of their position on the tree or else their greater susceptibility. • -..': '■'•'■'. j The omission of either the first or the fifth spray resulted In Increased infection. In addition to the data| in Table 5, it was found that where all five sprays were applied the amount of infection averaged only about one-half of that occurring on the corresponding unsprayed checks, while with the omission of both the first and the fifth spray the infection averaged over 90 per cent of that of the checks. It was evident that these two sprays were important, the first spray reducing the amount of earltf infection and thus the secondary spread from these leaves, and the last spray: checking the late-season development that often causes severe defoliation in early August. Root-sprouts as a Source of Infection During the 1932 season it was observed that one portion of the Early Richmond block of trees showed more infection than the more susceptible Montmorency. This was found to be due to the very severe infection of the leaves on root-sprouts that had developed In this uncultivated portion of the orchard. These sprouts, being only 2 to 3 feet high, were closer to the source of primary infection, the old Infected leaves on the ground from the previous year, and with the higher atmospheric moisture present they had become severly infected early in the season. Practically every spot on these leaves produced an abundance of spores, resulting in a high percentage of infected leaves on the trees above them. These sprouts thus served as an intermediate step between the organism overwintering in the leaves on the ground and the young leaves of the tree. </seg>
            <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY It was also noted that the Infected leaves on the root-sprouts always produced an abundance of spores and that the leaves turned yellow and dropped, as contrasted with an absence of spores often joccurring on the spots on the leaves of the tree. The lack of spores ;productlon was often associated with the cutting out of the Infected spot, thus resulting in a shot-hole effect rather than defoliation. The abundant production of spores on the root-sprouts was probably influenced either by the higher moisture conditions closer to the ground or by the more rapidly developing tissue of these succulent sprouts or perhaps by both factors. The importance of either removing or thoroughly spraying all such sprouts In an orchard can hardly be overemphasized, as the neglect of this source of infection can greatly reduce the value of any spray program. Discussion In each of the five years It was found that the full spray schedule resulted In a great decrease In Infection. A comparison of the sprayed with the unsprayed trees, made by averaging the percentages bf infection for all readings, gives the following results: 1929, 79 per cent; 1930, 55 per cent; 1931, 55 per cent; 1932, 23 per cent; 1933, 40 per cent. It was thus evident that spraying would reduce infection at least by half, and In a year favorable for Infection like 1932, It was reduced three-fourths. In 1929 the first spray was omitted and as a result the amount of Infection was so great early In the season that the application of three later sprays only reduced It 3ne-fifth as compared with the checks. While the beneficial effect of a full spray schedule was evident Bvery year, the effect of the omission of any one spray was not always discernible. Increase in infection due to the omission of the first spray was evident in three of the five years, of the second spray In the one year tested, of the fourth spray In two of the four years tested, and of the fifth spray in 1933, the only year five sprays were iipplied. For some unknown reason the result of omitting any one ppray was not evident in 1930, although only half as much Infection occurred with four sprays as on the checks. The amount of infection due to the omission of any single spray would depend, of course, on the weather conditions during the period when the leaves are un - protected and upon the amount of infection present earlier in the season. These factors, which vary from year to year, make it im - possible to determine the financial benefits due to each Individual spray over a short period of years. j In general we may conclude that In most years four sprays are advisable. While the fifth spray reduces the amount of late-season defoliation, this is not so important as the earlier defoliation due to early-season infection. The advisability of applying this additional ispray may be questioned in seasons of light infection. In these tests commercial lime-sulphur, 1-40, was usually applied. </seg>
            <seg id="p490">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the few comparisons with other spray materials no great difference was observable with dry lime-sulphur or the use of Oxy-Bordeaux or standard Bordeaux applied after harvest. Some injury resulted in 1930 from the use of Bordeaux, but no injury occurred in 1933 with Instant Bordeaux. Other states have reported good results in con - trolling leaf-spot with Bordeaux but a reduction in the size of fruit has often resulted. Michigan reports reduction in weight as high as 25 per cent in extreme cases, while in Wisconsin the results have varied greatly in different orchards and years. Wisconsin also reports that three sprays of Bordeaux will control the disease as well as four of lime-sulphur, probably because of the greater adhesiveness of the spray. Our data for comparisons of fruit weight have not been com - piled as yet. The convenience of the new instant Bordeaux, combined with Its great fungicidal powers, warrants further tests of this spray In comparison with liquid lime-sulphur. Summary The spray tests for the control of cherry leaf-spot reported in this paper were conducted in a commercial cherry orchard of the Early Richmond and Montmorency varieties at Nebraska City during the five-year period 1929-1933. The tests were made to determine the effect of the materials, time and number of applications, and the relation of weather conditions to the development of the disease. The disease was most severe in 1929, when 62 per cent of the leaves of the unsprayed trees were Infected by June 4. Defoliation was evident by June 12 and 92 per cent of the leaves had dropped by July 27. The other years were of the following order of decreasing severity 1932, 1930, 1933, 1931. In general, the severity of the disease was correlated with seasons of high rainfall with the exception of 1931, when the spread of the disease was checked by some other undetermined factor. The application of at least four sprays was found to be advisable in the average year and of these the first spray was the most im - portant. The effect of any one spray was dependent upon the existing weather conditions and the amount of Infection present earlier In the season. No consistent differences were noted in the comparative results obtained with dry or liquid lime-sulphur or by the use of Bordeaux for the fourth or fifth spray. No correlation was evident between the number of Infections per leaf and defoliation. There was great variation in the production of spores in the diseased spots on the leaves. The spraying or removing of all root-sprouts was found to be an Important factor In controlling the early-season spread of the disease. </seg>

            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Discussion . " Question: After the foliage drops off, is there anything strong enough to kill the disease on the ground? .... Answer: A few tests of that type have been conducted in our own orchard on cherry leaf spot. They have not been found as ef - fective as you might suppose. Apparently the organism will continue to develop on the leaf. One spray application simply does not control it. Question: Could you use anything strong enough to burn the spots out? Answer: I doubt If you could. You need very little Infection to start with and it spreads very rapidly afterwards when warm moist conditions prevail. We have found 1,000 spores on a leaf following ideal conditions for spore discharge and dissemination. MR. SHUBERT: I am sure we have all been Interested In the talk given by Dr. Goss. He has a good message. We have about 30 minutes left. You remember the good talk we had by H. L. Lobensteln, of Manhattan, yesterday. He told us what problems they had with the codling moth in his section of the country. We thought we had troubles enough of our own but from the report he gave us, he certainly ought to be in a position to tell us what to do because they are so much worse off than we are that there isn't very much comparison. We are going to listen to Mr Lobenstein again this morning. He is going to tell us what part orchard sanitation has in the control of the codling moth. Orchard Sanitation Has A Part In Codling Moth Control MR. LOBENSTEIN: Yesterday I mentioned the supplementary measures which we were intending to use in Kansas this coming season for the control of the codling moth and they of course are quite similar to those you growers and growers in other parts of the country will be using. We do not believe that we can secure control of the worms next year in those orchards in our state which had a very heavy infestation the past year unless supplementary measures, are used. We cannot get control of the worms by spraying alone. I believe in north east Kansas, in fact in the upper Missouri river valley, the worms have become more or less seasonal. For two or three years following favorable conditions for worm development the infestation will be very heavy and when these conditions become more unfavorable to the over-wintering of worms the population will go down. I think it is possible that in northeast Kansas we may, in several years, expect to get back to a very good control that most of the fruit growers were hoping to get just by spraying alone. </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In selecting a program of orchard clean up much will depend upon the age of the orchard and upon the severity of the infestation. An orchard that is 15 to 20 years old, where the trees are just beginning to scale and where there is little dead wood and few old prunnlng wounds offer a much simpler problem than some of these 40 year old orchards where the scaly bark extends 15 to 20 feet up into the tree where there are 20 to 30 large wounds that have not healed over and in - numerable small dead twigs and stubs that offer a satisfactory hiding place for worms. Furthermore there is usually more or less sod In the older orchards and in the sod are hidden old prunings and hard stemmed weeds which may serve as hiding places for those worms that crawl out of fallen apples. You may say It Is too expensive to go over an orchard with a fine toothed comb. To be sure it is ex - pensive but so Is spraying. Some of our growers have covered their orchards 12 to 16 times and then their crop shows 40 to 50 per cent worms. It is my opinion, it is the opinion of the other members of our department and also some of the leading orchardlsts, that growers can afford and In fact they must do some of these things if they are to stay in the orchard business. First, we are going to Insist on scraping and then banding, especially In the Arkansas valley. Last year we had a wide spread experience with the use of chemically treated bands — not only in the experimental blocks but In the orchards of many growers as well. In addition to the chemically treated bands, scraping was used by several of the leading growers in Doniphan county and several In Leavenworth county, so we feel It is a practice that Is beyond the experimental stage and is an adopted orchard practice. There is some - thing about the use of chemically treated bands we want to study a little bit further, as I mentioned yesterday. In the first place we feel that in the older orchards we must do a thorough job of scraping and the thoroughness of scraping cannot be over-estimated. It can not be stressed too much. It is our ex - perience that banding without scraping is of little benefit, because the scraping destroys a large percentage of over-wintering worms; further - more when the scaly bark Is removed the worms move down the trunk searching for a hiding place. Finally they come to the bands and spin their cocoons under them. We must remove practically all the loose bark. I might mention the experiences of one man in northeastern Kansas. About three years ago a crew of 4 men scraped 45 year old Jonathans' in excellent production. They averaged three trees in a half day so the scraping itself can be quite a problem. The cost of the scraping varies a great deal with the age and variety of the tree and to some extent with the soil it is growing upon. Trees in Northeastern Kansas have more trunk to them than they do in the Arkansas Valley. The trees In the Arkansas Valley seem to branch and spread lower. The </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY younger trees are much easier to scrape. We have many orchards in which a man can scrape 20 to 30 trees a day. Another thing we strongly Insist upon when this scraping is being done is that all loose bark be destroyed. We use a tarpaulin of pretty fair size, spread around the tree and extending far enough out so as to catch the bark which contains most of the worms and larvae on the tree. Collect it and either remove It from the orchard and destroy it or else burn It In the orchard. Scraping and letting It He on the ground is. "love's labor lost". Most of our men are making their own scrapers. We have several types. One that Is most widely used is patterned after the old - fashioned block scraper — a triangular piece of steel on a short handle. It makes a very good scraper. Another one that works Is an old hoe, cut down to form the shape of a triangle. That will make a pretty good scraper. Of course we are going to use our chemically treated bands and we have used burlap bands in some parts of the state, for as much as 10 years, with generally satisfactory results. We find the cost of the burlap bands throughout the season is more than the cost of the chemically treated bands. The Initial cost of the chemically treated bands is more but the burlap bands to be efficient must be changed every week or 10 days. We must destroy the larvae that have been caught if wo are to get results from this type of band. So we can not see anything but chemically treated bands. On smooth bark trees we are insisting on treated bands also. The next sanitary measure we are going to follow this year is general orchard clean-up. It Is not a new practice. However it is one that a great many growers have lost sight of. I am fully con - fident that our heavy Infestation in northeastern Kansas at the present time is due to the tremendous number of drops left on the ground two years ago from a crop that was particularly wormy. And then on top of that, a great many growers have had apples in very bad condition at market time, with a great many culls to - dispose of. In some cases these culls were left in the orchard for 4 to 8 weeks before being sold. I remember clearly seeing one particular hole containing 5,000 bushels right out In the middle of the orchard. Naturally they had a great many worms the next season and this year. So, next fall we are going to Insist upon cleaning up the orchard, clean-up of culls and all the drops. Many of our orchard men who can afford to do so are going to pick up their drops as they fall during the summer months. The man In our state who is getting the most successful control of the codling moth right now is the man who practices every one of these things. This man kept a crew of 2 or 3 busy throughout the summer season, picking up the drop apples, destroying them and doing a thorough job of scraping and so forth. We must pick those drops up more </seg>
            <seg id="p498">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or less as they fall in order that they may be removed from the orchard and destroyed before the larvae have become full grown and emerged. This applies particularly to the first brood. We are going to practice clean-up in the orchard in the fall Immediately after packing time. Thinning is becoming an established practice in more orchards and I hope next year if we have a good crop, many more orchard men will turn towards thinning. At thinning time we can remove a great many wormy apples. I was surprised in looking over several orchards In which thinning has been practiced to see how many wormy fruits were contained in the fruit the thinners removed. Naturally it is necessary that the thinners use picking sacks into which the wormy fruit Is placed. No good will come of thinning as a worm control measure if the wormy fruit is left in the orchard. Then we will learn and practice packing house sanitation which is probably the most neglected part of our codling moth campaign. I know of perhaps twelve packing houses that are properly constructed to prevent the escape of moths. I told yesterday of the basket of apples that sat in the packing shed for 3 days and the men found that 50 larvae had spun cocoons in the lid of that one basket of apples. Fre - quently I have found the bottoms of boxes In those sheds entirely cov - ered and the codling moth ready to over-winter in those boxes. We are trying to do this, first of all — in any new sheds that are to be con - structed, insist they be constructed tight enough, with all openings screened, or fitted with tight windows, to prevent the escape of the moths next season. We will have codling moth traps placed In the tops of all those sheds. We are trying to get some of the old sheds equipped with those traps. They are very simple affairs, made just about like you would make a fly trap. We use a fine mesh screen wire and build a cage that we set in an opening at the top something like this. (Illustrated on blackboard). I have seen cages in the Arkansas Valley In the top of packing sheds with so many codling moths In the top of the cage you could not see through the screen. Each pair of these moths can be credited with 50 to 100 eggs laid in the orchard with the possibility of perhaps half of them entering apples. Scraping and banding would have no effect on them. You can see why the apples around the old fashioned type of packing house are much wormier than those farther away. If the shed is an old barn that can not be made moth tight, we should take the picking crates, barrels and baskets and store them in separate buildings that can be kept tight. Store them in some ware - house or any tight building that can be screened, or store them In the open unmeshed so the sparrows can clean them out. You should see the bunches of sparrows around such a collection of crates. </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY There Is still another practice in northeast Kansas that has some value. That is the practice of orchard burning. You may be familiar with the burning work conducted by the branch experimental station there. The United States Department of Agriculture gave some as - sistance last year. Their problem was the control of apple curculio. I have no right to report on that. I know the station Is not ready to report on it but we do know that last year they secured very satisfactory and very promising results through the use of a burning machine simi - lar to the corn borer burner used in the east. Likewise we got con - trol of both scab and frog eye. We know this — that a good grower in Doniphan county, who knew how to use this running fire, has less dif - ficulty with both scab and frog eye. So we say, if a man Is to use run - ning fire It will give him some adequate control, not so much of the codling moth, but ot fungus diseases. I would not know what to do with those wormy apples. I am not sure that dumping them In the river Is the proper thing to do but we ought to destroy those wormy apples in some way. In your section of Nebraska, removal of those apples to a distance from the orchard and far enough away from any one else's orchard, might solve the prob - lem. But with us, it is a problem which has not been answered. I hope we will work out a satisfactory way to process cull apples, thus making some good use ot the culls and at the same time destroying the worms in them. Discussion Question: Can you plow them under deep enough to keep the worms from emerging? Answer: I am not entomologist enough to know. I do not know just how far you would have to put the codling moth under ground to destroy It. Question: Would poultry clean up those apples? How about feeding them to hogs? Answer: You can do that. It seems to me such a practice would be better than dumping them in the river. Question: What about running them through a mill? Answer: That can be done and it is effective, too. I know several growers who did that this year. Comment: We just turned the hogs in — 100 head of hogs. MR. LOBENSTEIN: Several growers in the Arkansas Valley sec - tion are going to use hogs next year; used them this year to clean </seg>
            <seg id="p500">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE up the first brood drops. Hogs certainly would keep the drops cleaned up but the hogs present some problems too. They must be kept abso - lutely free from lice — It not, they will be rubbing on the trees most of the time. We found If they are allowed to have wallows in the orchard, they will rub the surrounding trees pretty badly. We are not recommending that practice but a few growers are using it successfully In the cleanup of drop apples. Comment: You can prevent lice and If you allow the hogs other range besides. It is very seldom they rub the trees. Question: How far will these moths travel? Answer: Recent work by the entomologists in some sections of the country have indicated that normally they will travel but a very short distance. They are weak fiyers. But I have seen recently where some have gone as far as a quarter to a half mile when there were no apple trees near-by. On the whole, every man may consider the cod - ling moth as his own problem. Remember, if you once get infestation, you have a battle on your hands for years. There is an orchard of 4 5 year old trees that 10 years ago, through lax spraying built up a very high worm population and it took them eight years to get back to the normal control they had been getting. So, If you had a heavy worm Infestation on your hands this past fall, by all means get busy on them now. MR. SHUBERT: Nobody told any stories. So I am going to tell one. Last night Mrs. Shubert and I were having our dinner in the hotel and one of the ladies that has been on duty around the hotel, came to us and said she believed she would tell us a story but would wait until we were through eating. Then she told us this story after we had finished our dinner. She said a man came in the hotel for his breakfast, ordered some honey with his cakes. He found a hair in the honey, which naturally upset him. The more he thought about it, the more angry he became and finally he called for the waiter and wanted to know why it was a hotel of that class would have a hair in the honey. She explained that nothing like that had ever happened before and they would be very careful in the future. He dropped back in the evening for dinner. He had finished his dinner and called for apple sauce for dessert. He found a hair in the apple sauce. He was so indignant he insisted the waiter have the manager come over. They both explained about the hair in the honey. Of course, they could see how that might be. There might have been </seg>
            <seg id="p501">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY . a hair in the honey because of the comb. Then the manager said, "However I don't see how there could be a hair in the apple sauce because we didn't use anything but Baldwins." Now, do you know that I haven't been able to find any Nebraska apples on the menu In this hotel, but they have listed Rome Beauties from Iowa. Every opportunity we get we ought to insist that people In our state use Nebraska apples. If they had Nebraska Jonathans on the menu it would read much better to Nebraska people. We have just a very few minutes left. If any one has anything he would like to say, we would be glad to hear him at this time, or I had thought it would be a good idea to have a little round table. Discussion Question: What do you do with the apples that have rotten places on them in making cider? Do you cut them out? Answer: If you are going to make first rate elder, you have to use sound apples. I think one difficulty we are likely to meet up with is that we want to use up the apples that are worthless for anything else. That would be a mistake. We want to use good stuff for good elder. A wormy apple Is generally a rotten apple. Small green apples do not make good cider. If we can use a good press and spend possibly 5c a gallon clarifying the cider and then sell it for 30c to 40c a gallon without the container, It will be profitable. Meeting adjourned shortly before 12 o'clock. </seg>

            <seg id="p506">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SHEEP PROGRAM Tuesday Forenoon Animal Husbandry Hall W. W. Derrick, Presiding. SELECTING BREEDING STOCK, BLOCKING AND SHOWING (Four-H Clubs Attention) M. A. Alexander, William Esry and W. W. Derrick College of Agriculture A class of breeding sheep was brought into the judging pavilion and M. A. Alexander gave some pointers in the selection of animals for a farm flock, illustrating with the class of animals before the meeting. He recommended a low set, compact, blocky type of animal, show - ing a good constitution in a strong back, wide deep chest with deep round and twist and a wide loin and back, evidence of meat producing, ability. A start with a small flock of rangy western ewes, however, can be developed Into a desirable farm flock of the right type by a couple of crosses with the right type of rams, and enables the produc - tion of good feeding lambs of the right mutton type to be profitable. He stressed that rams and ewes alike should be selected with care, and that good weight of bone and straight legs and strong straight feet were essential. Mr. Derrick emphasized the selection of foundation stock with care and time after pointing out that a good farm flock, that will produce a. load or portion of a load of marketable lambs each year, will be found profitable In the utilization of both forage and grains on the average Nebraska farm. A warning to give attention to the quality and the character of the wool, especially in the rams selected for breeding the flock. A fleece free from excessive black fibers and black spots In the wool should be selected as a major characteristic in breeding a flock, a large part of income from which will be the wool. A fleece, compact in texture, medium fine wool and showing sufficient oil, with the proper color of the skin should be looked for. The flock &lt; should not be permitted to run Into stacks and other places where their fleeces will become filled with dirt and other foreign matter that would detract from the grading quality of the wool, if a good price for the annual wool yield is expected. William Esry, shepherd at the college, demonstrated methods of trimming and blocking lambs for showing, particularly in four-H club shows. The expertness of Mr. Esry soon resulted In a transformed </seg>
            <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION appearance of the lambs upon which he worked, which had not Deen trimmed before. He demonstrated the methods of trimming to give the lambs a blocky low set appearance, showing a wide back deep twist and full legs, and proceeded to illustrate the methods of carding and blocking the fleece to produce a finish effect, desirable for the show ring appearance of the animals. LAMBS IN THE CORNFIELD JOHN RANDALL of Bennet Mr. Randall, a Lancaster county farmer, told the gathering that if they gave lambs a chance, it seemed to him that that they would turn a lot of waste feed Into profit, In a brief relation of his experience in feeding lambs in cornfields. Mr. Randall has had remarkable success with running lambs In cornfields and maintains that they utilize the lower leaves on the stalks, weeds and other growths for feed that would otherwise be wasted In the cornfield were It not cleaned up by the lambs. In the fall of 1933, he turned a carload of lambs Into a thirty acre cornfield about the time the grain began to glaze, he reported. Some care must be taken in getting the lambs accustomed to the new feed, he said, recommending that the change be made gradually. Bundle oats and prairie hay were fed In a lot each night to the lambs, during the feeding period. The lambs ate very little of the corn grain, but knocked many ears off the stalks onto the ground, he said. To utilize the fallen corn, he turned a drove of hogs into the field at the same time. In return, he said, he received about 5000 pounds of pork, 5,865 pounds of lamb, both live weight and later picked twenty bushels of corn per acre from the field. Summing up his returns from the thirty acre field of corn, he gave figures showing that he received $180.00 from his corn; $150.00 from his hogs and $350.00 from his Iambs. EWES AND LAMBS ED JANICKE, David City His experience In runing a farm flock in the production ot early spring or hot house lambs, were recounted briefly by Ed Janicke. He raises lambs for the Easter lamb market, having them drop in De - cember. His ewes receive little grain during the summer. They are flushed just before breeding time and get a light ration of grain from then on until the Iambs drop. After lambing the grain ration of the ewes is increased to provide a good flow of milk, as a means of getting quick growth and early finish on the lambs. Sixty per cent of his lamb crop has been marketed two weeks before Easter each year, returning a $2.00 per cwt. premium over the regular market. </seg>
            <seg id="p508">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "The ewe and lamb flock has returned more per dollar invested than any other class of livestock on the farm. One of the Important values of the farm flock is their use for cleaning up fence rows, waste land and utilizing waste feed. The production of Easter of hot ; house lambs j.jis netted me from $1 to $2 per cwt. above the regular market price. ..... Lamb feeders and sheep growers have been able to show a profit from 1933 operations A flock of thirty to forty ewes is an important asset to the average eastern Nebraska farm," Mr. Janicke said. SHEEP VS. THE GOLDEN HOOF W. MARSHALL ROSS, Gibbon "From away back over 2000 years ago sheep have been the susten - ance and clothing of man. No matter what ancient history we read we find where sheep and wool played an active part in the activities of man at the time. Abraham in the lands of Cannaan watched over and tended his flocks, using them for food and clothing for his tribe, and in all ancient history they have been called the golden hoof. For food, clothing, and fertility no other animal can surpass them; grazing rough feeds or fine feeds very close, getting a bite here and there where any other animal would fail to find feed at all; eating about 352 kinds of weeds against about 5 7 kinds that cattle eat; enduring adverse conditions for food and cold or heat with a wonder - ful tenacity, and it has been said that they can stand adversity better than too much prosperity in the direction of food. However, we have learned In this last major depression that sheep have filled their mission on the farm to a greater degree of satisfaction, and monetory value than any of our domestic animals. Even at the very lowest ebb In our farm tide of depression and adversities, the old ewe with her lamb and wool paid a small dividend and that Is more than can be said of the Dairy cow or the celebrated mortgage lifter, the hog. The Ewe with her great capacity to utilize rough feed with a very small amount of grain manufactured into edible leg of lamb and wool for clothing, a great deal of material that would otherwise have gone to waste on the midwest farms. The hog with his gluttonous capacity for grain, tankage, and so forth, has actually been a liability for the last four years. The Dairy cow has given a better account of herself, but where she has had only a cream or butter market for her products, she has not been able to keep her balance out of the red at all times, where strict account of her maintenance and labor charges have been kept. The old ewe as usual has been the first to re-act against the de - pression. Man can go without new clothes when necessary and usually </seg>
            <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION economizes first on his wardrobe, but there comes a time when it must be replenished, as in these modern days It Is not proper to go naked or semi-naked especially for the male of the specie. Early last April wool began to show a little strength In price and by the early part of June, It had more than doubled In price. Manufacturing Renewed. Mills were taking on an unusual activity. Surpluses that had been accumulated In 1931 and 32 were, or had been, used up. and at this time the National Wool Marketing Corporation found that it was rapidly being absolved of Its very burdensome surplus and over - hang from former years, and with about 42 millions pounds of wool consigned by its 28 regional association for 1933 it found itself by December 12 of 1933, in the possession of only about 11 million pounds of wool which even now is being rapidly reduced. For the last four years of wool marketing we have had no protection of our 3 4 cents per clean pound of tariff due to the surpluses held in the United States. j Now we are at a point where if the mill' owner! has to import wool he will be obliged to pay us the amount of the tariff or 17 cents per lb. on 50% shrinking wool plus the foreign price, brokerage, ocean freights, etc., which brings these medium grades of wool up to around 30 to 32 cents net at Boston. In importing foreign wool of the same grade and shrink, a mill owner can pay about 10% more because of the fact that the fleeces are skirted or the belly, legs and heads are taken off leaving the main body of the fleece only. This saves considerable waste and makes it more desirable by at least 10%. Has there been any advantage in Cooperative Marketing of Wool We are ending our fourth year of cooperative wool marketing. In •31 and '3 2 our advance was just about the same as the dealer was paying. We had to sell this wool on a declining market but at that came back and paid a few cents dividend each year, which was more than the dealer did that bought the wool outright. But what a different story in 1933. In March and April some of our members took an advance of 7 to 9 cents per pound. By the middle of April there was some better sales In Boston. Dealers began to raise their bids, and because of sales having to be made, and Bankers interviewed before the national could set our advance to within 75% of the net market price in Boston, we were necessarily several days later getting out our advances. This, together with the fact that growers thought these prices just temporary and something to be </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE grabbed at once, caused a good many members to sell their wool to dealers and away from their own association. A great many sold out for from 6 to 15 cents per pound. Those who consigned earlier in the season to the midwest at low advances were later brought up to the full advance of 18 and 20 cents on top wool and checks sent out to them. Thus demonstrating the value of cooperation, our 1933 wool was practically sold at the high levels. Consequently we have been able to make an early and desirable settlement. Some of the very fine heavy clothing sold as low as 19 3/10 cents up to as high as 31 1/2 cents net on clear medium light wools, with the majority of Nebraska wools running from 25 to 30 cents. Prices as high as these were paid in a very few instances by deal - ers but If you will take the average from March until June,, I believe you will find that the member, marketing his wool cooperatively, got several cents above that one selling outside. A very good illustration of this was a small dealer who solicited members to market their wool cooperatively but if they did not de - sire to do so he bought their wool and marketed it through the asso - ciation himself. We gave him a check for $2500 profit or final settle - ment which could just as well have gone to the growers in that vicinity. The fact that the co-op was In the field caused dealers to pay better prices to begin with, thus making the co-op a benefit to all wool growers. Over $232,000 for 3.721,000 pounds were distributed to our mem - bers this year, putting that much more money back among the farmers where it belonged, rather than to a bunch of dealers and speculators In Boston Outlook for 1034 The outlook for 1934 is bright. We believe we are going to have a good steady demand for wool at steady prices. We do not look for any sensational prices and believe that wool should be marketed through the Midwest because you will be eligible to the average price paid through the consuming season of September, October, und No - vember, which, as a rule, is the height of the season. Our members consigning their wool at the very low time in Febru - ary and March, 1933, received as much for the same grade of wool as the member marketing at the high time in August. One of the facts to remember Is that the wool buyer would not be paying any more on an average than the Midwest advances if it were not for the competitive influence of the Midwest.

            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION EARLY AND LATE LAMB PRODUCTION M. A. ALEXANDER and A. D. WEBER* The early lamb production data of this report are averages for two years, 1930-31 and 1931-32. The data for the late lambs are for one year. The lot designated "4" represents work conducted In the year 1930-31, while the lots designated 5, 6, and 7 represent work conducted in the year 1931-32. The objects of the experiment were (1) to study the advisability of feeding grain to western ewes that are to produce early spring lambs, (2) to study methods of producing late lambs from western ewes, and (3) to compare early lambs to late lambs. Animals Used Western white-face ewes that were too old for the range but good enough to produce one crop of lambs under favorable farm conditions were purchased on the Omaha market. The ewes for the early lamb production study were bred to Hampshire rams the first of September. The ewes for late lamb production were bred to the same rams the first of November. There were 50 ewes to the lot the first year and 33 ewes the second year of the early lamb study. For the late lamb study, there were 33 per lot. The allotments were made after the breeding season. Expected time of lambing was considered more than the size of the ewe. Other factors such as fleece and age were balanced as nearly as possible. Management Methods and Rations For the early lamb production, three lots of ewes were used. They were designated as 1, 2, and 3. After the breeding season was over and at the beginning of the winter feeding period, October 23, the lot 1 ewes were started on a heavy grain ration of ground ear corn In addition to cottonseed meal, corn silage, and chopped alfalfa hay. This ration was continued after lambing and until the ewes were sold May 7. The lot 2 ewes were wintered on cottonseed meal, corn silage, and chopped alfalfa until they lambed. Following lambing, a heavy grain ration of ground ear corn was fed, in addition to the roughage, until they were marketed, May 7. The lot 3 ewes received no grain before or- after lambing. The lambs from the lot 1, 2, and 3 ewes received a ration which was made up of alfalfa hay and a grain mixture composed of 12 pounds ground shelled corn, 2 pounds bran, and 3 pounds linseed meal. The lambs were fed according to their appetites. •Prof. A. D. Wclicr conducted the 1930-31 test. </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The ewes for the late lamb production were designated as lots 4, 5, 6, and 7. The ewes were started on their winter ration October 23. This was made up of cottonseed meal, corn silage, bone meal, and chopped alfalfa hay. The lot 4 ewes did not receive bone meal. The ewes were all managed alike until after lambing, which was the first week of May for lot 4 and the last week of April for lots 5, 6, and 7. At this time the lot 4 ewes and lambs were turned on pasture without other feed until July 30 when the ewes were sold with 16 lambs. The remaining 30 lambs were left on pasture, but shelled corn was added to the ration. The 30 lambs were designated as 4B. The lot 5 ewes and lambs were turned on pasture during the day - time. The lambs received the grain mixture morning and evening. This mixture was the same as that fed to the lambs In the early production study. The lot 6 and 7 ewes and lambs were on pasture during the day. In addition, the ewes received shelled corn morning and evening, while the lambs received the grain mixture morning and evening. This practice continued for the lot 6 and 7 ewes and lambs until July 13 when the lot 7 lambs were kept in a dry lot day and night on the grain mixture plus alfalfa hay. They were allowed to nurse morning and evening. No change was made in the management of the lot 6 ewes and lambs. Feeding the Lambs A modified creep-feeding system was used for the lambs that re - ceived a grain ration. A regular creep was constructed. The lambs were driven in the first thing of a morning and fastened in the creep. The early Iambs were left in until about noon when the creep was opened. They could then go nurse, drink, and return. About four in the afternoon they were again fastened in the creep, the troughs cleaned and a fresh supply of feed given. The creep was opened for the night about six-thirty. For the late lamb study, the lambs were fastened in the creep for about an hour each morning and evening. They were allowed the use of the creep during the night, but were on pasture during the day. Feeds The corn was No. 2 yellow; the cottonseed meal, choice; the linseed meal, old process; the silage, good quality; and the alfalfa, bright leafy second-cutting. The pasture was fields of sweet clover and sudan. The ewes and lambs of different lots were running on the same kind of pasture at the same time. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION. The 1930-31 feed prices used were: Ground ear corn 60 cents cwt. Ground shelled corn 85&lt;J cwt. Cottonseed meal $35 per ton Bran $17 per ton Corn silage $ 5 per ton Linseed meal $35 per ton Alfalfa hay $12 per ton The 1931-32 feed prices used were: Ground ear corn 60&lt;J cwt. Pasture Mstfperday Cottonseed meal $25 per ton for lambs; l&lt;f for ewes Corn silage $ 4 per ton Ground shelled corn 85&lt;f cwt. Alfalfa hay $12 per ton Bran $15 per ton Bone meal $32 per ton Linseed meal $30 per ton Shelled corn 42?perbu. Chopped alfalfa $13 per ton The feed prices used may seem high, but no feed prices that might be used would be comparable to all farm conditions. The prices ap - proach very closely the actual cost of the feed delivered, stored, and processed ready to feed. After all, the feed prices of this study are considered only as one example since feed costs are always changing. The amount of feed consumed by the animals and the response made are the important figures to keep in mind. Feed prices for any con - dition or year can then be applied. The Results , EARLY LAMB PRODUCTION Feeding Grain to Ewes Before and After Lambing Lot 1, 2 .and 3 ewes and lambs The ewes fed grain before and after lambing — lot 1 — gained al - most twice as much during the test as the ewes fed grain after lamb - ing — lot 2 — , and three and one-half times as much as the ewes re - ceiving no grain — lot 3. The lambs — lot 1 lambs — dropped by the lot 1 ewes ate more grain and made a larger daily gain than the lambs produced by the lots 2 and 3 ewes. There was three pounds difference in total gain made per lamb Tor each lot, which was in direct proportion to the amount of grain fed the ewes. Feeding grain to the ewes after lambing apparently did not cause their lambs to consume more feed, but no doubt did stimulate milk production in the ewes and, thus, cause the lambs to make larger gains than those from ewes not receiving grain after lambing — lots 2 and 3 lambs. The ewes grained heavily before and after lambing consumed less 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE than half as much corn silage as the ewes grained after lambing. The ewes receiving no grain naturally consumed the most silage. Because of their superior condition from having grain before and after lambing, the lot 1 ewes sold for 50 cents a hundred more than the lot 2 ewes. The lot 2 ewes sold for 85 cents a hundred more than the lot 3 ewes. The market value of the lambs varied in direct proportion to the amount of grain fed the ewes. After deducting the marketing charges and feed cost, the return per lamb was again in direct proportion to the amount of grain fed the ewes. In the 1930-31 trial some trouble was experienced in lambing out the lot 1 ewes. The heavy grain ration was credited for the trouble. Steamed bone meal was added to all the lots during the 1931-32 trial. No trouble was experienced at lambing time. Since there was no check lot, the bone meal cannot be given unrestricted credit for the different results, altho without doubt it is beneficial in such a ration. Late Lamb Production Feeding Grain to Ewes and Lambs on Pasture Lots 4, 5, 6, and 7 The lot 4 ewes in Table II cannot be compared too strongly to the other lots In the same table since lots 5, 6, and 7 represent data ob - tained in the 1931-32 trial. The ewes in lot 4 did not have enough finish to sell at the top ewe price the last of July. Only one-third of the lambs produced were of a market weight and finish by July 30, and they were not real market-toppers. The remaining lambs had to be grain-fed to put them in a marketable condition. A comparison of the lot 5 and lot 6 ewes shows that the grain fed after lambing while the ewes were on pasture produced 12 pounds more gain on the lot 6 ewes. It also Increased their selling value 75 cents a hundred. The lambs — lot 6 lambs — of the ewes that were grained on pas - ture — lot 6 ewes — gained 6 pounds more per head, ate more grain, and were appraised at 15 cents a hundred more than the lot 5 lambs whose mothers received no grain on pasture. The ewes in lots 6 and 7 responded practically the same, since their management was the same. The lambs in lot 7, however, gained 3 pounds more per head than the lot 6 lambs and 9 pounds more than the lot 5 lambs. They were appraised at 10 cents a hundred more than the lot 6 lambs and 25 cents a hundred more than the lot 5 lambs. The ewes and lambs In lots 5, 6, and 7 were drenched once during </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION the summer for stomach worms. Keeping the lambs off pasture en - tirely would eliminate worm trouble. Such practice might prove to be good management for late lambs. Early vs. Late Lamb Production Considering the feed prices used, there is very little difference be - tween the feed cost per ewe for the lot 1 ewes of the early lamb pro - duction and the lot 7 ewes of the late lamb production. The average weight per lamb at the close of the test was practically the same for the lots 1 and 7 lambs. The lot 1 lambs sold for more, which was expected when comparing the early June and late August lamb market. For this reason, the early lamb method seems the better under conditions existing at the time of conducting the test. A year In which corn 1b high priced might make the feed cost so high for the lot 1 ewes that the higher lamb price in June would not be sufficient to maintain the advantage held in this test. The feed cost for the better-doing lambs of the early production te8t — lot 1 lambs — and for the better-doing lambs of the late produc - tionc test — lot 7 Iambs — was practically the same. If the ewes cannot be fed a heavy grain ration before and after lambing, this test suggests the possibility of producing late lambs, since the lot 7 ewes and lambs show more desirable results than the lots 2 and 3 of the early lamb production test. </seg>

            <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION HOG PROGRAM Tuesday Afternoon Animal Husbandry Hall E. P. BROWN, Arbor, Presiding WHAT'S MANGE TO A HOG? WM. J. LOEFFEL, College of Agriculture Hog mange is quite a serious thing to the hog breeder and feeder because the prevalence of hog mange is a problem to the packer and the farmer, Mr. Loeffel began. It is caused by a parasite that burrows in the skin and is evident in a scurvy condition of the skin, thickness of the skin, deadness of the hair and prevalent scratching by the hog. It damages a pig crop by arresting the growth of young pigs reduces their vitality, increases their feed costs and lowers their pork value. It. is believed to be due to bedding pigs too heavily, when they are closely housed during the winter. Mange is most prevalent during the winter and at that time the parasite does most of its work. It is not so evident during the summer, when pigs sire ~un - ning out, getting sufficient green feed and exercise and are exposed to the sun. In winter when they are housed and are not out in the sun and spend much of their time in the bedding, the parasite reproduces and feeds on the skin of the porkers. The parasite ,is microscopic and as it burrows in the skin, it sets up an irritation and results in a checking of the skin, resulting in a spotted appearance. We felt that, since mangy pigs are discounted 50 cents per cwt on the Omaha market and since five per cent of all receipts are mangy that we would run an experiment here at the station to test the various methods of control most adaptable to ordinary farm conditions. We bought 55 head of mangy pigs for the experimental work although we had the misfortune of losing a large portion of them thru vaccination for cholera when they had Necro. However, we set up seven lots as follows: Lot A check lot, received no treatment; </seg>
            <seg id="p522">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Lot B, dipped in crude oil; Lot C, sprayed with crude oil; Lot D, dipped in Crankcase oil; Lot E, sprayed with Crankcase oil; Lot F, dipped in lime sulphur dip and Lot G, sprayed with the lime sulphur dip. This gave us three sprayed lots, three dipped lots and one check lot. All had been checked and all lots had mange at the start. We continued the examination of skin scrapings and found mange at some times and not evident at other times in the lots. At the finish of the experiment it was found that about half of the pigs dipped had mites while about the same portion of those sprayed had mites. Crank case oil was not shown to be effective while lime-sulphur dip showed the most noticeable results. They seemed to "blossom right out" after they had been dipped in the lime-sulphur solution. The spraying did not show the results that the dipping did, it was apparent from just observation. The dipped hogs had a lot better appearance than the sprayed, and while the spray was somewhat effec - tive, undoubtedly, the spraying did not seem to clean the hogs up and do as effective a job of reaching all parts as the dipping. We checked the hogs at the slaughter house and found that some had mange and some did not in all lots, the results were however, about the same as to the effectiveness of the dip, as we have found them here. We intend to repeat the test In 1934. Now is an excellent time to get busy on the mange problem and control the parasite. It requires sometime and expense but will return that and more in the saving of feed and dockage. WHAT IS MAXGE TO THE PACKER? By DR. L. D. FREDERICK Omaha, Nebraska After just listening to the comprehensive discussion of "What Is Mange to a Hog?" by Professor Loeffel, you know there is quite some irritation generated while the hog is your property and I wish to assure you of Its continuation after you have sold him, not to the hog itself, but to his purchaser, especially If he Is a packer. We feel you are entitled to know the basic economic facts con - cerned in a hog being badly Infected with Mange. It was conservatively estimated that 8 to 10% of all hogs marketed at the Omaha Market from January 1st to April 1st last winter were </seg>
            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION infected with Mange. In round numbers, there were 686, 00u hogs marketed during the period, and approximately 7,000 were affected in varying degrees. If these mangy hogs were docked sufficiently to cover the packer's loss, the producer would have been penalized 25c to 50c per cwt., on present market value, on the affected animals, or a total of $6, - 125.00 for this period, at the Omaha Market alone. What Constitutes the Packer's Loss from This Disease All hogs' carcasses are cut up Into primal parts, 1. e., ham shoul - ders, bellies, backs, etc. These parts are graded for quality and weight and are put down to cure or sold fresh, according to this grading. Firmness, texture, color of flesh, thickness, color and char - acter of the fat, conformation of the part, proper cut, colbr and con - dition of the skin are all carefully considered in grading to determine which grade of product the cuts will go into. There Is no one point that will take a part out of the first grade more certainly than a rough, mangy skin and this also necessitates skinning the part These low grade, unsightly, unappetizing cuts are hard to sell, even at a reduced price and become a drug on the market, and con - sequently do the industry no good. The loss incurred by lowering of grade and loss of weight by skin - ning the various parts are: Hams J 30 % Shoulders 25 % Bellies 50 % Backs 10 % The reduction in grade of skins from a tannery skin to a scrap skin 40% Occasionally, a hog is badly enough infected with mange and pyogenic bacteria have gained entrance to the lesions so that the entire carcass is condemned on post mortem inspection by the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry Meat Inspectors. Then, too, occasionally an entire carcass is condemned where the infestation is so extensive that a septicemia results. The yield in total pork from a poorly developed, cachectic hog as a result being infected with mange is about 75% of the yield of a good, well-finished hog; also, the cost of cleaning (dehairing) a rough, mangy hog is nearly twice that of the cost for a smooth one. On an extensively infested one, we have to remove the skin and immediate underlying tissue, warm on the dressing floor, which </seg>
            <seg id="p524">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE materially adds to our loss and expense. Mange is not necessarily a condition of hogs at this season of the year, but it is at the season of late winter to early spring that we see it at its worst. This is undoubtedly because the hogs spend most of their time laying close together in shelters, with more or less irritation to the skin from manure, making attack easy for the might, laying on damp bedding, lack of sunshine, green, succulent, vitamin laden pasturage, etc. Therefore, we suggest you practice rigid sanitation and other preventative measures you have been told of today, and previously, in controlling and eradicating mange in your hogs. IMPORTANT CONDITION'S AFFECTING OUR LIVESTOCK MARKETS Before Organized Agriculture, University of Nebraska, Lincoln January 2, 1934 By R. C. ASHBY, University of Illinois Friends and Co-workers: It is a privilege to get "back home," even for a day. I am glad to be here. i Your Chairman (Mr. E. P. Brown) is eminently correct in his statement that what the agricultural colleges and experiment stations have sought and have taught was efficient production; that they have left the question of quantity of production to the producers them - selves. Nor has the attention of these Institutions been limited to pro - duction problems alone; fully thirty years ago some of them were taking up marketing problems. What I say to you this afternoon is drawn directly from the results of one livestock marketing study which has been under way at the University of Illinois during the past two years. My talk deals with four principal considerations: 1. What stockmen have to sell. 2. Who buys their livestock. 3. The problem of marketing costs. 4. The question of price level. With reference to the first, average figures for the three years, 1930-1933, show that for the U. S., meat animal sales accounted for 25.7 per cent of the total cash income of farms, hog sales accounting </seg>
            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION for 12.7 per cent of the total. In other words, one out of every four dollars cash farm income during that period came from sale of meat animals, one out of every eight from sale of hogs. For Nebraska the percentages would be much higher. Many people, In agriculture as well as in other Industries, do not realize the Important part meat animals play in our domestic economy. Second, one often hears reference to the operation of 1000 or 1200 or 1300 packing plants in the United States and assumes there is no limit to the competition of buyers for livestock. Two facts need consideration in that regard — (1) fully two-thirds of the 1 total U. S. commercial hog slaughter is under federal Inspection; (2) there have been only about 240 hog slaughtering plants operating under federal Inspection in any recent year. If we assume that possibly 80 of those plants are owned and operated by the Big Four, there remains some 160 plants operated by other packers. So the number of buyers is not so great as some have supposed, and buying competition may not be as broad as some have^. assumed. Speaking as a member of the Federal Farm Board, Mr. W. F. Schilling said: "Farmers must organize and concentrate their selling power to meet the concentrated buying power of the men who handle their farm products In the process of marketing and distribu - tion. The buying power on the part of the dealers who market farm products is so concentrated that four companies control 90 per cent of the tobacco consumed in the form of cigarettes in this country. These four companies control about 80 per cent of all tobacco con - sumed in the United States. You dairymen know that five companies control so vast a quantity of dairy products that they dominate the market. Three dealers handle about 40 per cent of the cotton pro - duced In the United States. Ten men handle half the wool and four companies process two-fifths (40 per cent) of the livestock." 1 Third, livestock marketing costs have received more attention, discussion and complaint than any other one question connected with the livestock business. Consequently I became anxious to learn just what they involved. With the aid of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics the figures were assembled. They are not presented as being statistically exact, but as being the best estimates available. They are for meat animals marketed in the U. S. during 1932. Ask 100 stockmen what marketing costs represent and probably 95 will say they Include transport from farm to market or slaughter plant, and selling expense. Here's what we find on that: ■Before National Cooperative Milk Producers' Federation, San Francisco, October 4, </seg>
            <seg id="p526">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Packers paid for meat animals in U. S. in 1932 $ 861,000,000 Farm value ; 721,000,000 Marketing cost, apparently $ 140,000,000 But packers have long told us that livestock prices are determined by what consumers will pay for meats. If that be true, and no one has disproved It, the real livestock marketing costs are the difference between cost of meats to consumers and the farm value of the meat animals that produced those meats. That's a different story: Consumers paid for meats in U. S. (estimated) in 1932 $1,656,000,000 Farm value of meat animals 721,000,000 Total livestock marketing cost $ 935,000,000 Divide 140 by 935 and the result is .1497; In other words, what we commonly consider our livestock marketing costs were only 15 per cent of the 1932 total. Stockmen have complained a lot about that 15 per cent (and any reduction possible there is worth while), but it would seem desirable to give some attention to the 85 per cent that has been too commonly overlooked. That brings us to the most important question of all. Fourth, and, most vital to stockmen, is the question of price (the remainder of the discussion referring primarily to hogs). Recently four conditions have been operative that have not before been effective at the same time In the United States. These are: 1. Curtailment of exports. 2. Low consumer buying power. 3. Inequalities in price of hogs to packers. 4. Concentration of large volume purchases of meats in the hands of a few buyers. The significance of the first two have been so generally dis - cussed that further attention will not be given them here. Inequalities in price of hogs to packers is one of the serious prob - lems confronting hog producers. The situation can be most clearly shown by means of illustrations. And I may say that my remarks on this and the fourth factor just referred to are based not only on my own observation and analysis but also on personal interviews with important packers in ten states or provinces during 1933. By way ot illustration consider first the competitive situation ef - fective between two packers, one operating at Ottumwa, Iowa, and </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION the other at Chicago. Chicago being the second largest meat maricet - ing center in the nation, both packers will want to sell in that market. If the Chicago packer buys hogs at Ottumwa for slaughter in Chicago, the freight rate (d. d.) is 31 cents per cwt. 24,000 lbs. @' .31 cwt.= 74.40 + 2.70 terminal charge at Chicago, or $77.10 freight. If the Ottumwa packer slaughters a similar car ot hogs at his plant and ships the edible product' to Chicago as fresh meat, he would have 18,196.8 lbs.@.22 per cwt. (at carload rate) or $40.03 freight, with no terminal charge. Subtract $40.03 from $77.10 and the difference is $37.07 as the advantage enjoyed by the Iowa packer. Divide $37.07 by 24,000 and the result is 15.4 cents per cwt., that being the handi - cap under which a Chicago packer would try to compete with the interior packer. 1 For general purposes packers estimate 68 per cent of edible product and, for ship - ping purposes, add HXi per cent of that to allow ior weight of containers. The following short table shows just a few freight rate relation - ships by way of illustrating the favorable position ot the Interior packers: Live Fresh Fresh Meat hogs meats rate as % of d. d. live hog rate. cents cents per cent per cwt. per cwt. Omaha to Chicago 40 : 36 90.0 Des Moines to Chicago .... 34 : 25 73.5 Ottumwa to Chicago 31 22 71.0 Chicago to N. York 53 .79 149.1 Indianapolis to N. York .. 49.5 , 73.5 148.5 Des Moines to New York .. 72 95 122.5 When hogs were eight or nine cents the situation was not bo serious. With three cent hogs such a freight advantage is tremen - dously difficult to overcome. The result Is that volume ol hog slaughter In Chicago plants Is rapidly decreasing. Eastern packers, generally, say that their only recourse — failing early readjustment of freight rates — will be to reduce eastern hog prices to a point where they can compete with delivered products from interior (Iowa-Minne - sota) plants. How much that would Improve Nebraska hog prices you can well judge. The facts, are that the Interior packers are today probably the most important single factor in determining the price of hogs in the Corn Belt. </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a second Illustration follows. Assume a local livestock market at Blooinington, Illinois, buys its hogs 30 cents under Chicago. Its freight rate to Buffalo is 42 cents per cwt. (d. d). If the price at Bloomington Is $3.25 +.42 freight + .05 order buying commission, the operator could, If necessary, sell his hogs to a Buffalo packer at a delivered (plant, Buffalo) price of $3.72. If they yielded 76%, the dressed cost would be $4.89 per cwt. If similar hogs cost the packer $3.55 In Chicago + .39 frelght+ .05 order buying commission, the laid down cost would be $3.99; If they yielded 78%, the dressed cost would figure $5.12 per cwt., or 23 cents per cwt., higher for the terminal market hogs. A third illustration Is worth noting. On November 20 top hog prices were reported as $4.25 at East St. Louis, $4.15 at Indianapolis, and $3.75 at Findlay, Ohio (a local market). What chance for eastern packer orders at Indianapolis at $4.15 if Ohio local markets are selling hogs at $3.75; or at East St. Louis at $4.25 if Indian - apolis is but $4.15? Thus the possible effects of local market operations upon terminal markets is clearly brought out. In general, packers get hogs cheaper at local markets than at terminals. As a result, as late as October, 1933, only about fifteen important eastern packers were still depend - ing on terminal markets for the bulk of their hogs. Since that time even a few of the fifteen have transferred much of their buy to local points. If marketing expense at the terminals can be reduced that will automatically narrow the margin on which local markets operate. Granting of in-transit rates, with a change of ownership, to terminal markets by the railroads would probably do more than any other one move to remedy the situation. Unless better coordination of local and terminal markets can be effected, the local markets — by continuing to underprice the terminals — will very probably put the terminal markets out of business. There are some 250 local markets now operating In eight Important hog producing states — an excellent opportunity for buyers to play one against another. Rise of the chain stores has put the purchasing of tremendous volumes of meat into the hands of a few buyers. With a surplus of product on the market and packers using every possible means of Increasing volume of sales, the situation was made to order for the big chain buyers to put the squeeze on packers as regards wholesale meat prices. The result has been to depress wholesale meat prices. Packers, individually, dare not talk about the situation In public. Therefore, stockmen and stockmen's organizations must take the initiative if they would know the facts on this additional unfavorable </seg>
            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION factor and its operation upon livestock prices. Note the following interesting and significant statement: "Chain store practices In regard to the retailing of meat appear very influential in determining the wholesale prices of carcasses and that of livestock. Moreover, it seems clear to those of broader vision within the chain store system itself, that if present chain store practices are continued it will not only continue to work serious hardship upon cattlemen but will in the end prove disastrous to the chain stores themselves. . . . The Division . . . represented 2,600 units, of which 850 sold meat and served an area of 15,000,000 people. ... this manager developed a policy which had proper regard for all parties concerned: consumers, packers and stockmen. His colleagues at first declared that this policy would wreck the chain store system This Division . . . handles nearly 3,000,000 pounds of meat per week and each unit earns an average net profit of from 15 to 20 dollars per week." 1 fc In conclusion your attention Is directed to recent figures of the Research Department of the National Livestock Marketing Associa - tion on distribution of consumers' meat dollars in 1913 and in 1932.

Most of these problems cannot be solved by individual stockmen (in no Industrial field, today, can the major problems be solved by In - dividuals acting alone). The first requisite is to inform stockmen accurately and fully as to conditions. When enough of them want conditions changed, they can change them. I thank you for your interest and excellent attention. * From The Cattleman, January, 1934, page 11. OH, LARD! BELLE LOWE, Iowa State College Ames, Iowa I would like to bring to your consideration three things about lard, first, its poor qualities, second, its good ones, and third, can the poor qualities be remedied and its use increased. I am taking up the poor qualities of lard first, so that if I do </seg>
            <seg id="p530">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uui icuve time to cover all three topics, we will at least have con - sidered the ones that cause a person to say Oh, Lard! And in addi - tion it Is probably the producers and manufacturers of lard that will have to remedy the poor qualities I think the chief drawbacks to the use of lards for cooking' purposes are its lack of uniformity in keeping quality, in consistency and in odor. Of these three the keeping quality of lard Is the least serious. Lard as a rule becomes rancid very slowly, but after a certain degree of rancidity has been reached It finishes the job of going bad very rapidly. Of the commercial lards, the prime steam usually becomes rancid more rapidly than the open kettle, though this might not always be true. The prime steam method of rendering seems to leave the lard more susceptible to development of rancidity or re - moves something that prevents development of rancidity. But if lard is kept in a cool place, is covered, it keeps excellently. Or for persons buying their lard, it can be bought in small quantities which removes the difficulty of spoilage. The consistency of lard may vary from one that is nearly like oil at room temperature to a very firm lard. Yet the housewife prefers uniformity in the consistency of the lard she uses. A very soft lard In some products, cakes for Instance, requires a different technic in handling to secure uniform good results. The softness or firmness of the lard varies with individual hogs, the season, the kind of body fat used in the lard, I. e., leaf, cutting or killing fats, and it varies particularly with the feed the hog has received. The softest lards we have used came from hogs receiving certain proportions and mixtures of soy beans or soy bean products. Per - haps If soy beans, peanuts or other feeds that produce very soft pork and lard are used in increasing quantities, the best solution will be to partially hydrogenatlon of the lard. If the very soft pork fats are mixed with firmer fats a firmer lard is produced, but it Is not as firm as if the soft fats were not used. Perhaps one ot lard's greatest drawbacks is the lack of uniformity of odor, although a year ago I would probably have not listed this characteristic as the most Important of lard's poor qualities. By odor I do not refer to rancidity, which is spoilage ot lard by oxida - tion, but to odors that are present in the lard the first day it is rendered. All lards have an odor, and the most characteristic odor of lard Is not disagreeable, though it varies in intensity and if strong enough can be disagreeable to some persons. The lards from in - dividual hogs vary in intensity of this characteristic lard odor, some being exceptionally mild, even when the lards are rendered exactly alike. </seg>
            <seg id="p531">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The odor of lards also varies with the method of rendering. Of the commercial lards the prime steam is much more disagreeable than the open kettle rendered lards. This may be partially due to fats used in prime steam lard as well as the method of rendering. But there are other odors that are associated with some lards that are disagreeable. In some instances the odor is somewhat nauseat - ing, resembling that of manure, whereas in other instances I do not know what to compare it with. We found the disagreeable odor was present more often in lards from fats of animals receiving large proportions of soy beans or soy bean products. Yet the feed is not always responsible for the odor, for 3 of the 45 lards from animals on the same experimental rations had a disagreeable odor, two of them very pronounced. My first thought was that the odor might be due to differences in handling the animals before and during kill - ing, but the Animal Husbandry Department assured me that the hogs were all treated alike. One of the men on our campus suggested that some pigs were bothered by B. O. Perhaps this explains it. One of the most interesting observations of the particularly dis - agreeable odors, was that they were volatile, though the characteristic lard odor is not so volatile. By this I mean that the odor disappeared during the mixing and baking of the product. Hence if a person ate the product, but had not mixed it, they would not know of the disagreeable odor. But after a person had had this odor fanned up in their face by mixing on a machine or by stirring with a spoon, they would usually have a complex about tasting the food product in which it was used. At least I did. I usually prevailed upon some that had not been around during the mixing period to do the tasting and was always surprised that the odor did not show up in the product. But I certainly would prefer to use some fat without a disagreeable odor for cooking purposes and realize why so many housewives state they do not like to use lard because of its odor. Also for deep fat frying lard gives off an odor. This odor becomes less as the fat Is used but by this time the lard begins to break down from the heat, due to the low smoking point of most lards and a decomposition odor that is disagreeable is obtained. I have no suggestions as to how to remove the disagreeable odor from lard, yet think it one of the greatest drawbacks to its increased use. Some of Lard's Good Qualities First, it is cheap. Second, nutritionally it is on a par with other tats and oils, as to energy it will yield In the body. Burr's work also indicates that it </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE has some of the higher unsaturated fatty acids necessary for good nutrition of the animal body. It has practically no vitamin A con - tent, so is inferior to butter in this respect. Easily Digested Third. Its good points as a cooking fat. It is very plastic. This means that it spreads easily and mixes easily with flour and other ingredients. This gives an easier blend - ing of the fat with the other Ingredients, for It is not soluble in any of the other ingredients, but for good texture must be rather uni - formly distributed. It has great shortening power. Of the plastic fats it has the greatest shortening power in pastry. This means that if equal quan - tities of fat are used the lard gives the most tender pastry, or if equally tender pastries are desired a smaller proportion of lard can be used. It is excellent to use In pastry, quick breads such as griddle cakes, muffins, and biscuits but for cake to secure excellent texture. It Is necessary to change the method of mixing from that usually used. Unless lard were used for making fuel, or for some scientific purpose, the use in cake seems to be the most logical to increase its use. In cake the amount of fat is about % pound of fat in one pound of cake, whereas in bread only about 1-60 of a pound Is used in a pound of bread. Hence It Is evident that the proportion of fat in cake is large and Increasing the use of lard in this product would use a much larger quantity. </seg>

His feed record turned in every year also ranked high. This year Eshelman raised 100 pigs from 13 sows, the pigs averaged 210 pounds at 180 days and the average litter at that time weighed 1,615 pounds. Corn oats, tankage shorts, bran, cotton seed meal, alfalfa meal, limestone and salt were used to fatten the hogs.

THE CORN HOG PLAN RALPH COLE College of Agriculture Briefly, there are three factors which have lead the secretary ot agriculture and farm leaders to adopt the course of action they have taken to reduce the production ot corn and hogs to a place where the domestic demand for pork and pork products will have a beneficial effect on the market and result In price levels which will restore some of the purchasing power to the farmer. Those factors are first: The production of a surplus of hogs and corn at the present time in the United States, which has had a de - pressing effect upon the market, second, the loss of the majority ot the export or foreign trade demand for pork products of the United States, an outlet which formerly enabled the United States to market a production far in excess of domestic consumption, and third, the lack of a currency stabilization which will permit and foster foreign trade and the export market for the American pork producer. Accordingly, the federal government Is endeavoring now to reduce that production of pork to a parity with the domestic demand, and in doing so finds It necessary to reduce the production ot corn as It directly depends upon the production of hogs for an outlet. The benefits that are to be paid the producers of pork and corn for their reduction in acres and head of hogs, are being procured from a pro - cessing tax on pork and commercial corn products. Briefly the contract requires a reduction of 20 per cent of corn production, the number of acres ot reduction being based upon the average acres produced during 1931 and 1932, and the average yield over the five year period 1928 to 1933. </seg>
            <seg id="p540">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a benefit of 30 cents per bushel will be paid to farmers signing the contract. The hog production part of the contract calls for a 25 per cent reduction in the number of hogs raised and grown to marketable age, the farmer receiving a $5 per head bonus upon the 75 per cent that he does raise, or upon the remaining 75 per cent. A farmers average production will be based upon the number of hogs he raised to maturity from Dec. 1, 1931 to Nov. 1st, 1933. The contract calls for a reduction of litters and also marketable pigs, either finished or feeder, the full 25 per cent. There is nothing in the plan that con - flicts with the efficiency of production of corn and hogs. Q. &amp; A. Drouth will not effect the contract, since drouths have not resulted in any special consideration otherwise. A farmer who has been dried out and has no base for yield or acres, will have to iron that out with his local and county committee. Q. &amp; A. Yes, there will be a 5-cent a bushel tax on commercial corn, that is corn going into commercial use. Q. &amp; A. The contract states that litters must be reduced 25% that means M less brood sows. Q. &amp; A. There is now recourse from loss, the same payment will be made whether you have one pig or your full 75% quota. Q. &amp; A. There Is no limit on the litter. Q. &amp; A. It is necessary to sign both the corn and hog reduction, they are all in one contract. If you raise no hogs that part' becomes inoperative. Q. &amp; A. A new producer may secure a base from a retiring pro - ducer if he wishes to sign, in that event no hog benefits will be paid, payment will be on corn acreage only the first year. Q. &amp; A. The man who buys feeder pigs agrees to buy and feed no more than previously. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION - HORSE PROGRAM Wednesday Forenoon H. J. Gramlich, Presiding HORSES TO THE FRONT JAMES C. ADAMS, Dawson County Onward Horses "In order to have good horses you've got to feed them regularly. When a horse sticks his head over the fence as you go along and whinneys to you, you just can't help throwing him a little hay or grain." These words were not read from a text book — neither were they gathered from any discussion in classroom but flhey came from Guy Uhllg of Cozad who, besides being a great lover of fine horses, has five times been state horseshoe pitching champion. Whether Mr. Uhlig became horseshoe pitching champion because of his love for horses or whether his love tor horses came from his love of horseshoe pitching is hard to tell but his words have a challenge to them that is worth thinking about. If you were to drive with me for a day in the neighborhood north - east of Cozad more particularly known as school district No. 23 and see the fine mated teams on those farms you will see by the proud way in which these farmers exhibit their horses that a horse means more to them than just a beast of burden. In fact they have made the claim that in no place of the same size in the United States can you find better horses than in this neighborhood. It was this pride In their horses that caused the State Cornhusk - ing Contest to be located this year north and east of Cozad. "Give us the contest and we will furnish a matched team for each wagon and not only will we give you matched teams but we will furnish them in three colors: sorrels, roans, and grays." In company with Mr. Uhlig, Miles and Lane Hart solicited these teams and all were gathered in Dawson County, with the exception of 6 teams, all of the 49 came from within a radius of seven miles. My topic is supposed to be "Onward Horses." After looking at the decline In horses during the last two decades in which the horse popu - lation of the United States has decreased over 10,000,000 head, per - haps some such topic as "Backward Horses" would more nearly hit the truth. I find that since 1913 the horse population of Nebraska has decreased from 999,743 to 595,617, a decrease of about 35% and in my own county of Dawson during the same period from 16,721 to </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 9,970 head of 41% and that is only half the story. Unless a breeding program is started in the near future the death rate is going to in - crease much faster due to the advancing ages ot the horses now owned. Our records show that less than 700 colts have been foaled in Dawson County in the last three years. During that same period our horse population has decreased 1672. This means that either through death or sales our county has had removed 2372 horses or an average of 791 per year for the past three years. If all of the colts lived it would take over three years to replace one year's loss. I am told in Iowa cost accounts by John A. Hopkins Jr., in Bulle - tin No. 264 that their average farm horse ate 27 bushels of corn, 35 bushels of oats and slightly over a ton. of hay per year besides pasture at the equivalent of 4 V* months. Using these same figures In our county alone for the last three years we have lost on an average the consumptive power of 21,357 bushels corn, 27,685 bushels oats, over 791 tons hay, and 3362 months of pasture. These same horses would require about 50 hours labor per head which would employ between 29 and 30 men for a year working on a 30 hour week schedule. This last year even with the advent of tractor fuel the cost of feed for horses was much less than the equivalent in tractors. Fur - thermore you never heard of a tractor having a colt. They are con - stantly depreciating. At the best, seven years Is all a tractor will last and then only with considerable repairs. It is true under certain conditions a tractor may work faster but on many farms the operator rushes through his work only to loaf several days while his machinery Is standing idle. I have seen many farmers who were hard pressed for finances run a tractor while their horses stood idle in the pasture. I am not an objector to tractors but often from a farm management standpoint more "horse sense" could be used. I understand that Mr. Linn is to talk to you about Horses and Overproduction this afternoon so I will not go Into this topic further. However It amounts to huge sums in the United States. Iu fact Wayne Dinsmore, secretary of the Horse Association of America, stated that "the number of horses in this country has decreased ten million, and this has lost the farmers a market for 40 million acres of farm products — considerably more than the total exports of wheat, corn, oats, rye and barley." This is the number of acres the Agricul - tural Adjustment Administration has stated needs to come out of production. "Onward Horses'' if that is to be the slogan of farmers in the next </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION few years, what must we do? Let me tell you what has been done in our county the last year. I attended a Sunday afternoon horse show at Mr. Uhlig's place last summer when from the neighborhood 34 sorrel horses were brought together. These men are partial to Belgians although some good Percherons are to be found. Can you think of any nicer way to spend a Sunday afternoon? We had two horse pulling contests. It might be of interest to note that pulling contest held at Cozad was held at the same hour and within a block of the football field where Cozad and Gothenburg were playing football, The crowd at the pulling contest was nearly as large as at the football game and as Gothenburg finished the season untied and undefeated, you may know the game had good drawing possibilities. . Also we have a number of company stallions. The men caring for these report to me that more mares served this year than usual. Good coming yearling colts are selling now for about $40.00 per head which is about twice what a steer would bring. Three year olds are much In demand and there Is no spot In the farm program right now that has a brighter future than the horse. "Onward Horses" must be our slogan If our horse does not In a few years become as nearly extinct as the buffalo and when a man tells you that he just can't resist giving a horse a little extra feed when he sticks his head over the fence and whinneys to him, you may well know that In such a man there Is a feeling of affection, of pride, and of pleasure In owning a good horse and he will be an inspiration in his community toward promoting good horses. PARASITE CONTROL DR. S. W. ALFORD, Lincoln One of the most troublesome Insects to horses is Bots, Dr. Alford said. Three species of the adult files are known, and they all lay eggs on the horses throat, nose and legs, placing the eggs on the hairs. The horse in biting its fetlocks, and by other means get these eggs into their digestive tracts, where they hatch Into the larvae of the fly. The larvae is the form known as Bots. They attach themselves to the animals stomach, feeding from the lining of the animals stomach. The eggs may be washed from animals legs with a 2 per cent solu - tion of carbolic acid and this method requires frequent application to prevent infestation. The best method of control, and the one most effectively used to remove the Bots and return vigor and lite to the horse, is to "debot" all horses early in the winter by drenching them with carbon disulphide. Best results are obtained it all the animals </seg>

The isolated treatment of a single farmers horses has little effect upon the entire problem of Bot files. It Is important to know that the carbon dlsulphlde treatment is one requiring the attention of a veterinarian or one experienced in the administration of the chemical. It Is poisonous and amateur treat - ment of horses without proper consideration and care of various fac - tors often results In the loss of several valuable animals, Mr. Alford said. COLT CARE AND TRAINING HARRY D. LINN, Iowa Horse and Mule Association The demand for all kinds of horse flesh has encouraged farmers in the production of colts and in the care of both colts and horses. This interest has created a very strong demand for information rela - tive to the care and handling of horses. During my talk today I wish to discuss for a short time care and training ot colts and during the remaining portion of the time allotted me I wish to discuss the fitting of collar, names, harness and the like. Care Care of the colt begins before birth, for if the mare is not in a healthy condition the little youngster may have almost impossible obstacles to combat before he gets started toward his goal of a useful, healthy horse. Exercise, or the lack of exercise, is probably the cause of 80% or 90% of our horse troubles so do not think you are being kind to the brood mare by keeping her tied or stalled up in the barn. She should have plenty of exercise either in the harness or out hustling for food. If the mare is worked in harness be careful about over exertion, pulling on slippery footing — backing heavy loads, etc. The mare's feed should be a cooling ration with abundant protein and mineral content. Oats, alfalfa, clean clover, some corn, etc., are all accepted feeds. If ' the mare is in the barn it might be wise to use a bran ration at foaling time. The mare should have a roomy stall, grass paddock, shed or lot for foaling. By all means these quarters should be clean. The mare, if valued, should be closely watched as foaling time approaches. The filling of the udder, milk droplets on end of teats, and dropping of muscles over croup and hips are signs of approach - ing foaling. The Foal If you are present at the arrival of the foal, assist mare if neces- </seg>
            <seg id="p545">545 NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION sary. Be quiet however. See that nostrils of foal are clear. Break cord. Apply iodine to navel. Rubbing and massaging many times helps pep up the youngster. Sometimes with weak foals I have seen them pepped up with a little of the mother's milk mixed with coffee. The first worry of the horseman with the young foal is to see that its bowels are working. Many times an injection of warm soapy water is used to insure prompt passage of feces or give a dose of castor oil, 2 to 4 ounces in milk. And now an injection of bacterln to guard against navel ill This is used with considerable success by horsemen. Many are now giving the mare this treatment before foaling. There is plenty to be found out about the disease and many people today, including many ieadlng veterinarians, believe the disease Is carried by the mare. even go so far as to claim that the stallion may be a carrier. Be that as it may, any precaution that we take is worth while. Some of the principle things to watch in growing the young colt are: 1. The feet of the foal— many colts have crooked legs and feet -pigeon toes. etc. This many times can be remedied bv trim - ming. 2. The colt's diet — wants plenty of protein, milk, oats, alfalfa, etc. Skim milk is very good— some of the Wisconsin farmers told me a few weeks ago that they were feeding skim milk to colts "Be - cause they obtained more profits there." Colt wants plenty of exercise. Should not follow mare and care be taken that colt does not suck while mare Is very hot. Colt will eat anything its mother does. — Easy way to break to eat. Break to lead and tie with foot rope — simple and effective. Should be put in harness as a large 2 year old or as a 3 year o:d. At this point I would like to go Into a rather thorough explanation of collar and name fitting. At this period of a colt's life he changes from a mischievous over-grown youngster to a valuable work animal or as is many times the case, to a cripple, a vicious outlaw, or worse. Almost nothing is more important in the care of a three-year old colt than the attention given the animals shoulders and the fitting of the collar. In fitting collars there are three types of necks to be considered, In getting a proper fit. This Is Important in the breaking of a horse to work and misfitting often results in a horse reluctant to pull. The three types of necks are thin, medium and short or stubby. For the first, or thin type, the full faced or standard collar Is used. On the second type the half sweeny collar allows a little </seg>
            <seg id="p546">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE more room toward the top of the neck. For short thick necks the full sweeney type of collar is suitable. For mules a special collar having a raised face is made. In fitting the collar it is best to fit the hames at the same time since they hold the collar in place. There should be room to run the fingers snugly down the side between the neck and the collar and there should be room for the whole hand at the bottom. The hames should be adjusted so the point of pull comes at the point of the collar and shoulder and so that the load does not raise the collar or does not pull down on the neck. Hames that are too short or too long, or have the pull at the wrong point invariably result in sore shoulders, sweeney and sore necks. HITCH 'EM UP W. W. DERRICK Mr. Derrick gave a demonstration of hitching five, six, seven, eight and larger horse teams In what are commonly known as big team tandem hitches, stressing the advantages of this type of hitching and the widespread acceptance of the five-horse hitch, three In front and two behind, in replacement of the former four abreast hitch. </seg>

Approximately 43,000,000 acres have been taken out of produc - tion, or will be under the control programs of the AAA. The attitude of the officials is that the government is renting the </seg>
            <seg id="p548">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ianu and that the tenant or owner of the farm cannot expect to use it. All rulings and contracts, have said In general, that the land should be left idle, with these exceptions. In most cases the farmers signing these contracts admit that the government is paying them a good return for the land and that under the payments they can afford to leave it lie idle or seed it down to some crop for the improvement of the land, and the fertility of the soil. Thousands of farmers over the corn belt are now thinking more about the future productivity of their land than they have thought in the last twenty years. They want to use the money from the benefit payments to finance a soil improvement program. Rulings on what may be done with the land taken out of pro - duction under the corn and wheat contracts are: 1. Plant to permanent pasture) Including alfalfa and clovers with or without a nurse crop. The crop may be pastured if no nurse crop is used. It cannot be cut for hay. 2. Planted to a soil improvement crop like sweet clover. The crop cannot be pastured or cut for hay. 3. Fallowed to store moisture or kill weeds. 4. Planted to farm wood lots. A recent statement from the administration is as follows: "It shall be deemed to be a violation of the contract for a pro - ducer to shift crops for home and livestock consumption and produc - tion, to leased land and put the land formerly occupied by these crops Into production of a marketable crop." Soil improvement crops are meant to include erosion control crops. Leased land can be seeded down to legumes and grasses for the Improvement of the soil and U3ed ntxt year with some other portion of the tract farmed being taken out for soil improvement crops. Q. &amp; A. Yes, I believe that the land taken out can be sowed to a pasture crop and then pastured if the permanent pasture Is al - lowed to stand idle, providing of course the pasturage or the animals on pasture, that is the production of marketable livestock from the pasture of the leased land, does not increase over the former years. It is true that many over pasture their permanent pasture and would find It is a means of allowing their sod pastures to build up again. There is no definite ruling at this time, but I think that would be possible. The decision, since there is no ruling would be up to the community committee. </seg>
            <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Now I (Stewart) want to say a few things in addition to what Mr. Aieher has said about sorghums. Concerning Atlas Sorgo, a number of Nebraskans have had some experience, particularly those down around Webster county and the southern border of the state, which bears out the things Mr. Aieher has said about Atlas. Of course Ne - braskans favor the growing of corn if that can be done, but it is often found advisable to plant the sorghums after the corn crop has been destroyed by worms or other means, or there has not been enough early moisture for corn planting. Halo is another grain sorghum that has taken the eye of many in Nebraska, especially in the South Platte country, where it has been found especially good for both the grain and the forage. Early Halo is worth trying although it may not ripen in the extreme western end and the panhandle section. CATTLE PROGRAM Thursday Forenoon D. M.

R. THALMAN, Lincoln Rather than calling this discussion "What Was Learned The Past Year" it should be "What Has Been Learned The Past Several Years." I do not propose to confine my remarks to the last season's experi - ments for they were discussed at the North Platte meeting this fall and again at the Rooters Day meeting in October. Though the re - sults have not been written up at this time, I hope to have them in circular from for distribution within the next two weeks. Further - more, the fact that I am no Bill Borah or William Jennings Bryan at speech making, as you know, precludes the possibility ot my deliver - ing an inspirational speech full of oratorical beauty and good stories. Neither shall I attempt to advance any good theories, since the field of agriculture is sufficiently full of them at the present time. My remarks shall therefore be based on those things which through ex - perimental procedure we have learned to be true, whether they suit </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE our tastes or not. To insure following this platform, avoid philoso - phizing, and stay on the subject, I have adopted for this occasion a question and answer plan. My questions have been selected from those most numerous in the letters we receive and a few others ot general interest to cattle feeders. With these preliminaries over, we have question number. 1. What can I do to cheapen a corn and alfalfa ration for fattening cattle? Would the addition of cottonseed or linseed cake be profitable? A very little can be done under present price conditions without reducing to some extent the gains produced. Cottonseed at its present level, $28.00 f. o. b. Lincoln, would not have any material effect since one to two pounds of cottonseed cake in a shelled corn and alfalfa ration will replace the equivalent of 2 % pounds of corn for every pound of cake fed. Beyond two pounds of supplement, its re - placement value decreases and thus operates on the plan of diminish - ing returns. The southern cattle feeder can use larger amounts be - cause he can buy cake for little more than the Nebraska farmer pays for corn. The feeding of ground snapped or ear corn adds bulk, saves some hay, and takes less grain for a given time, but it also extends the feeding period. In such a ration the addition of cottonseed cake aids in stimulating the gains, in cutting costs, and, in the aggregate, is more profitable than when fed with shelled corn. The addition of silage to a shelled corn-alfalfa ration would aid in saving corn and hay. Yearling steers should not be fed more than 15 pounds daily of silage it a quick finish is desirable. One pound of protein supplement would increase the dally gain without increasing the cost in this case. Question Number 2 : Which is the better supplement, cost con - sidered, cottonseed or linseed cake In a ration for fattening or for win - tering cattle? Experimental feeding tests show that linseed is slightly superior to cottonseed in the fattening ration. Though there is ordinarily a difference in price of several dollars per ton, at the present time this difference being $6.60 per ton, f. o. b., Omaha. The difference in feeding value does not justify paying this cover charge. Cottonseed is better than It was 12 to 15 years ago and the old belief that linseed produces a product that sells for more money is indeed questionable. Other supplements which we might list are corn gluten meal and soybean oil meal. Both are about equal to cottonseed for cattle, . though they are very deficient In the variety of amino acids which go to make up a protein. They are also deficient in mineral, especially </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION .- '.■■■■['■. | ■ ' calcium, and are considered somewhat less palatable than linseea or cottonseed. In the wintering ration the difference between cottonseed and linseed is mainly a matter of price. Cottonseed has 9 per cent more protein, which Is the Ingredient that we are interested in, and unless the price of linseed is equal to the price of cottonseed, I prefer the latter by whatever difference there is in price. With corn gluten or soybean oil meal and no clover or alfalfa hay. It would be well to feed in addition a good mineral high in calcium, especially to breed - ing stock. Question Number 3: How much cottonseed cake should be fed to fattening or stock cattle? Not to exceed 2 pounds per head dally to fattening cattle under present price conditions, and 1 pound Is preferable. This amount also is sufficient for wintering cattle receiving plenty of good rough - age. The only exception might be cows that are heavy In calf and whicfi are receiving considerable low-grade roughage such as corn stalks, straw, or coarse grass hay-. Question Number 4: Can cattle be fattened successfully without alfalfa or clover hay? Yes. Ground snapped, or even ground ear, corn will furnish suf - ficient bulk to prevent digestive trouble. The ration can be made satisfactory by the addition of 1% pounds ot cottonseed or linseed cake and 1/10 pound of ground limestone per head daily. Silage, ground corn fodder, or any other palatable roughage will meet the needs for bulk and the results secured will not differ materially from a shelled corn and alfalfa ration if 1 to 2 pounds ot a protein supple - ment and a high-calcium mineral are used to balance the ration. Such rations will pay whenever alfalfa is costing to exceed 35 to 40 per cent as much per ton as cake. Question Number 5: I have a limited amount ot alfalfa, plenty of silage and fodder and want to market my cattle this summer or fall. I have no pasture. How should these calves be fed? Winter on silage and 1 pound of cottonseed cake per head daily until April or May. Then start feeding alfalfa and shelled corn and gradually cut out the silage. If a little short on silage, feed ground corn fodder in conjunction with the silage. A steer calf will consume about 35 pounds and a yearling about 50 pounds of silage per head daily or 15 pounds of corn fodder. Question Number 6: Under present conditions, what is the best method of marketing roughage produced on the farm? </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Unless you are feeding on a large scale, the fattening ration is not a very satisfactory method of marketing roughages. Corn fodder, coarse hay, and especially silage can be used to good advantage, how - ever, with stock cattle, either breeding animals or steers. The safest plan for feeding stocker cattle involves the wintering of steer or heifer calves or light yearling steers. Properly supplemented with alfalfa or a protein concentrate, a ration of this kind will produce sufficient gain to return a comparatively good price for the feed consumed. In addition, the feeder next spring has a three-way go with his cattle. They can be marketed as feeders for as much or more than they cost; they can be pastured without grain and then sold or finished for market; or they can be fed grain on grass or in dry lot and marketed any time from midsummer until late fall. This plan makes for the maximum in efficient use of the corn and hay crops and involves the least financial risk. Question Number 7 : We have heard a great deal about ground limestone. When and how much should be fed? Is there more than one kind of ground limestone? If so, what kind should be used, where can It be purchased, and what is the cost? • We do not have sufficient data to make a blanket statement cover - ing the value of limestone in the ration for cattle; however, experi - ence in feeding trials has shown that it has a value if properly fed under certain conditions. Generally speaking, limestone should be fed with all rations that do not Include a legume hay or a green teed. This is especially true when grain makes up the principal part of the feed. When a poor grade of legume hay is used, or in some cases even when good alfalfa is fed which has been grown on calcium - deficient soil, cattle will show a ravenous appetite for old rags, bones, sticks, or dirt and if there is not a phosphorus deficiency, limestone will correct the deficiency immediately. It should be remembered, however, that limestone has absolutely no nutritive value other than supplying mineral. In the case of the phosphorus deficiency, steamed bone meal or rock phosphate will correct the condition. There are several kinds of limestone on the market. Feeding limestone, known as such, is finely ground lime containing 95 to 99 per cent calcium carbonate. There is a product marketed by the feed companies handling the above known as agricultural limestone. While not as finely ground, yet containing 95 per cent or more cal - cium carbonate, this product sells at enough lower price to make its purchase justifiable. Do not feed limestone containing more than 1 to 2 per cent of magnesium or flora n. Nearly all feed concerns handle limestone and there are two companies operating in Nebraska at the present time. The best grade product retails at $1.00 per hundred pounds. One-tenth pound per head daily is sufficient to do the job </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION and it caii be fed in a box or spread over the feed. Bone meal also makes a good mineral supplement and has the added advantage over limestone of containing phosphorus; however, bone meal is less pal - atable than limestone. Question Number 8: Can you suggest a good mineral mixture for cattle? A good mineral mixture for cattle or any other class of farm animal can be made as follows: ground limestone 40 per cent, bone meal 4 0 per cent, and salt 20 per cent. If it is not desirable to use bone meal, wood ashes can be used, or a mixture containing 60 per cent limestone and 40 per cent salt Is satisfactory where no phos - phorus deficiency exists. Either of these mixtures can be fed in a box available to the animals at all times, but salt should be supplied in addition -to the mixture. Question Number 9: How does the tonnage yield of Atlas sorgo compare to that of corn under Nebraska conditions? At Lincoln last year (1932) the Animal Husbandry Department secured a yield of 10% tons per acre of corn silage from 60-bushel corn. The yield of Atlas sorgo was 13% tons per acre. This year (1933) corn yielded 6.18 tons of silage and Atlas sorgo 16.26 tons of silage per acre. Both crops were grown in the same field under similar conditions. A questionnaire sent to some 20 Nebraska farmers who grew Atlas this year showed that corn yielded 46 per cent as much tonnage per acre as Atlas. These data came from 13 counties with Boyd, Dakota, and Cherry on the north and Lincoln county on the west. The average yield of Atlas sorgo was 13% tons and of corn 6 1-3 tons per acre. Question Number 10: What is the comparative feeding value of Atlas and corn silage? We promise a rather conclusive answer to this question next spring when the present experiment Is completed. On the basis ot one test completed last year, Atlas silage produced 92 per cent as much total gain on steer calves as corn silage. However, the calves consumed more Atlas and, therefore, produced only 86 per cent as much gain per ton of feed consumed as corn silage. In spite of this fact, Atlas sorgo, because of a greater yield, produced 10 per cent more beef per acre than the corn silage. Question Number 11: How does Atlas fodder compare to Atlas silage in feeding value? We have conducted only one experiment along this line and the results are reported in cattle circular 134. In this test Atlas fodder </seg>
            <seg id="p554">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE prouuced 62 per cent as much gain as Atlas silage. On a per-acre basis, the fodder produced 40 per cent less gain per acre than Atlas silage. These data are rather significant and are probably explained by the fact that most of the Atlas seed, being hard and rather small, goes through the steer In the undigested state. Where fed in silage, this kernel is fairly well soaked up and is more efficiently utilized by the digestive tract. Question Number 12: How do heifer calves respond to a silage ration as compared to steer calves? In a test which we conducted last winter, heifer calves made 1.4 pounds of gain daily on silage and alfalfa. This was exactly the same gain that was made by steer calves. They consumed slightly less feed and, therefore, produced a pound of gain somewhat cheaper than the steers. They did not gain as rapidly during the summer on a full feed of corn on grass as steers but more efficiently. As a result, the total feed bill was somewhat less than for steer calves. They sold for 15 cents per hundred less than steers, and Inasmuch as they had cost $2 per hundred less, showed considerably more margin of profit than the steer calves. The difference in returns per head was due more to the relatively narrower spread between fat heifers and fat steers rather than to gaining proclivities. Question Number 13: How do yearling steers respond to a silage ration ? In a test conducted last year, yearling steers gained 3 5 per cent more than steer calves. They consumed 38.5 per cent more feed and, therefore, were not quite so efficient in the production of a pound of gain. After they went on grass with grain they made good ga,ns and, figured over the entire period, they returned a good price for the silage they had consumed during the summer and corn during the winter. This method of feeding offers some possibilities. Another question which is quite frequently asked during the spring months Is whether or not half-fat cattle can be turned to grass when receiving a full feed of corn. It would, of course, be folly to turn cattle of this kind on grass without any grain. Last year cattle that had been fed corn and alfalfa for 150 days in dry lot were turned on grass and given a full feed of corn and compared to steers which were fed in dry lot, handled the same way during the winter. Briefly, there was no difference either in economy of gain or rate of gain between the two groups of steers. Practically speaking, we traded Brass for hay. That is about the only advantage to be derived from such practice. Other questions such as the advisability of grinding shelled, ear, </seg>
            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION or snapped corn for yearling steers will be answered at our next spring cattle feeders' meeting. We have some data on this subject at the present time but feel that we should have more before making very many definite statments. At present, however, It does not appear that the grinding of shelled corn especially is going to prove profitable in any way. BEEF CONDITIONS IN THE CONSUMING CENTERS OF THE EAST D. M. HILDEBRAND, Seward I wish to outline to you the route our finished cattle must take when sold at the consuming centers of the East (where some twenty - five percent of our population exists) where same meets other com - petitive food commodities in a large way. No doubt every live stock man in the corn belt has his own opinion as to the cause for the very low price that our beef has been selling for during the past year. I am sure if it was possible for him to follow same through to the consuming centers of the East, as I did during the month of December, he no doubt would change his mind on certain phases of the wholesale and retail end of the business. He would also probably get Information that would convince him that he was wrong In numerous other ways, in which he felt the producer had been taken advantage ot by the processor and the retailer. I appreciate the processor and the retailer are in a more favorable position to regulate their business than the producer, from the fact thattiiey can do business from day to day and average out their prices on a basis that will ultimately show a profit when the month or the year has past. If the processor must take a subsantlal loss on his purchases one day, he of course makes every attempt the next day to lower his buying cost in order that he might average out in the selling of his live stock. The average producer usually has only a few market times during the year, consequently he does not have the opportunity to take advantage of the up-turns in the market from time to time. It was my privilege to accompany other gentlemen on a trip East to investigate and study market conditions. We were permitted to see and assist in the buying of cattle on the Chicago market on December 4th. We saw a part of these same cattle killed in Chicago and prepared for the Eastern markets. The other part of the cattle were shipped alive to New York to be held there until our arrival so that we could see them killed, placed In the cooler there side by side with the cattle that were killed in Chicago, and sold to the retail butchers. . It might be interesting to you to know that about 25% of the </seg>
            <seg id="p556">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE total purchase of cattle In Chicago is consumed in or around Chicago. The average weekly buy of one of the large packers there runs around 9,000 to 12,000 per week. This same packer kills throughout the United States from 40,000 to 50,000 per week. During the year 1932 this same packer killed 1,705,939 cattle, not Including calves. For the same period during 1933 they killed 2,005,433. Calves killed in 1932 were 1,259,289. In 1933 the calves killed were 1.380,825. Sheep killed during 1932 were 5,731,309 and for' the same period during 1933 were 5,533,295. You will note that there was a substantial in - crease in the number of cattle and a decrease in the number of sheep, which accounts for the low price of cattle and the higher price for sheep. Our cattle population has Increased some ten million head since 1929 and with the buying power of the public lower, we can all appreciate the pressure that must be brought to bear at the dis - tributing centers in order to get into consumption this increase. It might be of interest to you to know that there has been a very large Increase in the sausage trade and cooked meats. This may be accounted for by the small apartment house or from the fact that the housewife prefers to have her meat cooked, If possible, in order to save time and labor. I presume it is generally understood that sausage and other cooked meats are not made out of fat beef, but must be made out of canners and cutters. The reason for this Is that fat steers will not absorb the water and other ingredients that go into this sausage and cooked meats, like the canners and cutters will. When the live stock receipts are received from all of the principal markets of the United States and the Eastern markets report on dressed beet conditions, buying orders of course go out to the various markets suggesting to them how the purchases should be made in ordor to meet the demands of the consuming centers of the East. The fact remains that the buying public regulates in a large measure what they are willing to pay for any food commodity, and of course the larger centers dominate this price, in a large measure, on account of the great amount that they are able to put into consumption, and of course, where there Is a surplus of any food commodity it makes a buyers' market instead of a sellers' market. I was interested to note that beef killed in the West- on Monday or Tuesday, that was shipped to the Eastern markets to be placed on sale the following week, went into consumption on the Friday follow - ing, at some price. It seems to be an unwritten law by all of the packers that their branch houses must be cleared by this time in ordor to take on the next week's supply that is already on the road. There are a lot of angles that must be taken into consideration </seg>
            <seg id="p557">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION with reference to by-products. One of these is on hides. The question was raised whether It would be to the advantage of our catt'e people if the tariff on hides was raised. We were told that in exchange for our hides, where we could sell automobiles on which the labor was around 50% while the labor on hides figured about 15%, if we could make these automobiles and keep labor employed we could well afford to forego the high tariff on hides on this account. We were told that the labor costs in order to process the raw material •war, about 9% and that since the N. R. A. the labor cost has gone up to 17%%, which of course has been detrimental to the producer in that the Increased cost has been passed right back to the sellers of live. - stock. On our arrival In Washington, D. C. we found that their branch markets opened about 3:30 A. M. Washington uses a good grade of beef. They prefer a dressed carcass weighing from 600 to 700 pounds, and can use a few heavier carcasses. The good steer beef the market was supplied with at that time practically all came from the West and the retailer was paying from 8c to 9c, where the entire carcass wa'j purchased. Where same was cut up and he bought the choice parts, he was paying around 12c per pound. After going through the branch houses, the retail markets were visited, in which all classes of food products are sold and made attractive to the housewife. These marketing centers are made up of small stalls in which a large percent of the meats are sold over the ' telephone. In visiting with one butcher, who claimed he had been in the retail business in Washington for some 54 years (and of course many changes have taken place during that period), he seemed to feel that since the advent of the chain store it has changed the methods of retailing meat to a considerable extent. The tendency has been to smaller cuts, competition has been keener, the spread between wholesale and retail price has been lowered, and the entire retail structure has been changed, in which he claimed it was hard for the independent to compete with the chain store on account of their large purchasing power. However, in contacting another retailer, who operated his own shop without any additional help, he seenied to feel that he was able to compete with the chain in that he did not employ any labor and was not affected by the N. R. A. In this respect. It was also interesting to note that in certain shops in Washington there was a trade that demanded certain cuts of beef that had to be supplied from New York City. This, of course, was to meet the demands of certain people, regardless of first cost. In Baltimore we found conditions somewhat different than in Washington. Certain branch houses there we found in direct com- </seg>
            <seg id="p558">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE petition with another branch house owned and operated by the same packer. We were told that a branch house that supplied hotels and restaurants had a different class of trade entirely from the branch house that supplied retail purchasers with the whole carcass. In one of these branch houses the carcass was cut to suit the purchaser who paid a little higher price than the retailer who purchased the whole carcass. You will also find in Baltimore a packing plant operated by one *. of the packers who also is in direct competition with the branch houses that are supplied from western markets. In going through this pack - ing house it was interesting to note that the beef had a different color and a different texture than our Western beef. It had a yellow cast as a general rule and could be distinguished invariably when placed side by side with our good corn-fed Western beef. This beef, of ".ourse, came from close by territory and was fed entirely different than our Western cattle, as a general rule. In Baltimore, of course, all meat products must come in com - petition with all kinds of sea foods, which are numerous. On arrival In New York City we were told that there were some 34 market centers throughout the City, besides all of the chain stores who operated Independently, and thousands of Independent butchers. When you go down one of these market streets, which run from one to three blocks in length, you will find a branch house and probably right by Its side you wiU find a broker who handles beef on consign - ment; some from the same branch house and also beef from some interior packer. Upon inquiry it was learned that this broker usually cuts his beef up and sells it to some small butcher, whom the large packer would not credit, and in this way puts Into consumption a large amount of beef which probably would not go into consumption otherwise. New York City, being of course the largest city in the United States, each and every packer is interested in putting into consumption every bit of the surplus that he has available. Some six years ago chain stores were organized. One of these chains, which Is the largest In the United States, operates some 850 meat shops in New York district alone. Throughout the country they have some 4,600 stores altogether. When you stop to realize that they only started their meat department some six years ago, which has grown now to the point where they use some two and one-half to three million pounds of meat products per week, you can better visualize the buying power that a concern of this kind has. We were advised that 35% of this three million pounds represented beef, 15% lamb and 15% pork. They insist on a carcass ot 600 to 700 pounds, in which all of their stores are supplied from one </seg>
            <seg id="p559">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION center and as a rule all of the beef is cut and ready to be disposed of when placed on sale In their meat shops. The average purchase made by the housewife is 60c. 47% of the meat business is done the last few days of the week. This same chain employs around 60,000 people and the average cost of their beef the last week in November was $10.33 per hundred. Their average selling price was $16.18 per hundred. During the week we were there they had on sale 700,000 pounds of rib roast which was being sold at a average price of l ! 7c per pound. In order to put on one of these sales we were advised that they must accumulate this amount over a period of approximately three weeks. You can appreciate that where they demand a carcass weighing an average of 600 to 700 pounds, this represents only about 15% of the available supply, leaving the 85% for the independent retailer, who must make his purchases accordingly In order to get same Into consumption. We were given to understand that their selling cost represents about 24%. In addition to this large amount of meat products sold they handle approximately one and one-half million pounds of fish per week. They have only been handling fish for a period of two years. I was interested in noting wholesale prices on pork loins were 15c on December 1st and when I was there it was 8V£c per pound. We were informed that when the N. R. A. went into effect it increased the operating expense of this one chain thirteen million dollars. This was passed on to the consumer, which is quite different than when the processing tax went into effect, for them It was passed back to the producer. On a Friday after leaving Chicago we inspected the live cattle that had been shipped to tho United Dressed Meat Company in New York City, which by the way was started in 1846 and is now being operated by the third generation of the same family. They kill approximately 2.200 head of cattle, 4,000 calves and 30,000 sheep per week. All of this live stock Is shipped in, unloaded at Jersey City and floated around to the packing house on the East river, which is almost in the heart, of the City. They have no yards to hold their live stock in as we do in the West, but have pens in the basement of the packing house. At this particular packing house they kill Kosher beef twice a week. This market demands the best beef available and ot course is handled entirely different from the way animals are killed in the West. In the first place, in this particular packing plant there are some twenty-five rabbis employed representing the Orthodox Jewish Church. The animal Is prepared for slaughter, is strung up and is never knocked In the head, but one of the rabbis washes the neck and the other cuts the throat of the animal. As soon as the animal has </seg>
            <seg id="p560">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE bled to death it is skinned and examined. If the liver or lungs have grown to the ribs of the animal, same is condemned as unfit for their food. After the lung has been removed from the animal it is examined by another rabbi and inflated the same as you do an automobile tire. If the lung leaks it Is also condemned. They have numerous other tests they put the animal to before it is branded as being fit for consumption. After it has passed all of the tests, It is then marked with their brand on the inside of the animal, and the date and hour that same was killed or. the inside also. Understand, they only use the four quarters, the first four ribs and the plate of the animal. The rest of the beef must be sold on another market. They like their beef hot — In fact some of these same cattle we saw slaughtered in the afternoon went into consumption that night. All of the beef must be eaten fresh, within seventy-two hours. If not consumed within seventy-two hours one of the rabbis wash same in holy water and they then have an additional forty-eight hours to consume same in. Beef that is condemned is called "Trafer", 1 which means "unfit for human consumption". There are numerous small Kosher killing plants and of course, after they have disposed of the four quarters this is offered to some other retailer or wholesaler in order to get same into consumption, which comes in direct competition with the meat that is shipped from the West to the East, which has a tendency also to lower the price In a small way. It was interesting to note the Influence of the Interior packers on the Eastern markets. In the first place, the interior packer does not as a rule operate on the central markets, but buys his raw material direct from the producer, in which he is not subjected to some of the Government regulations that the central market packer is. Furthermore, I learned that the Interior packers in Iowa have a lower freight rate to the consuming centers in the East, than the Missouri River packers have. Generally speaking, these interior packers do not maintain branch houses, but sell direct to the brokers and deliver direct from the car, in which the selling cost is lowered materially. This can only mean one thing — that the central market packers, In order to meet this competition, must in a measure reduce the buying cost on the central market. This all works against the producer. Also, with the large buying power that the chain stores have 11 places another handicap against the producer. I have been a firm believer in that the grading of our beef would help the producer of good beef, but on my arrival In Boston I had to admit that I could not see any advantage in the grading of beef, from the fact that Boston can use the heaviest carcass of any market that a </seg>
            <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION I was in, due to the fact that they bone all of their beef before offering same for sale. They demand a carcass weighing from 800 to 900 pounds and can handle a limited number up to 1,100 pounds. Boston maintains an up-to-date packing plant known as the New England Meat and Wool Company, in which they kill 2,000 cattle and 30,000 sheep per week. • I might state in this connection that they kill a large amount of dairy cattle, which come from the New England States. In Boston is located the home of the second largest chain in the United States. It 'was noticeable that the largest retail market in Boston was giving way to the chain store competition in that there were numerous vacancies in the stalls that were formerly operated by some local butcher. This chain in Boston operates some 2,700 stores, in which they sell meat in 450. Their warehouse covers some four blocks and Is very modern. They dispose of some two million pounds of meat products per week. Beef constitutes 50%, pork 20%, lamb 20% and other meats 10%. They employ 1,000 people in their ware - house and throughout their stores 10,000 people. They bone all of their beef before offering same for sale. I found that the highest priced cut came from the rump. There are about three slices that Bostomans seem to prize highly and for which they are willing to pay a good price. The average price of all the beef sold seemed to be from 19c to 22c retail, and it was also interesting to note that they manufactured a large number of the profitable lines that they sell and apparently they have only picked the choice and best lines in which the largest profits are made, and depend on the processors ot other lines to supply their needs. I also learned that they bought the larger portion of their pork products from the packing plants of Iowa on account of the price. They were paying for the best beef the week we were in Boston, wholesale, $8.75 per hundred. This chain only operates In 1 New England territory. One of the most complete and up-to-date retail markets that I visited was In Lynn, Massachusetts. This man operated four stores, had 1,000 employees and disposed of some four cars of beef per week. Here again same was boned and I believe put up in the most attractive way of any retail market that I visited. On the three choice cuts out of the rump he sold for 65c to 68c per pound, but of course this only amounts to a few pounds. The rest of the carcass ranged from 7%c to 35c per pound. Here again I learned that the branding or grading of beef was of no material benefit to the producer from the fact that the entire carcass was cut up before being offered tor sale through the retail store. This man's trade has been built up entirely on heifer and cow beef, but my understanding is that he buys the best grade of cows and heifers that are available. Just now, however, he is selling all steer beef on account of the cheapness of price. I also learned from this gentleman that when the Government report </seg>
            <seg id="p562">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cumci out which indicated a surplus in the hands of the feeders, he immediately ordered his buyers to purchase nothing but steer beef, which again demonstrates to me that government reports are not to the benefit of the producer, but to the consumer. The facts are, when any article is scarce, the price immediately goes up, which benefits the producer. When you advertise to the world that you have a large surplus of any article, down goes the price, so I am at a loss to know how these Government reports are of any direct benefit to the producer. When you stop to realize that there is brought in for sale at Boston, Glouchester and Portland some fifty-seven million pounds of fish that comes in direct competition with our meat products from the West, you can best realize that It Is Impossible to pass on to the consumer any processing tax or compensating tax that is not levied against a competitive food. They unloaded the day I was in Boston some 500,000 pounds of fish. One load had 147.000 pounds that was being sold wholesale at lc per pound. The highest priced fish that I saw sold wholesale was 2 '/fee per pound. In summing up the competition that our beef must meet on these competitive markets in the East, I am convinced that the packer does not as a rule, make his profit on the consuming centers of the East, but It Is made from the direct car lines which cover the balance of the United States, In which the competition is not so keen as it Is in these market centers. I am also convinced that the direct buying of live stock is a menace to the live stock producers. I believe also that the interior packer should be compelled to operate his plant under the same restrictions, supervision and regulations that now apply to the central markets. I am convinced that the Government should provide a safeguard in whatever way possible to regulate the buying ot the large chain stores in order to maintain a fair competitive market to the producer. Until we have an Advisory Board in which the packer, the live stock interests, the retailer and the marketing agencies are represented, I fall to see how the producer is to get his fair share of the dollar he is entitled to. If the opportunity presents itself to any one of you producers to cover the same territory that I have, I am sure you will find it interesting and enlightening and it will probably give you an entirely different slant on the problem that presents itself in getting Into consumption our meat products. I thank you. HOW I FEED CATTLE AND HOW? ELMER YOUNGS. Lexington. In appearing before this meeting to discuss methods of cattle </seg>
            <seg id="p563">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ■' : ! feeding, I think that it is important for us to understand my position, so that my remarks may be regarded in the correct light, by you. I am a farmer and feeder, and not a commercial feeder, I produce a great deal ot my own feed upon my own land, and while my experiences may have some value In the practical aspects, they in no way compare the findings of the experiment station, In the matter the relative value of different feeds, and my experiences and beliefs can only be con - sidered from the aspects of the judgement as to what Is best to fit the conditions existing upon my farm and In my feedlot. We raise most of our hay and roughage and about 25 percent of our corn. I have been feeding a long time, and I hope to continue for a long time, it has been pleasant and sometimes profitable. My methods are simple, they are similar to those of the experiment station, since I have made it a practice ever since it has been possible to get all the Information that I can on the feeding of cattle as it is put out by this and other experiment stations, and then I study that information, selecting what will fit into my methods and be practical, and judging those methods on the basis of their returns. Any advice that I give will be that, to get the data from the experiment station, other feeders too, and then draw your own conclusions as to whether it will fit your particular circumstances and feeding plant. I have been feeding small cattle a long time, and I believe that you can never get them too small for the feed lot unless they have been weaned from the cows too soon and their growth stunted. I have found in my experience, that the best feed to start calves In the feed lot is ground ear corn. It has been a hobby with me, feeding ground ear corn. I have ground it for forty years, and have always paid close attention to the manner in which the calves took it best, the proper texture and other factors of the feed. I have chauged the burrs of the grinder every few years to get the proper textue. I have another feed, which I grow on my own farm and practically every other feeder and farmer can grow, which I use to balance my rations of corn and alfalfa. That feed Is Barley. I feed a few pounds of ground barley In the ration of each animal during the last 60 to 90 days they are in the lot before going to market. I have found that it puts a bloom on the finished cattle that I have been unable to get in any other way. You have to be careful and a consistent feeder to feed barley, but I am certainly convinced that It is a great feed to feed with corn and alfalfa in the finishing lots. At the Century of Progress in Chicago I saw an exhibit by the Illinois experiment station, advocating a small herd ot beef cows </seg>
            <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ior me forty acre farm. With ten cows a farmer can feed out ten calves. A farm flock of sheep is advocated here In Nebraska, and I think there is nothing that will do more to eliminate the gamble of feeding than a farm flock of sheep, and nothing that will eliminate the gamble of farming and feeding than a small herd of beef cows to produce calves. It sponsors diversity in the farm program. I wish to say in closing that I am guilty as the others here of producing over fat cattle, cattle that are over weight and have a thicker covering of fat than the packer or the retailer desires. Often I find that cattle would have brought just as much earlier on the market as when they were overweight, that of course being due to price changes. Overweight cattle present another marketing problem. One thing more, and that is, the result of the situation that we are In today with low prices and a limited market for our products is going to bring us sooner or later into controlled production in the beef Industry just the same as the economic developments of the past years has brought the wheat and the hog man to controlled production this year. BEEF ROASTING MATILDA PETERS, Lincoln. That the proof of the puddiug Is in the eating applies to no product more than to meat. Not many of us would enjoy eating raw meat and furthermore we like it cooked just as we like it or "done to a turn" as we say. Some housewives fail to get the highest degree of satisfaction from their meat because they do not always select the cooking method best adapted to the particular cut. In beef cuts It Is the relative amount of connective tissue which offers the problem in selecting the method of cooking. Our alms in cooking meat are: (1) To make it tender if it is not tender; to keep it tender if it is tender. (2) To make it more palatable. In general the cuts with little connective tissue are designated as tender cuts, those with much connective tissue or less tender cuts. Con - nective tissue is developed through exercise, therefore the loin and rib muscles which receive very little exercise have very little connective tissue. On the other hand the neck and legs are much exercised and develop con - nective tissue- which classes them as less tender. There - fore different cuts of meat from the same carcass will </seg>
            <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION vary in tenderness as will the same cuts from diirerent animals. Other factors which affect tenderness are age, deposits of fat, "ripening" or aging of meat itself. Now cooking cannot make a superior flavored piece of meat from one of poor quality nor does it always produce a tender piece of meat. Finuh and quality count. However, a poor piece of meat may be improved by selecting the most suitable method. A good piece of meat may be spoiled by the wrong method or time of cooking. In general there are two methods of cooking meat: ( 1 ) By means of dry heat. Roasting Broiling Pan-broiling (2) By means of moist heat. Braising Cooking in water Stewing By roasting we mean cooking by means of dry heat in an open or uncovered pan in an oven without added water. The meat Is placed with the fat side up so it does its own basting as it cooks. Covered roaster used for braising mention early research work done at Illinois in 1906-1907. We may use a high initial temperature for searing and browning the roast and finish cooking at a low temperature or we may use a constant temperature 300°F throughout the cooking period. We used to say that we seared meat to hold in the juices but we know now that the juices are held In just as well without searing. So we may say that searing is a matter of taste and not a matter ot holding in the juices. It really makes little difference whether the browning is done at the beginning, at the end or gradually throughout the cooking period. Browning improves the flavor on the outside of the meat but not on the inside. It also improves the appearance and aroma. This is of greater importance in home where the whole roast comes to the table. Using a constant temperature influences the cooking time. The lower the temperature the longer the time required for cooking. The constant temperature reduces the cooking losses, the higher the temperature the greater the loss in weight of the roast. This is ot special interest to managers of hotels, restaurants and cafeterias in that the smaller the shrinkage of the roast, the greater the number of servings. </seg>
            <seg id="p566">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Tho higher temperature also means greater fuel consumption which is an Important item when gas or electricity is used. The high temperature at the beginning means that about 40% of the total fuel consumed Is used for preheating the oven and searing. The higher temperature shortened the time required, for cooking, but the fuel cost was greater. An important problem In roasting meat Is determining the degree of doneness. Tables giving time per pound for roasting meat to various stages of doneness as 15 minutes per pound for rare, 20 minutes for medium and 25 for well done are not very reliable. The degree of doneness will be Influenced by (1) the cooking temperature, (2) proportion of fat and lean, (3) size of roast, heavy roast requires less time per pound, (4) shape or contour roast, (5) whether roast Is boned or the bone left In. The meat thermometer has been devised for giving us an accurate picture of how we may expect the meat to look on the inside. The point of the thermometer must be placed as near the center as possible, shortest distance thru center thru thickest part of meat, because in order to be of value, the thermometer must be used correctly. The thermometer makes it possible to always have the meat just as one likes it — whether rare, medium or well-done. In summarizing we may say that In roasting beef we should (1) select a suitable cut, (2) cook it in an uncovered pan fat side up with or without preliminary searing. Do not add water. (3) Use a low temperature, (4) Use of meat thermometer for accurate results. RETAILERS PROBLEMS ERNEST BUFFET, Omaha. It has been my privilege to be quite closely connected with, the University of Nebraska and I am very glad to come here and depart with any knowledge that I may have which might assist the University In making its program more interesting and valuable to you feeders and livestock men. Im the last man that handles your product before the housewife puts it thru her process of cooking for her table. I might mention that 1 believe the National Meat board is a great help to your industry and to the retailers also. It has been my privilege to put out 1000 copies every year of their little booklet telling the methods of cooking and preparing meat and the use of the less tender cuts of meat as well as factors In the selection and buying of good quality meat and the right cuts. The board Is a great help to the retailer and the consumer and indirectly benefits the producer. One time a feeder, from between Lincoln and Omaha came into my store and priced porter house steak which was at that time, 45 </seg>
            <seg id="p567">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION cents per pound. He blew up and demanded to know why I should charge 45 a pound for the porterhouse when he was selling cattle on the south Omaha market for $8.25 per cwt. So I got interested and one day I went to South Omaha to find out. I bought an 880 pound beef in the yards and In the final analysis I am now making a net profit of 1 cent a pound on beef. This 880 pound steer was put thru the packing house and came out as follows: Hide 50 pounds, hoofs horns bones, 25 pounds, intrals 125 pounds. Total offal 345 pounds. Shrink In cooler 19 pounds. 1 received a 516 pound carcass. The 516 pound carcass cut up as follows: 'i wo chucks, 136 pounds of which 21% pounds went into scraps. Ribs 49 pounds 17 pounds scraps. Two rounds 130 pounds 14 pounds scraps. Loins 80 pounds 15 pounds scraps. Flanks 30 pounds 7 pounds scraps. Kidney fats 20 pounds 18 pounds waste. Sold 420 pounds of meat. 94 pounds of waste at 1 cent a pound. i That is why porter house and the higher quality cuts of meat are higher priced. They have to carry the loss of the waste and offal and help pay for the less popular cuts of meat which must be sold cheap to be moved at all. The price of beef is all leveled out by demand. It is a great game to be able to equalize all the way down the line of demand and the different cuts of meat as to quality. If we sold chucks at all in our store we would have to raise the price of porterhouse so that we could put the chucks way down and attract trade from a greater distance. I always make It a point to buy one or two four-H club beeves to help the four-H club movement.To the four-H club feeders and to others too, I say don't put too much weight on the animals, the fat waste is terrific. The retailer don't want too much fat simply because the customer comes in with the kick that a cut is too much fat meat. Don't overfeed your beeves, let them rest and send them to market whan they are fat and well finished but not too heavy. HILDEBRAND: Would you Mr. Buffet, be in favor of an advisory board composed of representatives of the packers, retail market men, cattle men, hog men, that is proposed to work out with the secretary of agriculture a plan to aid the meat industries? </seg>
            <seg id="p568">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE That might be a shot in the arm at the start, such a control plan, that would stimulate the market for a temporary time, but competitors of mine control my market and we must get back to a basis of supply and demand. Whenever they get to a plan ot control to set my profit at what the average is, and the price on the averages of consumer ability to pay and try to control a uniform price and merchandising system, I'm not interested. I'll turn the key in the lock when that comes and go off fishing. LOOSE ENDS H. J. GRAMLICH, Lincoln. The cocoanut oil and copra importation problem looms right now as one of the Important of the times. The Imported oils displace the lard market that would otherwise be supplied by 16,000,000 head of hogs In our country alone. In the cotton plan the reduction on cotton called for a reduction in cottonseed oil output and the cotton men said allright if it will help the hog men, but we (The cotton growers) are not interested if it will mean that much more importation of foreign food oils and fats. Do as has been suggested in the meeting, write your congressmen and senators, bring this to their attention and we will try to get some action out of congress. . Secretary Wallace wants us to instigate the action from this end of the line. The officers will take matters on this point up with influential interests that will aid the fight. Creep feed your calves, there is nothing like getting a young bunch of calves started on their feed while they are still running with their mothers. It Is a cheap gain, can easily be put on and starts them out right so that there is not as great a loss when they go Into the feed lot. I say amen to what has been said by Elmer Youngs on the farm flock of sheep. They certainly will make themselves known In clean - ing up roughages and can be finished very easily. Keep your mind on sorghums, plant three or four of your odd acres to sorghums and feed It to your horses in the winter if nothing else, rather than have them running out on pasture of stalks and straw stacks. Here Is a marketing problem the cattleman has had to fight represented in the highest market prices of the last few years, always occurring in January. The year 1930, January was the top with $15.00. The year 1931, January was the top with $13.00: </seg>
            <seg id="p569">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The year 1932, January was the top with $11.00. The year 1933, January was the top with $7.00. The year 1934, January comes with a top of $6.00. A progressive situation of this sort is leading us toward controlled production in the beef Industry. We hope for an Immediate change in this aspect before another year is over. Here is what may be in prospect for the meat man. There are now about 1,000,000 head of old cows held in production because they have mortgages against them and the owners or the mortgagors would not let them go to market and take the loss because the chances are not a great deal worse on holding them. It Is now proposed to appropriate a $300,000,000 fund to buy up these old cows and take them out of production. They would be put in tin cans and concerved for relief purposes during the next few years. While we heard mentioned the use of meat as a reducing diet, it is interesting to note that Dr. Campbell of the Rush medical college recently made public a report showing that 6 very obese subjects were fed 1 % pounds of lean beef per day for a reducing ration and lost unbelievably large poundages in the course of a few months. We have heard of quack reducing methods for a long time and now science comes forward with the use of lean beef as a reducing diet, which may, if popularized, result in a slight stimulation of consumption. Finally I say with others that It is time that the hogmen, cattlemen, dairymen, soybean and cotton growers got together, instead of fighting each other and present a united front on the oil import problem. We musL bury the hatchet. THE COCONUT OIL PROBLEM AND AMERICAN AGRICULTURE Address before livestock feeders of Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska at Shenandoah, Iowa, December, 12, 1933 by H. J. GRAMLICH. Gentlemen: It is indeed a pleasure to appear for a few moments on your program. I consider it a high honor to have been invited to address this serious-minded body of men representing the most vital cogwheel in the agricultural welfare of the United States. The animals you produce are selling at prices much below the cost of production. You and the industry which you represent stand with backs to the wall. You are seeking enlightenment as to what can be done to help the plight in which you find yourselves engulfed. The placing of a loan value of 45 cents per bushel on corn, the major feed used in the fattening of livestock and of which the three states represented in this meeting produce annually one-third of the nation's entire crop, has brought this problem to a crisis somewhat more </seg>
            <seg id="p570">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE quickly than It might otherwise have come. With no thought of criticizing the fixing of the loan value of corn, "but rather agreeing that under present conditions 45 cents is about the right basic price for corn and that were other agricultural commodities selling in proportion we would have a fair degree of prosperity throughout this wonderful inland empire and our farmers would again become buyers of industry's products, I appear before you and will in the few minutes assigned to me confine my remarks to one particular factor which I feel has a very close bearing upon the problem in hand and to which I think we should give concentrated thought. COCONUT OIL IMPORTATIONS DETRIMENTAL TO UNITED STATES AGRICULTURE I refer to the importation of coconut oil into this country. The growth of this industry is stupendous. Unless you have had an op - portunity to see and study the statistics, you can scarcely comprehend the tremendous expansion which has taken place during recent years in the importation of this commodity. When I say to you that it is literally undermining the interests of every agriculturist in the land, I mean every word I utter. A few years ago we thought this was a problem for the dairyman to wrestle with. When he tore his hair over the oleomargarine situation, we sat contentedly by and felt that it was merely a display of jealousy on his part over the use of some of our by-product fats in butter substitutes. While he might have been a little narrow in some of his fights a few years back, I have reached the conclusion that the folks representing the hog and beef cattle industry can be justly criticized for having been asleep. At that time we had a foreign market for our surplus lard. We, seemingly, had ample places to put our tallow. In so far as the animal fats were concerned, we were not worrying. Today we waken from our long sleep and find that we have quite a decided headache. Our foreign outlet for animal fats has been cut off and we start to Investigate where our home market has gone. One of the first Intruders Is found to be the coconut. The growth of the coconut oil Industry In the Philippine Islands has been stupendous during the past 25 years, the acreage planted to coconut trees having been trebled since 1910. All coconut oil importations during recent years have been from the Philippine Islands and the majority of the copra which has entered the United States has likewise originated from that source. COPRA AND COCONUT ODL — FREEDOM FROM DUTY As you look at the statistics presented in the attached table per - taining to the importation of coconut products, you will find that they are listed under two heads — namely, copra and coconut oil. In </seg>
            <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION order that you may be clear on this, permit me to say that copra is dried meat of the coconut. This contains, on an average, 63 per cent coconut oil, the oil being removed after the copra reaches the United States. For purposes of clarity in my remarks, I am going to give total coconut oil imported, using the oil imported as such added to the oil content of the copra. May I say that there is no duty on copra. Coconut oil comes in from the Philippine Islands duty free and from other than United States possessions carries a duty of 2 cents per pound. According to my sources of information, during recent years all of the coconut oil imported as such has come from the Philippines; consequently, entered the United States duty free; and most of the copra has come from there. In other words, our government collects relatively little revenue from the coconut oil im - ported into the United States. IMPORTS SHOW ASTONISHING INCREASE During the four-year period 1909-13, the average importation of coconut oil Into the United States was 76 million pounds per year. During the next five years, 239 million; the next five years, 425 million: the next, 514 million; and during the last five years, 1928 - 33, the average has been 679 million pounds, or an increase of 8.9 times in the short span of a quarter of a century. To make matters worsf. the figures obtained since the new fiscal year began on July 1 are alarming. In 1932 during the months of July, August, and September, coconut oil was imported to the extent ot 152 million pounds. During the same three months this year, 280 million pounds of coconut oil have been imported. Should this same increase hold throughout the remaining nine months of the fiscal year, the importa - tions for the 12-month period would be 1,056,000,000 pounds, or by far the largest on record. COCONUT On, DISPLACING ANIMAL FATS IN MARGARINE MANUFACTURE You may wonder whether coconut oil is a competitor of beef tallow and lard. To clarify my point on this, let me take you back a few years. In 1914 the average of the oleomargarine produced contained 74 per cent animal fat and 26 per cent vegetable, or, In round figures, 3 parts animal and 1 part vegetable fat. In 1931 the oleomargarine contained, on an average, 19 parts animal and 81 parts vegetable; practically speaking, 1 part animal to 4 parts vegetable. What about the vegetable oil content of margarine in 1914 and 1931? In 1914 margarine contained three-tenths of one per cent coconut oil. In 1931 coconut oil, on an average, embodied 66.8 per cent of the content of margarine. Cottonseed oil in 1914 made up 20 per cent of the content of margarine; in 1931, but 9 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p572">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thus we see a tremendous expansion in the use of coconut oil in the margarine industry and a very drastic reduction in the use of animal oil and our own United States-produced cottonseed oil.

            <seg id="p573">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION been striving to overcome certain deficiencies of coconut oil in order that they might use it in their business. I understand that as a result of new improvements In processing, coconut oil can be used successfully In lard compounds and there is a potential, if not an actual, usage of 160 million pounds per year in this field. EXPANSION OF COPRA AND COCONUT OIL IMPORTATIONS INTO UNITED STATES Annual Importations by Flve-Year Averages (In terms of total coconut oil) 1909-1933 (fiscal years July 1 - June 30) UNITED STATES FATS AND OILS VS. COCONUT OIL IN SOAP MAKING Needless to say, coconut oil serves one of its major functions in the technical field where it is used in soap manufacturing. Coconut oil &gt;s without question a splendid constituent for certain types of soaps needed at the present time. However, inedible animal greases and home-produced vegetable oils surely would be used to a; much greater extent in soap manufacturing if coconut oil were less | acces - sible. COCONUT OIL IMPORTATION IN TERMS OF ANIMAL FAT 1 do not want to worry you with too many figures and, therefore, am going to use a few Illustrations which may help to impress on your minds the significance of these coconut oil importations during recent months and their effect on our industry - namely, that of the home - produced animal fats. The markets of the United States today are flooded with prime long-fed yearling steers weighing 1000 pounds. Each of these steers produces, conservatively, 100 pounds of rendered fat. This Includes killing fats, kidney fats, retailers' trimmings, etc. The coconut oil which has come into this country during the three - month period July, August, September 1933 amounts to the fat pro - duced by three million 1000-pound prime steers, or, putting it on a per month basis, one million steers per month. Normally there are about nine million cattle and four and one-halt million calves slaughtered under federal inspection per year in the United States. In terms of 200-pound hogs, producing 30 pounds of rendered lard per head, we see that the coconut oil imported into this country during the three-month period mentioned is equivalent to the lard produced by nine million hogs, or at the rate of three million hogs per month. The normal annual hog slaughter In the United States at federally - inspected plants approximates 45 million head, or slightly under four million per month. Consequently, the coconut oil imported during </seg>
            <seg id="p574">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE recent months has amounted to three-fourths as much as the normal monthly lard production. - CHART II 279,764,000 lbs. i •■''■'. \ 152,510,00p lbs. . Coconut Oil Importations 3-Month Period - July, August, September 1932 compared to July, August, September 1933 AMERICAN FARMER CAN'T COMPETE WITH PHILIPPINE LABOR I am calling your attention to this problem not only with the thought that the tremendous development which has been made de - mands serious thought, but that the future holds seemingly almost unlimited possibilities for its expansion. In 1931 there were 65 million coconut trees In bearing in the Philippine Islands and there were an additional 35 million planted and ready to come into bearing soon. In other words, only two-thirds of the trees were In bearing. A coco - nut tree comes Into bearing when about five years old. It reaches full production when ten years of age, and, like the human, lives to a ripe old age, the span of life ranging from 60 to 100 years. Just think of the amount of coconut oil which can be dumped into the United States in the short span of a few years! We must bear in mind that the tropical conditions existent in the areas where coco - nuts are produced are conducive to tremendous production of vegeta- </seg>
            <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION tive growth and oils - Intense heat, rainfall ranging from 5^ 10 200 inches, and a sandy soil adapted to the purpose. Add to these things an abundance of cheap labor and an occasional monkey to shake the coconuts off the trees and you have a picture with which the American farmer cannot compete and maintain the standard of living which we feel he so highly deserves for himself and his family as citizens ot the United States of America. COTTON REDUCTION AND FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOS, COCONUT OIL A few weeks ago I had a conversation with a man vitally interested in the cotton business of the South. He made the statement that the proposed reduction in cotton acreage next year would result in a de - crease in cottonseed oil production equivalent to the lard produced by 16 million head of 200-pound hogs. Bear in mind that with each bale of cotton there are produced 150 pounds of cottonseed oil. This gentleman went on to state that in case the reduction helped the hog producers of the Corn Belt, he felt confident the southern farmers would he pleased, but that if it developed that a tew more thousand boatloads ot coconut oil came in duty free from the Philippine Islands to take the place of the cottonseed oil taken out of production, he doubted whether the nation as a whole would materially benefit. ALL AGRICULTURE MUST STICK TOGETHER Gentlemen, I am wondering whether we have not been so engrossed in solving our own problems that we might be said to have looked so much at the tree that we failed to see the forest. I believe: this problem is one of vital importance to every phase of agriculture. I think we should agree upon a united program and stick together. This Is vital to you beef and hog men, it is vital to the dairymen! who are witnessing a drastic reduction In the price of butterfat which they are selling at a figure far below the cost of production. It affects the cotton farmer; it affects the corn farmer because corn oil can have a material value If given a chance. Furthermore, the corn farmer might . grow soybeans for oil were there an incentive for so doing. This problem affects each and every one of us. A SERIOUS PROBLEM We are gathered together with a constructive thought in mind. We do not mean to be destructive. We have no thought ot partisan affiliations. This coconut oil problem is a cancer which has been eating into the vital organs of the American farmer for a quarter of a century. Let's pull together and see if some constructive action cannot be taken, to head off this octopus which seems to be intent upon strangling the very life blood from us. Let's study this problem and help work out a solution for it. </seg>

LETTERS FROM WINNERS OF CLUB WEEK TRIPS Dori.: Hanson. Lincoln, Nebraska: I certainly wish to thank you for my prize trip to club week. It was the most enjoyable week I've ever spent. It was a climax to my career as a club member and the first trip I've ever won. The trip was educational in every way. Very fine speakers spoke to us during the week. George C. Farrell, chief of the wheat section in the AAA at Washington spoke to us on the advantages of farm life and traced the development of the 4-H clubs. Director Brokaw and Paul Stewart also spoke to us on the AAA. Fine musical programs were heard every morning and we enjoyed the fevoup singing led by Mr. Diers. Our visit to the capitol was great and we have a building that we can be mighty proud of. It seems that every little piece of mateiial put into it has some meaning or symbol. That Is the way with club week. Every body comes with a purpose and the spirit to have a good time. The picnic at Antelope Park, the visit to the museum, the carillon concert, the banquets and programs sponsored by the University 4-H club were certainly enjoyed by all. I know they will all hold a big part in our memory of club week. On Friday we visited Omaha. The first place was the Armour packing company, after which we had lunch at the Livestock Exchange. In the afternoon we visited the World Herald Newspaper Co., and attended a show at the Orpheum theatre. A dinner and program at the Chamber of Commerce drew this busy day to a close and It was one of the best. I cannot express In words what this trip meant to me, but hope other boys and girls will win this trip and enjoy it as much as I. NORMAN WEITKAMP, Nlckerson, Nebraska Ever since the day that the 1933 club week had closed I was hoping that by some chance or other I would find a way to finance 19 - </seg>
            <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE my way to the 1934 meeting. Thanks to the Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Associa - tion, just such an ambition became possible. It came as a reward for being the lucky winner of Nebraska's 1933 meat judging and identification contest. Since that time I have looked forward with eagerness to the opening of 1934 club week — I knew that it was to be an enjoyable one. Now that it is over, that everything Is but a memory, I find it difficult to express myself. Monday morning found me registered ready and eager to start that eventful and enjoyable week. Even the abnormal temperature couldn't keep me from enjoying myself every minute of my stay. I shall not attempt to cover the trip In detail. I do wish to say, however, that a program crammed so full of good times, banquets, entertainments, etc., shouldn't just attract the 2 25 members that were present, but every loyal 4-H member and leader in the state. With such speakers as George Farrell, Chancellor E. A. Burnett, Brokaw, Paul Stewart, Dean Burr, and all the others, it was just impossible not to enjoy one's self. Then with the music of T. C. Dlers we were always kept ready to go, eager for more of whatever was offered in the way of educational lectures. Those concerning the philosophy of the AAA seemed especially appropriate — not only did they give me a better idea of the workings of our own national government, but instilled a spirit of security and satisfaction in me that may have been badly shaken during this great economic crisis. Among the other entertainments given us that stand foremost in my mind were the University 4-H program during which the 20th anniversary of Nebraska 4-H work was given special recognition. Then there was the Play "Ylmmle Yohnson's Yob" which was pre - sented to us almost In perfection — to say the least I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and I wish to express my appreciation to those who gave of their time and energy that our visit In Lincoln might have been so enjoyable. There was the Lincoln and Omaha Chamber of Commerce banquets and programs — -both were especially enjoyable, entei taining, and educational. The trip to Omaha on Friday was to me the high light of the entire trip. It was educational; it was a lot of fun, and it left me in just such a frame of mind to go home happy, to broadcast to other 4-H members just what i state club week really means and offers and left me ready and anxious to come back for more next year. Now in closing I wish to again express my sincere thanks to the Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association. I trust that as one of their representatives I have conducted myself so that they </seg>

            <seg id="p591">Soil Preparation for Potatoes MARX KOEHNKE, Alliance Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative The preparation of the soil for the planting of potatoes is an art in the true sense ot the word. If the potato grower wishes to have plenty of moisture in his field at the time of planting, so that an ex - cellent stand can be secured, so that the crop advances rapidly, he must start to B prepare for his potato crop long before planting time. One of the most successful practices followed by potato farmers In the conser - vation of soil moisture, is early prepara - tion of the soil. Several methods are used, some done in early spring, and others In the fall. The principal objection to the methods of soil preparation in the fall is the fact that it leaves an open Held dur - ing the winter, resulting In soil drifting, and loss of snow. The usual method Is spring working by means of an early dlsc- M\RX KOEHNKE lng - w * tn most farmers, this operation Is Alliance. Nebraska performed about the time the first growth of weeds commences to show, which re - sults in destroying this crop of weeds. Thorough work at this time is essential, and has a direct relation to the final results. Double discing is usually practiced, though single discing is much better than no disc - ing. Seldom is it necessary to do this operation a second time, unless heavy rains pack the soil, and a heavy growth of weeds starts. In western Nebraska this is a rare occurence. It is usually inadvisable to follow the discing with a harrow, be - cause a rough surface Is most desirable, as It prevents the top soil drifting with the wind. With all farming operations where the soil Is to be open for some time, this factor must be taken Into consider - ation. This is true particularly with the lighter soils, of which the majority of fields consist. The operutioh following discing is plowing. This usually is per - formed any time after the middle of May, from one to three .weeks preceeding planting. In the majority of cases, the most successful potato growers practice plowing at least two to three weeks ahead of planting. The larger growers, particularly, plow fartherest In advance, because plowing operations are not usually as rapid as planting. </seg>
            <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ocveral large growers who were very successful in the matter of securing excellent stands during the past three seasons, were found to vary their plowing operations slightly. This variation, which con - sisted ot packing the soil after plowing, resulted in good stands, when the majority of growers experienced trouble, not to say com - plete failure in some cases. This packing was done with the use of a sub-surface packer, pulled at the same time as the plow. Being light in draft, the packer did not necessitate the use of extra power. The results secured by using this machine were that the seed bed was firmed down, eliminating the usal loose nature of freshly plowed ground. By the elimination of largo air spaces in the seed bed, free air circulation with its usual rapid loss of moisture Is practically elim - inated. It was found that pulling this packer immediately after the plow is to be desired in preference to later packing, or harrowing. Any delay in doing this packing operation, however, allows this valuable spring moisture to escape. This soil moisture is usually the principal factor causing good stands, and subsequent rapid growth, particularly In the dry seasons we have just experienced. Harrowing has the dis - advantage of doing a poorer job of packing, and of breaking up the surface soil too finely, quite often encouraging blowing of the soil. In this same connection, the type of packer is an important point. A flat surface packer would encourage blowing more than a harrow, and would be inadvisable. Packers made with a series of wheels that have pointed outside edges, which wheels are separated sufficiently to permit them to sink into the soil two to three inches, will puck the lower part of the seed bed, and practically leave the surface undis - turbed. It Is seldom necessary to work this seed bed any more before plant - ing, unless hard packing rains necessitate again loosening the seed bed by another discing. This is a rare occurence, however. To summarize, the most successful practice followed by potato growers, Is the early preparation of land to check weed growth, thus conserving all of the winter and early spring moisture. Following this, plowing considerably in advance of planting, and following this im - mediately with a sub-surface packer gives the best results for a per - fect seed bed. </seg>
            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION PROGRESS REPORT ON SOME EXPERIMENTS DEALING WITH SOIL PREPARATION AND PLANTING METHODS FOR POTATOES ON DRY LAND IN WESTERN NEBRASKA H. O. WERNER Department of Horticulture, University of Nebraska As a result of hot and dry weather at various periods during each of the last three growing seasons, — 1931, 1932, and 1933, — crop yields were generally low. However, some very distinct differences in yield resulted' from different curtural methods. Time^ of Plowing and Disking During each of the three years, 1931 to 1933, stands of potatoes have been somewhat better on spring plowed than with fall plowed land. Late spring plowing resulted In stands as good as those on earlier plowed land, except In the dry, hot planting season of 1933 when stands were poor with late spring plowing. With either fall plowing or early spring plowing, stands were always best after two diskings, one early during May, the other In mid June just before plant - ing. When land was disked only once — a late disking was most de - sirable. One early spring disking resulted in very poor stands in dry planting seasons. Yields of potatoes were In general accord with the stands. Yields were so low and differences so small in 1931 and 1932 that they are not worth consideration. In 1933 — spring plowed land always pro - duced more than fall plowed land and early spring plowing produced about twice as many bushels as late spring plowing. One late disking or one early plus a late disking, resulted in high yields with both fall and spring plowing. The total yields for each treatment in 1933 are reported in Table 1. Table 1. Total yields of potatoes in 1933 at the Box Butte experi - mental farm, when plowing and disking was done at different times.

            <seg id="p594">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE scab seemed to be slightly more prevalent in the potatoes from the early spring plowing than in those on the fall plowed land. The last amount was produced in the late spring plat. Depth of Plowing Plowing for this project was delayed till the middle of May when the soil was very dry and because of that, as reported in the previous experiment, yields were low. However, these very severe conditions provided a good opportunity for the test under extreme conditions. The yields reported in Table 2 were secured from 6 plats of 1-1 Oth acre. Table 2. Total bushels per acre and grades of potatoes from different plowing depths in 1933.

With deep plowing a fair yield was secured. With shallow plowing the yield was unprofitably low due to poor stands, small vine growth and a heavy weed growth which de - veloped as a result of rains during the latter part of August. With deep plowing there was practically no late fall weed growth. Shallow plowing resulted In a very high percentage of small potatoes whereas deep plowing produced a high percentage of No. 1 size tubers. Dif - ferences In scab content were very small. Planting Depth This project has been carried on since 1928 but results are still somewhat inconclusive and very different from year to year. During seasons that are cold and wet at planting time as were 1928 and 1929, shallow planting was desirable but in average seasons or hot and dry planting seasons, deep planting or deep covering with shallow planting has been preferable. However, scab seems to have been slightly most prevalent with deep planting or deep covering. RESULTS IN 1933 FROM THE DRY LAND CROP ROTATION PLATS AT THE BOX BUTTE EXPERIMENTAL FARM H. O.

These differences corresponded with differences in vine vigor, the most vigorous vine growth having occurred in the long rotations or following corn or fallow. Early blight foliage damage was most severe where vine growth was most vigorous. This probably reduced the yields somewhat but still they were superior to those from other treat - ments. There was no great difference in the quality of tubers in the dif - ferent plats except with regard to scab and rhizoctonla which was much more severe where potatoes were on land which had been in potatoes 3 years before (1930) than where potatoes had not been planted since 1933. Even more scab was present where potatoes were planted each ot the last 4 years. The previous crop seemed to have no influence upon the amount of scab present. </seg>

History shows that during the past 25 years, small crops have produced greater Incomes than larger crops have produced. Present Indications point to an income from the 1933 potato crop 3 times that of the income from potatoes produced in 1932 and the largest income from potatoes in several years. The Increased acreage in production for 1934 Is indicated primarily for the southern and Intermediate states. This means the states which produce for the early markets. In the southern states the Indicated increase in acreage is about IS per cent and the increase indicated In the intermediate states, which includes Nebraska, is 16 per cent. These reports are based on "Intentions to Plant" as of November 1, 1933, and at that time of course, no data were given pertaining to the intentions to plant of the late potato areas. Nebraska is also included in the late producing states. There is, however, expected to be an increase in the potato acreage in the late producing areas because acreages in potatoes were reduced during the past 2 years and with favorable prices prevailing last fall, it is the common expectation that more po - tatoes will be planted in 1934. One factor that may work against this increase in acreage is the price of seed. If seed is high in price It is </seg>
            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION naturally going to prevent the seeding ot as many acres as otherwise might be planted if seed were low In price. Prices for the 1934 crop, while they cannot be forecasted but mere - ly indicated, point to their being favorable to the early growers. This is due to the short supply this spring of late potatoes. The supply of late potatoes on hand this spring Is shorter than usual because a greater quantity was sold last fall when prices were favorable to the producer. » • Prices for the 1934 late potato crop, however, will probably not be as favorable as those for the early crop. This will be because of the contemplated heavy production and with early potatoes coming on the market to take care of the early demand the indications are that there will normally be a large supply at the time the late crop comes on the market. Normally 3,000,000' acres of potatoes produce enough to supply the needs of the United States. This would Indicate 300,000 acres to be planted in 1934 over and above the requirements of the country. Another thing to be considered by potato growers Is the fact that potato consumption in the United States has been declining during the past 10 years. The relative Importance of the potato crop as compared with other farm crops in the United States should be of interest. In 1933 the potato crop in the United States ranked fifth In value of all agricul - tural crops produced. Corn led with a crop valued at $917,000,000, followed by cotton, hay, and wheat. The value of the potato crop was estimated to be $222,000,000. In Nebraska the potato crop like - wise ranked fifth In value of all agricultural crops produced. Corn led with a crop valued at $70,000,000, followed by hay, wheat, and oats, with the potato crop having a value of $5,600,000. It was slight - ly ahead of the sugar beet crop in 1933. We will now consider the charts. Chart No. 1 gives potato pro - duction and prices for Nebraska and the United States during the 10 year period, 1924 to 1933, inclusive. This chart shows, in a general way, that as production Increases, prices go down. We note that for the United States in 1924 the total production of potatoes was 386, - 000,000 bushels and the price 62 cents; In 1925 the production was 299,000,000 bushels and the price $1.87 per bushel; the year fol - lowing, in 1926, the production was 323,000,000 bushels and the price $1.41. The heaviest production of the 10 year period was in 1928 when 426,000,000 bushels were produced and the price was 53 cents per bushel. The next year the production was lower and the price higher. In 1930, 1931, and 1932, production was rather uniform but prices kept going downward. These were unusual years due to the </seg>
            <seg id="p598">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE depression and probably should not be given as much weight in de - termining the relative price based on production as occurred during the other years. In addition to the United States production and prices, we show the Nebraska production and prices for the same years. It will be noted that the United States production determines the price rather than the Nebraska production, although production in Ne - braska was usually lower in those same years when production was lower In the entire United States than it was in other years when production was higher in the United States. In connection with these figures shown in Chart No. 1, it might be well to mention the average yield per acre in potatoes throughout the United States and In Nebraska. In 1924 the average yield in the United States was 124 bushels per acre and for Nebraska 87 bushels; Chart No. 1 POTATO PRODUCTION AND PRICES — NEBR. and U.

These figures show that yields per acre in Nebraska are much lower than average yields for the United States. There are probably definite reasons for this due to climatic and soil conditions. I do not take it that it represents the lack of ability on the part of Nebraska growers as compared with growers in other sections of the United States. I </seg>
            <seg id="p599">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION cannot explain the reason for this, but probably the men ot your association who have made a detailed study of the potato situation can answer this question for you and have probably already done so. Chart No. 2 gives figures on the yields and costs of growing pota - toes In Michigan in 1928 by the 300 Bushel Club. Membership in the 300 Bushel Club is contingent upon the growers producing at least 300 bushels for two or more consecutive years. This chart shows the records In 3 groups of 10 farms each. The first group comprises those growers who produced an average of 375 to 490 bushels per acre. The second group comprises those growers of 328 to 379 bushels per acre. The third group of 10 farms had average yields per acre rang - ing from 300 to 325 bushels. For comparison an additional group of figures is shown giving data from 101 farms which are representative of average Michigan potato growers. The first three groups of farmers were certified seed growers. The certified growers whose records were obtained for this study planted their rows 35 inches apart with 15 Inch spaces between hills and seed pieces weighing two ounces.

Increased yields are obtained by use of better seed, more of it per acre, the use of the right fertilizer, proper sprayings, proper cultivation, and thoroughly spray - ing." Chart No. 3 shows figures from Colorado. These data were com - puted under the supervision of C. E. Metzger, who is present in the audience today and who will address you later. The data were obtain - ed for a period of three years, 1925, 1926, and 1927. The costs in this chart are based on hundredweight rather than per bushel and cover all costs of growing and harvesting and delivering in cars ready for shipments. The records were obtained from the San Luis Valley where the average yield is about 190 bushels per acre and the aver - age cost Is 88 cents per hundredweight or 53 cents per bushel. This chart shows that where the average yield In hundredweight was 38 the cost per hundredweight was $1.30, and as yields increased to 184 hundredweight per acre the cost decreased to 59 cents per hundred - weight. These data show the same as did those from Michigan, that as yields increase the cost per unit of production decreases.

Here we have figures covering different years so that vari - ations in costs and prices must be taken into account in determining whether higher yields result in lower costs per bushel or otherwise.

It Is difficult to make a comparison as between different years to show relationship of yield to cost, but It Is of interest to observe the figures In this chart showing the average cost per bushel and the average yields per acre during this time. Special attention is called to the acre cost of the 1929 summary which appears in the chart showing the distribution of the items of cost per acre which total $151.03 with a cost per bushel of only 58 cents. Here the yield was 258 bushels per acre. In this study man labor was figured at 30 cents per hour and horse labor at 15 cents per hour. It will be noted from this chart that the costs per acre have increased during the 9 year period. Some of the important causes of this increased labor cost were first, the practice of using more seed and better quality seed as indicated by the higher price which was paid for it. This does not show in the chart as shown here, but these figures show in the more detailed study which appears in the American Potato Journal. In 1921, growers used on an aver - age about 15 bushels of seed per acre and in 1929 nearly 24% bushels per acre. Second, growers used bigger and higher priced machinery and less hand labor. Third, more commercial fertilizer and manure was used during later years. Fourth, during the last 4 years, potatoes were graded and this added to the labor cost. Chart No. 5 shows figures on growing potatoes in Ohio covering a period for the three years 1927, 1928 and 1929. In this chart the costs are shown only for growing and harvesting. Grading and mar - keting costs are not included. Records in 1927 included costs on only one acre whereas larger acreages were covered in the studies for 1928 and 1929. The item of spraying cost includes materials and deprecia - tion of the sprayer. The charges for man labor and horse power were decided by the growers themselves, but they were less per hour </seg>

This accounts for the lower cost per bushel In 1929 than in 1928 when the average yield per acre was the same, 240 bushels. This chart gives some detail as to the different Items of cost and the labor and power requirements for producing potatoes during those three years.

In this particular year, costs of grading and marketing are not Included. The man labor charge was 4 0 cents per hour or 30 cents in some cases. The horse power charge was 20 cents to 15 cents per hour. Tractor charge generally $1.50 per hour and included charge for implements that the tractor drew. The land charge was 6 per cent of value given by the growers and the machinery charge 6 cents per horse hour. This chart shows the records grouped according to yields per acre. We have In the first column those having average yields of 3 50 bushels or over. In the next column, the average yield per acre ranged from 301 to 349 bushels, and in the next column are the producers whose average yields ranged from 201 to 3 00 bushels. In the next column the average yields ranging from 100 to 200 bushels are shown and in the last column the average yield per acre was under ldo bushels. At the bottom of the chart the average costs per bushel for the different groups are shown. It shows very strikingly that as yields per acre decrease, costs per bushel increase. In the first group the cost per bushel was 35 cents, in the second group 42 cents, in the third group 53 cents, in the fourth group 77 cents, and in the last group, those having yields under 100 bushels per acre, the average cost was $1.64. </seg>

The foregoing figures have been based upon work done in other states. It will be of interest to you men to note some cost figures from records obtained from farms in western Nebraska. I might state that a beginning was made in 1932 to obtain some cost figures on growing potatoes in western Nebraska. This work will be continued In the future. Some data were obtained during 1933 bearing upon costs from time of seeding until potatoes were put in storage. Other costs of storage, grading, and marketing have not been obtained. No data on 1933 costs are submitted herewith, but it is expected that if cost figures are obtained in future years that later a more detailed report will be given covering a period of years. Cost figures for 1932 from seeding until storage were assembled and published In circular form. In Chart 7, I am submitting herewith cost data supplementing some of those 1932 records. The figures given herewith comprise cost of storage, grading, and marketing, and the chart also shows the cost up until storing so that final cost per acre and per bushel appear in this chart. The storage, grading, and mar - keting costs were obtained from figures submitted by 10 cooperators from western Nebraska. In computing the costs as shown in Chart 7, the following scale of charges was used: Man labor charge, 20 cents per hour; horse power 9 cents per horse hour; tractor power, 2-plow size 65 cents per hour, 3-plow size $1.00 per hour and 4-plow size $1.10 per hour; equip - ment charge 3% cents per horse hour for horse drawn; for tractor drawn, 2-plow 14 cents, 3-plow 21 cents, and 4-plow size 28 cents per hour. Where hauling- was done by horses, the above rates for man labor, horse power, and equipment were used. In case hauling was </seg>

Storage charges were made on the basis of one cent per bushel. The average cost per bushel for storage and marketing on the ten farms was 7 cents per bushel. This cost was computed by dividing the storage and marketing charges by the total bushels produced. This same method of computation was used In finding the storage items for individual farms. This is subject to error due to the probability that not all of the potatoes produced were put into storage. We have felt justified, however, In using this method of computation because we have charged the entire costs of the crop against the total bushels produced and present the figures obtained herewith. For the 10 farms shown in this chart, the average cost per bushel for growing and harvesting was 28 cents. The ten farms shown here produced 46,774 bushels of potatoes and their storage record shows but 35,499 bushels put into storage. In Chart 7 we show storage and marketing costs on 3 farms; the low cost farm, the high cost farm, the intermediate cost farm, and figures for the average of 10 farms from which records were obtained. The low cost producer stored and marketed his potatoes at an average cost of $4.25 per acre. The growing cost was $16.55 per acre, making the final cost per acre $20.80. The average yield per acre was 81 bushels and the final cost per bushel including harvesting, storing, and marketing, was 26 cents per bushel. In this chart a cash rent charge was used for the use of the land so that the charges per acre are assessed to the total yield per acre. The producer having the Inter - mediate cost per bushel had storage and marketing costs of $5.84 </seg>
            <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION per acre. The growing cost averaged $29.79 per acre and the final cost was $35.63. His average yield was 100 bushels and the final cost was 3 6 cents per bushel. The high cost producer had a storage and marketing cost of $1.55 per acre. His growing cost was $18.81 and his final cost $20.36. His average yield per acre was 16 bushels and the final cost per bushel $1.25. Average figures for the 10 farms showed a cost of $4.82 for storage and marketing. The growing cost was $20.61, making the final cost per acre $25.43. The yield per acre was 72% bushels, and the final cost per bushel averaged 35 cents. The data presented herewith give some indication as to what may be expected in the way of the cost of producing certified seed potatoes in western Nebraska. It must be remembered, however, that these figures cover only one year, and average costs over a period of years would depend on the varying conditions that might arise from year to year. These cost figures must not be taken as truly representative of the area. </seg>

METZGER Associate Horticulturist Colorado Agricultural College Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Dr. Goss and Professor Werner have both already been asked the question as to what new potato troubles they were going to bring to the Potato Growers of Nebraska this year. They have asked me in to tell you about some new troubles and the controls which have been worked out for them In Colorado.

These V-*-- A »vi jjtii.-:-. S. - ; '. ' i .'■£3 '::"- ■—*' are all irrigated districts. The dry land ■ .-■* ■ -Jz-.r.... • J sections are not immune, however, as we C. H. METZGER have damage in the Divide district, east Colorado Agricultural College ot Colorado Springs and in the San Juan Basin near Durango. Since only five per cent of damage is allowed In U. S. No. 1 grade losses in the Greeley district are estimated at $500,000 to $1,000,000 annually. The damage to the tuber is in two forms, known as "worm-track" and "pimples". The "worm-track" is caused by the larvae of this Insect, feeding along the skin of the tuber and leaving small furrows. These furrows are often attacked by scab and rizoctonia which greatly increase the amount of damage. The "pimples" are a result of the larvae boring straight into the tuber at right angles. When one of these "pimples" is removed a brown spot is generally found which may extend Into the tuber as deeply as one inch. This is the burrow of the insect, which has become filled with a corky material and is known as a "sliver". Soil and moisture conditions have a large influence on the abund - ance of the insect and on the damage done to the tubers. In the Greeley district there are certain areas of sandy soil on which very </seg>
            <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION little damage occurs. On the heavier soils, however, the damage is severe and is increased where the drainage is poor. The Insect spends the winter, or hibernates, in the adult stage In the soil. In the Greeley ""district the hibernating adults emerge late In May or early In June. They Immediately begin feeding on any available green material. They have been collected from tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, nightshade, beans, turnips, radishes, cucumbers, squash, spinach, lettuce, celery, and a large number of weeds In addi - tion to potatoes. The Greeley district plants late, the same as is done here in Nebraska and very few potatoes are available for tood at the time the adults emerge. The eggs are laid In the soil one-half to two inches deep. Females will average 100 eggs each. The eggs are always deposited in moist soil. In cases where the soil is dry at the time the females are laying iggs there is little danger of damage. The eggs hatch In about 10 lays, depending upon the temperature. The larvae or small worms hatch from the eggs, immediately go to the underground portions ot the plant and begin feeding. The feeding Is not confined to the tubers but roots, stolons, and the underground stems are also included. The lervae feed on an average of 26 days at which time they pupate in a small cell In the ground. The pupa matures in about 10 days when the adult emerges. A few of these adults will lay eggs that same fall giving rise to a partial second brood which is of very little im - portance as far as control measures are concerned. The beetles are most abundant in fields about the middle of August. No parasites of this insect are known. Three years of experiments in the Greeley district have led to the following recommendations for control: Dust the plants with calcium arsenate, one part, and hydrated lime, eight parts, making the first application the second or third week in July depending upon the date of planting. The first application should be followed by two others at ten-day intervals. Twenty to thirty pounds of mixture are required per acre. The cost for materials Is about seventy-five cents per acre for each application. A traction duster for this purpose may be purchased at a cost of about $100.00. The most satisfactory time to apply these dusts is early in the morning, although applications late in the afternoon were also satisfactory. These dusts increased the percentage ot U.. S. No. 1 on an average of about sixty per cent. Sprays also gave very effective control. Zinc arsenite, one pound to 50 gallons ot water gave the best results of any of the materials used. This material should be applied with a power sprayer at a pressure of 250, pounds. Three nozzles per row and a four-row boom give the most effective coverage and make it possible to cover ten or more acres] per day. Zinc arsenite will also poison the Colorado potato beetle. </seg>
            <seg id="p608">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PsylUd Yellows. There is no disease known to potatoes which spreads as rapidly or causes the almost total losses that psyllid yellows does. The Fruita district in Colorado ordinally ships 600 cars of potatoes. In 1927, a very severe attack of psyllid yellows reduced shipments to two cars. It Is very probable that this trouble has existed in potato fields In the west for many years. Failures in Colorado were reported as early as 1876 and It Is highly probable from photographs and descriptions on record at the Colorado Agricultural College that these failures were a result of psyllid yellows. There Is also strong evidence that the failure of 1911 when the state of Colorado produced only 3,000,000 bushels was a result of an epidemic of psyllid yellows. This epidemic lasted through the season of 1914. In 1915 the discouraged growers raised record yields on a greatly reduced acreage. The trouble did not appear again in epidemic form until It broke out at Fruita In 1926. The epidemic at Fruita lasted three years and the trouble did not ap - pear again in this district until 1933. The disease has been known by growers as "purple-top" and "blight". The purpling of the leaves occurs In varieties such as Irish Cobbler, Bliss Triumph and Rural but does not occur in Brown Beauty, Peachblow, and Russet Burbank. Dr. Richards of Utah associated the insect with the disease in 192 7. He found that three to five actively feeding nymphs occasionally produced the symptoms and that 15 to 30 always caused the disease. The first symptoms are a cupping of the base of the leaflets in the upper part of the plant. This cupping is generally accompanied bv a yellowing. The rolling of the leaves progresses from the top of the plant downward. The buds in the axils of the leaves are stim - ulated Into activity and give rise to aerial tubers or deformed shoots. The tips of the plant have a peculiar rosette appearance. The axillarv growth forces the main stem to one side and gives it a zigzag ap - pearance and makes it appear that the plants actually shrink in size. The growths also give the plants a pyramidal appearance. The older leaves sometimes fall off and late in the season severely affected plants consist mainly of this auxiliary growth. The plants turn yellow in color and in some cases the leaves in the top have a purplish color. From a distance, however, the fields look yellow. An abnormal set of tubers most generally occurs. As many as fifty have been counted on Irish Cobbler plants. None of these were as large as an egg when the plants were fully matured. The lack of a rest period In the tubers is also another characteristic symptom. The tubers very often sprout in the ground before harvest. Small knobs are produced at the bud - eye cluster. Tubers from plants not quite so severely affected often show sprouts within two weeks after they are placed In storage when the normal dormant period should be two months. </seg>
            <seg id="p609">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The above symptoms are associated in some manner with the feed - ing of the nymphs of the potato psyllid. These nymphs are small, flat, scale-like insects about one-eighth inch long when fully grown. The nymphs cling to the under side of the leaves,'? usually on the lower parts of the plant and suck the juices. The adult is known as a jump - ing plant louse because It is very active and resembles the winged generation of aphid. It is about one-eighth Inch long. The body Is black with a white Y on the back of the abdomen. The open end of this Y is toward the rear of the insect. The wings project beyond the body almost the length of the body Itself. The adults may be seen on the vines early in the morning, late in the season when they are not as active as they are during warm weather. The excrement of the insect is a very small white pellet. The infestation In the Wet Moun - tain Valley In Colorado was so heavy in 1932 that it looked like sugar or salt had been poured on the ground under the plant, and 500 and more nymphs per plant were counted. The females lay eggs for a period of about 35 days and average 720 eggs each. These eggs hatch in a few days. The small nymphs are brown in color and are about the size of the head of a pin. They grow rapidly and turn green as they approach maturity. It takes about 16 days from the time the eggs hatch until the nymphs shed their skins and the adults emerge. These cast skins can often be found on the plants. The nymphs or cast skins can always be found on plants showing symptoms but none have so far been observed on plants which do not show symptoms. The infection usually starts at one end of a field or around the edges of the field. In areas subject to Infection, small isolated fields are com - pletely destroyed, whereas, large fields may be severely damaged around the edges but damaged very little toward the center. Richards found that removing nymphs from plants within 16 days after they started feeding resulted In a tendency for the plant to recover. First symptoms appeared within 3 days after the nymphs started feeding, but 3 6 days of continuous feeding were required for a full expression of symptoms. It was obvious from this fact that the disease could be controlled if the nymphs on the plants could be killed. The entomology section of the Colorado Experiment Station has been working on this problem and has obtained very satisfactory results by using lime sul - phur, one gallon to forty gallons of water. This material must be applied with a power sprayer because every npmph must be wet with the spray In order to kill It. Two hundred fifty pounds pressure is required and three nozzles per row; one nozzle on each side of the row shooting the spray material up underneath and one nozzle spray - ing the plants from above. Increases In yield of four and five hun - dred per cent have been obtained by using this spray. Early blight is a serious problem In most of your growing districts. A combina - tion spray using zinc arsenic, one pound to fifty gallons of water and lime sulphur, one gallon to 40 gallons ot water should effectively con- </seg>

Six years of study and observation of the effect of psyllid yellows on seed have shown that the symptoms of the disease are not carried by the seed and do not occur In the absence of the insect. Yield tests with seed from infected fields and seed of the same strain from fields which were not infected have shown no significant difference so far Seed from fields infected the previous season, has in all ot the many cases observed given satisfactory crops if the insect was not present. WHAT CONSTITUTES U. S. NO. 1 GRADE POTATOES By E. F. McKUNE, Senior Marketing Specialist United States Department of Agriculture Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen. It has been my pleasure to speak before the Nebraska Potato Im - provement Association on four or five different occasions and I always appreciate this privilege. I have met many of you personally and ' feel that I know all of you. HThe subject assigned to me today Is — "What Constitutes U. S. No. 1 Grade Pota - toes." This subject could be discussed be - fore almost any other group of potato growers in Nebraska with better results than it can be discussed before you, for in my opinion the members of this organiza - tion are well acquainted with the grades and the value of grades. In fact, I con - sider you so well acquainted with the grades that I would be willing for any one of you to discuss this subject in my place. It has been said in this room on sev - —; eral occasions, and no doubt It is true, that E. F. McKUNE tne majority of the present non-certified U. s. Dept. of Agriculture potato seed stock is of a quality that Is equal to the quality of certified potato stock when certification first started. This does not mean that non - certifled stock is on a par with certified stock at the present time. It does mean that you have had a decided effect on your surrounding neighbors and as your certified stock has improved in quality the non - certified growers have found it necessary to improve their stock in order to compete in the receiving markets. </seg>
            <seg id="p611">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION You certified seed potato growers have Improved your stock steadily since .certification started. You have not done this because your sales manager has suggested that is a nice thing to do. You have not im - proved your quality because the certifying committee has said it was the proper thing to do. You have improved the quality of your certi - fied seed potato stock because you have had to meet competition and because your buying public has demanded it. It is a strange thing yet true that the producer of a commodity, regardless of what it is, has little to say about the quality and ap - pearance of the thing he markets. Competition and the buying public dictates to him in this respect. I • In coming back to the subject assigned to me — "What Constitutes U. S. No. 1 Potatoes" I have discussed potato grades with you on sev - eral different occasions. At this time I will review only briefly the history and some of the difficulties encountered in the writing of grades! The potato grades were inaugurated in 1918 as an emergency war measure for the chief purpose of simplifying marketing and not ex - pressly; for the purpose of Improving quality, although the grades have been a: decided factor in improving quality since they came into use. Prior to the establishing of grades it was necessary to go into a long lengthy description in order to picture the contents of a car of pota - toes. With the grades in general use and the grade terms well defined, it is possible to picture a carlot in a comparatively few number of words and, in addition, these grades and terms have a definite mean - ing so that they can become the basis of formulating contracts. Some of you may feel that it would be an easy assignment to work out a set of grades that would be as practical as our present setup. However, permit me to assure you that in order to establish a grade or to even make minor changes In grades It Is necessary to travel thou - sands of miles, visit practically every potato producing district in the country and to interview hundreds of growers, shippers and receivers. For the potato grades, before they can be used on a national basis, must be adapted to a practical use in all potato sections in the country regardless of the variety, growing conditions and time they are moved to the market. This means that the grades must naturally be broad, yet at the same time definite enough to mean something. The U. S. No. 1 Grade Is well established and is used as the basis of comparison. The other grades are more or less built around the U. S. No. 1 grade. Recently, a new grade has been established. This is known as U. S. Commercial and is an Intermediate grade that comes between the U. S. No. 1 and U. S. No. 2 Grades. The U. S. Commercial </seg>
            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE specifies that 80 per cent of the stock in this grade must meet the quality requirements of the U. S. No. 1 Grade with the exception of dirt. In your organization you have adopted a "Red Tag" standard which corresponds very closely to the U. S. Commercial grade. This "Red Tag" grade is practical . and I am convinced that it has a real place in the merchandising ot certified seed potatoes providing it is used properly and not abused. I believe that before I have finished this discussion you will agree with me that under average conditions it will pay you financially to sort your stock to U. S. No. 1 or "Blue Tag" specifications rather than ship it under the U. S. Commercial or "Red Tag" grade. When I was informed of the subject that was to be discussed here today I took the opportunity of checking a large number of certificates that were on file In my office. These certificates covered cars shipped by your organization during this present season and covered both "Blue Tag" and) "Red Tag" stock. A check of these certificates shows that the cars of "Blue Tag" stock averages 97 per cent U. S. No. 1 quality, while your "Red Tag" stock averages 87 per cent U. S. No. 1 quality, or ten per cent less U. S. No. 1 stock than your "Blue Tag" cars. Your sales office advises me that your "Blue Tag" stock averaged a price of approximately $1.55 and that it was the general practice to quote "Red Tag" stock at twenty-five cents per hundred less than the "Blue Tag" stock. This difference varied somewhat. But I was ad - vised that a differential of twenty-five cents was the general plan of quoting. Also that the under grade stock when packed separately was worth from fifty cents to $1.00 per hundredweight. Considering that these percentages and prices are approximately correct. It Is easy to figure the amount you received for your U. S. No. 1 quality in each grade. U. S. No. 1 or "Blue Tag" Stock. Assuming that the average price for this stock in carload lots is $1.55 per hundredweight and assuming that the under grade stock is worth at least 50 cents per hundredweight: i Basing this on a carload Idt of 36,000 pounds: 36,000 lbs. @ $1.55 per' cwt. amounts to $558.00 97% of 36,000 lbs.

            <seg id="p614">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE STORAGE EXPERIMENTS WITH SEED POTATOES DURING THE WINTER OF 1932-1933 H. O. WERNER Department of Horticulture University of Nebraska The various experiments conducted during the winter ot 1931-32 and described in the 1932-33 report of the Nebraska Potato Improve - ment Association (14th Annual Report, pp. 26-33) were continued during the past winter with a few treatments added. All potatoes were stored in crates with 5 crates per ~ ' ' treatment. The cellar was managed so as to have the temperature as close to 40° F. as early In November as possible and continuing as long as possible at that H temperature. The cold storage temper - ature was held at 36 to 40°F. High humidity was maintained in both phases by sprinkling the floor at Intervals. The experiment was terminated on June 26. On that date all sprouts were rubbed off 1 ■ Am^—MM and potatoes were sorted. Weights were Heft _B secured of the sound tubers, the sprouts f Am and of tubers that Wj mmmlW* mmmmmmmk\ areas. The data are reported as percent - age of the original weight that was put University of Nebraita Into storage in early October in 1932. Time Into Cold Storage. In this series potatoes were put into cold storage on different dates but were moved to the cellar June 10 and final weights were secured on June 26. According to the data in table 1, there was little dif - ference in the percentage of sound potatoes, there being about as high a percentage when put into cold storage on April 1 or May 15 as when transferred in October. However, there was more sprouting as the transfer was delayed, but rotting was most severe with early cold stor - age. This increase in rotting was due to the low temperature retard - ing wound healing and thus permitting infection by rot producing organisms. Early cold storage resulted In more rot than when pota - toes were in the cellar continually. However, due to reduced water loss and less sprouting, cold storage at any time resulted In a higher percentage of sound tubers by June 26 than did cellar storage. These results again point to the desirability of low temperatures In the spring, whereas low temperatures In the fall are not necessary, per - haps not desirable. </seg>

A Late Spring "Warming Up" Period. Because of the rapid respiration accompanying both a shift from a low to high temperature and the cutting of seed potatoes, it is deemed advisable to "warm up" seed potatoes for a few days before planting To determine the effect of such a procedure on weight loss and sprout - ing, some potatoes were removed from cold storage on June 10— others on June 20.

Probably I the most important consideration is the healing of the wounds. Sixty pounds of Triumph potatoes stored in two crates were used for each or these tests reported. I Exposure of tangentially cut surfaces (about 1 inch in diameter like a slice off one side) to sunshine, decreased the percentage of potatoes, that were sound on June 15, for each increase in length of I exposure time (Table 5).

Conclusions. .['■'■ Very low storage temperatures in the fall of the year are not nec - essary for best potato storage, in fact they seem to be detrimental, increasing the percentage of rot because of slower and! more incom - plete healing of wounds at low temperatures. Low temperatures In the spring are very desirable as a means of retarding sprout growth. Mechanically damaged tubers are most effectively held by removing them from the field to the cellar as soon as is practical after harvest - ing and then having the spring temperature be low. </seg>
            <seg id="p619">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION FOUR SERIOUS DISEASES OF TABLE AND SEED POTATOES (Scab, Fusarium wilt, Rhizoctonia, and Early Blight) R. W. GOSS Department of Plant Pathology, University of Nebraska • During the past ten years you have heard a great deal about the various virus diseases, particularly in relation to the production of certified seed. From the standpoint of reduced yields ot marketable potatoes either for seed or table purposes, however, the four diseases I am going to discuss are by far the most important in western Ne - braska. The first three, scab, Fusarium wilt., and Rhizoctonia have always been with us, while- the fourth. Early blight, has become im - portant during the past few years. It is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of the loss due to scab but an examination of the certification records for a period of years shows that a 10 to 15 per cent scab sort-out is a conservative estimate. Some few growers are fortunate enough to have soil which seldom produces scabby tubers, while at the' other extreme we have found fields with 100 per cent scab. About Ave years ago we made a survey for scab on 100 different farms in western Nebraska, using 1 the same lot of treated seed potatoes on all farms. It was found that the average for all these fields was 10 per cent slight, 12 per cent me - dium, and 2 per cent severe scab. Twenty-one of the fields averaged 10 to 25 per cent severe scab, twelve fields averaged '25 to 5'0 per cent, and seven fields had over 50 per cent. It is evident from these data that scab is one of our chief problems and that the disease pro - ducing organism Is abundant in most of our western Nebraska Soils. ! .'•■■' ■•! In the same survey it was found that 94 per cent bf the fields pro - duced Stem-end rot tubers, the average per field being 4.5 per cent. Nine of the fields averaged 10 to 20 per cent infection, while one each contained 30, 33, and 47 per cent infection and in the latter instance I the potatoes were grown on soil that had never before been planted to potatoes. Referring to the certification records of approximately ten ' thousand acres, we find that In 1933 this disease occurred in 95 per cent of the fields at second inspection, averaging 2.4 per cent. Even after many fields were dropped and others severely rogued 84 per cent of the remaining fields averaged 3.8 per cent infection in the bin. Here again we have a serious disease originating in the soil. ! • * We have less . data concerning damage due to Rhizoctonia. This disease causes two types of damage, first the killing of sprouts early in the spring or the girdling of stems in mid-summer, and Second the black sclerotia on the surface of new tubers. The causal organism </seg>
            <seg id="p620">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE occurs in most soils and has many host plants, and therefore is pri - marily a soil problem. I assume that you are all familiar with the symptoms and life his - tories of the three diseases I have just mentioned, particularly as re - gards the fact that the organisms causing these diseases may live over either in or on the seed tubers and also in the soil. You are familiar with the results we have obtained with seed treatments and are also aware of the fact that even when Fusarium Infected tubers are dis - carded and the seed treated you may have any one or all of these dis - eases occurring in your crop. I therefore, wish to discuss them from the standpoint of soil infection but before doing so I think It would be well to discuss in a little more detail the fourth disease, early blight, with which many of you are not so familiar. Early blight is ordinarily of more importance in the irrigated sec - tions where In some years It has reduced yields 15 to 25 per cent. It also occurs in dry-land areas depending upon weather conditions and often causes the premature death of the vines several weeks in ad - vance of normal ripening. This disease differs from the preceding ones in three important ways, first, the Infected tubers are not known to produce the disease the following year; second, the fungus causing early blight is not primarily a soil organism although It lives over winter in the old Infected parts of the plant that are left In the field; and third, the disease affects the foliage and is spread by the wind or wind-blown rains rather than through the soil as with the three dis - eases previously mentioned. Early blight usually appears at about the time the tubers are start - ing to set. The fungus spores falling on the leaves germinate in the presence of moisture and penertate the leaf resulting in small, round dead spots about 10 days later. These spots can be distinguished from other injuries by a careful examination which will show the presence ot dark rings in the spot, giving it a target-board appearance. More spores are produced in these spots and in turn affect new leaves, thus causing a rapid spread of the disease and resulting in epidemics under favorable conditions. Diseased spots are also produced on the stems and when the spots on the foliage are great in number the vine turns yellow and dies. The disease may also affect the tuber and cause severe losses in storage and transit. At harvest time the tubers come in contact with the infected foliage as they go over the digger and the spores are scat - tered around on the surface of the tubers. When placed In storage the initial sweat provides the moisture necessary for the germination of the spores and they penetrate into the tuber. The spots resulting from this infection appear from 2 to 8 weeks afterwards, depending upon the storage conditions. Because of this delayed development. </seg>
            <seg id="p621">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION and the better the storage conditions the greater will be the delay, it Is common to find potatoes sorted out and shipped as healthy finally developing the disease in transit, particularly when being shipped south. These spots are usually about 1-4 inch in diameter and halt as deep. The diseased spot is easily separated from the healthy tissue unless secondary rots develop. A number of such spots may develop on a tuber and result in considerable shrinking. Whfle such infected tubers are not known to carry the disease to the next year's crop they are undesirable for seed because of the danger of such seed-pieces rotting in the ground and giving a poor stand. Experiments with scab, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium wilt. During the past four or five years we have been conducting ex - periments and obtaining data from experiments already under way at the Box Butte Experiment Farm under dry-land culture and at the Scotts Bluff Sub-station under Irrigation. While our results to date have not resulted In any one efficient control method for these dis - eases, they do indicate certain favorable practices and others that should be avoided. I am therefore, going to present a few results In the form of a report of progress. Effect of time of planting: — The relation of time of plauting to the development of disease is due to the differences In temperature and rainfall occurring during certain stages of the development of the plant. These conditions vary from year to year so that in discussing time of planting we are simply referring to average conditions, the exact dates being applicable only to the particular year and location. The general tendency over a period of years however, is quite con - stant. It has been known for some time that later dates of planting de - crease the amount of scab but many growers are not aware that the same thing is true of these other diseases. Numerous experiments and observations have shown this to be true and as an example the results obtained in 1933 under both irrigation and dry land are presented In the following table. </seg>

It must be remembered that total yields also decrease with the extremely late dates. More mar - ketable potatoes were produced however, with the reduced total yield of the June 23 planting at Alliance than with the higher yield of the June 15 planting, due to the great reduction in disease. The same general trend occurred both under irrigation and dry - land, although there was less scab and Rhizoctonia and slightly more Fusarium at Scotts Bluff. While no data were collected on early blight infection, observations over a period of years have shown that this disease is often the limit - ing factor in yield with the early dates of planting, particularly under irrigation, while the damage is usually very slight with the later plant - ing dates. Effect of time and depth of plowing: — Experiments conducted at the Box Butte Experiment Farm have not yielded data from which </seg>
            <seg id="p623">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION definite conclusions can be drawn without further ' repetition or the experiments. The tendency however, has been for increased amounts of scab and Rhizoctonia with the usual spring plowing as contrasted with fall plowing and late spring disking. Scab has been more severe with shallow plowing or disking than with deep plowing. Further experiments are needed to work out definite and practical applications of the principles Involved. Effect of preceding crops: — Scab, Alliance — The rotation experi - ments at the Box Butte Experiment Farm have not been continued long enough to observe the full effect of the various rotation systems and no significant differences have been observed in scab with wheat, corn, sweet clover, fallow, or beans preceding potatoes. The addition or manure has not increased scab under these dry-land conditions. Scotts Bluff — The rotation experiments under irrigation that have been in progress for many years show great differences in the develop - ment of scab. All rotations In which beets preceded potatoes had a large amount of severe scab. Applications of manure resulted in an increase in the severity of scab, that Is, more of the pitted type, al - though the total number of tubers slightly Infected was decreased. As the severe types of scab are those that have to be sorted out it is evident that neither beets nor manure are desirable preceding pota - toes. Rotations with alfalfa or sweet clover preceding potatoes had the least amount of scab, so that these crops in a 4 to 6 year rota - tion are the most desirable under irrigation. Fusarium-Wilt Alliance — No significant differences have occurred in any of the rotation plots with this disease. Scotts Bluff The most significant effect of the preceding crop under irrigation was shown in the rotations in which corn preceded potatoes, these having much more wilt than the other plots. This result has not occurred every year however. Rhizoctonia, Alliance — No differences have been found In the amount of Rhizoctonia in relation to the preceding crop, although an application of 12 tons of manure per acre greatly decreased the amount of Rhizoctonia. Scotts Bluff— Rotations in which beets pre - ceded potatoes increased Rhizoctonia in the same way that scab was increased. Rotations with manure had slightly less Rhizoctonia as at Alliance. Interval between potato crops: — In the rotation experiments at both Alliance and Scottsbluff, the interval between potato crops has been found to be very important in reducing both scab and Rhizoctonia, while very little effect has been noted with Fusarium wilt. At Alliance last year scabby sort-outs of No. 1 size tubers in the continuous potato Plot amounted to 68 per cent ot the yield, in the 3-year rotation 45 per </seg>
            <seg id="p624">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cent, and only 4 -per cent in the 5-year rotations. The effect' on Rhizoctonia was very much the same, and similar results occurred with both diseases at Scottsbluff. In the survey previously mentioned similar results were obtained from the 100 fields examined. All of those with an interval of 2 to 4 years between potato crops had an average scab sort-out of 31 per cent, those with more than a 4-year interval only 12 per cent, while those never before planted to potatoes had a 10 per cent sort - out. It is evident from these data that 4 years is about the shortest time that should be allowed between potato crops on the same soil. On some irrigated soils where these diseases are not severe a shorter rotation might be used if sweet clover or alfalfa precedes potatoes. Chemical treatments: — The possibility of a simple chemical soil treatment to eradicate these disease producing organisms has been tested at Alliance by applications of a large number of different chemicals that have been reported as giving promising results in other sections of the country or with other diseases. The necessity of finding a substance that fulfills all four requirements, that Is, cheap, easy to apply, non-harmful to plants, and capable of controlling dis - ease greatly limits the possible chemicals. The various mercury com - pounds and many others have failed to give satisfactory results. Dur - ing 1933 the only treatment that gave promising results was the use of sulphur applied to the soil at least a week before planting and thor - oughly disked In. This treatment showed a slight decrease in scab but no effect on Fusarium or Rhizoctonia. Further tests are being continued with this treatment. THE NATURE AND VALUE OF U. S. NO. 1 GRADE POTATOES By E. F. McKUNE Senior Marketing Specialist U. S. Dept. of Agriculture Mr. Chairman, Members of the Nebraska Potato Improvement As - sociation, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is with distinct pleasure that I appear before you today to discuss some of the marketing problems of the Western Nebraska Potato Growers. Before discussing the subject assigned to me I wish to thank your program committee for this opportunity. ; The subject that has been assigned to me — "The Nature and Value of U. S. No. 1 Grade Potatoes" — is broad and with your permission </seg>
            <seg id="p625">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION I wish to make it even more broad and to discuss some of the things that I consider wrong with the table potato industry in western Nebraska. This talk could be made In a very complimentary way. I could tell you that you are producing the best quality of potatoes in the United States; that your marketing methods are perfect; and that you have no room for Improvement In any respect. I could tell you all these things. You .would probably not believe me, but would consider me as a good fellow. Several of you have asked me to give you the plain facts as I see them. You have asked me to omit the flowery complimentary re - marks. The majority ot you people are growers. You are serious and concerned about your industry. You are open-minded; conse - quently I feel that I can discuss your situation plainly and any sug - gestions or criticisms that may be brought out will be received by you in the spirit that they are given. The North Platte Valley ot Nebraska is a wonderfully fertile district — probably the best adapted for the various farm crops ot any section that I cover in my 6,000 miles of travel in Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado. You are intelligent growers and are using improved and modern methods in your farming. You have produced and can produce very good quality of Triumph potatoes and in a quantity that is greater than produced in any other section of the country. But you are not obtaining the best financial results from your potato crop at the present time, especially when you consider the quality that you have and can produce. Your marketing methods in most cases are not to your advantage, and if continued for many more years it will mean the ruination of your table stock potato industry. If I am to discuss the table stock situation as it is in western Nebraska and give such criticisms and suggestions as I have been asked to give, then it will not be possible for me to touch on my assigned subject except as it relates to your conditions. It has been my privilege to study the table stock situation in western Nebraska for the past six years. I have watched your in - dustry very closely and feel that there are four major factors which, if improved upon, would result in a decided financial gain tq the table stock producers. The factors that I consider most important to ac - complish this end are: (a) The improvement of seed stock, (b) More careful handling to eliminate mechanical injury, (c) Better grading and sorting, (d) Merchandising on grade. These different subjects will be taken up in the order named. Western Nebraska specializes in the production of Bliss Triumph </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE potatoes. Your valley is well adapted to the production of this variety. The Triumph is one of the favorites on the market, especially when packed in the method approved by the market. But on the other hand, the Triumph is a very tender variety and is especially susceptible to Injury from handling, more, so than any other variety, which means that unless your handling methods are changed you are going to continue to suffer heavy losses from mechanical injury. Yet I would not suggest that you change to other varieties. You have In your very midst here a group of certified growers. Many of you no doubt belong to this group. These growers of certi - fied potatoes have, because of competition from other states, steadily Improved the quality of their commodity until at the present time they are shipping the best quality of certified seed Triumphs of any group in the country. They have accomplished this because of the necessity of holding their markets and by constantly improving their methods. As the certified growers have improved their quality, the table stock growers have permitted their quality to depreciate in about the same proportion. You have at your very door an ex - cellent lot of seed that can be purchased without having to pay additional high freight charges. Yet we permit a heavy percentage of this stock to roll to our competing states to growers who are anxious for it and are willing to pay a substantial price, plus freight and other charges. Much can be done toward improving your quality through the planting of good local grown seed. The second suggestion that I make is more careful handling. As stated before, the Bliss Triumph potato is very susceptible to mechanical injury. Mr. Marx Koehnke in his discussion has told you of the percentages of defects that occur in the ordinary methods of handling. He also explained to you some of the preventive methods that can be used to at least eliminate this type of injury. Mr. Koehnke's talk should be taken seriously, for to my mind if western Nebraska could eliminate mechanical injury, cracking and bruising, it would be little trouble for you to ship a high percentage of your stock as U. S. No. 1 Grade. A few years ago an enterprising grower in the San Luis Valley of Colorado found that his Triumph potatoes were failing to meet the requirements of the U. S. No. 1 grade (when marketed direct from the field) by quite a large percentage. He studied his situation. He changed his digger to eliminate or lessen the drop. He padded the picking baskets, the sorter, the sack holder and the truck that was used tor transporting the potatoes from the field to the car and, In addition, he instructed his help to handle the stock carefully. As a result, he eliminated the mechanical injury to such an extent that </seg>
            <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the balance of his crop easily met the requirements of the U. S. No. 1 Grade. The Triumph potato has such a tender skin that every precaution must be used to prevent injury from digging to the loading into the cars. In regard to the third factor — "Better grading and sorting" much can be said on this subject. This brings me back somewhat to the topic assigned to me, "The Nature and Value of the U. S. No. 1 Grade." The U. R. No. 1 Grade is the best known of all the potato grades. It is generally considered the basis of comparison by which all po - tatoes are judged, irrespective of whether a lot of potatoes meets that grade requirement. The U. S. Potato Grades are in general use throughout the nation. These grades were first adopted in 1918 as an emergency war measure for the purpose of simplifying marketing and to enable those who deal in potatoes to buy and sell on a more Intelligent basis. The grades have been changed on several different occasions since they were first promulgated. But the same basic principles have been retained. Some of you may feel that the U. S. grades are not especially well adapted to your condition, and perhaps they are not. Yet considering the fact that these grades must be broad enough to cover every potato section in the United tSates, regardless of the different seasons of the year that the crop is marketed and the many different varieties produced. They are probably the very best that can be written — at least for the present time. Although these grades were not primarily adopted for the pur - pose of improving quality, they have had that effect In districts that have put them into general practice. You who have made a study of potato districts that have an outstanding reputation as good potato areas know that they are making use of the grades and are practic - ing good grading and sorting methods. Western Nebraska has a reputation for being lax in grading for the main reason that there is not much incentive for an individual to practice rigid grading. There are of course certain growers to whom this does not apply. Before I finish this talk, I will endeavor to show why there is little or no incentive to put out a better pack. Do you know that Idaho U. S. No. 2 stock determines the price for western Nebraska partly graded table stock? If you have watched the Kansas City market this winter you have noticed that Idaho U. S. No. 2 potatoes have generally sold at the same or often a higher price than Nebraska partly graded Triumphs. This is not fair to the Ne - braska potato industry, for Nebraska cars contain as a general rule a </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gooa percentage of U. S. No. 1 stock", while Idaho U. S. No. 2 curs are strictly U. S. No. 2 stock. This is not the fault of your .shippers. They without doubt secured the best possible prices. It was because your consuming market is afraid to buy Nebraska partly graded stock. Experience has taught them that there is a wide variation in the quality of the potatoes shipped from this district. In order to play safe they have had to protect themselves and pay low prices. I have had good loyal Nebras - ka citizens in the eastern part of the state tell me that they prefer western Nebraska Triumphs in quality to any other variety of potato, but that they have suffered such a heavy shrink in sacks of -potatoes that they have purchased that originated in this section that they have been forced to buy sacks of other varieties shipped from states that use rigid grading methods. All of which goes to prove the old saying that the consumer is willing to pay for quality and "that quality is long remembered after the purchase price is forgotten." This brings us up to thcslast factor, and that is Merchandising on Grade. Probably not over fifteen per cent of western Nebraska table stock is bought and sold on grade. The majority of the crop is sold "as is." This is the fault of both the growers and buyers. The grower Is afraid to sell on grade for fear that he can not make the grade he contracts to make and consequently have to take a lower price. The buyers are afraid to buy on grade lest he create the enmity of a grower and lose him to a competitor. As a result most of the stock Is sold "field run" or "bin run" with only the very worst removed. The grower of a good quality crop receives the same or nearly the same price as the grower of a poor quality crop. The grower of the good crop feels he is penalized; consequently he is not as careful in the sorting of his next car or as careful In his production methods the next year, for the incentive to out put quality is lost. The same is partly true with the poor quality grower. I don't blame yon in the least. I would do the same thing under like conditions. This method of buying and selling may not materially affect your district in one or two years, but you can readily see what you can expect if this practice continues for a few more years. Approximately two years ago you had Federal-State inspection in this district. It was petitioned out as having been of little or no value. You were told that "it was a waste of money" and in general "the certificates were not worth the paper they were written on." I agree with you absolutely. It was a waste of money and was of little or no value. Why? Because the inspection certificates were not used. Neither the growers or shippers used the service except in rare cases. Like anything else, inspection is of no value unless used. </seg>
            <seg id="p629">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION There are Individuals and groups in this district who would like to merchandise their crop on grade, but are more or less discouraged because of the general practice in the district. In conclusion, I hope that my remarks will not be taken as a direct criticism of any individual grower or shipper, but as a plain statement of the conditions as they exist here in this district. It is not my purpose to condemn any shipper or shipping organization, for I feel that they are doing well with the quality they are forced to handle. If the western Nebraska table stock Industry is to regain its right - ful position and again be considered as a district that puts out a quality product it is going to take the united efforts of all growers and shippers working in unison and harmony. This organization, the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association, holds an important position in your industry. You can do much to - ward accomplishing these ends. Western Nebraska Is looking to you for relief. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this opportunity to present these facts as I see them. THE "PROFIT-BUSHELS" IN POTATO PRODUCTION JAMES A. HOLDEN • Scottsbluff Experimental Farm, Mitchell, Nebr. The total number of bushels of potatoes that a farmer grows is no indication of the amount of profit he will make from his crop. In fact, a farmer may have a large quantity of marketable potatoes, sell them at a fair price, and still lose money. With potatoes at 50 cents per bushel it will require an acre-yield of about 125 bushels to pay the cost of growing and marketing the crop. Therefore, a farmer may raise as many as 10,000 bushels of marketable potatoes and his crop still show a loss. Another farmer may have only 5,000 bushels and sell them at the same price per bushel and make a good profit from his potato crop; the difference is in the yield per acre. If the farmer who had 10,000 bushels harvested them from 100 acres or had an average yield of 100 bushels per acre, he lacked 25 bushels per acre of raising enough potatoes to pay expenses. Whereas, if the farmer with 5,000 bushels produced them on 16 2-3 acres he had a 300-bushel yield or 175 bushels per acre above the cost of pro - duction. These are profit bushels. </seg>
            <seg id="p630">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE wnlle the object of each grower should be to produce as many proflt-bushels as possible, it should also be his aim to produce these proflt-bushels with as low a total production as possible. The higher the yield per acre the greater will be the per cent of profit-bushels. This is true because the acre cost of production is about the same whether the yield is high or low. There are two factors which go to make potato grpwing profitable — the price per unit of production and the yield. It is not the total production but the acre yield of marketable potatoes above the acre cost of growing and marketing the crop that makes profit. It is pos - sible to cut down the total production which will stimulate higher prices, and still produce as many profit-bushels as from the higher total quantity. Where an acre yield of 125 bushels of potatoes Is required to cover the acre cost of production, a yield of 150 bushels will return 25 bushels profit, while a 300-bushel yield will give a profit of 175 bushels. A 300-bushel yield, therefore, is seven times as profitable as a yield of 150 bushels. It will require 70 acres yielding 150 bushels an acre to give the same number of profit-bushels as 10 acres yielding 300 bushels an acre. The 70 acres will produce a total of 10,500 bushels, while the 10 acres will produce only 3,000 bushels. Both fields produce the same number of proflt-bushels, but in order to do so the 70 acres produce 250 per cent more potatoes than the 10 acres, or 7,500 bushels more, and it is this 7.500 bushels which yield no profit that helps to create an overproduction and low prices. Here is a practical suggestion to the farmers who have signed acreage production contracts. When a farmer reduces his acreage of any crop it does not necessarily mean that he must reduce his profit bushels or tons. He can still produce the same number of profit units or even increase them and at the same time materially reduce his total production. It is the total production that the government wants reduced. , The question arises how can one best get the greatest number of proflt-bushels from his potato crop? This can be done by getting the maximum yield per acre. How to get high yields per acre depends on many factors, the most Important of which is productive land. You must first have land that ts^capable of producing high yields. It is im - possible to get high yields from poor run-down land. Alfalfa or sweet clover improves the soil for potatoes. There is no better place in the irrigating cropping system for potatoes than to have them follow 3 or 4 years of alfalfa. Another Important factor In the successful growing of potatoes is to follow a definite crop rotation system in which the same number of acres of potatoes are grown each year. There are -good years and </seg>
            <seg id="p631">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION there are poor years, but don't make the mistake of trying to guess the good ones. Don't be an in-and-outer. An in-and-outer Is the farmer who always has a large acreage when potatoes are cheap and no potatoes when prices are high. Growing potatoes under the in-and - outer system is a most dangerous sort of gambling and usually It is followed by the class of farmers who can least afford to take a gambling chance. There is a very simple way to prevent these costly mistakes and that is by adopting a definite crop rotation system. A definite crop rotation system will do more than any other one thing to take the gamble out of potato growing. It will assure potatoes when prices are high and it will prevent a burdensome amount when prices are low. It will also, if a proper rotation is followed. Increase the productiveness of the land so that higher yields and better quality will be produced., The potato is an important crop in the North Platte valley under irrigation. It has a higher possible acre return than any other of the main crops grown. The farmer who grows the same acreage of pota - toes every year, grows them on alfalfa land, uses good seed and gives the crop the proper care, makes more money from this potato crop one year with another than from any other crop he grows. On the other hand potatoes grown in a slipshod manner will lose more money than any other crop. The potato crop when grown by in-and-outers has caused more sad disappointments than any crop I know of, but when grown under proper conditions, potatoes have pulled more farmers out of financial holes and put them on their feet again in a short space of time, than any other two crops put together. If you are going to grow potatoes, and I think most farmers ot this section should, then grow the same number of acres each year, grow them on good clean productive land, use good seed, give them proper cultural treatment and harvest them carefully before they are damaged by frost and you will, over a. period of years, make a profit from potato growing. </seg>
            <seg id="p632">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOW THE RECORD YIELD OF POTATOES WAS PRODUCED IN COLORADO [ C. H. METZGER Associate Horticulturist Colorado Agricultural College There has been considerable publicity during the last few years on "World Record" potato yields. Permit me to say at the start that Colorado' has never claimed a new world record, because Sir Mathew Wallace, of Great Britain, raised over 2,000 bushels on a measured acre. Colorado held the American record for four years, however, when L. G. Schutte of Monte Vista, raised 1.145 bushels ot Brown Beauties on a measured acre in 1929. This yield was sur - passed in 1933 when a yield of 1,155 bushels was obtained at Stockton, California. These high yields have been obtained in connection with; the Color rado "600 Bushel Club," which! was organized in 1927 and now has 78 members. A summary of methods used by these growers has pointed out the best method for obtaining high yields of potatoes in Colorado. I . The San Luis Valley is not only Colorado's largest potato pro - ducing section, but has also produced several exceptionally high yields. John Gredig of Del Norte produced 1,069 (bushels of Bliss Triumphs on a measured acre, and Schutte has another record of 1,047 bushels of Brown Beauties on a measured acre. The valley is 12 0 miles i : The Brown Beauty, the highest yielder in the Sad Luis Valley. </seg>

The altitude of the floor of the valley is 7,600 feet. The water table In the valley Is very high being 4 to 5 feet below the surface. There are many artesian wells In the valley. The soil Is mostly of sandy or gravelly loam with a few farms having clay loams and even a few spots of adobe. Because of the high water table the system of Irrigation Is radically different than in most potato growing districts. Subirrigation is exclusively used by most of the potato growers. In this method water Is not run between each row of potatoes. In planting about every thirtieth row is skipped. When irrigation begins, a very large ditch Is run In this skipped row. This ditch is then filled with water which subs out into the adjoining ground. This method of Irrigation brings a con - siderable amount of alkali to the surface and is one reason for the practice of planting small whole seed. Schutte raised his large crop on land which had been In alfalfa for 12 years previous to the potato crop. Ten tons of barnyard manure were applied per acre. The land 4*as plowed to a depth of 12 inches, the land having been flooded previous to plowing. It will be remembered that the season of 192S brought very low prices for potatoes. SO instead of planting the small egg-sized tubers generally used in the valley Schutte planted tubers averaging nearly 6 ounces in size. He used 5,800 pounds of seed per acre when growers commonly use 1,000 pounds. The tubers were planted with a three-row cup type planter which Schutte had worked over to handle this seed.

This seed has now been tuber indexed and Schutte has 2,000 sacks of tuber indexed seed for plant - ing in 1934. Prom methods used by "600 Bushel Club" members, the require - ments for obtaining high yields may be summarized as follows: 1. Plant potatoes on alfalfa sod. The most desirable metnod is to plow under the last cutting the previous fall. Plowing the alfalfa when it is green, not only eliminates a second plowing, but also adds organic matter to the soil, which is so necessary under Western con - ditions. L. G.

Your committee found. on investigation, that some equipment used by the farmer has been Improved considerably from year to year, but we are sorry to say, that the manufacturers of potato machinery have lagged behind in the race, and In some instances, might be said to be ten years behind the times. While this applies to a certain extent to all machinery, it is most glaring in the case of harvesting equipment. For this reason. we consider that to be of greatest value to the men at this meeting, and have confined our investigations chiefly to this type of machine. One of the glaring faults of potato diggers, is the manner in which they damage the Triumph potato, which is in itself an easily damaged potato. We urge that this meeting go on record as recommending to the manufacturers of potato harvesting equipment the imporvement ot their machines to prevent to a greater extent, damage to potatoes. We urge attention to the following particular points: 1. Lowering of the general height to which the elevator chain lifts the potatoes, and subsequently has to drop them to the ground. 2. Using of a different type of elevator, to eliminate sharp points that bruise many potatoes. 3. Extending the length of the first chain, and elimination of the rear, short elevator chain. 4. Padding of the machine In several points where potatoes strike most frequently. </seg>

January 10, 1934 i - The Forty-Ninth Annual Exhibition of the Nebraska State Poultry Association was held at Norfolk, Nebraska, from January loth to 13th, 1934. There were over five hundred lollU) birds on exhibition, and were of some of the finest quality that any State Show has ever seen. The Show room was a large garage. The light was very goocL and the birds showed to an advantage. I think that it can be said that there were more people seeing the State Show at Norfolk than have seen a State Show in a great number of years. This was brought about by the splendid cooperation of the Chamber of Commerce and Radio Station of Norfolk, together with the help of the poultry people in that vicinity. The outstanding fact of the matter was that the lai mer, seemingly, was the interested party. They came from miles to witness this beautiful show. It is also a credit to the Norfolk vicinity that seventy-five percent of the birds were shown from that locality: This also speaks well lor the poultry people from that section. The judging was done by Mr. Erie Smiley in a very capable manner. The prizes were awarded, seemingly, with perfect satisfaction. The exhibition Class, as I have already stated, was unusual, and the hatchery Class was second to none. There were several state meets held at the State Show this year, and much credit is due to the Specialty Clubs for their special interest in making the meets a success. The egg Class was unusual.
