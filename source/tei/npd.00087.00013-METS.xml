Various materials have in the past been used in grasshopper baits in various pans of the world, but bran has remained the standard base. Of four unmixed bait bases experimented with, (1) coarse flaked wheat bran (shorts-free), used as a standard. 12) sawdust. (5) ground cornstalks, and (•() ground corncobs, and of combinations ut the three latter materials with a mill-run bran, the combination bait consisting of seven parts cornstalks and one part mill-run bran as a base, proved to be second to the coarse Baked wheat bran in effectiveness. The cornstalks and cobs were ground into small particles by running them through a hammernull. The corncobs-and-bran combination proved to be third in effectiveness, but the greater availability of the cornstalks makes their use superior to that of corn - cobs in the same proportions. Their obviously better properties for making a bait (lighter weight, greater absorptiveness, etc.) are also in their favor. These experiments show that ground cornstalks can not wholly replace bran as an effective grasshopper - bait base; therefore ground cornstalks arc not being recommended as a complete sub - stitute for bran. It is believed that at normal prices bran used pure would be thr most satisfactory material. In other experiments conducted to check reports of the effectiveness of magnesium sulphate ami sodium fluosilicate as substitutes for arscnicals in grasshopper baits, mag - nesium sulphate proved to be ineffective, and sodium fluosilicate at a strength of 3 per cent by weight proved to be as effective as a 5 per cent preparation of the same material, in a pure cornstalk base. Both of the latter baits killed 89 per cent of the grasshoppers offered these baits, in the cage experiment. </seg>
         <seg id="p003">Ground Cornstalks and /Cobs as Base Materials and Magnesium Sulphate and Sodium Fluosilicate as Poisons in Grasshopper Baits RAYMOND ROBERTS 1 ; For more than a quarter o£ a century poisoned baits made up with a base of wheat bran have been the chief reliance of mid western farmers in their efforts toward grasshopper control. Because of the recent drouth and the large number of grasshoppers that have developed as an indirect result of the drouth conditions, many farmers have been financially unable to purchase the bait needed for control work. Since less corn has been avail - able, more wheat has been used to replace corn in the stock-feeding program, and therefore much of the wheat bran which should have been available for grasshopper bait has been used for livestock feed. These conditions have increased the cost of bran to almost double its normal price at the same time that the farmer's purchasing power has been greatly reduced. Aid to: drouth-stricken farmers for fighting grasshoppers was first received from the federal government through the Bureau of Entomol - ogy and Plant Quarantine of the United States Department of Agriculture in 1934. In that year, and in 1936 and 1937, the federal government appropriated approximately a total of four and a half million dollars for this purpose, and it will probably be necessary to continue this type of aid for some time into the future. A good quality of wheat bran was available for making grasshopper baits, and was furnished by the federal government for this purpose in 1934 and 1936, but this was not the case in 1937. Even if the funds had been available to pay the necessary price for good wheat bran in 1937, the supply still would have been entirely inadequate to meet the demand. Consequently, a combination of sawdust and a low grade of bran was resorted to, in which 25 per cent of bran was used. In the use of this mixture the entomologists are applying their knowledge that grasshoppers have a tendency to gnaw on some hard, woody material, but still hold a preference for the bran as a food. In the event of continued heavy grass - hopper infestation, especially if accompanied by poor crop-growing con - ditions and yields, it is evident that some cheaper, or at least some more readily available base for poisoned baits than wheat bran will be needed in quantities m^the future if the crops of the Middle West are to be pro - tected from excessive loss by grasshopper depredations. Moreover, the range lands have an annual grasshopper problem that entomologists have been unable satisfactorily to deal with because of the low value per acre of the pasturage. A cheap and easily transportable base for use in such 1 Acknowledgment is nude Co Mr. Francis Yung for cooperation in preparing the experimental material! (or thii work,-to Mr. A.

         <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 312 areas would contribute considerably toward the control of range grass - hoppers by the use of poisoned baits. MATERIALS PREVIOUSLY USED AS BASES IN GRASSHOPPER BAITS An adequate and moderately priced supply of wheat bran in the United States has in the past discouraged any serious search for satisfactory sub - stitutes. The "Criddle Mixtures," depending upon horse manure as a base, developed about 1901 by Mr. Norman Criddle, of Manitoba, was one of the earliest departures from the use of bran. Horse droppings have been reported as having merit when used in grasshopper baits by investigators in other parts of the world, but in the United States, in this day of auto - mobiles and tractors the supply of this material would be entirely inade - quate. Because of trie shortage of wheat bran that existed during the World War, Swenk (Pl 7) recommended the substitution of a specially ground, coarse grade of alfalfa meal, after finding that if properly used this did not cause a serious loss in the effectiveness of the bait. Swenk and Wehr (1923) experimented by substituting fresh, chopped alfalfa, turnip or radish leaves, and also the by-product beet pulp from the sugar factories, for bran as a base. They reported that although the fresh chopped leases were 22 per cent more attractive than bran, they were impracticable to use as a base because of the difficulties in preparation and proper spreading. They also reported that beet pulp, though costing only half the price of wheat bran, was only about 66 per cent as attractive to the grasshoppers, was too coarse to mix and scatter well, and dried out too rapidly after spreading. It seems that of all substitutes for bran proposed in the United States, sawdust has received the most favor. Sawdust in combination with the whey from creameries as a combined wetting agent and attractant, has been used with satisfactory results in Wisconsin and Minnesota for several &gt;ears, often in preference to the standard bran mash bait formula. Munro (1935) indicates that sawdust "at least one year old" used in North Dakota to replace 50 per cent of the bran reduced the bait efficiency by 10 to 12 per cent, when used with white arsenic as the poison. Other reports of the use of sawdust with more or less satisfaction come from Berezhkov in Russia (1935), Golding in Nigeria (1932), and Coleno in the French Sudan (1931), and Lea in Natal (1934). No doubt there will be con - flicting reports of results from its use in the United States following the experiences with it during the summer of 1937 involving different qualities of sawdust and different conditions of mixing and application. Other substitutes for bran include middlings, chopped hay, oat husks, chaff, dry plant residues, and various other organic residues. These materials have given varying degrees of success where they have been tried. In certain countries the ground husks of ground nuts have been used. In Nigeria a species of sorghum known as "Guinea-corn" has been used with bran, and a similar article known as "bagasse" (cane fiber) has been used. In Kenya, coffee parchment base proved highly successful. </seg>
         <seg id="p005">Materials for Grasshopper Baits Probably the most unusual material, but one which shows the extent to which grasshoppers will go in feeding upon fibrous materials, is the use ot newspaper torn into pieces of about two square inches and poisoned. This was reported as satisfactory as a substitute for bran in Nigeria, where the cost ot transportation for bran was excessive. In Siberia a mossy turf has been used and found to be as satisfactory and as acceptable to die grasshoppers as dried horse dung. Fresh strips of sugar cane have been pounded and soaked in arsenic solutions and used satisfactorily. Dried cow dung is also mentioned in an article from the French Sudan by Coleno (1931). Malt sprouts were used in Manitoba in 1932, and are said to have "proved a cheap and effective substitute for bran," but their use seems to McrA'T bee" discarded ' as would be indicated by the report of Mitchener (1934) that their bait as then used contained a large amount of sawdust. MATERIALS TESTED IN RECENT NEBRASKA EXPERIMENTS After thoroughly considering all of the qualities desirable in a base for grasshopper bait the conclusion was reached that ground or broken-up cornstalks, if attractive enough to the grasshoppers/should make an ideal base. Cornstalks are sufficiently available/since most of the grasshopper - infested territory raises some corn. They are very light, and for this reason even when transportation is necessary could be carried without difficulty. They are highly porous and absorptive, and are not difficult to handle; They consist largely of pith rather than fibrous material. This is a desir - able quality of cornstalks, and the lack of it is one of the objections to the use of such materials as chaff or sunflower stalks. In addition to their other qualities, cornstalks, bare of leaves, are a product of little economic value .to the farmer. In the early spring of 1937 a considerable quantity was run through a small hammermill. This material, consisting of almost bare stalks, was put through a three-sixteenths-inch screen. Corncobs were treated similarly to the cornstalks and served as the basis for another test. Sawdust obtained from the Lancaster county supply of federal bait material was screened through an eight-mesh screen and was used. The fourth base used was the best grade of wheat bran obtain - able. The pure bran was used as a check, for its desirable qualities as a base in grasshopper bait are common knowledge. EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED . Several experiments were conducted during the summer of 1937 in order to compare ground cornstalks as a base in grasshopper baits with several other base materials in common use, including standard shorts-free wheat bran. Seven different base materials were used, as follows: (1) coarse flaked, shorts-free wheat bran; (2) sawdust; (3) ground cornstalks; (4) ground corncobs; (5) sawdust combined with mill-run bran in the proportion of seven parts by weight (28 ounces) of the former to one part by weight (4 "ounces) of the latter; (6) ground cornstalks combined with mill-run bran in the same proportions, i.e., 28 ounces of the former to 4 </seg>
         <seg id="p006">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 312 ounces of the latter; and (7) ground corncobs also combined with mill-run bran in the same proportions by weight as given above. This proportion would be the equivalent of 87 l/ 2 pounds ot the sawdust or ground cornstalks or cobs to 12/2 pounds of bran for each 100 pounds of base. The sawdust and mill-run bran used were obtained from the Lancaster county supply o£ federal material. For the field applications of these base materials, a basic formula of two pounds of each, dry weight, was used, to which were added two ounces of white arsenic (arsenic tri - oxide) as the poison, and 0.06 of an ounce of amyl acetate as the attractant. The amount ot water used in each case varied according to the bulk of the base, rather than to its weight, and is shown in Table 1. This formula is the one that was found most satisfactory against immature grasshoppers in experiments conducted in western Nebraska during 1922 and 1923, and reported by Swenk and Wehr (1923) and Swenk (1927) in Bulletin 183 and Research Bulletin 41, respectively, of the Nebraska Station. It con - sists of 100 pounds of the base, 6 pounds of white arsenic, 3 ounces of amyl acetate, and 10 gallons of water. The baits in Experiment 1 were applied on June 22, to a native-grass pasture consisting largely of grass which was already ripening. There were tall weeds along a natural drainage ditch, which formed a protection lor grasshoppers during the heat of the day. A large number of the poisoned grasshoppers died in the weeds along the ditch bank, rather than on the treated plots. The plots were sufficiently well scattered, how - ever, to prevent any bunching of the grasshoppers from two or more plots, and a careful estimate was made of the grasshoppers that died off the plots. The baits in Experiments II and HI were the same. They were applied on )une 28 and 30, to a field bearing a good stand of alfalfa about a foot high. These treatments were made on a larger scale than those in Experi - ment I involving tour times the area, and using four pounds of the base material instead of two pounds, as in Experiment I. One-fourth-acre pots were measured off and poisoned with the respective baits. These plots were separated by fifty-two feet of untreated ground, which was at the time regarded as adequate to eliminate confusion in results through the migration of poisoned grasshoppers. This proved to be insufficient, how-. ever lor complete isolation. Contemplated further field tests will involve separate fields and larger plots. The amount of bait applied had little or no effect upon the total efficiency of the bait, because of the migrations of grasshoppers from and to the plots. If the plots had been spaced far enough apart to prevent all migration of grasshoppers, then the total kill efficiency of the bait could have been accurately computed, and the amount of such bait necessary to produce a total kill could have been given in figures. In Experiments II and 111, sawdust base baits were not included. The bait applications for Experiment II had been planned for June 2b, and the various baits had been made up on the evening of June 25. A rain during the night of June 25, and cloudy, cool weather on June 26 and 27 prevented its distribution until June 28. The mixed bait was stored </seg>

Although all-of the baits had heated somewhat by the morn - ing of June 28, and emitted the odor o£ fermentation rather than that of amyl acetate and were showing signs of molding when opened, the oppor - tunity of trying out such stale baits was not passed over. But in order to check the results of Experiments II with freshly prepared baits of the same sort, Experiment II was duplicated on June 30 by Experiment 111. The baits used in Experiment 111 were mixed and applied on the morning of June 30. : ' The physical properties of bait bases is an important factor. While the baits used in these experiments were made up according to a weight basis it appeared logical that bulk and moisture-holding capacity should be of considerable value in determining the amount of poison that should be used with a base. While a single unsatisfactory test of unmixed corn - stalks with triple dosages of arsenic and amyl acetate was tried, the writer believes that heavier dosages, possibly not three times as heavy, can be used satisfactorily. . •'¦¦.. ¦¦ :.' • Table I. — Physical properties of base materials used in grasshopper baits.

It will be seen that ground cornstalks have at least twice the bulk of any other of the unmixed bases used. Water was added to the dry-bait base and poison in quantities sufficient to reach what seemed to be the proper consistency, rather than to any-definite measure. This was done in order to get an approximation of the amount of water which could satisfactorily be taken up by the base, rather than to establish any fixed formula. The working out of a fixed iortnuh will re - quire further experimentation. From Table 1 it will be seen that as compared with the two and one-half gallons of water to twenty-five pounds of bran, </seg>
         <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 312 as recommended in the standard formula, an excess of three and one-half ounces of water was used to the pound, or five and one-half pints to twenty-five pounds, of bran bait in these experiments. This did not seem to affect the physical properties of the bait so as to increase in any way the difficulties in applying the same. All of the baits used spread quite satisfactorily when used as indicated. RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS TaUe 1 indicates the number of grasshoppers of all species and ages found dead per square yard on the various plots at the time of termination of the experiment on June 25 in Experiment I, July 1 in Experiment 11, and July 3 in Experiment 111 (the afternoon of the third day). The results indicate that pure bran is by far the most satisfactory base if the availability and cost of trie material is not a primary consideration. The single tests in Experiment I of pure sawdust, the sawdust-and-bran mix - ture, and the corncobs-and-stalks mixture are regarded as inadequate to Table 2. — Number of grasshoppers per square yard jound dead at the termination of the experiment on the afternoon of the third day after the application.

The other base materials, in the order of their apparent value as indicated by their kill of grass - hoppers, and without reference to their relative costs, are (1) coarse flaked shorts-free bran, (2) cornstalks seven parts and bran one part, (3) corn - cobs seven parts and bran one part, (4) corncobs, and (5) cornstalks. The pure corncobs and pure cornstalks show little promise as base materials. But corncobs and cornstalks with a little bran added are so materially im - proved in efficiency as bait bases as to hold promise as readily available diluents of bran in regions where sawdust is not, or not easily, to be obtained as a local product. The proportion of bran used in these experi - ments with the ground corncobs and cornstalks may not have been the most efficient, considering both efficiency and cost. Further experiments would be necessary to determine that point. The records in Table 2 are the result of random samples of five square yards on each plot. </seg>
         <seg id="p009">Materials for Grasshopper Baits DISCUSSION Cornstalks have twice the bulk of any other pure base tested In these experiments. The pithy center of the stalks is the valuable part. This has a high absorptive or water-carrying power, which should add to the value of the bait because of the attractiveness of moisture to grasshoppers on hot, dry days. On the basis of bulk rather than weight the cornstalks-and - bran mixture would go three times as far as pure, bran, while the results of the experiments showed pure bran to be only about one-third more effective. With the possibility, that cornstalks could be used on the basis of bulk rather than weight, a single test of cornstalks was made in connec - tion with Experiment I. Six ounces of white arsenic and 5.4 grams of amyl acetate were used with |two pounds of stalks. The check on this plot showed 5.65 grasshoppers killed per square yard. This is a much larger kill than was obtained with cornstalks alone at the normal rate of poison - ing used in Experiment I arid two and one-half times that of the average for cornstalks. Although a single test cannot be taken as conclusive, this would indicate that cornstalks might prove more efficient if used according to bulk rather than weight. It is entirely possible that the grasshoppers did not get enough of the cornstalks in the weaker mixtures for a lethal dose. In order to make a comparison of the value of cornstalks with the other base materials used in the experiments, a cash value of the processed stalks probably would be the best- basis from which to figure. Estimating a crop of stalks at a ton per acre, the cost of binding and dropping the bundles in the field is about j $1.20. Processing should cost not more than $3.00 per ton, and hauling about $030. If the stalks are removed in the spring, their value in holding show and moisture has largely been realized. The value of the stalks disked and left on the ground is estimated at $1.00. Then the total value of the stalks processed and ready to use in the bait mixture is about $5.50 per ton. With that estimated value for the corn stalks, and $20.00 for bran, the seven to one mixture would cost $731 per ton. The kill obtained with pure bran was only approximately a half more than that with the combination bait. In other wordsj with bran at $20.00 the combination bait could cost $12.57. If it definitely develops that the cornstalks can be used on a j bulk basis, rather than a weight basis, with satisfactory results, then the mixture becomes worth $33.44 per ton on the bran basis; . . I ' • Corncobs have little advantage to make them recommendable. They are much less available than are the cornstalks. They have a certain fuel value, which is not true of die stalks. They do not have the advantage of bulk which stalks possess, and are much harder to process, and for that reason would prove to be more expensive. For these reasons the corncob - and-bran combination should, not be considered of as great importance as the cornstalks-and-bran combination. Corncobs could be used to replace bran in the base, but do not have the possibilities in the mixture with bran shown by cornstalks.; Where corncobs are available, if they can be processed .".-. y ' "• ' ¦ ' • ¦ ¦ ... :¦•'••'¦• : . .-'-¦ '¦ '¦ .; </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 312 cheaply, they should produce considerably better results than sawdust, according to these experiments. • * . , Although sawdust did not prove very satisfactory in Experiment I as here reported, it should probably be further compared with the cornstalks. Much of the sawdust obtained in Nebraska for use in the federal bait last summer was in such large chunks that the county committees found it desirable to run it through a hammermill. Some committees processed all of their sawdust before using it. Such processing would very largely elim - inate that figure in the cost of the stalks, or would reduce the cost of the stalks in relation to the sawdust to $2.50. If the sawdust were locally available it could probably be purchased for that figure, but when it is shipped in from the more northern states the freight amounts to about $5.00 per ton. Sawdust was used in the federal bait mixtures last summer at the rate of three parts to one part of bran. On the same basis as a seven - to-one cornstalk and bran mixture, using the figures given above for freight and processing, and allowing $0.50 per ton for sawdust and a like amount for handling, the base would cost $11.75 per ton. The least it can cost is $8.75 if not processed. While the figures in the table show sawdust to have half the volume of cornstalks, it must be remembered that the saw - dust used was dehydrated to three-eighths of its original weight. Other lots used in Nebraska in 1937 were reported to have had a considerably greater quantity of water than that. If sawdust shipped in for the purpose of mix - ing baits for grasshoppers is composed of five-eighths water, the dry weight content is six ounces per pound. When a three-to-one mixture of this saw - dust is used, there is only one-fourth more sawdust in the mixture than there is of bran. In the experiments the dehydrated sawdust used in- a seven-to-one mixture gave very poor results, which indicates that a high percentage of bran must be used to obtain satisfactory results. These results are based on far too limited a number of experiments to be regarded as conclusive. They are now reported upon as having possibil - ities, in the belief that under possible emergency conditions in 1938 some may wish to avail themselves of the opportunity to use cornstalk bait, and also other experimenters in other states will take up the problem of cheap and readily available base materials. While it will not be practical for the in - dividual farmer to haul a few bundles, or even a ton, of cornstalks to a community mill to have them made into grasshopper bait base, a com - munity project could be worked out whereby a portable hammermill would be made available and the cornstalks for the community ground in a short time. A difficulty involved is that the cornstalks are not available at the time grasshopper bait is needed, so that the stalks for this purpose would have to be harvested and stored or processed and stored some time in ad - vance of their need. This would require a certain degree of foresighted - ness and might lead to some unnecessary work, for in certain seasons an abundance of grasshoppers does not necessarily follow a season of. egg abundance. Where the range-land grasshoppers are a serious annual scourge, the possibilities in the use of cornstalks as a light, easily mixed, </seg>

MAGNESIUM SULPHATE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ARSENICALS Hubert W. and Mable S. Frings (1937) have recently reported on some ; preliminary experiments with grasshopper baits, on a few grasshoppers confined in small cages, as a result of which magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt) was suggested by them as a promising substitute for arsenic com - pounds as the insecticide element in the baits. The experiments mentioned seemed to be of sufficient significance to those who made them to warrant their publication. Shortly after the original publication of these observa - tions, their findings were republished in various popular magazines, all of which gave them a quite general publicity. These popular articles pro - duced a favorable feeling among many farmers toward the use of this material, and they spread the propaganda regarding it. In places this reached a stage where, county agents reported, their farmers stated that they would not use any arsenicals in their grasshopper baits during the summer of 1937.. ••; I It is of course true that if magnesium sulphate should prove to be a satisfactory substitute for arsenicals it should receive general use, for it would eliminate the danger of handling these potent human and domestic - animal poisons. Entomologists in general, however, were not as willing to accept these suggestions, based on very limited and admittedly prelim - inary observations, as were tne farmers and were inclined to require further tests of the value of magnesium sulphate in grasshopper baits. The follow - ing is the formula proposed! for the magnesium sulphate grasshopper bait by the Frings: 8ran.......

Two pounds of bait were used, made up: according to the formula ; above, except that amyl acetate was used instead of the molasses. Since this substitution affected somewhat the percentages of the various ingredients, the results here reported may not be as conclusive as if the formula had been exactly followed. However, the.effectiveness of this bait should have : been representative of the toxic value of magnesium sulphate against grass - hoppers, since the proportion of the base to the poison remained the same. Two pounds of bait were used on a one-eighth-acre plot, using 24 ounces of pure flaked wheat bran and 8 ounces of magnesium sulphate. The cover on this plot was similar to that on which the combination cornstalks-bran bait, containing white arsenic as the poison, was used.

Not a dead grasshopper was to be found on the entire plot, although the grass - hoppers had apparently eaten the bait, for no flakes were to be found on the ground. On the hypothesis that the 64-hour interval at the time of checking the other plots might have not been long enough for the sup - posed toxic action of the Epsom salt to take effect, another check of the plot was made a week later, but no dead grasshoppers were found. Following the field experiments, cage experiments were conducted under control conditions in the laboratory. Twenty-five grasshoppers were placed in each of five screen cages. The base for the bait used in these experiments was cornstalks, which were treated with 20 per cent, 30 per cent, and 40 per cent (replicated), by weight, of magnesium sulphate, with a check cage in which the grasshoppers were fed plain alfalfa throughout the experi - ment. In those cages in which the magnesium sulphate baits were used the grasshoppers were fed the bait but once, since under field conditions they would probably have but a single opportunity to feed on the bait. On the following days upon which observations were made all of the grass - hoppers were fed fresh alfalfa. The bait was left in the cages for two hours. During that period there were two or three grasshoppers feeding on the bait almost any time that the cages were examined. There seemed to be \ill\e difference in the number of grasshoppers that fed upon the 20 per cent bait and those that fed on the 40 per cent bait.

The greatest mortality among the grass - hoppers was on the first day following the feeding of the baits, both in the cages where magnesium sulphate baits were fed and in the check. This eariy heavy mortality was probatty due to injury by rough handling of the insects in capturing them. There were as many dead grasshoppers at the end of the eight-day observation period in the check cage as the largest number found dead in a treated cage, i.e., one of the cages containing the 40 per cent magnesium-sulphate bait. Three of the grasshoppers in the second cage containing magnesium sulphate 40 per cent gave up Sarco - pnaga {ellyi (a dipterous parasite) larvae.

Sodium fluosilicate has been tried as a poison in grasshopper baits (by several experimenters and found to be effective. After making the cage tests with magnesium sulphate, two cage tests with sodium fluosilicate in baits, instead of arsenic, were made. These show the effectiveness of this material for that purpose. The grasshoppers collected for these tests were fewer than in the mag - nesium-sulphate tests and therefore were handled in a different way. They were all adults, taken individually and placed, twenty-five per cage, in each of three cages, on August 12.1 They were all fed fresh alfalfa until August :¦.. 22. On. that date there were eighteen live grasshoppers remaining in each : of the three cages. The mortality in the magnesium sulphate experiments averaged 36 per cent, while the mortality in these three cages, fed alfalfa for about the same period, was 28 per cent. This difference may well be explained in two ways: (1) the grasshoppers were captured individually and therefore received more careful handling, and (2) they were all adults and therefore more resistive to poisons and less susceptible to injury than nymphs, which made up a percentage of the grasshoppers used in the magnesium-sulphate experiments. The grasshoppers were not fed on August 22, and on the morning of August 23 all three cages were fed cornstalks, the check unpoisoned, the others containing 3 and 5 per cent, by weight, of sodium fluosilicate. No attractant was added. The fol - '¦¦ lowing brief table gives the results of these tests.

Sodium fluosilicate costs approxi - mately a third more than white arsenic, which would make its use slightly cheaper than white arsenic. . .. -:-.'-':. ¦ </seg>
