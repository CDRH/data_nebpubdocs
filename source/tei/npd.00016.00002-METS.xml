The help is sufficient I work at the present time. I would recommend and earnestly hope that the legislature will make an appropriation for metal fixtures for the two vaults in this office. The archives and records of this office are valuable beyond estimation, and should be protected against any possible danger from lire, and, therefore, I recommend that the wooden boxes and cases in which they are kept be replaced with metal furniture and cases. Cost would not exceed (6,000.00. I would also call the attention of the legislature to the enactment of a law compelling the Superintendents of the several institutions to deposit all funds of every description that come into their hands faring their term of office with the State Treasurer, in excess of ouo hundred dollars on the first of every month. Said funds to be known as a special fund for the institution creating same. This fu.id to be paid out by warrant drawn by the Auditor on the State Treasurer after the vouchers have been allowed and properly signed by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings. At the present time there is no law allowing such funds to be created and no authority ever given by ihe State Board. While these funds may have been honestly expended for the best interest of the state, the system is wrong for the reason that the money is expended without the approval of the board and the oply knowledge that the Board of Public Lands and Buildings has of the transaction is the report made to them by the Superintendents after the money has been paid out. It also leads to the purchase of merchandise and improvements in many cases without competition of price and there is no good business reason when the farm produce is ■old the receipts therefor should not be turned over to the State Treasurer and credited to this special fund for the use of that institution od! \ Thi? reason I advocate giving to the several institutions an </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 amount not to exceed one hundred dollars, to be known as a cash fund, is to meet the emergencies that arise that would inconven the several Superintendents to have to file vouchers before these emergencies could be adjusted. As a member of the Board of Public Lands and. Buildings I see where the Board has failed in many cases in letting contracts for public uildings in not being more careful in their specifications to see that verything pertaining to the completion of a building is in the ron - ract. For instance, Board of Public Lands and Buildings prior to this dministration let contract for cottages at Norfolk. Con - ract did not call for wire guards on the windows. These had to be urnished before the building was completed, and undoubted! aid more than we would, had they been in the original contract, Another building did not call for complete finishings of the walls, and o leave them in first class condition, will cost about $400 that should lave been in the original contract. Last' Legislature abolished the office of State Architect. I 1&gt; this was for the best interest of the state, as the total expenditure for the past two years, has only been $2,416.54, compared to $5,634.49 paid during the previous bi-ennium for state service, which does not include office expense, such as stationery, postage, express, telephone and telegraph. I would also recommend an amendment to Section 19, Chapter 4 8, page 1035, Wheeler's Compiled Statutes, which now reads: 'The Board of Public Lands and Buildings shall advertise for supplies not o exceed $1,000 of stationery, etc., sixty days prior to the convening f the Legislature." his section should read, that they shall advertise or supplies, furniture and repairs not to exceed $3,500, as it requires more than this amount, and as we can only get bids for $1,000, the Legislature practically pays retail price for every dollar they use over nd above this $1,000, and when the Legislature convenes there is not upplies sufficient to do business with, you can readily see that this is not a good business proposition. The greatest leak in handling state nione- t now work under in purchasing supplies for the various state institutions. The present law compels the Board of Purchase and Supplies to buy for Eions separately. Had this Board power to buy for all institu - te could save thousands of dollars by buying in large quan tributing to the several institutions. The state should soon organize on a business basis, and have a *tate buyer, establish a warehouse, at some central point, ship all good? </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 to this point and distribute from there, purchasing everything at whole- Bale instead of the present unbusiness-like plan. I would also recommend an appropriation for the publication of a "Blue Book." Last issue was exhausted long ago. The state is rapidly growing in population, hence, there are more schools, libraries, news - papers to supply and more requests from the general public. Other oAcers from the several states are sending us their Blue Books and asking for ours in return. The book could be compiled by the Secretary to the Printing Board, without additional expense only for printing; same. There should also be funds appropriated for a map of Ne - braska. This work could also be done by the Secretary to the Printing Board without expense, only for publishing. Norfolk Asylum will need another cottage for the accommodation of the insane from the northern part of the state, as the applications for that institution as the present time are greater than the accommo - dations. Beatrice should have another cottage with accommodations for the feeble minded that are over the age of 18. Under the present law no one can be admitted that are over this age. Neither can they be sent to any other institution. We have on file now twenty applica - tions for admissions to this institution, that cannot be admitted on ac - count of their age. We need this building to relieve the crowded con - dition there now, as in years past quite a number have been admitted that had attained a greater age than 18. At this date, there is not room for more than ten applicants in all departments. Tou will at once see - the necessity of more room. They also need an administration- build - ing for the use of the officers, separate from the other buildings. At Geneva Industrial School it will be necessary to build a cottage for the farmer and his family, as at the present time it is impossible to retain a good man under the present inconveniences, and it is essential that the farmer be there all the time. They also need an appropria - tion for a green house. The matter of insurance on state property other than the main buildings, such as farm cottages, barns, cattle, grain, etc., at the pres - ent time there is no insurance carried on above property except at Hastings. There we carry $30,000. There is not a represen farmer in Nebraska but what carries insurance on their proper see no reason why the state should be an exception, as the class of peo - ple employed, is certainly unsafe, as regards fire, more so than the average farmer and his employes. </seg>

During the biennium of 1905-6 the State Printing Board has se - cured bids upon and awarded contracts for many hundreds of dollars' worth of miscellaneous printing and stationery supplies for the dif - ferent departments and institutions operating under the state govern - ment. While the volume of this business makes it impractical to submit here a detailed statement thereof, the records of the board give tangible and indisputable proof that the numerous small items have been purchased by this method at a net reduction In cost of from 25 to 50 per cent, as compared with the prices customarily paid previous to the adoption of the present system. LFor each letting a tabulated schedule is prepared, giving full infor - atlon regarding items, bidders, prices and awards, the same being preserved as a portion of the records of this board. Throughout the biennium competition has been keen, with the result that, notwithstanding the heavy advance in the cost of labor and material, the state has secured a much greater value for the money expended for printing than in previous periods.

            <seg id="p025">25 KKIflKT OP BNGIXEKR. Dear Sir: I herewith beg leave to submit the following report for the biennium ending November 30, 1906: E,e amount appropriated for covering steam pipes was $500.00 this amount we have used $475.66, which has helped very ma - in keeping down the cost of running the steam department, lmately the cost of running tke pumping station is $200.00 for nnium or $8.33 1-3 per month. There has been about $600.00 spent in sewer system and which has put the building in a nearly sanitary condition. Instead of there being a deficiency in fuel and light, we will have a small amount left in that fund, which amount at this time is $970.24, instead of approximately $1,000.00 deficiency two years ago. There has not been a stoppage in the sewer system in this biennium and through our perfect flushing system, with plenty of water of our own, the state has been saved about $1,600.00 for the biennium. tin July, 1905, new fleues were placed in boiler No. 1, and a - g to Insurance Inspector's report, boilers Nos. 2. 3, 4, will have to be placed with new flues, which will cost about $700.00. We have a little four-horse power boiler to run a six-horse power engine which is out of the question to get good service^ I would therefore recommend the purchase of a twelve-horse power boiler, •which in case of emergency could be connectd to a steam pump in the pumping station. The approximate cost, installed, would be about Our gasoline engine being in a damp hole 45 feet in the ground, Is giving a great amount of trouble and will have to be replaced with either a new engine or motor. To install either, with shafting, pu would cost about $600.00: $100.00 for repairs on cinder elevator. All fire boxes will have to be replaced with new flre brick at cost of about |tH Total amount of appropriation asked for $l,SOO.00. LA11 of the above repairs are absolutely i , and I then amend the appropriation of the same. Respectfully submitted. U. G. SAWYER Lincoln, N'eb., Dec. 1, l»0«. Hon. A. &lt;;alu*ha.
