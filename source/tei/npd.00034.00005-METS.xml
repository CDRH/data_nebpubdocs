            <seg id="p003">GROWING FOREST TREES IN WESTERN NEBRASKA. BY W. P. SNYDER.* INTRODUCTION. For more than a quarter of a century farmers have been try ing to grow trees in western Nebraska without surface or sub - irrigation. That the result has been a failure from a purely com - mercial point of view is evidenced by the lack of any groves that furnish lumber, fence posts, or enough fuel to repay the cost of production. A few trees, however, are bein&lt;: grown about the buildings and in the "tree claim" plantations. These are sufficient in some localities to break the monotony of the landscape and to add much to the beauty of the country. These trees, dwarfed, scrubby, and mostly less than twenty-five feet high, are chiefly Box Elder, tho there are some Green Ash. Cottonwood. White Elm. Rlack Locust. Honey Locust. Mulberry, and Catalpa. Thee Claim Act. — The groves were planted because of the •'Tree Claim Act" passed by Congress in 1873, but repealed in 1891. Under this law the title to a quarter-section of land could be secured by a qualified homesteader without residence on the land, by planting ;&gt;nd cultivating for eight years ten acres of trees, 675 to the acre, on the quarter-section. This was an effort on the part of the Federal government to forest portions of the prairie land. On some "claims" there were ten acres of rather thrifty trees from four to ten feet high when "proof wai made. * When this experiment was planned and during the first few years of its progress the United States Forest Service cooperated with the Sub - station, but later the Forest Service severed its connection. The Sub - station has received very valuable assistance from the Department of Forestry of the University of Nebraska, represented by Professor F. O. Miller, Professor Frank J. Phillips, Professor O. L. Sponsler, and Pro - fessor W. J. Duppert. Mr. L. L. Zook. of the D. S. Department of Agriculture, took the pho - tographs In 1912. Professor W. J. Morrill, who is now in charge of Forestry in the Uni verslty, has carefully edited the Forestry portion of this bulletin. </seg>

After the requirements of the law had been fulfilled, the trees were ghrca little or no attention. Weeds and grass fought the trees for the scanty Mpplj of water thai was available tire ran thru many proves, doing much in jury, and cattle often completed the damage. Native Forest Trees. — No forest trees grew on the table - lands before the advent of the settlers. There were some grow Fig. 1 Plowing up typical "tree claim." Substation Farm.

Many of these trees were cut and used by the settlers for fence posts, buildings, and fuel.

During the dry years of the '90's the homesteaders took the tinker from the school land and from other land where the owners did not reside in the community.

The bench land upon which the trees are planted is approximately twenty-flve feet higher, or 2,850 feet. The "tal&gt;le land" is the highest land on the Substation farm and is about 175 feet higher than the "bench land." The surface of the "table-land" is generally level. </seg>

The sides of these are generally steep, while the bottoms are narrow and from 25 to 50 feet below the level of the table-land. Soil. — The soil on the bench land is a very fine sandy loam very easy to work. The distance to water is about 50 feet. This soil is typical of that found on the benches of the Platte River valley, tho it contains no alkali. The soil on the table-land is very similar to that on the bench land and produces good crops in seasons of sufficient Fig. 6. Black Locust grove on table-land. Planted in 1907.

The canyon bottoms have a soil which is similar to that ou the "bench land," while on the sides there is little except the yellow subsoil, which, however, is of sufficient fertility to grow trees.

It was plowed in the fall about eight inches deep. In the following spring it was disked thoroly, harrowed, and marked for planting. All the cultivated land planted has been prepared in a similar manner, in order to Invr the soil moist and in the best possible condition at the time of planting. No preparation was given to the soil in the canyon tract, excepting to break a furrow for setting some plats of trees. The methods of planting were probably somewhat more careful than would be used ordinarilv bv a farmer. tTHE Stock. — The trees ordered were of the best quality that ild be produced, Iho they often arrived in very poor condition, me had been damaged by being kept too warm after being dug the fall previous and others had become too dry while being shipped. Of the common deciduous species, one-year-old seed - lings were planted except cottonwood and the poplars, which were one-year-old rooted cuttings. We endeavored to avoid getting stock pulled from swamp land or river islands. Of the conifers three-year-old transplants were used. I Manner of Planting. — Two methods of planting were fol - ed, the "slit" method and the "hole" method. The former hod consists of making a slit in the soil with a spade, stick - ing the roots of the tree into the slit and pressing the soil firmly about the roots with the spade. The latter method consists of digging a hole with the spade, setting the tree, and pack'ng the soil about the roots with the hands and feet. In some instances where it had not been possible to summer-till the land and the soil was dry, water was poured into the holes before the trees were planted. The trees were carried either in a bucket of mud and water, or wrapped in a wet burlap sack. The tree was taken from the bucket or sack and set into the soil qnicklv «o that the roots could not become dry. Great care wnt» taken to have trees set a few inches deeper than they were in the nursery and to pack the soil firmly iibout the roots. Stand Seotred. — The percentage of trees that lived during the first season after planting depended on the variety of the trees, the condition of the trees when planted, the condition of the soil, and the weather duriner and following the planting. Rome varieties are much more likely to grow as they are not so </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 Growing Forest Trees in Western Nebraska easily injured in storage and in shipment or by wind and drouth after being planted. The Catalpa, Box Elder, and poplars are probably the most hardy in these respects, and the conifers the least hardy. If a fair stand is to be secured, it is quite neces - sary that the trees be planted in moist soil. It is a great ad - vantage to plant after a snow or rain when the top soil is satu - rated with water. Tt is well also to plant during cloudy, moist veather rather than during clear, windy weather. The stand of trees has ranged from nearly 100 per cent to almost nothing. The conditions mentioned above were the factors governing the percentage of stand. In some shipments, we received fresh cut - tings in place of the rooted cuttings which we had ordered. We planted these, hut in only one instance did we secure a fair stand. Usually none of the cuttings grew.

The trees have been given clean tillage. This has required the use of a one-horse cultivator and occasionally the hoe. Some groups of trees now shade the ground so thoroly after they are clothed in their summer foliage that no cultivation is required during the latter part of the summer. We see need of continu ing the cultivation only when it is necessary to keep grass or weeds from growing PRUNING. have pruned the trees each spring to prevent the forma a of forks that would later result in splitting the main trunk the tree, and to eliminate side branches that interfered with cultivation. Some catalpas have been cut back to the ground. The new shoots from these, in most cases, have frozen back dur - ing the first winter after their growth. SPACING AND MIXTURES. Neither the planting of trees different distances apart nor planting different species together has given any very decided </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Growing Forest Tree* in Western Nebraska 15 results yet. In a few plats, the trees have made more growth where they were planted farther apart. INJURIES. ■ Pocket gophers cut off about twenty-five per cent of the lver Maple, during the first winter after they were planted. They cut off also nearly all the Honey Locust in one plat and repeated the operation for one or two years after the plat had been replanted. ThiB plat adjoined prairie land on two sides. The gophers destroyed only a very few trees of other varieties. Cottontail rabbits nibbled the bark off nearly all the Honey Locust trees in one plat and a few in other plats. This was during the first winter after the trees were planted. A tree badly barked usually sprouted at the surface of the ground and sent up a straight shoot more valuable than the original tree, and therefore little, if any, real damage resulted. If the rab - bits had continued their work during succeeding winters they would, no doubt, have accomplished considerable damage. Borers. — The borers have killed nearly all the Black Locust on the table-land and have injured all on the bench land to such an extent that they have no value. Many of the Black Locust trees are entirely dead, but some still send up sprouts from the roots. During 1912 we found many Green Ash affected by borers. We presume the borers will accomplish the same results with the Ash as they have with the Black Locust, especially if their growth is cheeked by drouth. We found a few Honey Locust trees in which borers were working, but each of t:iese trees gave evidence of being in a weak, sickly condition, which probably antedated the insect attack. (Sep figures 5 and 6.) Winterkilling- -The effects of winter drouth and winter freezing are so closely connected that no attempt to differen - tiate the two was made. The Osage Orange froze to the ground and nearly all were killed during the first winter. The Russian Mulberry was killed on the bench land, but only froze back slightly on the table-land. The Silver Maple and Catalpa freexe back some each winter with little or no injury.

            <seg id="p017">Growing Forest Trees in Western Nebraska 17 The purpose for which the trees are being planted and the location should determine which of these species should be planted. There is a popular belief that the Cottonwood, Caro - lina Poplar, Norway Poplar, and other similar trees will not live long on the table-land. This opinion is probably correct. It is also reported th-it the Carolina Poplar is more subject to in - jury by borers than the Cottonwood. It is the writer's opinion that neither tree will be injured by borers where the conditions permit of a vigorous growth. It is noticeable that when a tree has become weakened by insufficient moisture or from any other cause, its enemies combine to hasten its death. It may be advisable to plant some of these trees on the table-land on ac - count of their rapid prowth. with a view of replacing them later by slower grawtafj .md hardier trees.

            <seg id="p018">18 Growing Forest Trees in Western Nebraska The Russian Olive is of use as an ornamental tree or for a windbreak.

Altho this species will be unsatisfactory, the good specimens Fig. 11 Russian Olive on bench land, October, 1912. Planted in Kso very promising that we feel fully justified in recommend the American Elm rather highly. The Box Elder should always be given a place. It is hardy and furnishes more green spots on the table-land than any other species. It will furnish shade and protection, and improve the appearance of the landscape more quickly, and probably more effectively, than anv other tree on the table-land. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Growing Forest Trees in Western Nebraska 19 The Honey Locust and Hackberry give promise of being moBt useful for fence posts and for windbreaks about the farm. SPECIES LEAST PROMISING. The following table gives a list of the trees which we are trying but consider unsatisfactory : Fig. 12. Honey Locust grove on bench land, October, 1912. Planted in 1907. Height, about 10 feet. Table 4. — Trees that are very unsatisfactory for planting in this region. Black Locust ; killed by borers. Gatalpa; killed back during winter but sprout.

Our experience indicates that the trees in the above list should be planted only on an experimental scale, if nt all. under conditions similar to those prevailing here. The Black Locust is the most promising of any until the borers attack it. but these </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Growing Forest Trees in Western Nebraska insects have completely destroyed the Black Locust groves in this locality. Ash resisted the borers for a longer time bnt are now being attacked to an extent that indicates this species will be either killed outright or badly injured. We have taken every precaution possible to secure the true hardy &lt;:atalpas. bnt we have not found them hardy here. Some of them, after many years, may make a fence post, but they freeze back so much and are 80 scrubby that they do not seein to be worth planting. We are dealing only with conditions as they have existed on this farm since the spring of 1907, and are not indicating what these trees may do on irrigated land or in other localities. The species not included in either Table 3 or Table 4 are giv - ing poor results or have not been tried sufficiently for ub to judge now of their merit. CONIFERS. With one exception our results with the conifers, or ever greens, have been quite discouraging. Altho we purchased the best stock obtainable and have given it good care, after planting several thousand trees only a few are alive. The best results were with fifty Black Hills Spruce which were set out in 1908. These were 18 inches high, three or four times transplanted, and shipped with a ball of earth on each tree. Nearly every one is living and making a fair growth. The next best results have been with three-year-old transplants of the Western Yellow Pine, often called Bull Pine, and with Jack Pine, both being planted in the canyons, where on the heavily grassed, northern slopes the best results were obtained. Plant - ing in furrows seems to be better than planting without the furrows. Canyon planting, however, does not appear eneourag ing. The trees planted in the canyon in 1908 were killed by fire in 1910. The space was replanted the following spring, but not with as good results. It is probable that the heavy growth of grass on the ground at the time of the first planting furnished beneficial protection from the wind and sun. Since the later results with conifers at Halsey. Nebraska, by the Forest Service are much more encouraging than their earlier results it is pos - sible that with improved methods at this Substation we shall later be able to speak more highly of conifers for this locality. Where we set conifer trees on cultivated land there has been almost complete failure, altho a few Jack Pine and Western Yellow Pine trees survived, and are growing well. Western Yellow Pine are growing faster than the Jack Pine. It is prob - able that in order to grow conifers on the tilled land the stock </seg>

They should also be protected in some manner from the sun and wind after being planted until they are well established. Two barrel-staves or pieces of boards driven into the ground to form a V-shaped protection on the south and west have been found advisable at other Stations. Nearly all of the conifers planted at this Station died before they were well esablished and the great majority before they had started to grow after being transplanted. Pig. 13.

The nurserymen should he able to give the trees better care during the winter than you can give. Of the cottonwoods and poplars, use one-year-old rooted cuttings. These are cutting grown under favorable conditions one year. Of the common broad - leaved or deciduous trees use one-year-old seedlings. Of the evergreens it is probably best to use three-year-old transplants. The foliage of these trees should be green, and the root system well developed. Care of thk Stock. — Upon receiving the trees, they should be unpacked and immediately placed in damp soil. It is well to use plenty of water and it is very important to pack the soil firmly about the roots. If convenient, it is an advantage to have the trees under a roof where they will be protected from the sun and the wind. With the evergreens care should be taken to permit the air to circulate freely thru the tops. It will not do to pack a great number of these together. Care must be taken never to allow the roots to be exposed to the sun or the I Planting. — Plant the trees only in moist soil. Choose a idy or rainy day when the surface of the soil is wet. Plant trees deeper than they were in the nursery. Pack the soil firmly about the roots; it cannot be packed too firmly. If a tree is set so loosely that it can be pulled out easily by one's hand, pull it out and reset it more firmly. Carry the trees in a bucket of muddy water, or puddle the roots in mud slime and carry the trees wrapped in a wet sack. Take the trees from the bucket or sack and place them in the soil instantly. Leave two or three inches of the top soil loose after the soil about the roots has been packed firmly. It is quite essential that the evergreens be protected from the sun and wind in order to get a fair stand. Cultivation. — For several years give the trees the same ivation that you give a cornfield when you are cultivating it you should. Young trees are not likely to grow satisfac torily when they have to compete with weeds and grass for moisture. Thoro cultivation with a loose surface mulch at all times furaishes the most favorable conditions for the growth of trees or other crops. </seg>

A farm home may be mad - beautiful with delightful surroundings as advantageously as a city home. To make a lawn beautiful costs in time and iu money, but the investment pays well in satisfaction. With the climatic conditions prevailing at the Substation it seems unwise to try to grow trees, shrubs, or flowers about the house unless some form of irrigation can be provided. No grass will make a green lawn under these conditions without a con - siderable amount of water. The lawn should be quite small unless there is an ample supply of water. Blue-grass and white clover make the best mixture for a lawn, but they will not grow well during seasons of only noruial rainfall, unless irrigated. fSonu' trees should be planted about the buildings. Tt is well i ontine the list +o native species. The only exception to this would be to plant the Honey Locust and a few Russian Olive for ornamental purposes, and evergreens for ornament and wind - breaks. For quickly growing trees, plant the Cottonwood and Box Elder. For more permanent trees, it is probable that the American Elm, Honey Locust. Hackberry. and Black Walnut in the best. From the evergreens we would choose the Black tils Spruce, the Western Yellow Pine, and the Jack Pine. There • other species of evergreens, possibly, as suitable as the three ntioned. The Red Cedar is the host of the "cedar apple." which is injurious to certain varieties of apple trees and should not be planted near an apple orchard. It is much better to plant a few good trees and to care for them well than to plant a large number and not properly tend them. The trees should have water where possible. This can generally be furnished from a windmill and well. Where this is impossible the soil about tfcm should be kept cultivated with a spade, making a circle from 4 to 8 feet in diameter. Mulching may also be advisable, as it conserves the water that is present and takes the place of cul tivation. Tt does, however, encourage surface roots which are kept down by frequent cultivation. Mulching is not practical on a well-kept lawn, as the litter will be scattered with the 1 i .•&gt;! t^ 'rrlitl </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 K There are several shrubs that give satisfactory results if wn on tilled laud or given sufficient water. Among these are the Tamarisk. Spiraea Van Houttei. several kinds of Honey suckles, Snowball, Common and Persian Lilac (the latter being specially desirable). Mock Orange, Golden Elder, Cut Leaf Sumac, Flowering Almond. Siberian Pea Tree, the native Flower ing Currant, and Thunberg Berberry. The Peony has given such a wealth of bloom that it should be especially mentioned. Figure 14 shows a bed of Peonies in t foreground as they appeared in 1912. These were mulched the winter and watered in summer. I A few of the flowers which give the most satisfactory results the labor expended are the Pansy. Tulip. Peony. Dahlia, ox. and Gladiolus. Fig. 14. Peonies at the North Platte Substation KThe Pansy does well when planted along the north side of house. It will usually live thru the winter if mulched with ves or straw. The Tulip will live in the ground for several years with jrood n suits if watered and mulched during the winter. Mau.\ dig the Tulip bulbs after the stalks have died down and kee|« them in the cellar until fall and then plant them again or throw them away and purchase new bulbs.

            <seg id="p026">26 Peonies can be kept in the ground for several years and made to bloom profusely if watered during summer and mulched during the winter. Dahlias are easily grown. The bulbs must be dug up before freezing weather and handled like potatoes. Phlox remains in ground during the winter. The Gladiolus bulbs should be dug in the fall and kept in a dry place during the winter. There are many annual flowers that do well when properly cared for, but none are likely to give as much pleasure to the grower as the plants mentioned above. The Farm Garden. — To make the farm home complete there must be a garden. The garden will likely be a source of dis - appointment unless it is near the house, is small, well fenced, protected from the wind, and subject to irrigation from the windmill or elsewhere. Given these conditions, the farmer's wife will have a garden that will repay its cost many times. And with the lawn, the trees, the shrubs, the flowers, the psrden and a comfortable house, the farm home becomes much more artrac tive than the citv home of the same cost. FRUIT TREES AND SMALL FRUITS Fruit trees are being grown on both the bench and the table - land without irrigation. Several varieties of apple, cherry, and plum trees have been planted. A few of the apple trees planted in 1907 bore some fruit in 1912. Plums planted in 1907 bore fruit profusely in 1912. plums planted in 1909 on table-land bore a fair growth on both sites, but we have not sufficient evidence to permit us to make conclusive statements. It seem* that the growing of apple trees without irrigation will prove quite dis - couraging, as the trees do not grow thriftily or vigorously and an injury of any &lt;»ort is likely to prove fatal. On the other hand, we believe that the growing of cherries and plums will probably give satisfactory results. We have not dono much with small fruits, but currants and gooseberries are worthy of careful trials. Under expert man - agement blackberries, raspberries, and grapes may he grown, raspberries being the most promising. Windbreaks are quite essential for growing fruit of this sort. Strawberries- do well when irrigated, and rhubarb and asparagus grow with almost no care. </seg>
