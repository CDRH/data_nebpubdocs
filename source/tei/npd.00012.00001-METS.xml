GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE 

To the Members of the Twenty-ninth Session of the Legislature 

of Nebraska : 

Gentlemen — It is a constitutional requirement that at th 
beginning of your deliberations the chief executive shall conve 
to you "information by message of the condition of the state, anc 
shall recommend such measures as he shall deem expedient." 
am a believer in the idea that the state suffers from too muc 
rather than too little legislation ; that it is better to make mor 
practical and to enforce the wholesome laws which we now have 
than it is to enact a mass of experimental legislation, much o 
which is sure to prove of questionable value and of doubtful con 
stitutionality. I have, therefore, but few recommendations t 
make, nor shall I occupy any considerable portion of your time 
in a discussion of state conditions. In general I may say that 
the state was never more prosperous than it is today, the several 
rjtive departments were never in better working condition 
the institutions are at the zenith of careful and economical 
management. 

' 'wing to the chance of politics your membership is chosen 
almost entirely from one great party. With this unprecedented 
majority comes a corresponding responsibility. The dominant 
party cannot escape the burden thus laid upon it and it should be 
sobered by the thought. It is a time for earnest, zealous work : 
it is a time when state patriotism should rise superior to personal 
prejudice and petty whims ; it is a time when the privileges of the 
few should not be allowed to take precedence over the welfare 
of the many ; it is a time for laying broader and making more 
secure the equitable foundations upon which this state shall con- </seg>


            <seg id="p007">

tinue to rise toward a condition of future greatness which we now 
but faintly appreciate. If you would merit the highest encomium 
of praise let your deliberations be distinguished by honesty of 
purpose, careful research and strict economy. Thus will you 
protect the public treasury and guard against hasty and imperfect 
tctments. Your motto should be, not how much legislation, 
how good. 

Within the proper scope of this message it is impossible to 
make fitting reference to all of the various executive departments. 
The biennial reports of all departments and state institutions are 
at your disposal and I recommend the careful study of these reports 
for such suggestions and information as you may need in 
your legislative work. 

THE REVENUE LAW. 

The revenue law passed by the preceding legislature has met 
the expectations of its friends and has been received with popular 
favor. This inference is fully warranted by the results of 
the recent campaign. The law being an innovation in some of its 
features and having a direct bearing on the interests of even 
citizen was naturally brought under the searchlight of public 
opinion and was made the target of extreme criticism. The agitation 
was helpful in that it gave the people generally a better 
understanding of revenue problems than they had previously 
enjoyed and enabled a more intelligent vote upon the issues involved. 
The result was such an endorsement of the work of 
the legislature which framed and passed the bill as has seldom 
been recorded in the history of Nebraska. Not a single member 
who voted for the bill and who stood for re-election this vear 
was defeated. The conclusion is that the time was ripe for revenue 
revision. The people understood the inequitable provisions 
of the old system under which the growing state could not adapt 
its revenues to its increasing obligations ; they appreciated the 
logic employed by former executive officers in challenging public </seg>


            <seg id="p008">
attention, by message and biennial report, to the urgent need of 
revision ; they were cognizant of the non-partisan spirit which 
entered into the framing of the new law and realized that the 
measure was the product of the best thought, regardless of party 
which the legislature could command, supplemented by the valuable 
experience of older states along similar lines. They knew, 
too, that the two foundation principles were the essence of justice, 
namely, the listing of all property for assessment purposes at 
its fair cash value, and the levying of an equitable and uniform 
tax upon all property so listed, without bias or favoi . 

IOne assessment and one set of levies have been made unde 
e new law and we are now in a position to judge of results 
It is apparent that a large amount of property which hithert' 
has been covered and has escaped taxation entirely has beet 
placed upon the assessment rolls and is made to stand its jus 
share of the expense of government. Other property which i 
the past has been valued at ridiculously low figures, has been 
listed at approximately its true worth. Tax shirkers have been 
brought to time, both private and corporation property hav 
received their just deserts, the grand assessment roll has bee 
increased to a reasonable sum, the state has been enabled to raise 
sufficient revenue to meet the expenses of government economically 
administered, and in the transition'from the old to the new 
no interest has been injured beyond the few isolated cases which 
have been the victims of mistakes, or concerning which the 
judgment of the assessor or of the levying body may have been 

In some communities the taxes for this year are considerably 
increased over the taxes of last year, but an investigation of the 
facts discloses that the fault is not with the law, but rather with 
the local levying bodies which, in making their levies, did not 
take into proper consideration the increased valuation upon which 
they were-acting. In all such instances it will be found that the 
state tax is but sliehtlv increased and that the additional sum </seg>


            <seg id="p009">
6 

raised is for county, town or school purposes and hence is 
retained in and expended for the benefit of the particular community 
which produced it. This condition will not prevail another 
year for the reason that the levying boards will have become 
familiar with the fact that they are dealing with larger assessment 
rolls, and their own judgment, together with the pressure of 
public opinion, will dictate such minimum levies as will meet the 

While the essential principles of the law are, in my judgment, 
eminently just and correct, there are some matters of detail which 
might be improved, and to these I invite your attention. 

Under the interpretation placed upon the law by the state board 
of equalization and assessment it has no power to differentiate 
between classes of property in equalizing county assessments. It 
can raise or lower the entire assessment roll of the county, but 
cannot raise or lower one class of property without reference to 
the other classes. For this reason it is impossible to secure a just 
equalization, for in raising or lowering one deficient class to the 
proper standard, other classes with which there is no fault are, 
by the unit system, raised or lowered in unison, and, hence, while 
justice may be secured in the one instance it is violated in the 
other. I, therefore, recommend that section 130, article 1, chapter 
J7 of the Compiled Statutes of 1903 be amended so as to 
permit the state board of equalization to differentiate between 
classes of property in equalizing county assessments. 

Another inherent weakness in the present law is the fact that 
county boards of equalization are compelled to make their levies 
in advance of the equalization of the county assessments by the 
state board. It follows, therefore, that the county board is confronted 
with the probability of making its levies upon an assessment 
roll quite different from that which is finally certified to it 
by the state board, and of providing taxes in excess of or insufficient 
to the actual needs of the county, depending upon the 
action of the state board in raising or lowering the assessment </seg>


            <seg id="p010">
fsaid county at a time some weeks subsequent to the making 
the county levies. There seems to be no legal redress for this 
inconsistency. I recommend that section 136, article 1, chapter 
77, Compiled Statutes of 1903, be amended so that county boards 
shall make their levies after the certificate of county equalization 
shall have been received from the state board. Also, that m 
130 of the same article and chapter be amended so as to pr 
for the transmission, by the state board, of the certificate of county 
equalization to the county clerk at the earliest date con~ 
with the general tenor of the section, and that the said county 
clerk be instructed to call the county board together within 
seven days after the receipt of said certificate for the purpose of 
making the necessary levies for the ensuing year. For the same 
reasons the law fixing the time for making school district and 
municipal levies should be amended in harmony with the above 
suggestion. 

STATE BOUNDARY COMMISSION. 

By act of the last legislature the chief executive of this state 
was authorized to appoint a commission of three members to 
act with a like commission appointed by the governor of South 
Dakota in the matter of agreeing upon a boundary line between 
the two states. On the 10th day of July, 1903, I appointed as 
the representatives of Nebraska in the discharge of the duty 
above referred to, Mr. Chas. J. Swanson of Oakland, Dr. F. O. 
Robinson of Hartington, and Mr. E. A. Lundburg of Wayne. 
These gentlemen met with the representatives of South Dakota 
in due time, and after repeated conference and personal inspection 
of that portion of the boundary in dispute, namely, the portion 
affected by the uncertain meanderings of the Missouri river, a 
report embodying the unanimous agreement of the joint commission 
was filed with me March 4, 1904. This report was accompanied 
with a surveyor's plat of the district in controversy, 
together with field notes, and the entire matter I now transmit 
to you for approval or rejection. If the findings of the commis- </seg>


            <seg id="p011">
8 

sion meet with your favor, and likewise with the favor of the 
legislature of South Dakota, it will be necessary to memorialize 
congress upon the subject and secure from that body an approval 
of the findings before the proposed boundary can be definitely established. 
The appropriation of $1,000, to pay for the services 
and expenses of the commission, was entirely drawn. 

The preceding legislature also made provision for a similar 
commission to act in conjunction with a commission representing 
the state of Iowa in the matter of agreeing upon a boundary 
line between Nebraska and Iowa. However, as our enactment 
was contingent upon the action of the Iowa legislature in providing 
for a boundary commission and as the Iowa legislature 
neglected to take such action, nothing has been done. The area 
involved is adjacent to certain stretches of the Missouri river, 
where the shifting channel has occasioned confusion in jurisdiction. 
Owing to the technicalities involved, lawlessness and crime 
have been fostered in the disputed territory and the rights of 
property owners have been subject to much annoyance. This 
state of affairs will continue until relief has been afforded by the 
settlement of the boundary dispute. I recommend, therefore, that 
your honorable body make provision for another boundary commission, 
the statute of limitation having run against the old 
act, to co-operate with a like commission from the state of Iowa 
in agreeing upon a boundary line, the governor of Iowa to be 
notified of the action taken by the Nebraska legislature. 

The litigation regarding the boundary line between Nebraska 
and Missouri, which had been pending in the supreme court of 
the United States for some time, was permanently settled recently 
by a decision of the court fully sustaining the contention 
of Nebraska. The court fixes the boundary line in the center of 
the old channel of the Missouri river, confirming to Nebraska 
what is known as "Island Precinct," Nemaha county, which disputed 
area, was the source of the controversy. It only remains </seg>


            <seg id="p012">

dentlv will not be difficult, as a tentative agreement has already 
been reached by the two states. I recommend that an appropriation 
of $1,000, or so much thereof as may be needed, be made 
for the surveying of the line and the erection of permanent monuments, 
the state of Missouri to meet its equal share of said expense. 


THE BATTLESHIP NEBRASKA. 

On October 7, 1904, the battleship "Nebraska" was successfully 
launched at the yards of the builders, the Moran Brothers' 
company, Seattle, Wash. The impressive ceremonial was participated 
in by a number of the executive officers of this state 
The "Nebraska" is one of the latest and most efficient types of 
battleships and our state is highly honored by the national gov 
ernment in being permitted to stand sponsor for her. The remaining 
work of construction and equipment will occupy about one 
year and she will then be ready for commission. At that time 
it will be highly proper for our state, through its legislature or 
unofficially through its citizens, to present to the officers of the 
"Nebraska," for the use of the ship, some practical gift as a token 
of our interest in the fighting craft which bears our state name 
and as a further indication that we are not insensible to the distinction 
which has been conferred upon us by the general government. 
It has been suggested that a silver service or a library would 
constitute a most suitable gift, though possibly something else 
would be better. I now bring the matter to you and recommend 
that you either make an appropriation for the purpose mentioned, 
or that you give your endorsement to some suitable plan for 
raising the necessary funds by popular subscription. 

UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS. 

During the past biennium, at the suggestion of this department, 
a uniform system of bookkeeping has been established in all the 
state institutions, the result of which is most satisfactory. During 
prior years there were as many different systems in vogue </seg>


            <seg id="p013">
10 

there were institutions. Some important data were not syslatically 
recorded, comparisons were difficult to make, and it 
was impossible to determine the condition of the several funds 
against which vouchers were drawn without consulting the books 
of the auditor. Under the new system these things are made 
apparent and general uniformity is secured. In addition to the 
convenience in keeping, checking and auditing institutional accounts, 
the new method promotes economy and more careful management 
in that it makes apparent at a glance the exact condition 
of the several funds. 

SUPREME COURT COMMISSION. 

The legislature of 1903 made provision for the temporary continuance 
of the supreme court commission, six commissioners 
to be appointed for the period of one year and three commissioners 
to be appointed for the period of two years, from April 
10. i&lt;x&gt;3- The court, with the assistance of the three commissioners 
now in service, is unable to keep up with the work 
which comes before it, the number of cases filed each month 
being in excess of the number disposed of. With a gradually 
increasing docket it seems imperative that a commission of at 
least three members should be provided for the coming biennium. 
to the end that the rights of litigants who are seeking relief 
before the state's highest tribunal may be conserved without unnable 
delav. 

THE STATE'S FINANCES. 

On November 30, 1904, the floating interest bearing indebtedness 
of the state, as represented by outstanding general fund 
warrants, amounted to $2,253,386.40, an increase during the 
biennium of $264,057.77. This condition was made possible and 
practically unavoidable by the operation of the old revenue law, 
which as a revenue producer commensurate with the needs of the 
state was a failure. Each succeeding legislature had- found it 
necessary to make appropriations in excess of the revenue which </seg>


            <seg id="p014">
11 

could possibly be derived from the assessment roll, and the result 
was a gradual piling up of the floating indebtedness. As a 
Cedial and corrective measure the last legislature passed the 
revenue law, which is now in effect. 

rile the new law was passed in 1903 it did not become operuntil 
1904, and, hence, up to the present time, it has had 
no appreciable effect upon the state's financial condition. The 
first levy under it was made last July and the taxes so produced 
are now being collected, personal taxes becoming delinquent 
December 1, 1904. Realty taxes will not become delinquent until 
May 1, 1905. With reference to the sufficiency of the state's 
income during the coming biennium, I quote the following excerpt 
from the current biennial report of State Auditor W'estnn : 

"To the estimated income from the levies of 1905-6 have been 
added a conservative estimate of income from back taxes and a 
very considerable amount derived from miscellaneous sources, 
making the total estimate of income for the general fund 2,819,--'44.71. 
As against this estimated general fund income the estimated 
requirements for the biennial period commencing 
¦5. and chargeable to the general fund amount to $-',541 

From the above it is apparent that if the present legislature 
hold* its appropriations within reasonable bounds the reccn 
•ming biennium will exceed the expenditures by $27^ 
a condition which has not existed in Nebraska for many years 
It is this flattering prospect which warrants Auditor Wat 
saying that the amount of floating indebtedness ($2,253,386.40) 
"outstanding November 30, 1904, should practically mark the 
extreme limit of high tide in the floating debt of the state." 

With such a state debt as now confronts us it requires no argument 
to make clear that the strictest economy consistent with the 
public weal should distinguish all your relations with the public 
treasury. While it is probable that we have reached the maximum 
figure of floating indebtedness, it rests with you to make 
sure that we have reached that figure and that the coming bien- </seg>

            <seg id="p015">
12 


nium will witness marked progress along the line of ultimate 
liquidation. The opportunity is most auspicious. The state institutions 
were never in better condition. The per capita cost of 
maintenance has been reduced to the lowest level known in recent 
jretn, if not in the history of the state, without in any degree 
impairing the efficiency of the service or detracting from the 
comfort of the inmates. The two preceding legislatures made 
appropriations for permanent improvements amounting to a little 
more than $600,000, of which amount $411,000 is chargeable to 
the last legislature. The result is that needed buildings and 
equipments have been generously provided, meeting the requirements 
of the state for years to come, and the present legislative 
will be expected to do but little in the way of expenditures 
along similar lines. The time is opportune for making a splendid 
economical record and I trust that every legislator will feel a 
Krsonal responsibility resting upon him in the furtherance of 
s idea. 

THE LOBBY. 

The bane of every legislative body is the subsidized lobby. 
Vicious legislation is not the result of ignorance, but is rather 
the result of prejudicial influences which ought not to exist and 
which certainly ought not to be tolerated within the halls, cloak 
- or offices of any deliberative body which has power over 
the destinies of a people. Nebraska is not different from other 
states in that it has suffered in years past from the attacks of a 
conscienceless horde of paid retainers whose sole mission was to 
debauch the membership of the legislature in the interests of 
questionable enactments, directed against the public treasury or 
conferring special privileges upon certain beneficiaries. Suck 
influences ought to be banished from legislative environment. I 
recommend that such action be taken as will protect your membership 
from the onslaught of private and corporation lobbyists 
who seek to accomplish pernicious ends by the exercise of undue 
influence, being careful to draw the line of demarcation between </seg>


            <seg id="p016">
13 

the corruptionist on the one side and the honest and untrammeled 
advisor and counselor on the other. 

LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION. 

During the past year the greatest exposition the world has 
ever seen, commemorating the Louisiana Purchase, has been held 
in the city of St. Louis. The legislature of two years ago appropriated 
$35,000 for a Nebraska exhibit and laid upon the chief 
executive the duty of appointing a non-partisan commission of 
three members upon which should devolve all responsibility pertaining 
thereto. In April, 1903, I appointed as such commissioners, 
C. H. Morrill, G. W. Wattles and Matthew Miller. Because 
of pressing business engagements Mr. Morrill resigned in 
September of that year and I appointed Pet:r Jansen to fill the 
Key thus created. The commission solicited additional hndf 
the citizens and corporations of the state, believing the aplation 
insufficient, and as a result secured donations to the 
it of $25,000, as follows : 

Union Pacific R. R. Co $9,000 

Burlington &amp; M. R. R. R. Co 9,000 

Chicago &amp; Northwestern R. R. Co 7,000 


An exhibit was installed in due course of time which, so far as 
I have been able to observe, met the full expectations of every 
Nebraskan who visited the exposition and which received much 
favorable comment from all quarters. No similar appropriation 
was ever better expended and our people have reason to take 
great pride in the showing made. Our individual exhibitors 
were exceptionally successful in the matter of winning honors, 
and in this particular Nebraska again demonstrated her superiority. 
The exposition has but recently closed and the commission 
has found it impossible to make its final report prior to the 
meeting of the legislature. I am informed, however, that after </seg>


            <seg id="p017">
14 

paying all obligations there will remain unexpended about $16,000 
of the original appropriation. This is certainly a most gratifying 
condition, one which speaks eloquently of the wisdom and discretion 
which the commission exercised in the discharge of its 
duties. The complete report will be filed during the month. 

LKWIS AND CLARK CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 

The people of the Pacific coast in particular, and those of other 
f the country in general, are now preparing for the 
1 and Clark Exposition, an event which will commemorate 
the trials and triumphs of the exploring expedition sent out by 
President Jefferson during the year following the purchase of 
Louisiana and which succeeded in penetrating to the mouth of 
the Columbia river in 1805. The exposition will be held at Portland, 
Oregon, June 1 to October 15 of this year. The Pacific 
has been remote from the great expositions held in this 
Entry and because of distance its citizenship has been denied the 
rileges attendant upon such exploitations to a great degree. 
seems fitting that the great northwest should now have its 
•orttinity. There are many ties which bind Nebraska to that 
section of our common country, a present matter of deep interest 
being the construction of the battleship "Nebraska" on the shores 
of Puget Sound. I recommend that a reasonable appropriation 
be made for the participation of our state in this exposition. Much 
of the material used at St. Louis could be again utilized at Portland 
and an excellent showing could be made at a nominal ex- 

JAMESTOWN EXPOSITION. 

At the request of Governor A. J. Montague of the state of 
Virginia I lav before you a copy of a joint resolution passed by 
the general assembly of Virginia, February 17, 1904, looking to 
the commemoration of the first permanent Anglo-American settlement 
made on this continent, May 13, 1607. It is proposed to 
hold a Tercentennial and Naval-Marine exhibition on the borders </seg>


            <seg id="p018">
15 

of Hampton Roads, Virginia, in the year 1907, and the joint resolution 
of the general assembly of Virginia is for the purpose of 
enlisting the interest and support of other states in the enterprise. 
I call the subject to your attention as an act of courtesy to the 
chief executive of a sister state. 

FOOD COMMISSION. 

rhe work of the food commission is necessarily curtailed bv 

Riti of the fact that the law restricts inspection to dairy prodcider 
and vinegar. As a consequence the great mass of food 
nets, many of which are known to contain injurious adulterants, 
escape the jurisdiction of the commission and are amenable 
only to the general statutes. The subject is an important 
one. While it is true that national legislation affords th( 
adequate remedy it is also true that each state must conserve the 
interests of its own citizenship pending the time when cor 

will adopt a general pure food law. At present the commission 
is sustained by a system of fees collected from jobbers and retailers 
of dairy, vinegar and cider products. The deputy commissioner 
holds this to be an inequitable arrangement and in his 
biennial report he recommends that the fee system be abolished 
and that the commission be supported by a direct appropr 
It seems desirable, too. that the present law be broadened in itscope 
and made to include all food products, and that pn 
be made for such additional assistance as the enlarged duties 
mav make necessary. 

OIL INSPECTION. 

The preceding legislature raised the inflammability test of illti 
minating oils from 100 degrees to 112 degrees, Fahrenheit, thus 
affording additional security to life and property. Since the law 
was made operative it has been rigidly enforced, not a single 
case having been reported where oil below the test has been 
placed on the market. During the biennium the inspections have 
amounted to 389,544 barrels, and the corresponding receipts to </seg>


            <seg id="p019">
16 

$38,954-4°- Of this amount $22,007.57 P 3^ the salary and expense 
accounts of the chief oil inspector and his assistants, 16,-520.18 
was deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the 
general fund, and $426.65 remains in the hands of the chief inspector. 
These figures are taken from the biennial report under 
date of December 1, 1904. It is noticeable that the inspection

IRRIGATION. 

The report of the secretary of the state board of irrigation 
shows that considerable progress has been made in irrigation 
matters during the past two years. While the number of new 
projects has not been great, much has been accomplished in the 
¦ if improvement of existing canals and additional area has 
been brought under cultivation. The United States reclamation 
service has undertaken a large project which has 1 
object the storage of all the flood waters of the North Platte river 
and the reclamation of thousands of acres of land in Nebraska 
and Wyoming. It is hoped this plan will work to a MOD 
conclusion, thereby adding a large productive area to our domain. 
The report of the under secretary shows that the Nebraska 
irrigation law has proven very satisfactory in a general way and 
only a few minor amendments seem necessary. For the details 
of the proposed changes you are respectfully referred to the 
secretary's report. The law has been upheld by the supreme 
court and in a recent opinion the following statement is made : 
"Publicity of right and stability of title are matters which the 
legislature fully intended to establish as far as lay within it* 
power, and the provisions of the law under consideration seem admirably 
fitted to accomplish this purpose." 

THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. 

The military department has assumed a position of much 
greater importance since the enactment of the present militia law </seg>

congress, approved January 21, 1903. The purpose of the law 

recognize and make effective the volunteer force organized 

under the title of the national guard, ai the reserve army of ihc 
i. Certain benefits, fully set forth in the adjutant genera!'* 
report, are accorded to the state, conditioned upon the stand. 

guard as required by the war department. 

Ei order that the state may receive its full quota of assistance 
that its privileges under the federal law may materialize, a 
cient appropriation should be made to carry into effect the 

t the enactment, insure safety of public ston 

lhle quarters. for company organizations, and extend encour- 

Kt to the young men who voluntarily assume the duties of 
r, duties that may at any time become arduous and dangerhe 
enforcement of law and protection of life and property. 

The administration of the affairs of this department for the 
past two years has been very satisfactory. Economy has been 

ed, a broader field of instruction has been covered and 
hie results have been attained. The responsibility and lat&gt; 

the adjutant general have been largely increased and he si 
receive compensation commensurate with his duties. 

For reasons arising prior to the present administration I deemed 
it expedient to make investigation of the financial accounts 
adjutant general's office, and employed an expert accountant for 
that purpose. The reports of the accountant, giving complete 
details of the investigation, are in my office and are subject to 
vour inspection. It will be necessary for you to make an appropriation 
to meet the expense involved. 

EDUCATION. 

Estate views with ever increasing pride the progress of its 
educational centers, the university and the Peru normal 
looking forward to the time when the Kearney normal will 
take its place with the others and will become an important factor 
in our public school system. The people are willing to make </seg>

any reasonable sacrifice for the cause of higher education ami 
for the proper training of teachers, asking only that appropriations 
and expenditures be made with due regard to the needs 
of these institutions. 

RELIEF OF FAMINE SUFFERERS. 

Phe preceding legislature, under the terms of H. R. No. 417, 
ropriated $2,000 for "the relief and benefit of the people suffering 
from famine in northern Sweden, Norway and Finland.' The 
disposition of this relief was left to the chief executive. 
April 21, 1903, I drew the entire appropriation from the treasury 
and remitted $1,500 to Hon. A. Grip, minister of Sweden and 
my, Washington, D. C, for the relief of the famine summers 
in the countries which he represented, and $500 to Count 
:ii, Ambassador of Russia, Washington, D. C, for the benefit 
of the sufferers in Finland. On April 27, 1903, I receh 
acknowledgment from Hon. A. Grip in which he testified his 
appreciation and expressed the gratitude of his countrymen for 
the generous action of the Nebraska legislature. Under date of 
May 12, 1903, I received from Count Cassini the following explanatory 
note, the formal address being omitted : 

1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 
of April 2 1st, in which your excellency have transmitted to me a 
cheque for $500 appropriated by the Nebraska legislature for the 
relief of the famine sufferers of Finland. In reply I beg to inform 
you that as the relief fund organized by the Russian government 
for the needs of the poor in Finland who have suffered from the 
unsatisfactory condition of the crops last year is amply sufficient 
the imperial government does not feel possible to accept this generous 
donation of the people of Nebraska, as it could be em- 
Kin some other quarter where help is more needed. I avail 
of this opportunity to express to your excellency and ask 
transmit to the Nebraska legislature the feelings of my progratitude 
for this act of the people of Nebraska which 
der to be a new proof of the traditional friendly relation*

existing between our two countries. The cheque is herewith returned. 
Accept the assurances of my highest consideration. 

(Signed) Count Cassini. 

Ambassador of Russia 

The $500 so returned was redeposited in the public tn 
May 16, 1903. 

INSURANCE ON PUBLIC BUILDING. 1 

It is provided in section 6, article I, chapter 83, Compiled 
utes of 1903, "That the governor be and is hereby authorize'! 
and empowered to insure the public buildings and other property 
belonging to the state, liable to destruction or injury by fire, with 
some good and responsible insurance company or companies, for 
the benefit of and in the name of the state." The state has been carrying 
its own insurance since 1889, the last appropriation for the 
payment of premiums ($24,000) having been made in 1887. 

is estimated that the cost of carrying reasonable insuraiu 
present state property will amount to $30,000 per biennium 
The chief executive cannot carry out the provisions of the section 
quoted unless an appropriation is made for the payment of premiums. 
In the absence of such appropriation I shall assume that 
the state desires to continue the policy of carrying its own fire 
risks. 

BARTLEY BOND CASE. 

Your attention is called to the suit of the state against the 
bondsmen of former state treasurer J. S. Bartley. This is an 
action originally brought in the district court of Douglas 1 
soon after Bartley went out of office. It was dismissed by Attorney 
General Smythe, October 20, 1897. The next day Mr. Smythe 
again began suit to recover from Bart'ey and the bondsmen 
$550,000, the amount of his shortage as treasurer. After more 
than seven years of litigation the state is without any judgment 
against the bondsmen. The case was tried three times in the 
district court of Douglas county, and on appeal to the supreme </seg>


            <seg id="p023">
20 

court the judgment rendered in each trial was reversed. The 
fourth and last trial in the district court resulted in a judgment 
against the state for costs and dismissing the case. From this 
judgment against the state the attorney general prosecuted error 
to the supreme court where it is now pending. If the case is 
again reversed by the supreme court it will stand tor its fifth 
trial in the Douglas county district court, to be again appealed 
no doubt, by whichever party happens to lose in the lower court. 
From this it is clear that there is no immediate prospect for the 
state recovering a final judgment against these bondsmen. In 
the meantime the costs are increasing. I am informed that not a 
single bondsman has a dollar's worth of property in his own name 
out of which the state could enforce the collection of any part ot 
the judgment should one ever be rendered. Some of them have 
already gone through the bankruptcy court since the suit was 
instituted: 

I get this information from the court records and from the last 
official report to me of Attorney General F. N. Prout, in whicli 
he recommends the dismissal of this case on the payment of the 
which have been made, by the bondsmen, and on the best 
terms possible. 

Pi view of these facts, I request your careful consideration of 
recommendation . 

GUARANTY BONDS. 

Ender a recent decision of the supreme court it is held that 
statute is invalid which authorizes the execution and approval 
fficial bonds with guaranty companies as sureties. The defect 
¦clinical and can be remedied. There is no question but that 
ranty bonds furnish adequate protection and relieve officelers 
and their friends from the unpleasant features attendant 
upon the securing of a personal bond. A past legislature has 
endorsed the system and it is a technical error only which has 
defeated the statute In view of the importance of the subiect </seg>

            <seg id="p024">
governor's message. 

21 

P:ommend that at the earliest date consistent with the amount 
ork involved you pass a law which will legalize the execution 
approval of either personal or guaranty bonds. 

STATE ACCOUNTANT. 

The experience gained in the past two years serves to confirm 
my judgment as expressed in my previous inaugural address, 
recommending the creation of the position of state accountant. 
It should be the duty of such officer to "scrutinize and verifv the 
accounts nf the various state officers and state institutions." and 
he should "have authority over the books and records of said institutions" 
with a view to securing uniformity. Such accountant 
should also be delegated to examine into the various account? 
of delinquent taxes due the state from the several count', 
the end that this mass of delinquent assets may be realized on a? 
much as possible, and the portion that is worthless may be stricken 
off the books in accordance with the provisions of section T65. 
Ki, chapter JJ, Compiled Statutes of 1903. I believe that 
official would prove of great value to the state, and. hence, 
t the recommendation.

The preceding statements, Nos. 4, 5 and 5a are taken from 
the biennial report of the state auditor. Tables 4 and 5 show 
tht; estimated receipts and expenditures for the coming biennium, 
and Xo. 5a shows the appropriations made for the various 
departments by the past four legislatures, in comparison with 
the estimated expenses for the next two years. The first 
table shows a mass of statistical information relative to the twelve 
state institutions under the control of the governor and the board 
of public lands and buildings. 

Eill be noticed that the last reports show seventy-two inin 
the Home for the Friendless, Lincoln, and twenty-seven 
Industrial Home, Milford. It is necessarily true that where 
but a small number of inmates are cared for, the per capita cost 
of maintenance runs high, since salaries, heat, light and general 
running expenses go on much the same whether there be few or 
many. As there is a similarity in the work accomplished by these 
two institutions it seems to me that their duties might be combined, 
and all of the inmates of both be cared for at whichever 
one of the plants is best suited to the dual load. My judgment 
is that such an arrangement could be consumated without detriment 
to the service and would result in a saving of a number 
of thousands of dollars to the state. 

The Institute for the Blind at Nebraska City is one of the 
institutions where the per capita cost of maintenance is comparatively 
high. This is accounted for by the small attendance, the 
fact that more teachers are required for blind pupils than for 
the same number of seeing pupils, and the further fact that the 
school has three departments, namely, common and high school 
Erk running through the twelfth grade, music and industrial 
ining. I have every reason to believe that the school has been 
economically and discretely managed. The attendance is not 
nearly so large as it should be. 

I recommend that the purchasing of all supplies for both the 
Institute for the Blind and the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb </seg>

            <seg id="p031">
28 


be placed in the hands of the board of purchase and supplies, this 
being the board which does the buying for all the other 
institutions. It is a noticeable fact that the two institutions named 
pay more for the same classes of goods than do the other institutions, 
the reason being* that the board, doing a much larger volume 
of business, can buy cheaper than can the trustees having the care 
of the two institutions under discussion. 

The Institute for the Feeble Minded is in a very crowded condition. 
About thirty applications are now on file from those seeking 
admission, and who are properly entitled to the care of the 
state, but who are denied entrance on account of the lack of room. 
This matter has received my careful attention and I recommend 
an appropriation of $20,000 for the purpose of erecting a cottage 
k girls, as an adjunct of this institution. By so doing the quesof 
additional room will be solved for many years to come. 

The Norfolk asylum, for the rebuilding of which an appropriation 
was made by the last legislature, is nearing completion, but 
probably will not be ready for the reception of inmates until about 
the first of May. The west wing of the old building can, at comparatively 
slight expense, be made as serviceable as any other 
Pof the equipment and 1 recommend that an appropriation 
[5,000 be made for the restoration of this wing. The recepof 
inmates at Norfolk will relieve the congested condition 
existing at the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane and will 
greatly to the efficiency of the service to this class of unfortunates. 
When the last legislature made provision for the rebuilding 
of the Norfolk asylum it was believed that the institution 
would be completed and would be in condition to care for 
patients during at least ten months of the present biennium. 
Appropriations amounting to $54,850 were accordingly made for 
officers salaries, employes' wages and general expense of maintenance. 
As the building has been delayed, no part of these appropriations 
has been used. The burden of caring for the inmates </seg>

governor's message

months of the biennium, has fallen upon the Nebraska Hospital 
for the Insane, with the result that a number of its funds show 
deficiencies. I recommend that $18,000 of the maintenance lunci 
appropriated for the Norfolk asylum be transferred to the account 
of the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane for the purpose of meeting 
its deficiencies so incurred, similar to the action taken by 
the Twenty-eighth legislature and for the same leason. This i* 
a matter which should receive vour earlv attention. 

These are the more important topics to which I wish to direct 
vour attention. As the session progresses new questions ma&gt; 
arise concerning which I may wish to address you by special 
message. Permit me to express the hope that your duties will 
prove pleasant and that the result of your labor will promote the 
welfare of our beloved state.

and jury, Omaha. 

Mike Mrkvicka, one year for concealing stolen property. A 
commutation from one year to nine months and three days was 
asked and strongly endorsed by Hon. J. N. Paul, ten of the jurvmen, 
and by a large number of citizens, giving reasons to create 
a doubt as to the justice of the sentence. In view of the facts 
presented it was decided that the ends of justice could best be 
served by commuting the short time remaining of the sentence. 
Granted July 22, 1903.

chance for his life. Granted May 7, 1904. 

Es Dunn, thirty years for murder, second degree. Com-0 
ten years, seven months and two days, July 4, 1904. On 
from many good citizens, in consideration of an excessive 
;. and after having personally convinced himself that 
Dunn has made a model prisoner and now sincerely wishes to 
become a good and law-abiding citizen, the governor decided that 
the case was one fit for executive clemency and that justice would 
be subserved by commuting sentence as above stated.

a technical provision of the law the sentence would have been 
but one year, and under the circumstances he was compelled to 
give an excessive sentence, but recommended executive clemency.

same view is now on file in the executive department. Sent' 

1904. 

Lem T. Goldsberry, three years for receiving stolen property.
