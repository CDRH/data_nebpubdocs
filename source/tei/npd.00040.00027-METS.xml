            <seg id="p003">THE FARM INVENTORY H. F. WILLIAMS Only a few suggestions are necessary to make clear the use of the following pages for recording an inventory of the farm business. The most satisfactory date for taking an inventory is March 1. At this time the amount of live stock and the amount of feed supplies are low. It also has the advantage of being the date from which farms usually rent, and changes in ownership occur. The inventory should be made out on the same date each year. In itemizing the Real Estate, care should be taken that the value placed on the land does not include the value of the build - ings. In case one does not wish to itemize the Real Estate, the "total value" may be inserted without doing so. In listing the items, enough detail should be shown to permit of a comparison of their value in the inventories for the different years. For instance, it will be found more satisfactory to list the horses by name or by team, giving the name of both horses on the same line. Under Bills Receivable, list the money due from others. In case supplies, such as a ton of hay, have been borrowed by a neighbor the value of such supplies should be entered as Bills Receivable, regardless of how the neighbor expects to make payment. Under Bills Payable make a list of the money owed to others. This includes: notes, interest on notes, store accounts, and personal debts. Under Miscellaneous may be entered the items not already provided for. The value of growing crops may be entered here. The automobile may be entered either here or under machinery. While household goods are not considered a part of the farm equipment they may be entered here or, better yet, in a separate book where the household accounts are kept. In making out the Summary on page 10 transfer the totals from the preceding pages. Then add the assets, and from this sum subtract the Bills Payable. A gain in the net worth over that of the preceding inventory represents the extent that the farmer has increased his financial standing the current year. It does not represent the profits of the farm since family and other expenses have been met out of the farm income. </seg>
