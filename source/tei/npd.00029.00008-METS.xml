            <seg id="p007">7 PIOCKEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTT7WL Secretary Mellor: : No; Mr. Arnold sent a letter, but he la here. President Hendershot: That Is good; I am glad he Is here. I sup - pose the next thing Is the "President's Message." as we term it. You know, these big people write messages, and why not I? Instead of call- Ing it a "report." It will be a "message," for the simple reason that It isn't a report. We will call it by Its right name. President Hendershot read his message, as follows: PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE To the OHlcrrt and Member* of the Veorattca State Board of Airriculture : Gw*n.rMKn: I feel justified In saying that there is no better agency for developing the agricultural, live stock, social and educational In - terests of our state than the annual State Fair, which gathers together the highest achievements of our people. No other state can boast of such rapid advancement in Improved live stock and advanced ideas In scientific farming as Nebraska: much of this advancement has been brought about by object lessons demonstrated on our Fair grounds from year to year, showing what Improved breeding and Improved seeding will accomplish. It Is onr aim to bring together the best in tynes and blood lines In all breeds of stock and to show the results from the selections of the best seeds coupled with scientific farm- Ing. From object lessons received at the Nebraska State Fair the young ir-an from thr farm resolves *o imn&lt;-ove his live stock, after comparing the splendid specimens his eyes feast upon at our State Fair with the scrub animal at home, and in other lines. Improved machinery, etc. R these resolutions rut into execution Nebraska today \i boast - aving won an enviable position on many breeds at our national ms: amone these exhibitors of national reputation I know per - mme of the most successful who get their incentive at our fair. T can name a number of such cases. We reach the farmer direct; no other educational Institution can take the place of the State Fair. We are the only organization dealing directly with the tillers of the soil, therefore the main feeder of primary incentive to bring the farmer boy to our Agricultural School. Erne permitted T would be glad to take you back twenty-five years sent the facts and fleures of the Nebraska State Fair. Its growth n tn keeping with the demands of our people and the best In - of our state. Nebraska's rich soil with her varied climatic condi - tions give her the lead of all other states in diversified farming, placing our agricultural exhibits far In advance of any state in America. No other state fairs dare make comparisons with Nebraska's agricultural exhibit, we outclass all of them. Nebraska Is geographically in about the center of the United States. I^ocated as we are. on the western border of the corn belt and on the eastern edge of the really good alfalfa country we enjoy a combination of the most useful and profitable products of the soil. Combined as we have them, Nebraska is yielding larger returns </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 per acre from alfalfa and corn for the cost of producing than any other known crops; producing pork and beef at a less coat per pound than from any other animal food: with three and four cuttings of alfalfa per sea - son, yielding from three to five tons of hay per acre each season. The same kind of land producing from fifty to eighty bushels of A-l corn per acre. Is it any wonder lands are advancing so rapidly and that the Ne - braska farmers own 65 per cent of all bank deposits in our state? Eraska has the sell, and her citizens have the push that wins. I to on and tell you of her fruits, her flowers, her never-failing sup - the purest -and best of water, her never -falling streams, etc., but 'braskan it is unnecessary. CCKntleman, do we appreciate our stewardship? If you are fortunate ugh to own a Nebraska farm you are a lord. To enumerate our re - souroeg would surprise many, if not all. We are, of all countries, richly blessed in Nebraska. One of the duties of the State Board of Agriculture is the holding of the annual fair to give the people of our state good wholesome amusements, and to this end the Board of Managers has from time to time drawn the lines more closely in selecting attractions that would elevate instead of degenerate the morals of our patrons. At one time in the history of the Nebraska State Fair the fakirs and grafters were a financial asset, helping to pay the premiums, etc. It was necessary at that time to make ends meet. Not so today. In the year Just past your Board of Managers contracted for amuse - ment features (rating $1R. 147.00; offered in premiums $26,333.00 other than si&gt;eed: paid for renairs and labor $12,000.00. These amounts neces - sarily must be increased from year to year, adding to our expenses ma - terially. With the loyal support of our citizens we have been able to pay these expenses and add to our surplus sufficient funds to insure all exhibitors payment of premiums, should a rainy week prevent the at - tendance sufficient to pay the expenses. In summing up our needs I find we are about In the same predica - ment of the over-grown boy. "nothing big enough." We are obliged to make repairs of old buildings, build sidewalks, put in sewers, grade the streets, put in crossings, add to our water system, put lights In the build - ings, with numberless other growing needs; and must ask the state to build the permanent buildings. At this time I recommend we ask for an appropriation of $150,000 of the legislature now in session. Our present amphitheatre is Inadequate, unsafe and must tx replaced before our next annual Fair. We require seating capacity for 8,000 to 10,000 people who desire to witneas the races and other attractions. In front of the grandstand; we owe It to our patrons to furnish them with a comfortable place to see these attrac - tions, besides such a grandstand will pay big dividends on the invest - ment, and we need the revenue. Such a building will cost approxi - mately $100,00*, (Iowa's cost about that much) to build of steel and con - crate, and will par the State $20,000 revenue per annum from the sale </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTl'RE. of Hlti. Our unfinished Live Stock Pavilion will cost $60,000 more to finish and should be completed. The members of the Legislature now in session, should consider It a privilege as well as a duty to appropriate funds to build these buildings on oar Fair Grounds this year. The Nebraska State Board of Agricul - ture is an important factor in the advancement of our state's wealth and should receive liberal support for its needs. The 1910 Fair was a pro - nounced grand success. The exhibits were very complete in each de - partment, and of excellent quality. The Judges in the various depart - ments rave entire satisfaction, there being but little complaining and not sHnrle protest filed. E'he amusement features were entirely satisfactory to our patrons, one thine to be regretted was the accident to the aeroplane, which ppointed many of our visitors. The management did all in their Br to supply another, as we conscientiously desire to fulfill erery re given the people. Ethe officers and members of the Nebraska State Board of Agri - e, I wish to thank each of you for the loyal support given and the !ness displayed in accepting the positions assigned yon, and the hearty cooperation during the year Just closed. The success of our fairs are largely dependent on the efforts put forth by the Secretary and It gives me great pleasure at this time to congratulate our most worthy and efficient Secretary, Mr. W. R. Mellor: as to him more than all others combined, falls the burden of building the Fair. The officers can make the rlans and specifications but the Secretary must build the structure. He has performed his duties well and T congratulate the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture on being able to retain his services. A detailed account of receipts and expenditures being given In the Secretary's report, I do not Include this in my report RECOMMENDATIONS.

This committee will report at our meeting tomorrow morning. We are now ready for the Secretary's report. Secretary Ifellor then read his report REPORT OF SECRETARY. To the Ofteert and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, Greeting: A decade of constantly Increasing prices, with good crops covering the entire period, has placed Agriculture In Nebraska on an enviable foundation, and results in a per capita wealth for our citizenship that is the marvel of the age. With our banks filled with cash deposits, our cribs, granaries, barns, feed lots and pastures filled to overflowing. It is time for felicitations. The 1.192.214 people of Nebraska have Just cause for contentment. In such "security which lulls to sleep" it is of great Importance that we should do all within our power to arouse our people from their self sat - isfaction and hold before them the necessity of effort for future ad - vancement. To be satisfied, to rest on laurels already won, is but the advance stage* of future decay, therefore let the Nebraska State Board of Agri - culture continue to occupy its position for progressiveness so that our efforts shall not only be proclaimed as one of the bodies of progress but as "The one" body constant in an earnest desire for the future welfare of our commonwealth. Not only must the interests of agriculture be advanced but the im - •ortnnt problems confronting the animal industry of our state be care - nlly considered. With 163,978 cattle and 849,487 hogs less than Ne - •raska had two years ago. the future prosperity of the breeding industry assumes gigantic proportions. The census of 1910 reveals to us that consumers are increasing at a rapid rate, while the ranks of producers are correspondingly depleted. Many of the agricultural districts are los - ng population, this means fewer hands to supply constantly increasing needs. If this be true, what will be the result? If the country keeps up P irons course. If labor continues in Its present employment, the dingly restricted and proportionately decreased number of agri - must furnish the necessary food, and at prices which will r cause the mad rush cityward to cease, and demand attention Icnltures financial returns, In spite of the lure and glamor of The question, "What can be done to Increase the numbers of cattle and hoes?" is one of serious moment. The world's supply of cattle and </seg>

That the swum treatment of bogs will materially assist in solving the difficulty so far as pork production is concerned is assured, but it takes time to breed up cattle to attain an age fit for beef production. THE UNIVERSITY FARM. The School of Agriculture continues to grow in numbers and in its influence upon the agriculture of the State. There are registered at the present time in our lour years' high school course about 400 young men and women, and in our Winter Course 2uo young men, who are here for ibe practical study of agricultural problems. The College of Agriculture has increased about 2o per cent over its registration 01 last year, and now registers about Z2i&gt; students, with many students from the Arts College tailing special courses in agri - culture and in Home Economics. About 300 young women trom the Uni - versity are studying Home .Economics at the University Farm. B growth in tne College of Agriculture has emphasized the nee— offering all the work of the agricultural courses at the Farm This will doubtless be remedied in the near future. ihe growth of agricultural education in Nebraska and the accumula - tion oi the results of the Experiment Station is emphasizing more and more the necessity for an adequate means of distributing this knowledge among all tne people. 'Ihe Farmers' Institute Department of the Um varsity lias lor years done excellent work along this line but its resources have become inadequate to the task. Agricultural knowledge has ac - cumulated rapidly within the last fifteen years, and there is now a great laud of knowledge, well understood by the best farmers and by students ol agricultural methods, which should be distributed among all the people living upon the land. The Agricultural College offers instruction to not more than 800 young men and women annually. It sends out to the larms less than one-third this number. The agricultural population of this State cannot be much below 600,000 people, so that not more than about, one in 1,000 of the people interested in rural pursuits attend the Agricultural College. Some method of organization should be plannea and financed which would permit us to carry the best agricultural methods to these people. In several of the Agricultural Colleges there has grown up within the last few years a department of Agricultural Extension, which is intended to act as a bureau of publicity for the gen - eral distribution of agricultural knowledge. This department of Agri - cultural Extension has a corps of competent workers devoting themselves to extension lines of education. These include, speaking roughly, the ex - tension school where systematic instruction may be given for one, two or more weeks to regularly organized classes in the different towns of the State, where laboratory instruction in corn judging, in grain judging, and in live stock judging may be given to those in attendance. Departments in home making are also connected with each of these extension schools, and </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. Uie fundamental principles of cooking, of sewing, of household decoration and home sanitation are discussed before this school. Such schools can - uot but have their influence in the promotion of better methods on the tarm and in the farm home. In addition they give much of inspiration u&gt; the farmer, furnishing incentive for him to do the things he has al - ready known but has neglected because of carelessness or of lack of pur - pose and of forethought. It is to be hoped that the work of the Farmers Institutes will soon be enlarged so that it may include the agricultural extension work now done in the i wad ing agricultural institutions. Ene practical work of our lixperimeui Station is being demonstrated tany ways. At the central plant, by a careful system ot breeding selection, types of Turkey Red Wheat have been produced which are ucing on the Station farm and which it is believed will yield from U&gt; six bushels per acre more than the seed from which it was nally selected, tor the fanners of me state, these superior types are leauy lor general distribution. Ee work done by the Seed Laboratory in the examination of seed for ity offers the tarmer an opportunity to investigate the character 01 and other seeds which ne wishes to sow upon his larm and to know .lure and Lhe amount ot the impurities which they contain. The worn in Uie prouuctiou 01 seiuni lur die prevention 01 iiog cholera has reacnea a siege where it can be positively asserted that tne use 01 Lou serum in herds »mcu are exposed tu cholera and have not yet siCK - ened lrum the disease will protect at least Su per cent of the herd against cholera.

Nebraska is torlunate in being able u&gt; grow u^od every larm the two staples — corn and aliaua — which, prop erly combined, produce the cheapest beef, pork, and mutton, and the work now iocs", necessary in this connection is to spread this informa - tion broadcast among all the people. In the work ot the Experimental Substation at North Platte, Ne - braska, hogs have been fed upon a commercial scale to determine the most economical rations, and methods for their production have been worked out. It has been shown among other things that where corn alone is fed in rattening hogs, from »v* to 10% bushels of corn have been required for 100 pounds of gain, but where corn and alfalfa hay have been used it required but 7Vi bushels of corn to produce the same gain. Where the beat practical farm methods of feeding have been used, the corn fed to fattening hogs has returned an average of about 77 cents per bushel, which ia nearly twice the price paid the farmer for this grain. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE. The work of this Station on determining the effects of summer tffl - a«e method* for prowinir wheat In western Nebraska will be of Inestim - able '&lt; r alue to the people of the central and western portion of the state. For a series of five years the average production of wheat upon summer tilled land has been six bushels more than twice the averare produc - tion nnon land which was not summer tilled: so that when the yields are dlTlded by two. elvine the averaee yield per acre for the two years re - quired to produce a crop, this method has still been more profitable than attempting to produce an annual crop.

Through this Fanners' Institute department has been carried on the work of Agricultural extension, and as a Board we are of the opinion that the people of Nebraska fully appreciate the value of an institute held in their midst. The superintendent has written a statement to your Secretary which is in the words following: "I should judge that In your report you would be particularly anxious for a statement of that portion of farmers' institute work in which your Board cooperates. I therefore enclose a list of institutes to which your State Board has very kindly expressed packages of their annual reports. take it from letters that come in, that these reports are much ght for and appreciated. The State Board of Agriculture has also given, through your office, much publicity to farmers' institute work, and have cooperated, both by interest and financial support, to the boys' and girls' institute work which is coming to be one of the most important lines conducted by this Department. "As Superintendent of Institutes T wish to express my thorough ap - preciation of the financial support tendered by your Board to the State Contest and Corn Show. It would not be possible to hold this Corn Show or get up an attractive premium list without the support of your Board. We use the State Contest as a sort of round up meeting for the various County Contests held in different parts of the State. The pre - mium list for your contest has a wider interest than one might realize b first thought, because it stimulates activity and interest in exhibits ■ry County Contest. The boys and girls are anxious to win in their r that they may be privileged to exhibit in the State Contest. "On several occasions and at several different Institutes, members of the Board have been present and participated In the program. fwish to state that the chief difficulty in the promotion of Farmers' Mitp work is a lack of appropriation. We are refusing eighty-two lunities institutes this season and have cut down all two-day ln - :es to one-day meetings. We held forty boys' and girls' County Con - at which our speakers put on a boys' and girls' institute program. will hold one hundred twenty-five one-day Institutes and five Farm- Institute Schools." In addition to this fifteen institutes have been held in communities not supplied on account of lack of funds.

Eie educational work of preceding years in this Commission has ; fruit in the gradual decrease of misbranding and the more inteli - efforts of retail dealers to obey the law and to understand and apply )re generally. While iht limited force that the law allows for inspection has not been able to make inspections with the frequency desirable the state has been practically covered and the foundation laid for more thorough future work. About time thousand creameries, cream stations and dairies have been inspected and four thousand places where other foods were nianu - d or sold. E records of th &gt; enforcement of the sanitary law show a desire ply with its requirements on the part of those inspected and a ly cheerful and hearty cooperation on the part of county officials. The number of permits for cream testers has increased during the last biennium from less than eight hundred to about 2,200. Bing the last biennium the fees collected by this Commission ted to 111.324.G4, an increase over the preceding btennlum of About 1,400 samples of foods, drugs, paints and oils have been analyzed in the laboratory of the Commission. Eie system of score card inspection for sanitary conditions and of them for public inspection meets with very general approval and result, v/ith a sufficient inspecting force, in a complete record of initary condition of every place in the state where foods are manu - red or offered for sale. t Nebraska l-egislature of 1909 amended the food law by approv - bleaching of flour by nitrogen peroxide upon investigations made Alway of Nebraska and Drs. Weisner and Teller of Columbia ry. Amendments to the dairy section of the law requiring samplers of milk and cream to secure permits, and putting all bottles, glassware and scales used in making tests of milk or cream under supervision of this department were passed as was also a bill requiring branding of all receptacles used in transportation of dairy products and their use only </seg>

Ey Choltra. — During the last two years thirteen thousand hogs Immunized in this stale by the hog cholera serum and excellent i were obtained. The Department of Animal Pathology at the Nebraska Experiment Station has sent out serum for 8,600 hogs, the average weight being 130 pounds; aa ordinarily described this would mean 13,000 minimum doses. This has been distributed partly through requests from the State Veterinarian and partly from direct requests. The loss, as far as it has be.-n possible to obtain reports, has been less than 10 per cent in cholera herds. This serum has gone into twenty-seven counties. LPart of the {6,000 appropriated by the last legislature for the produc - i of hog cholura serum was used in building a serum plant. When this sum is exhausted there will be produced about 17,000 minimum doses of hog cholera serum. The cost for the minimum dose has been, so far, about 36 cents. There has been, however, no charge of adminis - tration against the production of serum. Cattle Mange. — This disease has been eradicated from Dawson, Cus ter, Boyd, Hayes, Hitchcock, Chase and Dundy coumies and therefore they have been released from Federal quarantine.

North 7latte. Valentine and Scotts Bluff present opportunity for tests of condi - tions In black loam, fine sandy loam and sand hills In low and hteh atti - tudes. In portions of the state covered In one Instance by sufficient rain - fall, and In the other from a lack of moisture, causing Irrigation and dry 'arming methods to receive exhaustive trial, still It Is very desirable that the Information by object lessons receive greater dissemination. Because of this fact numerous bills for Experiment Stations have been Introduced in past legislatures, but owing to the Treat expense of larre stations, and the limited fleld for further value than can now be secured from those aireadv located by the state, such additional stations have not received favorable consideration. One of the chief claims of this Board Is that education by object lesson Is the education of moment for the man who Is actually compelled to work out the practical problems of every day life, and In order to accelerate the cause of agriculture to a more perfect de- Bre hone that the nresent leelslature will pass a bill for an experl station of not less than ten acres In every county with an approprla - uftlclent to cover one-half of the expense im to 1400.00 entailed by onntv In securing the services of a scientific fanner from the ad - il students of our Agricultural School during; the cropping season A PTTBMCTTY DEPARTMTWT O»in&lt;; to the fact thp.t during the formative period of Nebraska the Secretary was not located at the Capitol, the departments tributary to. and a part of the State Board of Aerlctilture. as operated In other states. have been placed undsr the supervision of various political boards. The &lt;•&lt; mmerclal clubs of the state have declared for the gatherings of agri - cultural statistics and a publicity department through the office of this Hoard, and we are informed that an effort will be made to pass a bill authorizing same during this session of the legislature. That additional statistical and publicity work should be done In Nebraska Is a well known fact, bur In order to accomplish beneficial reforms In such work a new law touching assessors who primarily gather all data upon which statistics are based Is badly needed. In the enumeration of animals, for Instance. It seems customary not to list for assessment pigs under 6 months old. and also numbers of calves are not listed. Tf the law was changed so as to se - cure an enumeration of animals not assessed, as well as those that are. It would have a wonderful Impetus In advancing the position held by Ne - braska among the agricultural commonwealths. As an Illustration of the </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 HOARD OF AIJRIl II inefficiency under the present law, we will cite the conditions which obtain for 1910. In the report of numbers of animals returned to the Bureau of Statistics by the various counties under the present law, the numbers as given were: Horses and mul. cattle. 2,051.903: and hogs 1,490,- The numbers actually taxed as forwarded to the secretary of the Board of Equalization was: Horses and mules, 993,545; cattle, 2,475,639; hogs, 1,680,460. This shows a difference in the report to these two departments of 205,760 horses and mules, 423.736 cattle and 190,22s hogs. EQe government will make its report of Nebraska's statistics about nary 1st and it will (redit Nebraska with more than 3,000,000 cattle more Ifcasj I bogs, and the government report will be much t, as to actual numbers. However, it is not likely that the legislature will extend favorable consideration to a change in the method of securing agricultural sta - tistics, as it is much harder to eliminate than create political offices. if this Board should desire to make a preliminary trial of gathering and publishing agricultural statistics on its own motion we think we can add this department to our office at an added expense of not to exceed K.500 per annum, and guarantee fully as good service to the state, so far as agricultural statistics are concerned, as has obtained in the past. However, if a publicity agent were added the expense would be greater. STATISTICS. report of the Bureau of Statistics for the year 1910 shows that i h&gt; value of agricultural products was less than for 1909, although the general crop was greater. The long dry spell during the summer caused sonic shortage over the early promised yield but the prices ob - tained for products have been lower than a year ago.

April 13, 1911. — Census Director Durand issued to - flrst official statement from the Census Bureau relative to the oral statistics of the state of Nebraska collected at the Thirteenth al United States Census, April 15, 1910. It is based on a preliminary comparative summary submitted to the Director by Dr. L* Grand Powers, chief statistician of the Division of Agriculture in the Bureau of the Census. This summary shows, for both the census of 1910 and that of 1900, the reported total value of farm land, buildings, and implements and machinery: total acreage: improved acre - age; average acre per farm: average value per acre of farm land and buildings: average value per acre of farm land alone: and the aggregate expenditures for labor and fertilizers. It also distributes the total num - ber of farms according to color of farmer: specified character of tenure: whether held free or mortgaged by owners: and by certain acreage gronps. Ee director gives notice that the summary's figures are subject to re - later, owing to the fact that a number of farms whose returns are plete will be included in the final tables. These additions will not, probability, modify any of the amounts or rates contained in the it statement. K census of agriculture was taken primarily for the purpose of og an accurate Inventory of all classes of farm property existing II 15, 1910; a complete exhibit of farm operations during the year December 31. 1909; and a statement of the number and value of i&lt;- animals in cities and villages on April 15, 1910. Statements relative to acreage and yield of crops and the domestic animals of Nebraska will be issued by Director Durand as soon as the tabulation of this daia has been completed.

            <seg id="p046">46 PROCEEDINGS NBRRARKA STATK Roarp OP AORiril.TIRE STATE FAIR. The Nebraska state fair has now reached its most critical stage. Exhibitors and concessionaires who make the entire fair circuit tell us that Nebraska now hu the peer of any state fair In the country. Some fairs are greater in certain departments, but for uniform strength in all departments our exhibition la unexcelled. This fact should be a matter for satisfaction to every loyal citizen of Nebraska, but such a fact brings the management face to face with the grare problem of sustaining and excelling the present high standard attained, which Is a matter of no little Import, and a subject for serious thought and consideration. That we are now extended In exhibits to the very limit of our accommodations is well known to every student of the needs of our annual fair, and we most either limit our efforts in certain lines or secure additional accom - modations. That "additional accommodations" will be the solution of this problem there is little doubt, but this fact can only be obtained by Judicious and untiring labor on the part of each Individual upon whom responsibility rests. We think that Nebraska runs the most expensive state fair in proportion to Its attendance, of any state in the west, there - fore it Is timely to seriously consider a judicious curtailment of expenses, as there is a limit beyond which good business judgment should declare against It is well to remember that our state appropriation for pre - miums still remains at $2,000 per annum, the same as It has been for the past number of years, while our premium payments have Increased more than 100 per cent, with corresponding Increase In running expenses and a constantly Increasing repair account which now averages from $6,000 to 17.000 per annum to keep the old temporary structures in condition for ise. If our fair keeps up Its proportionate increase the coming dec - ade, corresponding to that enjoyed in the past, we shall have to secure greater buildings as more land sufficiently high for fair purposes adjoin - ing the prevent grounds is only possible by expensive 111. Tt is certain that the 1910 Nebraska state fair was a model in com - pletsnesa. with well balanced departments filled with exhibits.

This tair was characterized not only by the increased attendance but by the increased number of exhibit* la all departments and the higher quality shown in many of them," Wallaces' Farmer published the following exhaustive recapitulation: NEBRASKA STATE FAIR SUCCESSFUL. All Records Broken in Attendance — Best Fair Ever Held at Lincoln. Last week at Lincoln marked the forty -stcond annual state fair for Nebraska, and also the best fair in the history of the association. In the general quality of the exhibits, as an all-round, well-balanced exposition, and in the attendance of visitors, all records were broken. Each year finds a better fair at Lincoln- There are new improvements, chief of Ethis season is the handsome stock-judging pavilion, one-half of is completed.

            <seg id="p048">48 his family came from every county of the state to take advantage of the opportunity. The weather was cool and pleasant, with a bit of chill to the breeze the last two days. A big rain late the week before flooded ■mm of the low ground and delayed the races till Tuesday Everything possible was done for the comfort of patrons and visitors, and the big crowds were well handled, considering the facilities at hand. Early in the week it became apparent that all previous attendance records would be broken, and Wednesday saw over 44,000 people on the grounds, which sets a new mark for Lincoln. As a whole, the fair excelled any previoijF chow. In some departments it did not surpass certain former years, but in its general character, in the high standard of the stock show, the extent of the machinery exhibit, and the excellence of the agricultural products and fruit, it was ahead of all previous Nebraska state fairs. The financial success of the fair insures some needed improvements for the future. The big stock pavilion must be completed, more acreage is imperative, and also a heavy dike to provide against overflow in time of heavy- rains. A modern grandstand is sadly lacking, and several build - ings are inadequate to take care of the demand for space. The state fair should I*- considered a state institution, and the Nebraska legislature should be liberal in assisting the fair with appropriations for the big permanent buildings. braska certainly beats them all when it comes to county displays of agricultural products. Every available foot of agricultural hall was required to accommodate the entries. Nothing but the 1910 crop is allowed in these displays except mature corn of 1909 may be used. The visitor to agricultural hall would not suspect that this has been a rather dry season in many sections. The grain and sheaf entries were never equaled in quality throughout the show. Vegetables were hardly up to the standard of some former bumper years but it was nicely selected and remarkably good. A surprising feature was the splendid displays made by some of the western counties. The eastern counties have generally taken the bulk of the prizes in the individual classes but this year a full share went to the western half of the state and among them some of the most desirable prizes. The individual entries exceeded last year, which was a record-breaker, by fully twenty-five per cent, and the quality was better all through. The county awards are made on the collective exhibits, and the individual articles may also be entered in the general state contests No better idea of the agricultural resources of the state could possibly be placed before home folks and visitors alike than these county exhibits Generous prizes are hung up to encourage good dis - plays, and from an advertising standpoint it is certainly a good invest - ment. In the eastern section the counties were awarded prizes in the following order: First, Douglas; second. Pawnee; third, Richardson; fourth. Lancaster; fifth, Butler; sixth, Nemaha: seventh. Saline. In the central section the counties stood: First, Franklin; second. Kearney; third. Webster: fourth. York; fifth, Fillmore; sixth. Antelope. The </seg>

Red Wil - low; fourtu, Box Butte; fifth, Keya Paha: sixth, Thomas: seventh, Sioux. The chief attraction provided for this year was a series of aeroplane flights, four to be given each day. Monday four beautiful flights were made, and two more on Tuesday morning. On the next attempt a gust of wind caught the machine just as it left the ground and dashed It against one of the speeo barns, completely wrecking the aeroplane and bruising the aviator. No reserve machine was at hand, and none could be procured in time for the remaining days of the fair. It was a keen disappointment to the board of managers that the flights could not be continued and also disappointing to thousands of visitors who did not get to see the bird-man in his thrilling flights. The quarter-stretch had been all cleared out to give room for the starting of the bi-plane, but it proved too small and the aviator stated he would never again attempt to start in so small a space. Compared to the air-ship, or dirigible balloon, the aeroplane is like an 'automobile compared to an ox-cart. It can be handled in a stiff breeze, and travels at great speed, being diven by pro - pellers operated by a powerful gasoline engine. The operator had the machine under perfect control. He swooped in big circles like a hawk on a calm, summer day, dipped up or down at will, veered right or left, and turned sharply around as fancy dictated. However, it will be some years yet before this will be a popular mode of travel, owing to the danger in starting and stopping and the serious results if the engine or anything else refused to work properly in midair. As an example of the Cgress of the world, and as a beautiful and thrilling spectacle, the fly - machine is well worth a long trip to see. Each year the machinery exhibits grow larger, and keener interest is taken by visitors in this department. This is the age of Improved and labor-saving machines, made necessary by the scarcity and high price of efficient farm help. Only a few years ago the machinery display at Lincoln had ample room on two or three acres. Now it covers twenty acres, and many need additional space to display their lines to advantage. Prominent among the displays was the gasoline engine as a farm motor, both for stationary and traction work. The big gas tractors for plowing, hauling, etc., had the attention of a large crowd. Silos and silo machinery bmore in evidence and also corn harvesting machines. In short, every machine the Nebraska farmer or his wife could use In their ss was on the grounds for Inspection. * Horticultural hall is always an interesting place to visit at Lincoln. The state society lends its influence to encourage exhibits of apples and other fruits, with the result that a fine display Is made every year. This year, In spite of the unfavorable season in many localities, the quality and extent of the show surpassed all records. The apples were of excel - lent coloring and size, and remarkably clean and free from scab ana worms. Evidently the Nebraska fruit growers are giving more attention </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 1'ROTEEDINQS NEBBA8KA STATE BOABI&gt; OF AOBirt'LTTKE p«*r* was most notable, there Twine several time* as many entries as last season, and this fnitt Is becoming more general In the orchards of the state. Among the interesting things of the show none were more eloquent of Nebraska's success as a fruit country than the handsome trophy cups and medals won by her horticulturists at the national show last winter. A featnre that Interested many stock men was the exhibit of tuber - culous cattle and samples of diseased organs and meat from Infected cattle This exhibit was made Jointly by the experiment station and the state veterinarian. A corps of assistants were kept busy explaining the tuberculin test, the effects of the disease In the living animals, and how it may he detected in the carcass. Several of the tuberculous animals shown were as thrifty looking beasts aa one could wish to see, being sleek fat and apparently in perfect health. Only a very small per cent of Infected carcasses are condemned by the Inspectors at the slaughter houses as unfit for human food. Those animals which are In the advanced stages of the disease are condemned and "tanked:" those but sllghtlv affected generally show the disease only in the glands and organs not used for food, and the meat is wholesome. It Is gratifying to note that people, both veterinarians and stockmen, are taking a less radical and more common-sensp view of the dangers of tuberculosis among live stock. The races did not start until Tuesday, and the Monday events were rtlstrlbnted Into the remaining days, giving a big card each afternoon The pnrses were generous and brought out strong fields In almost every event By the last of the week the track was hard and .fast, and good time was made Past time and broken records do not count so much with a state fair crowd as big fields and close finishes. T^lncoln visitors had plenty of both The grandstand was packed and the fence lined several deep clear around the track. A modern amphitheater Is an abso - lute necessity to comfortably take care of even a small crowd. No other feature at the fair attracts so many people. They see the fair In the forenoon and want rest and recreation In the afternoon and evening \ building large enough to accommodate the crowd, with comfortable seats and fireproof construction, would pay for itself in short order, and be a source of considerable revenue to the fair. Visitors would patronize It freely, and feel they had made a good Investment. Now a few thous - ands are crowded and cramped into the old grandstand, and the rest must hang over the fence Tt Is hard work Instead of recreation. Ee automobile has proved popular among Nebraska farmers. They to the fair In goodly numbers In their machines, and with dry and roads storage room on the grounds for autos would have been at a premium The old horse- Judging pavilion has been turned into an auto - mobile show. It is symbolical of the passing of the driving home. In the pavilion and around It under big tents were centered the exhibits of </seg>

There Is evidently little known of a closer money market among the farmers in Nebraska, and automobiles are getting so common as to cause no comment. The dealers reported satisfactory sales and a record-breaking inquiry. Educational hall was worth a visit by every patron of the fair. There are some "live wires" among the instructors of the state, who realise the value to the pupils of encouraging them to prepare exhibits and compete at the state fair. It can be made a great stimulus to better work and keener interest in school. The work shown by the pupils of grade and high schools was surprising in its excellence. It is a feature worthy of encouragement at every fair. The Nebraska fair has for years been noted for the state fisheries exhibit, and no more popular feature is seen on the grounds. Visitors thronged around the pavilion all day long inspecting the various kinds of tish native to the waters of the state. Glass tanks set in the outside walls of the pavilion contain the fish, and the visitors follow the broad walk around the building. This method is a great improvement and does away with the old-time crush, which was unavoidable inside the old Mercantile hall was the mecca of the visitors who wanted "something you give away." Here the merchants and business firms made their displays and got rid of advertising cards and novelties in great quan - tities. A new feature was the exhibit made by the local naval recruiting office, and it attracted an interested crowd of visitors at all hours. A miniature reproduction of the battleship Oregon, eight or ten feet long, marine charts, souvenirs, nags, pictures and various guns and equipment used by the sailors were features. A miniature overall and jacket fac - tory attracted much attention also. The skill and rapidity of the girls in sewing various garments was remarkable, and the work of the ma - chines in stitching, making buttonholes, etc., was no less remarkable. After watching the ease and rapidity with which the girls turned out the finished garments, one could easily be persuaded that it is cheaper to buy them than to make them at home. E&gt; art hall was filled to overflowing with the needlework and various of fancy work known only to womankind. It was said to surpass mer years in the number and beauty of needlework and art goods. Pie feature of the bee and honey exhibit was the lectures of the "bee i," which were delivered in a big wire cage, with a few quarts of swarming around and over the lecturer. Not content with letting them alone in these close quarters, the "wizard" stirred them up with his hands and even his nose, caught a few in his hands, and in general invited trouble, according to the notions of most folks, who harbor an idea that bees will go out of their way to interfere with the peace and happiness of humanity. To watch this man handle the bees, and to listen to his story of their work and life habits was a revelation to hundreds </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 mOTI!H&gt;IN(JJ» \ERR\SK\ SI \ It: IIOAUl III' \r .iill T I.TtRK. It is an educational feature worth while, and demonstrated in an impres - sive manner how one who understands bees may handle them with safety. Hee-keeping ought to he general on the farms of the central states, where every year an abundance of pure honey could be secured at practically no expense and but little extra work. The dairy hall, as usual, was principally given over to the separator men. with a few butter and cheese exhibits from farm dairies and one or two displays made by the creamery men. The centralized creamery has full sway in Nebraska, and It has taken the dairy cow clear out to the "short grass" counties In the western section of the state. Farm dairying Is not popular with the Nebraska farmer, generally speaking. He "don't have to" milk cows and churn butler and is inclined to prefer other lines of farming which are less confining, even if not quite so profitable. The popular plan of farm dairying is to sell cream for ship - ment to the big central plants. This makes it hard to get out a good dairy exhibit and one that would be in keeping with the importance of the industry in the state. The poultry coops were all filled, and the overflow of the ducks and ■Mae were housed in the adjoining hall. The standard of birds shown was said to excel any previous year. The women folks all took keen interest in poultry hall, and most of the men saw the show, too. Interest in pure-bred poultry is evidently increasing, and the Nebraska hen is coming to be appreciated more than ever before. A uniform system of cooping and arrangement would add greatly to the attractiveness of the show. The Nebraska experiment station co-operates with the department of agriculture in maintaining at Lincoln a seed-testing laboratory, for the benefit of farmers in Nebraska and neighboring states. Seeds are tested free of charge for both germination and purity, and this affords the buyer of farm seeds an opportunity to protect himself in the matter of procuring good, clean seed. It is a most important work and one that farmers should appreciate and use. Prof. E. M. VVilcox, who has charge of the laboratory, bad in agricultural hall an interesting exhibit of their equipment, and explained their work to visitors. THK STOCK SHOW The stock show gets a little stronger each year, and it takes better entries to win the ribbons in most breeds. There were over 180 horses. 500 cattle, 1,500 hogs and 300 sheep in the barns. The new stock pavilion was well filled with visitors whenever the judging was in progress. Down around the barns the aisles and alleys were crowded till one could scarcely get through during the rush hours. 1 II K SHOHTHOKNS The exhibit of pure-bred Shorthorns was perhaps the best the state </seg>

The showing of young things was especially strong. The junior yearling bull class was exceptionally strong, and furnished the junior champion bull, while the junior yearling heifer class furnished the grand champion female of the show. Both the senior calf classes were large and strong. There were twenty-four senior bull calves in the ring, and the judge said the class would be a strong one in any show not excepting the Inter - national, in commenting on the Shorthorn exhibit as compared with other years, Professor Smith emphasized the improvement that has been made in the Nebraska herds, as the natural outgrowth of the wondeiful agricultural resources of the state and the enterprise of the progressive farmers of the state. This improvement has oeen very noticeable to the observing ones who have attended the state fair the past five or six years. One of the most difficult decisions Professor Smith had to make was in the senior champion cow class, and he called in Charles Escher, Jr., to assist him. The contest was between the Tietjen heifer, who was grand champion at Des Moines the week before, and the Nevius cow, who was not shown before this year. The Nevius cow won. but was defeated for grand championship by the Tomson &amp; Sons junior yearling heifer. The Teitjen bull, Village Marshall, won senior and grand championships.

Pi white faces made a grand showing, perhaps not the largest, but isses were mostly of good size, and all were made up of high-class animals, of uniformly good type and showing good condition and quality. The exhibitors were from Nebraska, Colorado, Missouri and Iowa. Most of them had met at the Iowa State Pair the week before. O. Harris won grand championship on bull at both fairs, but at Lincoln Mr. Mortimer reversed Professor Kinzer's Towa decision by making the two-year-old grand champion Instead of the yearling. It will be noted that the two-year-old was later awarded the sliver cup for best bull any age or breed, the same bull having also won this prize at the Nebraska State Pair a year ago.

Nebraska's swine exhibit this year was somewhat larger than a year ago, and was considered more uniformly good. The Duror- Jersey and Poland-China breeds were both strongly represented, as usual. There were over 600 Duroc-Jerseys and about the same number of Polands. The Berkshire showing was the smallest In years, only two herds being represented. There was a fair showing of Chesters, and the best show - ing of bacon breeds that has been seen at the Nebraska state fair. Tarn worths and Hampshire? were well represented as to quality, but with little or no competion. The bacon hogs were also represented by a new breed called the English Blacks, a heavy-eared, medium-sized hog, re - cently introduced in this country. While the swine show was largely made up by Nebraska exhibitors, there was considerable competition from Iowa, Illinois and Missouri herds. The Nebraska herds, however, won all the ohampionphlns, except in the Ixcon breeds, where there was no Nebraska competition. The Duroc-Jersey champion, owned by Barnes ft Lamb, is a Crimson Wonder breo hog. In class awards Judge Burnett railed in H. F. Hoffman to help decide between the Barnes ft I*mb hog and the Van Patten hog for first place, the latter being a son </seg>

We understand that it is not possible for all of you to be represented as members of this association, because there is an agri - i ultuial society still back of you that has not instructed you so; but we want to own you as individuals; it don't make any difference whether your agricultural society stands under. We believe this agricultural society that you represent there will become a member later; and we appreciate the position you are in; and we waiit you to come to this Eting, and 10 not feel that you are under any obligations at all to body. Come to this meeting, and get an admission. You will get it he door free of any charge. Evident Hendershot: I hope others will take advantage of this, be - lt isn't very often we get this kind of an invitation. Better take it. good thing. Is the committee on revision of the premium list ready R. Rudge: Mr. President and Gentlemen: I believe in letting a man it least what he is worth. We have not in the past paid the sal - as a Board of Agriculture to our officers or our Secretary that, 1 should have been paid. We have been having a $6,000 man for Secretary for $2,500. I believe in paying him at least half what he is worth to us. I move that the Secretary's salary be increased from $2,500 to $3,000 a year. (Motion seconded.,/ Secretary Mellor: Gentlemen, 1 appreciate Mr. Rudge's feeling in this matter, but I do not think it is expedient for you to do this at this time, and I am much obliged for the offer. I have turned down several offers here in the last year of from $3,000 to $4,500 a year. But I have not been working for money: 1 have been working because I am con - nected with a mighty fine bunch of fellows. [Applause.] And the money affairs of life do not worry me as much now as they used to. Therefore, I thank you, and 1 appreciate this very much; but I do not think that it is wisdom for you to do this, and I hope you won't. I thank you very much. E resident Hendershot: There is a motion before the house. (Calls for stlon.") It has been moved and seconded that we Increase our Sec - y's salary from the present amount of $2,500 to $3,000 per year. Are ready for the question? ("Question.") All those in favor of the in signify it by saying "Aye"; contrary, "No." The ayes have it; unanimous, and so recorded. [Applause.] </seg>

Eretary Mellor: I wish you would all turn to your premium lism eratise we want to take this along the regular way. In the first we will turn to page 21: On the pay-roll schedule we have added Intendent of automobiles." Mr. McLeod: Mr. President, before we go on with this, I have a reso - lution I want passed for a change in the constitution, that I did not think of up there at that time; in fact, I did not have It in shape to present. I would like to present this before we go on further, because it might make some changes. For several years I have oeen studying on the matter as affecting the manner of selecting the Board of Managers. I may ba wrong or I may be right. You may all agree in this room, or differ with me. but you all know that we have been having trouble in congress in the last two years over "Cannonism." I am not a stand i . I am what you might call an insurgent to a certain extent. If Cannonisni ' is the thing for us, you know the result of the last election; one man iiower is not endorsed by the people of the United States any longer: and those people here in Nebraska, up here at the capital, the legislature, now. Instead of the one-man power, have abolished that, and decide by a committee which selects other committees. I have as a reso - lution here that which will to a certain extent explain itself and change that form, which I now pass to the Secretary, and ask him to read. I Eflnd out whether we are stand-patters or whether we are lnaurg - what we are, here; and whether that will stand the test or not. know, but I want to know where the are at in this matter. The Secretary read the following: RESOLUTION The old prejudice that has existed in the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture for more than a quarter of a century, based upon its methods of election and distribution of its membership over the state, is still a matter of contention and a source of unrest among its members, not withstanding the reform of two years ago, when the old nominating com - mittee method of election was supplanted by equal distribution in the state, using the congressional district as the unit of division in this ap portionment. The charge is still coming up, however, that the Ne - braska State Board of Agriculture is a close corporation, a wheel within a wheel, an endless chain, so to speak, that it is organized under such rults of government as to be able to control and perpetuate its official head, the Board of Managers: Ptolvil. That no member of the Slate Board of Agriculture who has I in the elected position of President of this association is there - eligible to appointment or election on the Board of Managers until </seg>
            <seg id="p135">Hrtolvvd, That the Board of Managers be selected in the following I State Board of Agriculture shall select a committee of six (6), together with the newly elected President, shall select the new of Managers, one from each congressional district not represented President, said selection to be ratified by the society. BMcLeod: I move the adoption of the resolution. (Motion sec - ) Prrsldent Htndershot: Gentlemen, you have heard the' resolution. It has been moved and seconded that we adopt this resolution. Are you ready for the question? Any remarks? Secretary Mellor: Mr. Chairman, I don't know that it is a good time to make remarks, but I see that the rest of you are afraid to get up and say anything, so I will speak a moment on this matter. It has been fashionable in the past (this may be stand-pat ism. or may not be) to find fault with any custom that is made in the state of Nebraska with a corporation on the plan of its organization. There is always some merit in some other method of procedure. The reason that the President has been allowed to nominate his Board of Managers, or appoint his Board of Managers, has been, that the President is supposed to be re - sponsible for the success or failure of the fair. Each President so elected has, in his judgment, selected the men whom he thought would S serve his purposes for the welfare of the association. I know that i I tried to be President bark in 1904, it was at a time of quite it in the society between tvo of us who both wanted to be President iKissibly some of the members felt a little sore at me because I ap - ed two of the opposition and three of my friends. I think that was 6 distribution, and it proved to be a good distribution, for the that it made a better feeling in the State Board of Agriculture , if we would still follow this plan, that It will not be any worse would be under some new plan. Two years ago we started in with the Australian ballot system. There was a good deal of dissatisfaction because we had been in the habit of having a committee of five go out over night and select the men with regard to location of candidates, and so on. They said, under those con - ditions, they had an opportunity of selecting the same men over too often: but it was a fact, gentlemen, that under those conditions, we selected fourteen or fifteen members, and there were always three to five new men. Ever since the Australian ballot system has obtained most of the old members are re-elected. It isn't our fault if we are the old iinn : it isn't our fault if we old fellows are re elected; but it is your judgment, and you have thought possibly these old fellows are the best or you wouldn't have elected them. [Applause.] If there is any reason why these men that are now acting on the Board of Managers, who have been acting, should be let off this Board. I think you are fully able to form that opinion and let them off, and you should let your wants be </seg>
            <seg id="p136">Introducing this resolution, and lxjssibly he can give us gome better reasons; but, so far as his reasons have been made known up to this time, I do not see so very much more merit to them than the reasons for the other way. Mr. McLeod: I think Mr. Mellor has strengthened my reasons a great deal. A few years ago when I advocated changing the method of procedure In elections a great many of the old members were just scared; they were downright scared. I wag willing to trust this body of men to put in the best men. You know they have been kicking all over the state, the same as there is a kick now on the method of electing these members of the Board of Managers. I have no kick over the Secretary; none whatever; nor over the President; I have nothing but compliments for them. As to the Board of Managers, I think they deserve the beet of every nature in this organization/ All I want is, not to throw down any man, but to throw down the procedure by which you select these men, and come to present day methods, and let us all take part In that; and I am willing to trust you the same as Mr. Mellor Is willing to trust you, and he says the old members will be all back. They do come back, because we are satisfied with them. This Board of Managers will go back, because you will be satisfied with them. But it changes this sentiment that is going out through the country, saying that it Is a self - perpetuating body, a wheel within a wheel, a one-man power, which we are turning down all over the United States. L&lt;et the people rule. Let the body rule Itself. There's no harm done. The Board of Managers are good. There's nothing that I am after. There is nothing that I want. There is nothing that I care anything for whatever, except to strengthen this state fair and to put the best men possible at the head of it, and increase its efficiency here. We have one of the best fairs in the United States, and it is going to get better year by year. Don't think I am finding any fault with the management. Don't think I am finding any fault with the gentlemen. Because he is satisfactory to you, 1 am satisfied with Mr. Mellor. I want Mr. Mellor to stay there until he Is 100 years old, if possible. I would rather help keep him there. But it is this method which will give more satisfaction when you bring new people out. Out in the state of Nebraska they make demand for this change; and you will not find the Board of Managers changed materially — not if I can help it. I thank you. Mr. Rudge: The statement or resolution read that no ex-president shall be on the Board of Managers until the time of two years has elapsed.

I want to say In behalf of myself, and I think I can speak for Mr. Youngers here, that neither one of us Is seeking this post tion on the Board of Managers. We put our time In here because we are Interested in the work, and we are neither one of us seeking a posi - tion on the Board of Managers the coming year. The fact is I would rather have you put somebody else on. I have put in ten or twelve years of good service here, and I am willing that some one else should be put on there and do the work. With my knowledge of the work that the C presidents have bad on the Board or done on the Board, I know that h of them would be only rbo glad to resign. I thank you. [Applause. 1 RPrltchard: There is a statement that to me seems rather strange lot think that the resolution is Intended as a slap at Mr. Toungers Mr. Rudge. I did not so consider it when that resolution was read, le idea is this: That this association, whin it elects a man its President, confers upon him the highest honor in its gift, and it is simply fitting for the President to retire without any direct application to anybody, you see instead of applying to these men who happen to be on this Board of Managers. It It not a slap at Mr. Youngers. I know him as well as I stand here. It is not a slap at Mr. Rudge. I don't believe there is a man on this State Agricultural Board that will do ax much work as Charles Rudge has done on this lioard of Managers. [Ap - plause.] I know his work. I have been on tho Board, and I know it. and I don't believe it is a slap at him. But I will tell you: the appoint - ment of this Board of Managers is In conflict with American Institutions; it is not democratic. Why should this Board, created by law as twenty - nine members, delegate to one man its authority or its power? I do not see any reason why we cannot elect Mr. Rudge and Mr. Youngers if we see fit. It is simply a question of every fellow having a finger in the pie, and then, when he puts his filnger in and he gets burnt, it's his own finger, isn't It? If the delegates should put a man on the Board of Man - agers, he helped do it, didn't he? It simply takes the cussing off the President. Your parties out all over the state everywhere, your dele gates, come in here and elect this organization and its Board of Managers the same as they elect their other officers; and I do not see wherein It can do any harm. It is merely carrying out the idea of American institutions, and I hope that the motion will prevail. Mr. Lawson: Mr. President and Gentlemen: This is consuming time, and, with the evidence of the satisfactory results of the present manage - ment, I move that this resolution be tabled.

A member: Where will that end? Will it not bring it right up again in five minutes, to vote on that again? A member: Sure. Another member: Possibly. Member: And then again, and then again.

That would read, then, "lie shall, at each annual meeting in January, appoint live additional members on the State Board of Managers, one of whom shall be the first Vice President."

We a ill have it settled now. 1 think there is every reason (or the First Vice President to be on the Board of Managers, so that he will be in a position to know something about what has been done be - fore the week when the lair opens, so u nocesuary he can lane the posi lion of the President, and do it intelligently. If we have a Vice President who is not connected with the Board of Managers, when the fair opens up if (something should have happened to the President, we would have to put the Vice President in his place, and, if he is not on the Board of Managers, he is not familiar with the work of the fair,, and It is at best rather a difficult proposition. 1 think I mentioned this five or six years ago, that 1 thought that should be done; but it was never put in our Constitution or By -Laws. I think the First Vice President ought to be on the Board of Managers, so as lo be in touch with the work of the fair if he had to assume to take the place of the President.

This is cut out. The reason for cutting this out was that the President and Secretary are both members of the Board of Managers, and both make a report. This should have been cut out when they were added to the Board. Kident Hendershot: if there Is anything that is not perfectly clear man in the house, he may get right up and say it, or "forever nr peace." Secretary Melior: Rates for Dray ing, on page 32, had to be referred u&gt; the incoming Board, as it is a matter that we cannot control. on page ML "Amateur Stock Judging," there were no entries In tnat yast year, so they cut it out of the list Mr. Mickey: On page 34, under "the computed age of cattle," was a change made by the State Fair Association in the dairy cattle? Do you have any recollection of that? Secretary Melior: I do not think so. EMr. Mickey: Last year, there was a little trouble over that, and the pie thought that the ages of the dairy cattle should be 60 and 64.

            <seg id="p144">Secretary Mellor: Gentlemen, before we do that I would like to read you a letter that I have from a neighboring Iowa state officer about this proposition of securing a grand stand from the legislature. President Hendc i shot : We would be glad to hear the letter from our sister state of Iowa. Secretary Mellor: Two years ago Minnesota appropriated $200,000 for a grand stand, and Iowa appropriated $100,000 for a grand stand. The receipts from the grand stand two years ago In Minnesota for the week of the fair of 1909 were more than $62,000. That was a pretty nice percentage on the cos) of the stand. I think, if we could have a stand that would seat from MM to 10,000 people, we could take $20,000 out of that stand, which would assist materially in increasing the premiums, and make a better fair for Nebraska,. I wrote to Mr. Simpson, of Iowa and he says: January 2, 1911. R. Mellor. Hev'y \&lt;bratka state Board of Agriculture. Lincoln, "Mi Deah Mb. Meli-oi: Your letter of recent date at hand and we note that you expect to start a campaign for a new amphitheater on the Nebraska state fair grounds. We are glad to learn this, for you surely need one there, and there is no good reason why the state of Nebraska should not. as far as their funds permit, add to the permanence of your great state exposition. It is one of the greatest institutions of your state, and we believe the people of Nebraska are in sympathy with its purpose, and the members of the legislature should see to it that it is taken care of equally as well as the other state institutions. Nebraska is pros - perous, and will be proud of a fire-proof steel constructed amphitheater that will safeguard the lives of their dear ones while gathered to watch a few harmless and highly interesting amusements. In my opinion, an amphitheater is the hardest of all improvements to secure for a state fair grounds, for the reason that there are no particular in t rests back of it. The fellows who make the most noise about building hundred thousand di Bar amphitheater for the 'hoss-racing' will be the first ones to say 'Amen' after It is once built. Just so long as the people of Nebraska continue to hold the state fair (which will be for all time to come), just so long will people congregate there by the thousands. This being true, it is the plain duty of your legislature to provide against a panic that would result in possibly a great many lives being lost. One or our most learned Jurists has said that 'Recreation and relaxation are quite as important sociologically as education and instruction.' There - fore, an amphitheater that will seat in safety the thousands of citizens of your state who annually attend your fair, and gather to see your anwaenvnt program, it is a necessary adjunct in their training. "I will try and find you an extra set of plans and specifications that we had for our amphitheater. If I can, I will be glad to send them </seg>
            <seg id="p145">. km* ut M Ml MM our legislature asking for the appropriation two years ago. In building our stand we found it necessary to move the rare track and speed barns, and the bill which we had drawn up covered this as well as the building of the amphi - theater. We received only $100,000 of the $160,000 asked, so we found it necessary to eliminate many of the features of the stand, including two sections — one from off the ca.-,t and one from cff the west end. It was also necessary to leave out the mezzanine story, the brick wall en - closing the back, all cement floors and walks, store rooms, toilets, etc. In fact about all we had left was the steel work for eight sections, with the reiniorced concrete floor for seating, the roof, and the chairs neces - sary 10 soat the stand, together *ith the necessary equipment. In fact, we did not paint the iron work after it was erected. What we put up in 1909 cost us a little over 188,000; to this was added during the past Win about $8,000 in the way of cement floors underneath the stand, went walks in front and on the back of the stand, grading around and and in the paddock, etc. It cost us about $12,000 to move and rebuild our race track, move and practically rebuild some nine speed barns, etc. Pne of the good features of our stand is the width of the seat rms, they being full 36 inches wide, instead of from 30 to l!2 inches i will find in most stands. This makes it much more comfortable. t, I have never seen a stand any place where the people took as pleasure in sitting through an afternoon, and apparently seem not % as they do in the stand we built. We used a steel folding chair wood slats for seats and back in seating the boxes. We have a regular open-air opera chair for the reserved seats, and use the common bow back or kitchen chair for the balance of the stand. These last we fastened together in about 2,500 reserved seats, the balance of the seats being open to the 25-cent ticket. The total seating capacity of the stand is about 7,000. We charge 25 cents extra for reserved seats, and M cents extra fcr the box seats, the regular amphitheater admission being 25 cents. In addition to the seats in the amphitheater we this year erected within the paddock about 2,500 to 3,000 regular circus seats. Our stand, as you know, sets back 100 feet from the track, and as our paddock extends out about 200 feet east of the stand and 100 feet west, you may know we have a very nice place there, which will comfortably take care of 2,000 to 4,000 people, thus practically doing away with the quarter-stretch nuisance, as no one wants to go there now except a few with their vehicles. "With best wishes for the New Year and success in your campaign for the new amphitheater, I remain, Yours truly, J. C. SIMPSON, "Secretary." PIr.

For my patt I am heartily in accord, and I 4m not want to take any woik off this incoming Board. I think we couldn't pick out five men out of this body that are members of the State Board of Agriculture either now or that will be elected tomorrow, that would not place that •'residtnt there; but, at the same time, just at that time, I thought theie ought to be an expression on that point.

Y oakum, chairman St. Louis A San Francisco Railroad Co., at The Temple, Lincoln. Nebraska, January 17, 1911. None of the investigations which have been made by Congress, by Enmissions, by any department of the Government, by any economic titution or society, or by private inquiry has shown that the cost of Iroad transportation has anything to do with the increased cost of The railroads have to pay their share of the increased cost of labor Biplies, but these increased expenses have not been met by adding cost of transporting food and clothing or other articles used by pie. I know that the retailer#often replies in answer to complaints prices that old prices are impossible on account of higher freight Such replies are misleading. All Investigations show that the I charge for carrying products from the producer to the user Is small compared with the profits and expenses paid to the merchant. l-ft us get down to the bottom of this subject. Broad unsupported statements made either by politicians or railroad officials mean but little ■■less facts are given and the subject is analyzed Twelve years ago $10 would nay for the same house furnishing goods thai it now requires $13.20 to buy in Nebraska and other western states. T. n dollars would then purchase the same amount of wire nails as cost $12 30 today. It then only required $10 to buy the same amount of agri- cultural implements and lumber as $16.40 buys now. Conditions are just the reverse when it comes to paying freight bills. Ewill purchase the same amount of transportation as $10 were re - to pay for twelve years ago, although the railroads have to stand no high cost of living as yourselves. To illustrate how rapidly the P 1 living has advanced to the railroads within the last twelve years I -abor has advanced 36% Coml 40% Steel rails and ties 60% Taxes 85% and so it runs through every artleta r« quired in the maintenance and </seg>

It has been a problem of no small importance to keep sufficient people on farms to feed those in towns. According to the census reports 33 per - sons out of every 100 in the United States are farmers. In France, the most prosperous country of Europe, in many ways the most thrifty nation in the world, 60 out of every 100 are farm workers. In England, directly across the Channel, about 25 out of every 100 are farmers. Lloyd George, chancellor of the exchequer of England, showed the effect of England's condition in a recent speech In which he said that 7 per cent, of the people of England are in helpless poverty and 30 per cent. are part of the time on the verge of starvation. The statistics of other countries are not necessary to show that we are confronted by rural problems of our own which are pressing for im - mediate solution, and which are of greater importance than any otner question. e&gt;ur government and our lawmakers can better afford to increase their U and devote more of their time and energy to aiding the farmer to give so much time to other less important public questions. It is business aide of country life that Interests me more than the social pntimental side. I am a believer In good business methods. The bee, the most intelli - gent of all Insects, and by many naturalists placed next to man, is shown by observations covering a period of more than a century, to be making a businesslike effort to reduce the number of drones in each hive. The drones are non-workers and the bees have had sense enough to see that It is economy to get along with fewer of that class of insects which pro ducr nothing and are only in the way. It will do the country good if farmers will patiently study the business policy of bees towards their drones. In the past farmers have given too little consideration to*the economical handling of their products and to the expenses and profits paid to those who do not produce. Farmers have listened to political agitators who denounce railroads and trusts but have nothing to offer In the way of lower costs in handling farm products and larger returns to farmers. We can now discuss this matter frankly as farmers are commencing to take advantage of trust methods. They no longer have any false no - tions about using good business, sense in getting good prices. The Farmers' Grain Co-operative Association, The California Fruit Growers' Association, the Texas Southwestern Truck Growers' Association, and many others that are organized to handle the products of the farm, de - liend for success upon the application o&gt; business methods which it was </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 formerly the fashion to condemn as trust methods. The trusts were pioneers in reducing the cost of manufacture and distribution, thereby increasing profits. In the elimination of competition individual hardships resulted, but this could not be helped, any more than in the introduction of labor saving machinery, men are thrown out of work. The principle of the farmers' co-operative societies is to adopt the same methods in re ducing for mutual profit the expense of trading between the producers and K farmers' cooperative society adopts as its first and basic principle, IKMition of giving to the members a pro rata share in the in returns resulting from a decreased cost of marketing or selling. Bhf growth of the organizations of farmers will be the next important in the development of the country. We will then have commercialized ing. Theie are now in this country several thousand farmers' or - ations which have been created for the purpose of getting greater returns to farmers and to make reductions of selling cost of their prod - ucts in the markets. Too many retail middlemen are to the farmers what the dronrs are to the bees. The bee said the fewer of these non - workers the better, and he reduced the number. The farmer is saying the fewer of these non-working profit takers along the line, the better, and he is reducing the number, selling through established agencies of his own selection, taking part of the returns himself, and willing to divide the savings with the consumers. This movement has made much greater progress in the tinted Kingdom and continental countries than in the I'nited States, but we are learning rapidly and adopting the methods The organization of co-opeiative societies in England commenced In IM4 with twenty-eight members. In 1908. the last statistics we have, the l«T8 aie Ftven as 2,:. Hi. and tne profits $55,665,000. They- show over 33 per cent, advance to the producers without hurting the cor. turners. tThe farmers' business organizations of Ireland, France and Germany 1 show lanid growth, with large profits to their numbers. In Denmark in 18X1, when co-operation v as first taken up, the pro cluccis received for butter, eggs and bacon twelve million dollars. In ISOu, the last statistics we have, through cooperative organizations that business had increased to the farmer to seventy-eight million dollars. Their cooperative dairies number 162,000, and the egg export societies of Denmark have 22. mm im n 1 erts. This industry is now bringing them ten million dollars a year. Knai k is a low country with an area of 15,000 square miles.

The other half Is to market It to the vantage. Ei8 Is a day of co-o;&gt;erat ion. The success attained through organiza iili our timber lands, coal lands, minerals and manufacturing in Ml and by our merchants and organizations of commerce could not teen realized by individual effort. These industries have their for buying, for selling, and have forces working together to make dollar in profit by saving every dollar in expense. ■ ould be unreasonable to expect the farmers of the country to ad - their interests through individual effort. It can only be done i organization. To illustrate, if a community of tarmers owns a milion bushels of I heat whi&lt;h is worth 90 &lt;ems in the market, and it costs say 12 cents a bushel for elevator charges and transportation, a purchaser must fur - nish over a million dollars in (ash to pay the farmers and hold the wheat for a favorable market to sell. The farmers are the owners or this n illion bushels of grain, and the cash required by them, if they are organised to hold their grain for a favorable market in which to sell, would only be $120,000. Therefore, they can carry and ship their own giain to market with a small cash requirement, as against the present method where they haul their grain to town and sell it at the best price h f i an get. Eie same applies to other agricultural products, and the instrument can be of the greatest service in facilitating the establishment or louses and aid in marketing your products is the railroad which you htard condemned and preached against by th»se engaged in the established i olit it al industiy of the country. ■etary Wilson, in his lecent report, estimates the cost of dtetribu - laini products between the producer and the consumer at over 50 t. of their value. This is a nine billion dollar crop country. Therefore, the distributing coat, according to the Agricultural Department's estimate, is four and &lt; n&lt; half billion dollars a year. If one-half of this, through proper busi - ness methods, could be saved to the farmers, it would mean a saving of over two billion dollais annually. There could be no better or bigger reason given why the farmers should apply business methods to the handling of their pioducts. At present, needless profits and unnecessary r.scs are enormous; and they will continue to be big and will keep the (ost of living high until the farmer advances through organization to a i oint where he can use the best business methods in marketing his You (an depend upon the co-operation of the railroads in working out your pioblercs if you will take them up in a business like way, but we should deal direct. Politicians are not needed as go-betweens. I have </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 of tb.se conferences. Business relations between railroads and you who largely use the wagon roads, which are the connection between the (arms and the railroads, should be very strong. You run the wagon roads, and we run the railroads. Let us talk business every time we can with a view to reducing the cost of distribution of farm products to the lowest figure possible. We can afford to leave the buncombe to the politician. He will continue to blame the railroads for high cost of living, and the retail middleman will continue to implicate the railroads and the farmers. So far as our business relations are concerned, both of us and the country at large will be better off when we deal directly with each other. The farmers of the country to make the greatest success must do so through business methods. Their organizations must deal with the most imiiortant etonomic questions of the day. They will have, to deal broadly and in a spirit of fairness to all to be successful. They must be coin posed of men who look into things for themselves, and pass their own Sent, not relying on the opinions of public men seeking office, whose its influenced by selfish motives. Their representatives must bo up of men who can sit around a table aud thresh out questions t prejudice, keeping in mind the two important things, the cost of tion and the cost of distributing to the coLsumer. Bie organizations should endeavor to promote legislation looking to ancement of agriculture. I don't mean that laws .in the interest farmers especially should be enacted without due regard to the Any law enacttd 10 protect a special interest against the general wrong. Euerly the principal work of the Agricultural Department of the States was supposed to be for the distribution of seed and issuing b. That department has expanded into other work. One of its i|K&gt;rtant bureaus is ils good roads department, and no one thing omplish more to aid the farming industry than the saving in cost iportation from the farm to the railroad station. I good roads work has been accomplished by the expenditure of le government money. It has been through intelligent work and ition of the Good Roads Department with the public in advising erent communities how to work out their road problems to the vantage, thus giving the country the benefit of the government natives' knowledge and co-operation as to the most economical and best methods of construction and maintenance of our high The same benefits could be had through a close co-operation between the Agricultural Department of the federal government and the farmers, through their organizations, in marketing their products. I do not mean by this that the government should furnish financial aid, but it could supply valuable assistance through the issuance of bulletins on the differ </seg>
            <seg id="p153">cost to transport, profit to th&gt;- difT»r»-nt dealers, and cost of distribution to the consumer. When all of these things, which make up the cost from the farm to the table, are worked out, it will be very easy to show where the useless expenses and profits are taxed against the consumers of the Nation. Iran through advanced methods of cultivation, which up-to-date 5 are adopting, reduce your ex|&gt;enses of growing and increase your tion per acre, but so long as you have so little to say concerning ing product prices will be beyond your influence, and the consumer ntinue to pay as high prices as at present without any advantage growers. When our factories are again employing all the men they need to run 10 their full capacity; when the lailroads can again commence new con si ruction and carry on their improvements; buying large quantities of material as they did a few years agn; when general prosperity is again started; the consumer will be taxed by the dealers in proportion to the renewed prosperity of the country. In other words, all that comes to the average man through the general prosperity will be taken away from him and added to the profits of the dealers, without benefiting the farmer, unless protected through organized methods. This can be accomplished easier and to greater advantage by closer relations between the producers and the transporters. It is better for the railroads to have friendly relations with the farmers. It is good business for them to do so. It is better for the farmers to work closely with the railroads, as the railroads can help in many ways through the use of their warehouses and facilities to extend to the farmers advantages that can substantially help them both in pro during and marketing. All of us stand for advanced ideas and reform; but reform theories and putting them into practice are two different things. However radical a reform it taWes hard-headed, thinking, conservative men to successfully carry it out. We do not look to the orator who can hold the publir spell bound with his speech making. He is not the man to place at the brake on rounding curves where danger lurks. It is not to the high stepping leader of a four-in-hand that the driver looks for his safety. It is the wheel horses he depends upon for real work, and to hold the spirited leaders when in trouble. Impracticable catchy speakers take themselves too seriously. They are good to listen to in their dramatic delivery of radical Governmental policies and con - demnation of railroads, but when the hard-headed thinking man looks over the field, he goes quietly and votes for the man who is safe and holds the ranting leader down. This is not displeasing to the theorist who plays the game of extreme radicalism, for he knows and admits secretly to himself that he is incapable under his inflamed condition of mind of being trusted with carrying out any important policy, but must look to that class which constitutes our thinkers and conservative men I </seg>

Publicity, as it applies to the County Agricultural Society, e&gt; of the must important features that we deal with. We feel thai particular subject of publicity is deserving of considerable atten tion, and, in view of that, there has been a gentleman selected to talk 6 this subject, to introduce it, by the name of James K. Ryan, of In tola, Neb. We will have Mr. Ryan introduce his subject, and the dis lion on this topic and the others will be pasted over until we have ed our program. PUBLICITY. Eiyan: Mr. Chairman: The subject assigned to me rovers a great re ground than I can possibly get over in the very limited time I to me Publicity is only another way of spelling success. The public aue tioneer Is a great example of publicity. Note, if you will, how zealously and carefully he prepares his sale bills. Every phrase that touches th&gt; fancy and catches the eye and Induces men to read the bills is inserted, always carefully posting the bills where the people interested will see them. Publicity is what he is seeking, knowing that proper publicity means the success of the sale. I might go on through all lines of busi n»as and illustrate points, how the merchant, the manufacturer, the mine operator, and in fact every line of business and trade, has come to realize that proper publicity means larger returns and greater success in their business. There are many modes of getting before the public; perhaps all of them, in a measure, legitimate; the old adage, 'The constant dropping of the water wears away the stone." So I think that in order (o make a fair a complete success it should be constantly kept before ihe public; not only a few weeks before the fair, but all the time, doing around </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 but it s a poor way to Advertise ft fair. Placing bills on bill-boards And the business house windows is all right, and the more the better, but to rely wholly uixm that method would spell failure for the fair; and so I think that if we were to rely wholly upon newspaper publicity, success would not be attained. So you will readily observe that I believe that I legitimate means of getting before the pub'ic should be used, not grudgingly and spasmodically, but liberally and all the time. thing to advertise, and then let the public know by adver - tising it. Then, there is quite an art in getting before the public. Have you ever noticed two almost similar events being advertised? The one is told in a monotonous, sing-song, uninteresting manner, while the other bristles and bubbles with wit, humor, catchy sentences which at once arrest your attention and cause you to read it. It were useless for me to tell you which of the two is the greater success. Ejiim up my whole theory of publicity in connection with the fair, I would say: First, strive to have a creditable story of publicity, and, secondly, never lose a legitimate means or % it before the public and keeping it there until the event is pulled there is anything better than publicity, it is more publicity.

We all rcali/c that publicity practically is a moving factor in the world; and publicity is doing more today towards the advance ment of agriculture and the advancement of every industry in this country than all other things, practically, combined. This is observable In the fact that our business men and our commercial clubs all over the country arc organizing themselves into publicity clubs, to get the advantage of publicity and the advantage of advertising. We notice that every place. The Comnu i&lt; ial Club of this city, the Commercial Club of (in aha. and the Com men ial clubs of all your towns are organ - ised u|Min the basis of publicity.

We will now hear an address upon "The Circuit." This "Circuit" to a very considerable &lt; xtent has reference to the fast horse and the fast horseman. This is a feature of our county fair that a few years ago was condemned. A few years auo agricultural societies were breaking up because the fast horseman and the fast horse became a strong factor in the county agricultural society.

We are living In the "Syndicate Age." An are of organization. Everything Is being done by "team work." Cap - ital Is organised. T,abor Is organized. Associations of every kind are organized to do effective "team" work for their respective members, each trying to promote the general welfare of the "class" as well as to bring benefits to the members Individually. No better Illustration Is needed than that of the various meetings of Organized Agriculture In session here this week. What do we obtain by organization? Organization, rightly used, unites force, systematizes efforts, and conserves energy. It tends to bring har - mony out of discord, order out of chaos, and equalizes our burdens by proner distribution of labor amongst the laborers. By counseling, better ways of doing thlngR are found and obsolete methods are left behind. By It we find the true relation of things. Our county and district fairs are In need of a'l the aid they can get. Their hardest problem Is to get the largest amount of success possible, consistent with the very limited amount of money and of labor they have to expend. This can be done best by Intelligent organized circuit*. "Team" work In maturing their plans and team work In their execn- The counties of Flllmore and Nuckolls have been, In a measure, work- Ing together now for several years. Sometimes we have had other counties associated with us and at other times not. During 1910 we had Webster and Kearney counties with us. Our organization wag (In fact has always been) very Informal In its character, with little or no legal binding ties upon Its members; In fact It has been very "democratic" In Its organization and work. It has not attempted to do much, yet I believe that the results have been very satisfactory to Its several mem - bers. Our representatives, by counseling with each other, have by dis - cussion of old methods — comparing and analyzing — found where changes could be advantageously made. We have made some advancement In uniformity of speed program — in classes, purses— and In rules governing ■peed events; but also in privileges of horsemen. We have joined in procuring some of our free attractions and have been mutually benefited thereby, financially and otherwise. Our "circuit" has economized oar funds and conserved our energies, by our "team work" with and for each other's benefit. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. I believe this work can be carried further. Our community of interests are such that we can make fair uniform classes in our premium lists, uniform prizes, and uniform rules of Judging, as well as expert character of the Judges. Fillmore county (and I think the others also) is using expert judges more and more, and we hope soon to be able to use them in all departments, pay them for their work, and get such as can give brief lectures, telling exhibitors their reasons for their rulings. It will enable us to arrange for uniform prices for concessions, as well as pro - vide for rules governing their admission and exclusion, and, also, their control when admitted. This subject U a very live one — one that effects at once the character and the finances of our fairs. We do not wish to intrude on Mr. Pigman's subject, "Our County Pair," but would like to say this much: The county fair, as we look at it, has three purposes in our community life, namely: The promotion of education, social entertainment, and the financial advancement of its people. Without these it has no excuse for its existence. These purposes ran be accomplished only by making it a financial success. This brings us to the last but not the least question, revenue. Revenue is largely a question of gate receipts. If we can approximate uniformity in the "show" we give our "fair" patrons, we ought to be able to have uniform rules and prices governing admissions. What shall we charge? Are we to have a "family" ticket? A "season" ticket? Shall an admis - sion ticket admit but once, or allow one to come and go? Children, shall they be charged full, or half fare, or admitted free? And at what age draw the line? "Comps," what about them? Then team and "auto" admission? Also, grand stand and quarter stretch tickets and accom - panying privileges? Fillmore county admits children of ten years and under free of charge every day. Charges, single admission, 50 cents. Has a season ticket, but price not fixed for 1911. No family ticket. Mem - bers each get one ticket, and if married, one for wife. Teams and autos nig per day or 50 cents per season. Grand stand and quarter stretch, each, 25 cents. No "comps," except to visiting representatives of other fairs. We have had a special privilege of the grounds ticket, which admits holder to come and go through main gate, quarter stretch and grand stand during fair. These questions must be settled by each member according to the sur - rounding circumstances, but where the members in a circuit are in con - tiguous territory they can very materially aid in smoothing the rough places if they can get together in their planning. Harmonious team work by the members of the circuit, with harmonious team work by the several members of each fair association, will certainly bring success to each community. Shall we work together? Toastmastcr Hervi-y: Our next topic 'is "Free Attractions." This is a new feature, practically, of tfca fair work. It is only a few yearn ago ■toea this was introduced into our state fairs, aud that applies more </seg>
            <seg id="p159">properly to the large fairs — the free attractions, to the fairs that are able to pay money for good entertainments to come and be exhibited on their fair grounds without any expense to the management and for the purpose of entertaining the visitors. I think that the introduction of the free attractions on the fair grounds is a very long step towards the reform of attractions on the fair grounds; in other words, it is a moral - izing feature; it is a moralizing step towards the doing away of all the immoral influences of the disreputable shows that creep into the fair grounds, in spite of the management, and which are a disgrace to the fair and the fair managers and every person who attends those fairs. 1 think that this free attraction feature is one of the greatest things that has ever occurred for the moralizing influence of our fairs. We have a gentleman here in Nebraska, who is reputed to be one of the best fair men in the state. He is conducting one of the best fairs in the . and he has got practically at the head of this procession. He has given fair management, and fair attendance, and general fair prop - iiis a great deal of study and a great deal of his attention. Now we will have Mr. George Jackson, of Nelson, talk to you on "Free Attrac - tions," and incidentally he may give his experience with the "girl on the Midway." [Applause.] FREE ATTRACTIONS. !. Jackson: Mr. Chairman, before I left home I was appointed by uiuinercial Club to represent them at their "Good Roads" meeting Friday morning. And my son said, when I left, "Dad (he knows etty well, you know/, don't make a mistake, now, and give your roads speech before the agricultural meeting." So, in order to get from that, I have outlined a few thoughts that I want to talk on. I' attractions for our county fair are a hard problem to solve. •coming a necessity, and in fact is considered a part of the fair, it as important for the permanent success of the fair to have good, ttractions as it is to have a fine exhibit of stock or farm products, t is a hard problem to solve, because the class of people that this line of work are not, as a rule, honest in every respect, 01 . I will venture to say that every fair manager in this room has had at some time just grievances against attraction people. Just at the last moment they probably will cancel their contract, without as - signing any reason; or probably you won't hear from them at all. I have had that sprung on me many a time. And, If they come, they may not be up to the contract. Often they are not as represented. I will be glad to see the time when amusement people will put a higher value on their word or contract. I think, however, that a great deal of this trouble can be eliminated by the formation of circuits for this purpose. You can always secure your attractions cheaper when you can promise them several week's work, and short jumps; and there is no doubt that it </seg>

If your attractions are not as represented, not up to the con you are in position to protect yourselves. Within the last season, in the circuit that we belong to (Nuckolls County Agricultural Society), we hired an att rait ion for the four fairs, and I think the contract price was to be $400 for each fair, and, when it came to show up at the first fair, they found out it was not as repre sented, that they were paying $400 for about a $250 or $300 show; they concluded it was about a $3uu show, and so they decided to pay them but $300, and no more. The attraction people, after some correspondence and some trouble, decided to take the $300. Of course, all the rest of the association, or the rest of the circuit, were notified, and we all paid but $300 apiece; and there was a saving right there of $400. So you can help each other in so many different ways, and benefit each other, in getting horses and concessions. 1 think a great many associations make mistakes by putting a limit on the amount to be expended for free attractions. Frequently we have met. with associations that in deciding on attractions would have three or four men, and they couldn't get together at all; they had a limit; they were not free to act, and couldn't do anything. I think the beet way is to have one good, conservative man, one who is a good judge of human nature, and instruct that man to get something good, to get something out of the ordinary, something that the people would enjoy; and, if you find that he has been a little extravagant, arrange to try something else, or raise the price of admission. 1 find that the patrons of the fair do not object to the price of admission if you have something to show them that is of interest. They demand a clean, moral exhibition, and should have it. The rules of every association should be that no objectionable shows or gambling be allowed, and everything held to strict rule. I think it is better all the way around. For instance, if you have plenty of free at - tractions, and good ones, and there should come a rainy week, you can cancel your races and be to no expense, and when you have the at - tractions, go right on and give the shows anyway: they can perform if It is rainy weather. 1 can't hardly read my wife's writing [referring to paper]. [Laugh - ter.] Just how to entertain the people In the forenoon is a proposition. It is true we have our stock judging and farm products and agricultural judging, and that; but there are a good many that these do not appeal to. We might have bail games. I don't know but that I would like to hear some one else express an opinion along this line. I think, If we El get a crowd in there in the forenoon, we could command more for concessions, and it would be a step in the right direction. I would to hear some one else on this though. ▲ fair is supposed to be an educator, and the best of everything sfcoikl be found in it. We should never forget that the patrons of the </seg>

This appeals to the fair man as the biggest proposition that he has to deal with. We have selected to handle this question, I understand, an attorney, L. H. Cheney, of Stockvllle. We thought that this would be a good, subject to give an attorney of great experience with county fairs and state fairs, on the proposition of concessions. That la really a great, big proposition, I fancy, with state fair managers. We will now hear from Mr. Cheney. Mr. Cheney: If you have had grief with your concessions, that is certainly true in the western part of our state, where we are compelled to make the best use of what is offered to us. CONCESSIONS. Concessions. We want them for the pleasure and convenience of the patrons of our fair, and for the money they will produce for the fair treasury. Concessions should be in harmony with the fair. So grouped and of such a character as to strengthen the general good Impression of the fair to the vistors. Objectionable concessions should be carefully excluded from the grounds. The money received from them does not begin to pay for the damage they do. Games of chance, questionable and immoral shows, gambling as carried on by some followers of the fairs, with their paddle wheels, spindle wheels, jungle boards, etc., are constantly trying to secure places on the fair grounds. I speak of this because I suppose our experiences are similar in receiving flattering offers from early spring till the fair season Is over, to allow games of chance and certain shows on liberal terms to the management. Public opinion Is frequently divided as to how far the concession man should be allowed to go. Some favor a wide open fair, but the opposition is steadily growing. Farmers do Bwant their children swindled and demoralized by amusements of this acter. Frontier county cut out games of chance some time ago. If e are any who find that too radical a step to take at one time they lit follow the example of the fair manager who wrote across the face prtain concession receipts, "No gambling a-1-o-u-d." The men who have general stands and restaurants should be en couraged to put up permanent stands and buildings on the grounds and carry on their business from year to year. It is better for them, for the managers, and more satisfactory to the visitors. The average store keeper in a country town is far too busy during fair time with his own </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 kind of business. In any event tout h&amp;s been our experience in my own county. Wide-awake young farmers are what you want, to get results. They bring their own help and a large part of their supplies from their farms. In a measure it is a holiday for them. Not only that, but they will bring in usually a good display of exhibits for the fair which might not otherwise be shown. Their homes become a center of interest for the coming fair, which influences their respective neighborhoods. Further, and what is of particular interest to you and me, the farmer can and will pay a better price for the concession than the average town people. That is our experience In our own section of the country. It might not apply in other parts; but we make an effort to interest, and to press in the young farmers in this particular line. Ere the grounds ready for the concession people before they arrive ■ured and staked; hay and straw for their stock; the wells and ready and the sanitary condition of the grounds carefully examined proper condition. The concession people for the most part arrive 1 days before the opening of the county fairs. Unless careful prep - i I* made, they are frequently at much unnecessary inconvenience. The terms, prices,- and number of tickets given should be clearly understood in advance. Exclusive privileges at a county fair should be granted sparingly, if at all. As to the number of tickets of admission, we have made a practice of giving not to exceed one concession ticket for each $5 paid. If additional help is needed, they are required to purchase tickets the same as visitors. The prices that should be charged must depend on the general attendance, the location of the grounds, the number of stand privileges granted and other local conditions. The Custer County Fair and perhaps some others print their scale of con - reacion prices In the premium list and upon cards for convenience in promptly answering all inquiries. I should be glad to learn from the representatives of other counties how their concession money compares with their jrate receipts; and what method can be used to Improve the character of the amusement conces - sions and Increase the receipts from this department. To give you an idea of the growth of concessions as a revenue producer at the Frontier county fair, allow me to give you a few figures In 1897 the receipts from concessions was 19 per cent of the gate receipts; In 1898, 21 per cent; while the average for the past five years has been 24 per cent and the year 1910 28 per cent; or, to put it another way, the receipts from concessions in 1910 were more than four times those of 1897. This re - sult has been secured in part by greater publicity, the general growth of the fair, and in part by the avoidance of conflicting dates with adjoin ing counties and the formation of county fair circuits. The iirices charged should be high enough to prevent overcrowding of small stands, yet low enough so that the concession men will make good money, go away satisfied, with a good word for your fair and a </seg>

Take good care of the goose that lays such golden eggs. Toast master Hervey: I hope you are hearing and noticing the good points of these discussions, and will be able to profit by all of them. The "Stock Show" is one of our topics, and we all realize the im - portance of the live stock industry .to our state, and Incidentally to the farmers and to our county fairs, and the- importance of a good, strong live stock exhibit at the county fair. Because, the live stock industry of Nebraska, the live stock industries of the counties we are operating In and are living in and that we are making our living from, are largely i onirolled, so far as a money making proposition is concerned, by the manner in which they are handled. We have Mr. E. E. Youngs, of Lex - ington, a live stock breeder, who also does a good business in the live stock industry, and is quite a prominent man in the breeding of live, ■lack, to discuss this question for us. [Applause.] Mr. Youngs: Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: In order to be specific in what I am saying, I resort to manuscript. THE STOCK SHOW. The stock show at the county fair is a feature that should be en - couraged by liberal rewards of money, by having wide-awake, enthusiastic, live stock breeders as superintendents who are willing to work without expecting to be rewarded with a special salary; who, with the assistance and guidance of the management of the fair, interview the different breeders in the county in which the fair is held, and adjoining counties, soliciting them to show their different breeds of horses, cattle, hogs, sheep and poultry. We, of Liawson county, have found this to be very successful in having a full and complete representation of the different breeds of stock and in having a particular strong showing of the best the country produces. The stock show is the most attractive place on the grounds for the business farmer, business man, banker, and the young men who realize the importance of better stock. The stock show is the only way com - parisons can be made by which we formulate and store away in our mind's eye the correct conformation of the nearest perfect »n&lt;m W i The stock show is not only an education to the stockman or breeder, but the public at large is greatly interested in good stock, specially if presented in splendid condition, well groomed, well broken, and with ribbons flashing on heads of halters. Show stock in show condition is considered by all breeders a thing to be proud of. The spirit of rivalry, with a disposition to surpass the efforts of the other fellow, is an important factor in a successful stock show. Encourage the stock showman.

The management of county fairs have many and varied ways of spending the money they receive at the gale and from other sources. I think, however, the money spent for a real up-to-date stock show is of more lasting importance than that spent for any other purpose. You may ask for reasons. So 1 will give them. In the first place, the men that make up the slock show are a class or citizens of big heart, public spirited, ambitious, and boosters from start to finish. In making up your premium list, every one of tlieni will buy ■pact: to advertise his particular business. The success of the county fair in uppermost in his mind at all times, lie talks fair to his neigh - bor; he talks fair with his banker; with the merchant, with everybody. Why.' lie has stock for sale; he U aware of the opportunity the stock show offers him lo display the products of his farm and his skill In tilting them no as to be pltasing to the eye, making a prospective in looking over our lKlu premium list, 1 find that $110 worth of space was bought by breeders and other kindred interests. And that of the $2,407. lu total amount of premiums offered, other than speed, $867,511 was offered for pure blood horses of draft breeds, standard bred horses, jacks, grade geldings, and mules; $65u was offered for cattle of several beef and dairy breeds; $10u for Duroc-Jersey and Poland-China hogs, and Er fine and coarse wool sheep; making a total offered in show stock 717.50. Of course, all the classes in all the different breeds were led; consequently, we paid out for all the show stock about $G5U. 1 bring iheae figures up before you in order that you may comprehend the importance we, of Dawson county, consider the stock business, the stockman, all encouraged by the stock show. Toastmaster Uervey: Our County Fair." This is a subject that, I think, appeals to all of us in a kind of sympathetic way. It makes us eel that there are kind of home conditions connected with this subject — - more so than anything we have discussed. It brings us down to our wn community, our -own real home conditions; and I hope that there will be following this a free discussion in regard to our county fair. We nave given this subject to Mr. Joseph Pigman, of Broken Bow. Mr. l'ig - man will please discuss this question. OUR COUNTY FAIR. BToastmaster and Gentlemen: In entering upon a discussion of ibject, I wish to state in the beginning that the thoughts herein ted are not founded upon actual experience in county fair manage - but are mostly theoretical, being drawn from observation and com - i with those who are experienced in the business. Ktime was when the county fair and the Fourth of July furnished j'fufll hdliriflVK and times of recreation of the rural population. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">165 of accident, rather than by any scientific management of the producer, had reached unusual size; for in those days corn was corn and pump - kin was pumpkin, regardless of the breeding. To the fair was also brought the large hogs, the fat cattle and sheep, and horses of various ages, selected, of course, because of their individuality and often groomed and fed for weeks or months with extra care to be put in the best pos sible condition. Likewise, with all the exhibits, the selections being made almost wholly of specimens of large size regardless of other points of excellence. In those days Mr. Farmer and his family went to the fair for two purposes: To see the show, and to have u social time with their friends and acquaintances. Two very laudable purposes. Then the task of the fair management was comparatively easy. All they had to do was our the country for the largest specimens. The fair management of today must do more than that. It is true that it must retain the show feature and furnish the opportunities for a social time, but it must bring together the best products that the surrounding counrry affords and it must be a place of instruction. In the olden time, when Mr. Farmer loaded his products intended for exhibition, Into the old farm wagon, with his good wife by his side in the spring seat in the front wagon and the young Misses Farmer and the young Master Farmer sitting on the hay behind, drove off to the county fair for a few days' recreation and to see the show, it was not a very difficult matter to satisfy their tastes as far as the show part was concerned. A horse in harness that went the mile in three minutes was a wonder. A horse that bad been stuffed for nine months until he weighed 1,800 pounds was the next thing to an elephant. A balloon ascension on the principal day of the fair sufficed for the special attraction. A ride on the circle swing, the motive power of which was furnished by the boys pushing ttj arms which held the seats, furnished plenty of recreation for the youngsters. After throe days of such sight-seeing the family returned home, having seen much but learned very little that could be of use to them in producing better crops or the improvement of their stock, but with a fund of information sufficient to furnish topics for conversation for the neighborhood gatherings for months to come, especially how the young people delighted to tell their less fortunate companions who did not get to go to the show of what they saw at the fair. But in this age of rapid communication and transportation and wireless telegraphy and aerial navigation, it is different. Mr. Farmer drives' to the fair with his family in a 50-H. P. automobile. The rural carrier has been bringing to his home the daily newspaper, the magazines, and innumerable farm journals, and he and his family are well informed about the world's doings, and especially in those things which are being done for the betterment of the agriculturalist. The boys from 15 to 20 know all about the different breeds of horses, cattle and hogs, and you will find many of them familiar with the different strains of the several breeds, and can </seg>

Ity the use of labor-saving machinery and the adoption of better nieihixltt of doing things, many have been enabled to visit the larger cities, the state fail's, and a very large number, the industrial ex - hibitions which have been so successfully held throughout the country in the last few years. This is the class' of people for whom the present day manager must provide a fair. Now, for a few things that I consider in dispensable in the conduct of a successful county fair. K superintendent of each and every department must be next to an n the line over which he or she presides, and, in addition to qual quantity of the things which are exhibited, there must be present icr very essential element — tasteful arrangement. The management should start early in its preparation. The premium Hat should be arranged with reference to the kinds of products raised in &lt; &gt;iimiunity. A premium intended to bring out an exhibit of oranges and figs at a county fair in the sand hills of Nebraska would be ridicu - lous in the extreme. Begin to get people interested before the crops are put in. Let the public know as many of the things which you propose to do as possible. I'lan things to interest the boys and girls and let them know about it. Ik) not be afraid to advertise. Too often those most interested and for whose benefit fairs are held, do not find out what is going on at the fair till within a few days before it begins when the big posters are pasted up on the barns and granaries of the farmers. A WBIX BALANCED FAIR. Eieavy speed program with scant live stock and agricultural ex - will not be a success. Neither will a fine line of exhibits alone tisf action. The premium list alone will not bring exhibits for it is often the •■ase that those producing the best do not care to take the time which is necessary to get their products to the fair for the small amount of premiums offered. An effort should be made to get in touch with those who are producing the best of whatever line, and arouse his Interest and enthusiasm so that he will want to show what he has accomplished and be glad to tell his neighbors how he has done it. The education feature I consider most important. Every effort should be made to follow as closely as possible the efforts being put forth by the Farmers' Institutes — and the suggestions of the State Farm and experimental station man - agers, to the end that people in every community my be encouraged to improve the breedings of the crops and herds. Toast master Hervey: I wish to say to our fair managers that I think there is no state so closely related to Nebraska in the fair industry and in the fair work industry as the state of Iowa.

(numerous occasions we have had some of the Iowa Board of Mar s come to the Nebraska fair, to see what we were doing and how vere doing it, and invariably they have gone away with the greatest Is of praise for the Nebraska state fair. In fact, a number of them, e or four of their leading members, were here a year ago, I under - d, and weut away with the impression and with the expression that had never witnessed such an exhibit in the agricultural building as saw on the Nebraska state fair grounds, four or five or ten times more than the Iowa state fair produces. I won't say it is because Iowa cannot produce this stuff; it is not because Iowa cannot put up an ex - hibit of that character that we are putting up, but it is because Iowa has failed in educating the exhibitors that Nebraska has been spending years in educating in putting up one of the best agricultural exhibits, which will go further than did the best agricultural exhibits made in the United States by any /state fair.

I let the matter lie a time, thinking it was not possible to got away some 250 miles to attend a meeting of this kind. Yesterday aft) moon, one of our Board of Managers came in and spied this program on my desk, picked it up, looked it over, and said, "Clark, when are you going?" I said, "I didn't intend to go at all. " Said he, "Well, we will ace about it." He walked up to the telephone and called up the presi - dent, a farmer out about ten miles in the country, and talked with him a little; called up the directors that were living &gt;n town and talked with them, turned around and said to me: "Ycu go over to Lincoln, and be there tomorrow night, at that mooting." That is the excuse I have for intruding myself on you here tonight. 1 do not feel that I can say anything in addition to what has been said regarding the management of county fairs: Mr. Smith and your President suggested that I might say some things with regard to our association in Iowa, dm years ago last December, or three or four years ago, a few of us in Iowa got together at th&lt;? annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture and conceived the idea of forming an organ 1 zatioii such as we have there and such as you have here. We did not meet with a very favorable response, and at the first meeting that we </seg>

We bad our speakers, both local and outside men, and the interest hag increased ever since; and I think at our meeting in December last we had a majority of the ninety fairs of Iowa as active members of our association. Now, that is, what that association has accomplished it might be hard to say. We have taken up E project every year with the view of bringing it to the attention of niiniy fairs and making them more useful, both as places to inspect Ive stock and farm products and as an education institution. P'm in Iowa believe that the county fair should be an educator of the c, not only along the lines of live stork but of exhibits that the ing community are especially interested in. I presume you have all practically the same experience when you have introduced some novelty into your fair in the line of an exhibit of an educational nature, to see the interest that was manifested. Two years ago, in the fair of which I am secretary, after a good deal of trouble, we secured the car - cass of an animal that was affected with tuberculosis. We got a tent, and had that carcass on exhibition on the grounds, free to everybody. In Marshalltown, my home, we have a paper there that has a very large at Ion. which reaches over the interior of the state very fully. I was kept busy on the telephone that night up to 12 and 1 o'clock, by phy - sicians 100 to 150 miles from Marshalltown, asking me whether we had that animal on exhibition there, the carcass, or whether it was a fake. And the result was that the next day and the following days of the fair there were physicians there from practically all over the state of Iowa to see what we had on exhibition there. That matter was important enough in the eyes of the Wallaces' Farmer and other agricultural papers published in the state for them to take up, and they gave us a nice write - up on it. I feel that that benefited our fair very much. It put us prac - tically in the lead of other county fairs. And so I say I believe the Kly mission of the county fair is to educate the state, to educate the jple on new matters that should come up everv day. One thing that our association has brought about and put into gen - eral use, I might say, in the state of Iowa, is the stock judging contest for men and boys. I do not know the amount of money that is used every rear. In our fair we put up $60, and have two classes — boys under 18 years of age, and men and boys over 18 years of age. Professor Dins - more, who addressed the meeting here today, and I think he is at present the president of the Percheron Horse -association, formerly a professor in college, prepared the rules and regulations for that stock judging contest. We have had that now for two years in our fair, and in a great many fairs in Iowa, and it has created a great interest. It Is wonderful the number of men and especially of boys, fellows under 18 years of age, that will come there and pass on the stock. Tney are re - quired to judge horses, cattle, and hogs, two animals of each; and we have provided them with blanks for scoring them. They have to give </seg>
            <seg id="p169">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOABD OF AGRICULTTBE. HiO ond, (he other third, and so on. We divide the money into four prizes in each class; it inakts the prizes small; but it is not the amount of money they are looking after, as much as it is the knowledge that they acquire of stock judging. ■ither thing that we have put into the fairs in Iowa is an educa - exhibit. We had prepared a classification on a basis of $100 in ms; an educational exhibit which takes in both graded and coun - iooIs. Eie first year we got entries enough to pay out about $4© or $50. past year we have entries enough to pay out nearly $200. I feel money paid out for the educational exhibit is one of the greatest y makers that the fair has ever been interested In. We got the little folks worked up to bring something to the fair, and they are going to come there every day with the thought of seeing whether they are going to get the premium or not; and, when they come, as a general thing, their folks are with them; and I believe that one little thing where we were paying, as I say, nearly $200 this year has been the Ens of bringing through our gates enough to more than four times the amount of premiums that we are paying. P. as glad to hear one speaker here speak of the uniform classlflca f live stock. That matter was taken up by our association a year i December, and we have prepared and sent to every fair in the classification of all live stock exhibits. I am glad to Bay it has been practically put into effect. We did not make this as full as some of the larger fairs make it by dividing the age and offering a premium on an animal between twelve and eighteen months and six and twelve months. A good many small fairs divide all the year, and this classifi - cation or division was not of the year, but this brought the matter before the different fairs, so that now, if a man fits up a herd of cattle and shows it at the fairs, he knows he can go in Smith county and Jones county and Brown county and shows his stuff there, and the same animals that he has fitted for one will go right into all those fairs; he has got classes for all of them; and I believe it has been a wonderfully good thing in getting the breeders interested to show at the fairs. If every fair is going at random, some saying, "Here, we will give so much on this class of stock. We will give so much for a bull. The cow we don't care so much about;" and the other fair goes right the other way; they say, "We don't care so much about the bull, but we will gtre a big premium on the cow," the man that has the stock Is loth to fit It up and get it ready to show to those fairs; when, if he finds that he can start out and make a showing of three or four, or six, and finds prac tically the same classification all around, he is mighty liable to fit up a little stock to show in all classes. Therefore, by that means, you get a good line of stock. This year we are working along a little different line. I notice tonight that there are a good many members of your legislature here. The thought has occurred to me that it would be a good plan for the Iowa </seg>
            <seg id="p170">l"'l PBOCEEIMNG8 NEBRASKA 8TATK BOARD OF AGRKTI.Tl RE. Association to change the date of their meeting until such time as they could get to talk to the legislators. There is one thing in Iowa I am ashamed of: that is, the amount that that same state of Iowa is paying for their county fairs. The limit that any fair has received in Iowa today, in the state today, is $300. There are only three or four towns in the state that receive that amount. Inder the law as it is at the present time, the state pays 40 per cent of ihi first $500 of premiums paid, and 10 per ceni of the balance, with a limit of $300. I wrote your Mr. Smith with regard to that. I presented the matter at our association meeting in December. I find that, under your peculiar law here in Nebraska, you are paying out more money than we are. In Illinois, for Instance, the limit is $1,700 to any one fair. The law in the state of Wisconsin, which has more poor land in it than aska and Iowa put together, permitted the paying out in 1909 of between $92,000 and $93,000 in support of their county fairs. Ohio has a limit of $800, and an annual appropriation of $60,000, toward the sup - port of county fairs. While from the great state of Iowa we paid out the munificent sum of $20,000 last year; less than $83,000 in premiums paid in the state outside of the state fair; and then the state came down with $20,000. We are going to the legislature this winter, and we are going for them from the standpoint of the farmer, and ask them to treble the amount of the appropriation that they give us now. I don't know wl-at we are going to get out of it; but, if we don't get the money, we will make it hot for them at the next election. [Laughter.] I have been very much interested in the discussion of the papers that have been read here tonight. I feel that I have profited very much more from what I have heard here than I can benefit your people my anything I can sa&gt; I have a warm spot in my heart for Nebraska. The first year I crossed the Mississippi river I made a pilgrimage out into Frontier lounty, in what was ten years ago the little town of Moorefleld. I don't know whether it is on the map at the present time, or not. A member: Yes, it's still there. (1 r. Clark: I went up there and worked for a lumber company, and business for about the first thirty days that 1 was there was sitting i pile of lumber during the day, and sleeping in a sod house at night, i one eye open, to see that the homesteaders d'dn't steal that lumber, lighter. | When it got so that there was a prospect of building there. haul -d lumber across the country from Cambridge, which, as I re - lber, it was something like 40 miles up there, and I sold lumber then he rate of $40 a thousand for dimension stuff.

I suspect, when the rail t finally got in there, and we had to get down to something like a lable price for lumber, that the intelligent homesteaders there have been after my scalp.

RKI'ORT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS. lit nil'-m- n, and Members of the Fair Managers Association of Nebraska: Ee year ago this association was organized, following a call issued e president and secretary of the State Board of Agriculture to the lents and secretaries of the county fairs of Nebraska that they con at Lincoln during the time of holding the annual meeting of tbe Board of Agriculture to take under advisement the forming of a association of fair managers. This meeting proved a most interest - ■ssion. and was in all respects a strong endorsement or county fair irise, resulting in the organization of the association you now rep t at this, its second meeting. Prhe officers elected at the organization were: Q. W. Hervey of Doug - county, president; L. H. Cheney, Frontier county, vice-president, and H. Smith, Seward county, secretary-treasurer. A detailed report of the organization meeting, with copy of constitu - tion, object of organization and outline of work contemplated, member ship list, etc., was gotten out in pamphlet form by the secretary, and mailed to officers of all organized county, or district fairs, in the state with invitation to join the state association. They were sent out Febru ary 8. These were followed by a letter to the county superintendents of the public school, stating the organization of the state association, and asking their co-operation in the extension of the county fair work by furnishing names and addresses of officers of any fair association al - ready organized, and if no association organized in the county, then the names of persons who would be most likely to help organize one. A communication, entitled "Support Your County Fair," was mailed out to county fair officers in general, urging activity in county fair work, in the revival of organizations that have from any cause failed to main - tain a county fair, and the getting together of some active, enterprising citizens and organize where no fair has been held. The essential basis of organization was furnished with extracts of the state law governing tbe organization of county agricultural societies. Communications appealing to the county commissioners to aid the I'Oiinty fair by the county appropriation provided for by law were mailed out. These letters also directed the county agricultural societies how to </seg>

This is a feature that unties must take care of themselves. Two other general letters were written of which I have not now The Hill Board and many agricultural journals, besides state dailies and weeklies, were furnished lists of our fair dates, etc., by the secre- A great many letters of inquiry pertaining to the organization came to me personally, many of which I answered without referring them to the secretary, especially from fair advertising publications wanting an article furnished them on the organization, puriHwe and work or our assocla- Ethe Fair Journal of Chicago, the largest publication of this kind bed in the country, devoting all its space to fair history, fair and fair advertising, 1 gave a two column article for its June descriptive of our organization, its work and purposes.

Enerous letters of inquiry have been pouring into the secretary's from both old societies and those desiring to organize. It has I a general bureau of information on all matters of inquiry on fair interests. All things considered, the Nebraska county fairs have never been so well advertised and at practically no cost to the association. We have received several requests from other states for our plan of organization; furnished Kansas a copy of our organization report, constitution, etc., only last week. They are arranging to organize a state association this week. Toast master Hervey: Now, gentlemen, we are up to the turn in our program for general discussion, or any feature of the work pertaining to your interests or those of the County Fair Association. We hope that you will all feel that it is an experience meeting; and, if you have any questions to ask, or any questions which you wish to answer, we trust that you will be free in expressing yoursevles. This association has a good work before it; but you don't take hold of this work and push it the way that we think you should. You are all Interested in the county fair. You are all organised In the county fair. And you all — I need not say that you all have different </seg>

What will answer in a particular instance probably will not serve in noun- other part of the stale, or in some other county. But from a ■ 'immunity of interests such as we have here, there isn't any question but that this association can grow and develop and be of great educa - tional advantage to every county tair in the state of Nebraska; and 1 feel, gentlemen, that every fair, every organized fair, in the stale of .Nebraska should be a member of this association. If we join together and push this proposition, as we have heard here, and as Iowa is pushing theirs, there isn t any question at all as to the advantage you will be to yourselves in the community of interests, and the advantage you will be to yourselves in the matter of building up home industry and making in time all your features of agriculture and live stock grow. There isn t any question at all. Vou all realize now, that have had a county lair in your coumies tor two or three years, that there are better conditions in your neighLoihood than there were before the organizations were lorined; there isn t any question about that: Vou will see that more particularly, probably, in live slock. There are more men engaged in li\e stoct anu interested in live slock, and the men that have become txhibilois two or thiee years ago are exnibitors loday, and are stronger in that industry, ihey nave a stronger county tair center. ihe county tails 01 this slate are back ot the state fair. You wipe out the county lairs of Nebraska today, and the influence of the county lairs, and you have destroyed the slate fair — just practically destroyed it. Vou are titling up and backing the county fair, and we see it here in i he slate tair in every department of our work. I feel that this body of men here are responsible tor Ufe success ot the state fair; and 1 am satisfied that you all realize the important places you hold in the general state fair industry. Now, we would like to have you gentlemen start right in here and discuss this fair proposition from your own standpoint; ask questions on ihe topics that have been read and the discussion that has been made in a general way; and feel free to enter right into a real, old - fashioned experience metting. This is the way we are going to get our benefit and profit out of this association. A member: Mr. President, is there a secretary's report? Toastmaster Hervey: We have it; but that comes a little later. We would like to have this discussion. Mr. Hudge: Mr. Toastmaster, one of the gentlemen here touched on the pass proposition, with a suggestion which, I think, was a very good one, and which meets my approval, and which I found a very in - teresting subject when it was discussed at the National Association of State Fairs held in Chicago last December. I am not familiar with the county fairs as to what extent they have to use or do use a pass system. I want to say that, if you get in your mind that you cannot run a </seg>
            <seg id="p174">iiavt- got in the wrong road, and you ought to get out of it. Because I know, when 1 first went on the State Board of Agriculture, it was thought that you couldn't run a state fair without issuing several hundred or probably a thousand complimentary tickets; but, when the wave came across the country here, the anti-pass wave, we "got into the band wagon," and I want to say that the easiest way to run a fair U to do away with the pass system. It saves you one-half of your troubles and one-half of your worries, when you cut out the pass system: and, if you continue it in the county fair, it seems to me you will have the same trouble we used to have in the state fair. If you cut that out, you are better off, and you have half your troubles over with. I would suggest that you try . that. I heard a gentleman — I think Mr. Jackson, of Nelson — speak of that. He is on the right track, and he will iiiake a successful fair if he follows that line. I thank you. [Ap plause. j Toaatmaater llervey: l^i us hear an expression from others. Pretary Mellor: I would like to hear something from the County Associations that conducted an automobile publicity campaign, lertising campaign. There are several fairs here represented that likely did that; and 1 believe that that is one of the most effective islng schemes that a county fair can have. I would like to hear of the gentlemen discuss that topic. tToastmaster Hervey: That is a good suggestion. I know that there I a number of fairs in Nebraska that have conducted those automobile vertising excursions over the counties. Let us hear from some of (Calls for Mr. Wilson.; rr. Wilson: The boys think 1 ought to say something about that. We what we call a "boosting trip" a short time before our fair. We about in automobiles, and somewhere about 80 persons; and we made a round-up. We visited every town in our county, and some out side; and we found it a good thing. We started out in the morning and we traveled a little over 100 miles during the day. We were or - ganized for it. We had a party in charge. We took our band with us. We made the towns. We had advertised before. When we were up there we had a schedule made out, and we run just a little behind that schedule, so that we would not disappoint any people by getting in ahead of time. When we came to a town, we would go in in a body. We might run along, dropping some of them, who were lagging along to keep out of the dust going up, but, when we came up to a town, we went in in a body, and pulled up on the street, and the band stepped out and played a tune or two; and we had our spieler, who made his little talk. We had different fellows we sent, who had advertising matter. Bach one knew what he was to do, ana he did it during that time. Fifteen minutes were as much time as we put in in any town, excepting where we stopped for our dinners and suppers; and w« </seg>
            <seg id="p175">made the rounds, and covered about 125 mile*, I think, in one day. I forget how many towns we visited; I think it was about fifteen We found that we never did anything that gave us so much advertis injTj or so much publicity. It brought us before the people, not only of our own county, but of the counties immediately around us; and it was a good thing. We rather worked our automobile people, to start with. We got them to make a bed-rock price; in fact, they didn't charge us a great deal. I presume, another year, we will have to pay a little more for the machines. The payment of this, however, did not come, I understand, out of the fair money. We took the matter up in our Commercial Club and said, "You have to furnish us the money if you want to make a trip around and visit your patrons out over the county, and see the. people, and see what kind of a county they live in, and they wanted to go, a lot of them, and farmers came in. We could have run up some more automobiles, if we had known we were going to have so many people; and they paid for them them - selves; and they found it a good thing; and it didn't cost us the fare or anything, except that we took care of the band. Some of them were so glad to assist us that, at one place, Bruning, when we came in there we iound an elegant banquet aVaiting us and our money wasn't good for any purpose at any place in town. Mr. I. W. Haws: I would like to say that I am glad to see such a turnout here tonight, because I believe here is the place to receive a lot of useful knowledge. I want to say that I attended this meeting last year, the first one, and I got some ideas in the way of conducting county fairs that I know benefited us. We inaugurated an automobile advertis - ing trip. We went at it in a little different way from Mr. Wilson's plan. have been conducting a fair in our county for a number of years, and our receipts had been running along about $2,200, and had a few horse races, a few cattle, and some pumpkins; in fact, a good deal upon these same lines as the gentleman who has spoken on the subject of "County Fairs" outlined— the old time fair. We came to the conclu - sion — I did, at least — to be representative of our County Association, that we had to inaugurate some new plan, if we wanted to be successful in the county fair line. In order to do that, it occurred to me that we would have to "put more money in the game," so to express it; to get more enthusiasm worked up by our people. Those were propositions that we had to work out. Just how to do that we did not know; until we got together and worked one thing out; and then another would come along. Ee had been offering a thousand dollars for speed. We had found t&gt; impossible to get horses, or horsemen riding them; and It would tter to pay a little more; we were offering only a thousand dollars, said, "Uentlemen, you can't do it; you have to put more money In." it down and met Mr. Wilson, and we formed a circuit, and found eadily we hadn't been offering any money at all for race*. They </seg>
            <seg id="p176">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRHTLTt'RK. had been offering $2,000 and $3,000, and had been having races. Nelson was in the same position as Geneva; they have been working together, and got together for two or three years, and worked up a very successful race meet. In our part of the country the . inhabitants were composed largely of farmers, and some of them, in fact, said, "Cut out this alto gether. We don't want this business. This is a pumpkin show. This Is an agricultural county. We don't want horse races." After telling what I had heard at this meeting and other meetings, probably, done by county agricultural societies, and after outlining my views, they con - sented to let me go ahead and try it. So we offered this last year $2,250 in premiums. We thought that was going to make us go some, because that was quite an increase over what we had thought of giving. We went to work and formed a circuit, which was composed of Fillmore county, Nuikolls county, Webster county, and Kearney county, and we adop'ed practically the same speed list and the same per cents, with the exception of a few county lists got up for the wcrk of the business men. Our experience along the line of races was, more business; we had more entries last year, four times the entries we ever had before. We opened our races, and every class was filled; some with fourteen entries in and six or seven sUtrters. People were pleased, and went away satisfied. That demonstrated to us that, in order to make that part of the business successful, we had to put the money In. Now, then, I got ahead of my story. I want to tell you about this advertising proposition. I said to our Board of Managers, "We will call our people, the business men of the town, together. They are a little faint on the county fair proposition; they haven't done what they should have done." They called them together one evening there, and I outlined to them what we had been doing, and what I thought we could do, and I thought they ought to at least help us put on one of those races, pay for one race — or four or five races— I suggested. They wanted to know how much money that would take; I told them, and some of the people spoke up and suggested, "Well, now, here, let's have some entertainment down town nights. Let's have a carnival out of this thing. How much money will you take to give us an entertainment down town at night, in addition?" I said to them: "If you will give us $500, and give us the free use of the streets, give us absolute control of the streets, so that we may sell the concessions and get the money; and. If you contract with me, we will give you a night entertainment" They went to work and did It. The result was we put up a show down town there that was a corker. Mr. Jackson was over there, and the members of our circle, I think, will bear me out on that. In order to advertise the matter, however, I said to the people that night there, "We want to make an automobile campaign;" and in less than ten minutes I think we had something like twenty-five automobiles at our command, and without cost whatever to us. We started out taking four trips, taking four days, four dally drives, and traveled one hundred miles or mare every day. We made these with all the way from twelve to twenty- </seg>
            <seg id="p177">177 two or twenty -three automobiles. They were no two-person cars; they were all big cars. We had a colored quartette with us that sang In every town we went into. It was our advertising car that took the lead. That advertising car took something like ten to fifteen thousand pieces of advertising matter; and, while we were entertaining the people and visit - ing amongst the people in the town, our advertising car was billing the town. 1 remember going into Shelton. Shelton is a little out of our territory, if you will look at the map; but, to show you how the people took to the scheme, I will tell you this: While our car was advertising, I was walking up and down the street there, and I heard the remark frequently, "Those fellows are on their Job," and "They know how to advertise." The Shelton paper came out the next week and gave us a little boost. And the result was that the people came to the show, and lots of them tame over and saw it, and our receipts were considerably in, i.-ased. From a few hundred dollars, the usual amount, we took in *4,soo on that occasion; it was one of the best shows in that part of the country for a long time; never hau a better show; and our business men now stand ready to give us $5,000 to put in these night entertain - menu down town next year. I know some of the people here have had experience in night enter tainments that have not been successful. I think that is on account of not being handled by the same organization. I think, if they had night entertainments along with the fair, it would be a good thing; but the Fair Association should have absolute control of it where it works in so many. We used the entertainment on the grounds in the daytime, and used it down town at night, and it did it in nice shape. I thank you. [ Applause.] Toutmaster Uervey: Is there any other gentleman who wishes to speak on this topic, or any other? (.Calls for Mr. Gustafson.) Mr. Gustafson: After these experienced men have spoken, I would like to give our experience down in Saunders county. There Is one thing that this gentleman from Iowa has touched on, and that is the children's part in the fair. Last spring we decided to put aside $150 for children under 15 years of age to exhibit agricultural products; and we found it a great success. As the gentleman has said, the children would come there with exhibits, and would bring their folks, also, there, and it was a good idea; everybody thought it was good; and I think we shall continue that. Later on in the season we conceived the idea of saving the farmers any need of using money for races and we went to the Commercial Club of Wahoo, and the men of the club put up the money for the races entirely, and they responded liberally, and we had a nice race program, all paid for by the Commercial Club of Wahoo. Then we conceived the idea of the automobile advertising scheme, and we got about fifteen cars, and each car carried four or five men; each man paid $2 for riding in a car; and we went to every town In the </seg>

We were a committee of one, every one to boost the fair. We didn't make any spieling; we went around personally and saw every business man and a lot of farmers, Kent over to the adjoining farms with them, came in every town, got the boys out boosting for a good time with our people. It takes three days to make the county. It was one of the best advertising stunts pulled off in our county; and we had the promise of the best at - tendance that the county ever had. But we made one mistake; we didn't consult the weather man, and he put us out of business. [Laughter and applause.] Tiiastniast'-! Hervey: This is your meeting. Now, gentlemen, let's hear from you. ■ relary Mellor: I would like to hear a gentleman speak who has on fairs in a great many states during the past six months or months; and that gentleman is pretty well known to all of you. ■ to Mr. Frank Odell.

I am especially glad to see indicated here the sentiment universally that the fair should be primarily an educational institution; that it should bear in mind the development of young exhibitors; that it should aim to get expert exhibitors and expert judges; and that, above all things, the county fair should be the training school for and the sus - taining influence bebind the state fair; and I believe, when you get to this i&gt;oint, you are getting toward the thing that makes success. I am just home from a six months' trip to the state fairs and farmers' Institutes over the south and southwest. In the past few years in which I have been engaged in fair work, it has been my privilege to visit all of th&lt; late state fairs in the western and southwestern sections of tn &gt; country. I want to tell you I am glad to get home to Nebraska. I am glad to look in this assemblage of my fellow citizens, and to say to you thai in many respects you represent the greatest agricultural state In the 1'nion; and beyond any question you represent the greatest agricultural fair that there is in the United States of America. [Applause.] I say that with all deference to, and without any apologies to, our honored visitor from Iowa, whose state fair I had the privilege of serving last Somehow, I felt kind of sorry for Iowa when I was there at Des Moines, Mr. iiervey, as I saw that magnificent agricultural building and its contents; for I saw we might have a duplicate of it on our grounds yonder. Instead of being filled with a splendid agricultural exhibit such as it called for, I saw it filled with lemonade stands and jewelry con cessions, and things of that sort, which never should have been in ther* Theie should have been In there a magnificent exhibit of the agriculture' products of the state of Iowa. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">I came home the next year, and I wandered around the same home grounds, and saw that ramshackle old building out yonder that we call Agricultural Hall; but it seemed to me it never looked as good as It did last September with the finest exhibit that Nebraska ever put up. I went down to Texas, with her equipment of $2,000,000 on her fair grounds, and her paid attendance, if you please, of over a million peopl* which passed through her gates in sixteen days, an average of over 0,000 paid attendance there every day for the sixteen days. In the great tate of Texas, at Dallas, I declare to you, as a matter of fact, without any question, that you located in this state of ours will bring down to he state fair and show here, next year, as they showed last year, a better howing for all her products, and almost as large an exhibit in quantity nd as fine an exhibit in quality as I saw at the great fair at Dallas, Texas. tl am glad to get back to you again. I am glad to live in an at - iphere of that sort. I am glad to know that we have that kind of pie. And I am glad to see this organization that is going to make for us, and to teach our honored members of the legislature that it is a great educational influence here which makes more for the uplift of our people, for the information of our people, for the prosperity of our people, than any one other educational influence that is contained in that short space of time. We will teach them that they ought to support the state fair, the state agriculture, and these exhibits that all work for the good and the prosperity of our people. We should act in no "penny-wise pound-foolish" way. We are growing. We are not as far advanced as we ought to be on some lines in Nebraska. When I was going down to Kentucky, down to the corn show in the Cumberland mountains, I found that a twelve-year-old boy down there could produce more corn on an acre of ground in Kentucky, than they could in Nebraska. I saw there a boy's corn from Pulaski county, in the mountains, where a twelve-year-old boy came in there with a yield of 124 bushels on the acre. The same amount of ground ten years ago wasn't producing but 56 bushels of corn. Those boys in Kentucky are getting busy. I want to say to you, in building up county fairs In the future, don't forget the boys. Don't forget the boya! Wherew you get the boys busy, you are going to accomplish something for tbr future. As you enter those farmers' institutes in Kentucky, wherevt they had the boys' contest, the whole family came — the father, mother and children; and they have plenty of them; they have Roosevelt ian families down there in those mountains, I tell you; and they pack those great houses jamb full [ laughter |, and that means something for them In the future. We ought to hold prayer meeting all over this country, we people that are interested in this agricultural movement— we ought lo pray that the Lord will get those fellows, at least, that are in a rut, to advance. Wo ought lo hold prayer meetings that the I&lt;ord will g&lt;&gt;&lt; lid uf the bunch of old-fashioned, slow-going individuals that are in thj </seg>

I want to assist in the Interest of the Nebraska State Bee Keepers, to have you acquaint your - selves with Kentucky methods and dealings; and it Is you men who can work for your fair and make It one of the finest agricultural fairs that I believe there is in the I'nlon. I thank you. f Applause] PWr. Dort: Judging from your sunburnt countenances, we all belong he same gang. When I heard our eloquent friend here reciting what claimed to be and what has been reported to be. for a number of months i.a«t. the greatest corn yield per acre of any state In the Union, I took It as a challenge. TTe knew what he was talking about at the time, but he hasn't heard the latest returns. The latest returns are Nebraska ahead yet, and Pawnee county Is the champion county of the world In corn produced per acre! John Harold. In this year, and last yemr. 1910, raised 138 bushels and forty pounds of yellow dent corn on one acre of ground! T was glad to hear the eloquent address and to know the inspiration that this man has received In visiting the (treat fairs of this country; but T want to say to you. In advertising for county fairs, that T have been closely Identified with the work year after year past, a number of years; and T say as one man has spoken before that. If you reach the children, the boys, and pet them enthused. In - spiring them with a desire to excel, make it an educational Institution first, and those children will rearh the hearts of the mother, and the mother will reach the old man, and you will have them taking an Interest in the county fair, and the children will lead. The children are the ones, as has been said, whom we must depend upon; It is the young, growing boys of the day; you must reach them; you must en - courage them. The best money ever Invested In a Pawnee county fatr to bring about a showing and to interest the people, was a little ex hibit that was taken by the boys at one time. There Is another way: l^t your grounds be nicely located, kept clean and up-to-date. I am not going to say it boastfully, but I believe Pawnee county has the </seg>
            <seg id="p181">PROTEEHINUS NKHRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRKTI.TI RK. 1S1 Cit to a certain extent, at any rate, and I believe It is the nicest ted ground in the state of Nebraska. That Is the verdict given by every Chautauqua manager that has ever occupied this ground in the last four or live years. It is located high; it drains in every direction; it is watered by a splendid system of water: it is lighted by electricity. We don't have a splendid amphitheater. About our other buildings I have nothing to say in speaking of them: they are poor and dilapidated. We have a splendid little park grovo, and we are nicely located in that respect. It is near enough to town to drive out if you wish to drive; or you can walk, if you desire. So I say, with reference to the fair, offer them premiums and make it an educational Institution. Get such amusements as will be clean, and always keep your grounds clean and free of shell games, and keep without the buildings and the grounds the persons that come to get your money and the money of your children, and give nothing In return. It is a bad lesson for the boy to learn when he conies to think he is going to get something for nothing in his early years: it cannot be done. Our experience is a slow, progressive one. Another way: I^et your county be known by such men as you find are the county fair workers, and are known by their exhibits. There is Colonel Leonard, who is always ready and willing, not only to work, but to use his premium for different things for which he was selected, and has done that in years past in all of our farmers' meet- Ings and farmers' institutes. Another such man is Mr. Scott, whose Shorthorns are as well known as used to be his Poland-Chinas. And those men that are well known have built up a name and-a reputation and a standing in our county fair, and have all helped us in the past. One more word wtth reference to the corn produce: John Harold is ■who lives in the northwest part of Pawnee county; he raised d, and is here in Lincoln today, and has been attending your ow. I say, once again, all glory and honor to the grand old Nebraska. I wish I might be able to say something that would ) interest In the agricultural, horticultural, and stock industries state through the county fair. [Applause.] Mr. Dusenberry: I am pleased with Doctor Dort's speech. I heard of another man from Pawnee county saying today that he cut 125 tons of hay on their farm last year; and I thought to myself, "Why don't you let the grass grow?" [Laughter.] Mr. Dort: I would like to say that we organized an automobile boosting trip in our county last fall. In fact, our secretary is such an energetic, enterprising man, that he had pretty nearly exhausted the publicity schemes that had been in vogue generally; but we made one feature on that trip that has not been mentioned, I think, tonight, and that was that we advertised our fair among the school children. We have always made it a point in our county to make the first real day of the fair children's day. Last fall we drew about sixty-five children to the fair from our couuty; because we all are aware that most </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 tlren are tied to their mothers' apron strings, and the result was mothers came, and, as Brother Dort said, the fathers came. We to the schoolhougfs last fall in every town in the county, and d the scholars out, with the permission of the board. Our band d tunes for their amusement. We invited the school boards to iss the schools one day of the fair, and the country schools in county were dismissed on the first day of the fair; and the result that It created a great interest among the children. Secretary Mellor: Every school but one. Mr. Dusenberry : Every school but one, our secretary gays, in the county; and that means a whole lot to us. Every time, every year the schools' day, our children's day, is thr day of the fair. Mr. !&lt;awson: Mr. President, you have all heard a good many fish stories, like this automobile advertising and other similar advertising I want to tell the latest story about fish. If you want to reach your schools and your children, get your premium lists out early before the schools close in the spring meeting. Get the men of experience interested enough to distribute those to the teachers and schools, and make special premiums there for thrse children. Give them an opportunity to prepare for the county fair, and you will get them interested that way, as Merrick county has done, and made our fair a success. E: Clark, of Iowa: There is one thing that the agricultural men of on the retiring board do: After each fair they prepare for another and they appoint a superintendent of the educational department, nt a man who is actively connected with the schools and who com s work when the schools open in the fall. A member: That is the "latest story." Toast master Hervey: Let us hear from others. Mr. Wilson: I would like to say r. word: Mr. Jackson, in one of the iwpers, Bpoke about the attraction proposition and some of the difficulties with our attractions. Perhaps you may run up against the same propo - sition. In looking for our attractions we dealt with the houses who furnish them. We got our attractions through a house. We made our contract through our circuit. They held us up for a cool hundred dollars. They were grafting upon us and upon the attractions we pro - cured. When the attractions came to show, we got together and found out a graft was in it, and we refused to pay it. They came down and found out that we knew all about it; and the attractions went on at what they should have been, with the graft cut out. But that was partly because of the fact that in our organization we were a little late in getting organized. We had to get « hat we could, and it was arranged at long distance over the telephone; and that probably won't happen again. I would like to &gt;ay u|K&gt;n the subject of the children, I know my ex - perience has been along the lines that the gentlemen who have talked </seg>
            <seg id="p183">- who has a hog, or a row or a ealf, or something, to show there, if I can get one of those children to enter it in his name and bring it there, we have an exhibitor there. And it is not for that year alone, but for the next year, and for succeeding years. If an old man brings it in, he probably exhibits it that year, and his enthusiasm is worn out. [Laughter.) If the boys or if the girls bring something in, they come back the next year; they are young, and they are more hopeful; they have more enthusiasm; and they come back year after year. Not only that but they talk with their neighbor's children, and each year the cir - cuit grows larger; it Is like an ascending spiral, each year growing larger and larger, and it grows out. That has been our experience, and I believe the thing to do is to teach the children. I have been especially interested in this talk, especially the talk of our friend from Iowa, as to how to get the children. I think that is a good scheme. I would like to have one of their premium lists, to see how they do It. Toastmaster Hervey: Gentlemen, this member, Mr. Jackson, will sjxak. We will hear him. Mr. Jackson: I was going to say how we can get in touch with the children. We have our teachers or superintendent of schools at the leathers' institutes, Just before school starts, send me the names of a number of children in their district under fifteen years of age; and just the week before the fair I send every child in the county a ticket, and I have every child in the county talking about the N'uckolls county fair. 1 send them to the teachers, and have them distribute them. I,ast year we had every school in the county, except Superior, I believe, turned loose, and we had about 6,000 school children; and, if you can get all the children in the county talking about any one thing, the people are going to come. Toast master Hervey: Gentlemen, I want to read a few recommenda - tions here, not because they will be of any advantage now, but Just to show how near we are all thinking alike on these propositions. RECOMM ENDATIONS. I would recommend the adoption of the non-pass system for all county fairs, issue no complimentary passes and issue no passes of any kind except in exchange for services rendered. The local press, publications in your county and possibly adjoining counties should be liberally com pensated for their advertising. The usual courtesy extended to the fair managers of other county fairs, in your part of the state, is an advan - tage, and should be cultivated and some form of guest's ticket should be provided to cover all such admissions. Try to visit as may fairs each season as you can, you will find it of great interest, and you will be profited, often where you least expect it. Draw the free admission line so closely that every person on your fair grounds will feel that he has something invested in your enterprise, unless he is in the list of invited </seg>

Kuld also recommend some form of district school contests to be I on the fair grounds, this to be worked out and provided for by nty superintendent and board of fair managers. 1 would also recommend a Grand Army or Old Soldiers' day, if for no other reason than the sentiment it conveys. I would recommend the enlisting of the attention of the boy and girl who is large enough to do things, to become personally interested in the fair as an exhibitor in some of the departments. Kould recommend special divisions or departments in certain classes designated Boys' Department and Girls' Department, where boys rls between certain ages are eligible to compete. Farm products, ilture and mechanical arts for the boys, and textile fabrics, fine read and cake, preserved fruits, etc., for the girls, thus encourage ir spirit to be taken by the coming man and woman while they t susceptible of impressions that may be of great influence in ; them to choose for life. 1 believe the township or precinct collective exhibit to be the most successful plan and offers greater incentive to exhibition contest than the single article classification alone. Have a precinct superintendent elected or appointed for each precinct in the county, who will look after the exhibitors of his precinct and arrange for the collection of the articles to be exhibited. These separate displays add variety to the derailments and create a friendly local competitive interest that can not I,, had by any other plan of contest. G. W. HBRVEY, President. Tosat master Hervey: I want you gentlemen to go right along with this discussion. I wanted to get this in before you covered the whole proportion. (Laughter. | .lust go right along with the discussion. Here is where we get the benefit. Here is where we get the experience feature of these meetings. There isn't any question but that we are on the right course and the right proposition. We haven't very much in our program yet; we have the business meeting, which may mean much or little; the report of the secretary and treasurer and election of officers. But I know there are men here who want to say something on some of these questions whom we would be only too glad to hear. Mr. Clark, of Iowa: One thing I meant to speak of I would like to mention now: The Iowa boards have taken up this in a quiet way, the </seg>
            <seg id="p185">185 fairs. This year there was sent out to every member, every fair that is a member of our association, a list of every concession man that went away last year without paying his bills, and, if possible, have those men shut out of all the fairs. If a man comes to me and says, "I want a concession from you; I want the privilege of running a lunch stand or towel rack," or whatever it might be. If I find his name on the black - list, I simply tell him he can't get into our fair until he has paid up his account for last year, or the year before, or whatever it was. I believe it can help us out a whole lot in that way. I would like to hear from you gentlemen, from Mr. Wilson, I think it was, if I remember the name right, about the attraction house that they secured their attrac - tion from, that was running a skin game on them. Mr. Wilson: 1 believe we should talk about these things and know them. If there is a dead beat or tramp trying to beat somebody in the state, you want to know it, and I want to know it now. I came over here to learn something. It was the i-ang House, of Chicago; that is all I can remember of the name; the I -an*; Vaudeville Exchange, I think Mr. Clark: That is what is important to you, to look out for those Sit master Hervey: That is a very good suggestion. I think it come of interstate interest to each other. Iowa Is organized on le basis. Missouri will very soon. I think it may just as well led into an interstate interest as a state interest. Has any other you got anything? Mr. Clark: Another word in regard to the concessions. I would like to know if there is any of the Nebraska men that are playing the merry-go-rounds on a percentage? A member: In Dawson county we have got a concession in the way of eating stands, peanut stands, cakes, and things of that kind, giving concessions on a percentage basis. With the carnival companies and wild west shows, and all of those, we have had from 25 down to as low as 10 per cent of their total receipts for our percentage. Mr. Clark: Regarding this matter of paying on a percentage, when one of our county fairs was started, five years ago, you all probably have had the same experience — one of the concession men wanted to come to the county fair, and didn't know what they were going to do on the merry-go-round; couldn't get an offer of more than about $50 or $64 for the right. We thought that was not what It was worth. We made It on a per cent. Now, we are getting 25 per cent on the first $800, and 40 per cent on all over. In 1909 and 1910 the merry-go-rouna per cent reached very close to $275, only a few cents from it either way. I apprehend that there aren't many people that have figured to know the money there is in the merry-go-round. I am sure, if you will put the merry-go-round contract on a per cent, you will double the profits that you making; and you will get your money. 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p186">Mr. Walsh: I rise to pass just a remark or two. I do not think I would be doing my duty to the state and to the agricultural interests of the state if I did not pass a remark or two as to how to induce the children to become experts. I presume I am the oldest fair man in this house. Thirty-six years ago I was elected president of the agricultural society in Douglas county, and I have been a member since. Much has been said about the children. I suggest that each man would enlist the services of an expert fair man who knows how to harvest grain, how to grow it, how to grow corn, and, when grown, how to harvest it, how to select it, how to take care of it and how to exhibit M to the different counties. It is all right to enthuse the children. You have to start with the children, if you ever get the success that you ought to have in this state. W. have two noted experts in the matter of harvesting grain at the right season of the year, and how to take care of it when harvesting it. how to have it of proper colar, and how to show it. That is also nut- about grasses. One of these experts lives in Saline county; one of them lives in Washington county. I think if this body of men would solicit and petition the railroads in the state of Nebraska, that auch ex - pert be put upon the pay-rolls for at least two months in the year, to visit the different counties and go and talk to the children, and tell them how to go out into the oats with them with a jac knife and cut an inch or two of small bunches of grain, and tell them to take It home and keep it in a dry place and cure it, and present it at the county fair, in the name of the boys and girls, I think that would be an educa tional advantage to the state of Nebraska that has been entirely over looked The growing of grain, and the harvesting of the same, and presenting that grain properly bundled, properly colored, and properly tied together, is not learned in a day, and those that know the art of doing so are very slow to tell their neighboring counties and their neighboring &lt; oiiipeiitors in the different counties how it is done. I am inclined to think that the sooner the children throughout the different districts of the state of Nebraska are taught that from a professional who knows how, you will find that the grain and grasses which were brought in and put up at your different county fairs, that came from your region, would help in the right direction. Further, I want to state that, from my experience of thirty-six years. I had the honor to take charge of the Nebraska state exhibit at St. lx)uis. and I made a splendid selection in my assistant from Saline county, who did more work in shorter time than any two men I ever employed. It isn't necessary to state who he is. I want to say to you, sir, that every man should dabble in politics in their respective coun - ties, and get close to their board of county commissioners. It is within the provisions of the law, and within the province of the different boards of county commissioners, to make an appropriation yearly to cover the </seg>
            <seg id="p187">187 Into an agricultural county and as an active body of men selected in the county to manage a county fair, that, if they figure annually what to spend in the matter of advertising, in the matter of covering the increase in the value of land in the county, that every man who owns ISO acres of land in any county of the state, if he paid $25, if he gave $.',o a year, to elect an active agricultural board that would see to it that exhibits were properly gathered, properly exhibited, and properly advertised, would receive a benefit that he could never receive other- It to a well known fact that the advertising train that left Nebraska in 1891 throughout the East did more to advertise the resources of Ni-liaska than did any other enterprise that Nebraska ever took hold of. And the county that is behind in the matter of advertising Its agricultural resources loses what cannot be figured in thousands, nor hundreds of thousands, annually, tin 1 increase in the value of its land, because Nebraska by nature is one of the best agricultural states in the I'nion. There is no state In the Union that carries such a mis cellaneous crop and carries It so well as the state of Nebraska. I am very pleased to see the Iowa gentleman here. If you had the same experts in the state of Iowa that we have in Nebraska, you could beat the world; but you don't pick up those men every day, and you can't do it, and you are forty years behind the times. [Laughter and a:&gt;plause. | You are forty years behind the times in the matter of putting before the world at large information as to the agricultural resource*. You are losing the best men that you ever had in the state who are wandering avay after a will-o'-the-wisp in Canada and in the lands in the Northwest. You are losing them. And you lose them because you haven't brought before those men the nature of' the land that should r be exhausted; and you can't find anywhere In the United Stater &lt;iwr two or three states that will grow corn. You can increase i h&gt; growing of small grain all over the world, even in Alaska; but, out fide of the corn belt, you tan't enlarge it. [Applause..] S Clark: There are a few things about Iowa that we are ashamed aughter. | One thing is the lack of publicity that the people of re guilty of. Another one might be the meager salaries we are our professors in the agricultural college. As the gentleman says, F them are flitting away to greener fields, where there is more in sight. Biiembf i : I would like to hear from this expert on the curing of in Nebraska — this expert from Saline you mentioned in the last . I have a kind of an idea that it is Mr. James whom he means, call for Mr. James. Mr. Walsh: Do you ask me to say who he was? A member: No, sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">(Call! for Mr. James.) Mr. lames: It is a little too late to go into it in detail. A member: Give us the main, general outline. Mr. James: I will give you a little outline along that line. What do you wish me to take up? A member: Oh, grains and grasses in general. Give us a general outline. We will give you all the time you want. Go ahead. Mr. James: Well, take up, for instance, grasses. In the first place, with all grasses, you want to cut them pretty well matured; before you &lt; ut it, it should be pretty well matured. In other words, it will be nice and green before it Is quite matured. When you come to dry It, it shrivels up and loses its looks; it doesn't carry out its looks. So you want to wait until it gets well matured and still keeps its color. For instance, with clover, you want to take them when some of the seed heads begin to turn brown in the middle, and the foliage Is green, and want to take and cut it; don't leave it in the sun; take it and cut off the small bunches, and carry it to a loft or barn, in a dark place. You dont «ant even the light; that will fade the flower, the light will. Tie it in bunches, and hang it in that way. Plfalfa Is a more difficult thing to cure. For instance, you can cut the same way as you do clover, and hang it in a dark place wltt down, in small bunches. Another way: You take the clovers and alfalfa, and then you tie them in large bunches, like that | illustrating] ; *nd you lay them down in the loft in good condition, as they even «crow on the side that lies on the floor. You take a long string, cut your t.um h. carry It to the loft, in a dark room, and take the bunch, and h out the string, take up a little bunch of it and it has a whole lot in it. and tie One knot, draw It up close to the end where you &lt;ut it off; cut another one and tie one more knot there. When you get through, you have a long, fan-shaped piece of alfalfa; and then hang it right up in the loft, and let it cure. If it is a dry time, you couldn't ii ; you have to leave it in the loft, until there comes a damp, moist day; or, if you don't have the conditions, when the time comes that fou need to pack this away, you can go up there again some dry day, in the evening, and you can take a sprayer of oil and a can of water, m the evening, after sunset, and no wet at all; and can throw the oil and water on the sides and on the roof, not on the samples that you have got, but to dampen the whole loft or the building that you have got this :n; and that moisture through the night will evaporate in such ■ way that in the morning your alfalfa is nice and pliable, and It will not hurt the color. Then you can take it down, and pack It away ready for use, or prepare it in any shape you want. for instance, corn. Our state fair here comes in the early part of the year, which does not give our corn justice. For instance: In the ■rat place, your corn that you plant that you want to make an exhibit </seg>

Fi ground; plant It early, and guard for a while, and keep watching and before the fair — we will say about five or six or seven days — you n go out and go through the field, and the proper way to do Is to take a newspaper; just get the dally newspapers and cut them up In squares that will Just go around an ear of corn, and you can tem - porarily have a little box of little fine rubbers, or a ball of twine, any ordinary wrapping twine, and go through the field. If you go down across, you go on one side of it, or -where you can get at this corn, and tramp through the field, and you have your measure. They have a cer - tain length of ears that you want to comply with. You take the ear and shuck that corn down: shuck It down; if the ear looks well and good to you, you take the stalk and measure It, and find a certain length of ear. Tou want to have It a little bit longer than your measure. Tou take the husks and pull them down; don't break them off: Just husk them down: then take the piece of paper, like this, a paper a little longer than the end of that ear of corn. Tou simply put it around the ear, like that f Illustrating, and tie one string around It, or slip a rubber over, like that. Ordinarly, that will be a roasting ear. Can't tell whether it is white or yellow. That is to protect it from the sun, protect It from the rain, or anything that might mar it. and yet It gives the foliage through the end here. Tou don't want to tie it. over the top. In two or three days the roasting ear when you first shuck It down, will begin to tint rleht up; It dries over the spot, and It will begin to tint up and color up. whether It Is white or yellow. And leave It In such a way like that, let it stand right on the stalk; and then your ear is selected .for the fair, and you have got that all ready, so that any ordinary man, or any farm hand, or any hand could go through that field at the time that he needs to go to the fair and simply break those off. A member: Have you a grade? Etfr. James • Tou can take those other grades, and just arrange on the e line. Tou can simply break that ear off with the paper. Get a king knife, and Just break it off from the stalk; lay It on this grass, and pack it up and leave it that way, till you 50 to the fair. It will not shrivel up. The same thing with the leaf and ear that stand on the body, when you get to go to the fair, five days after that, and you go to work and shuck that ear and show its style for a roasting ear, and it is Impossible to tell whether It is a white ear or a yellow ear, unless you know. Now, I might go ahead and take up any other part of this work. There's no end to it. I could keep you here half the night. [Cries of "Go on." Calls for "Wheat and oats. Go on. That is good enough.") Mr. James: If there is anything else, I might say, your timothies in rutting them for the show, ordinarily, when it looks the prettiest and nicest, is when It Is tassled, or the bloom or the head Just begins </seg>

After the pollen has dropped off Is the proper time, so that you have a nice, smooth head or a nice foliage; you can cut them off and cure them in the same way. With all grasses and clovers you do not want to let them lay out in the sun, because the sun will fade them. Even light will fade them. After they are prepared in sheaves. you can pack them away for exhibit purposes. A member: How do you sheaf the wheat? Mr. James: Your wheat? You have to take your jack knife; some body said something or other about a jack knife; that isn't right; I usually take a btg, old butcher knife; you go down into your field, and you have to cut these off, and tie them up in bundles. Of course, it is Impossible for as to go into the field where you have the best head and beat block of corn; sometimes a field will vary a little; sometimes there will be some down in the low ground that will be thicker and taller and look wonderfully big, yet it hasn't got the qualities of value in it that some has that is a little smaller. You have to take into consideration the grain more than anything else, because that is the value of the wheat; the straw isn't of very much value. Then you get this in the same way. You can cut it. You don't have to tie it up in small bundles, because at the time it is being cut, it ought not to be dead ripe, so that the straw loses its life and color. No, it ought not to be cut green; that is certain; it ought to be cut so that, when you strip the straws off, the husks off, or the leaves, your straw has a nice, bright, lively look or appearance. You can tie these in bunches, and hang them also with heads down. Your straw, when you come to prepare your sheaves, will be all straight, and your heads will be all nice, uniform shape for delivering. Oats, you ought to cut them a little bit greener than you would your wheat; because it makes a nice, clean, green color, and hey make a good deal better appearance in the show; and it isn't so much the question of the value of it to cut it a little greener than you would wheat. Another thing we have been doing that is wrong during state fair. and that is, the exhibitors have been coming to the state fair with their millets, their corn, and their grains, of all these varieties, and a great many "bf them have been having fine samples, and they simply bring them down there and strip the foliage all off from them, leaving nothing but bare stalks, even with millets, too; and they put them up in display; and, when we have good expert judges that know the value of this foliage or forage, and a good many of the exhibitors don't get any prizes on them, they don't understand why. We ought to get that into our premium list that individual samples of forage should retain their Now, if there is anything that anybody wants to know in particular, </seg>

I used to be a professional man before I got to be a hayseed, and I don't know as we ought to ask or even request Mr. James to tell the secrets of his pro - fession to us without compensation; and I for one would not like to Toastmaster Hervey: Well, the man has already declared the secret!

Your humble servant is a strong champion in the line of preparing agricultural ex - hibits, because I started back in 1895, and became very successful the very first year I started out at preparing these grains and corn sheaf, to have them look nice, and won practically all the premiums that year at the county fair, taking a large share from your state fair that was held at Omaha at that time; my worthy colleague from Douglas county who has preceded me a short time ago being associated with me in the </seg>

A motion was passed that I write a paper, which should be published in all the agricultural and dally papers for the benefit of the exhibitors of our county. The fact of the case m that the next year I didn't get any premiums; and the fact of the case Is, unless you extend some compensation to Hr. James, he will be in the same boat if his paper is published in the annual report of the tie Board of Agriculture; and I do not think you ought to have him it gratis. Toast master Hervey: It seems apparent here that there are quite a number of experts in the audience [laughter] on this sheaf propo - sition. 1 am in favor ot drawing just as much information out of these fellows as possible without paying for it. 1 Laughter. J If it isn't asking loo much, I would request these gentlemen who have taken his thought, to give us a little piece of information in regard to the preparation of sheaf stuff for exhibition. Mr. Urau: It was not my intention to make any remarks in order to bring out the experience that I have had along the line of preparing sheaf stuff. With all due respect to the remarks that have been made in regard to the experts of this state, Douglas county will not have to take a back seat with any state in the union, when it comes to getting experts to prepare sheaf stuff for exhibition purposes; and I can support that by citing men that have attended the fairs in Douglas county, and also the exhibits that have been shown at your state fair, as bearing out the assertion that 1 make. 1 have contended that the success of Ne - braska, the advanced values of farm lands in Nebraska, since the year ls»b, when the Trans-Mississippi exhibition was held at Omaha, are largely due to the men that were advanced at that time in the prepara - tion of sheaf stuffs that were shown at first at the Trans-Mississippi Ex - posilon; next at the Greater America Exposition; and following up those, the expositions at St. Louis and at Portland Oregon. Your humble sen sill had the privilege at that time of securing all the sheaf stuff that it was possible to secure from Douglas county; and Douglas county surely had an enormous lot of stuff to prepare and pick from at that time. We had just the largest exhibit in five years off the bottoms of the 1'ai pio, that rich black soil, after it had been dressed into a sheaf, and sent it to St. Louis, and they wouldn't believe but that it had come from Oregon. Now, the way that we went about to prepare those sheafs. it is no use to go over the ground that Mr. James has gone over. He has worked it all right, as far as he went; but he didn't tell you how to bleach it. I think Mr. James overlooked that part. His method of curing grass is correct. But you must remember here, when you cut grains, cut your wheat, to be careful not to let any dew in, or tie them together so close that they will form any moisture of their own. You must tie them together in these little small bunches, as he has outlined, in fan shape, and hank it up where the air will circulate. Then, </seg>
            <seg id="p193">ret the sun bleach It and you will get the whitest white you have seen. There Is where you get the white; It will bleach them. He told you how to cut It. That Is proper. You must remember about bleaching it; the whole success lies in the bleaching process, though you want to keep the color, or though you want to take the color out and get It white. It must be a little green when you cut It, In order to get the whitest strain possible for exhibition purposes. I believe that !■ all I will Ray, as someone else wishes to talk. Mr. Dusenberry: That sounds like the letters we used to get about the St. Louis exhibits from the secretaries. Mr. Orau: T have to give Douglas county the credit — all the credit. Douglas county produced a greater per cent; In fact, your humble servant himself delivered eighty-six bunches of different grains that were grown In that county, that were cut with the knife. It all went to the state commission. It was not known as Douglas county; when It came to St. Louis, It was known as the state of Nebraska, wasn't It? And the state of Nebraska got the credit for providing all the articles that were shown at St. Louis, because they were known as the state and not as the county exhibits. But that was not the Idea, to simply bring out one county, but the Idea was to bring out the resources of the entire state; and It was by those methods that the prices of land that exist today were brought about; and I think that the statistics will bear me out In that assertion, that those exhibits have been very Instru mental in bringing about the prices of lands that exist today. Because they showed to the people of different parts of the world Just exactly what Nebraska could do. I never was any more thoroughly convinced of the value of Nebraska until I made a trip, one of those trips to the southern states, which have been so thoroughly advertised, regarding the great resources of their agricultural land; and there never has been a greater humbug perpetrated on the general public than those publica - tions that are sent out from this southern country, and especially the southern part of Missouri. There is good land In this state, but yon can - not Imagine what kind of soil and what kind of formation they have down there until you compare it with the soil we have in this state. It looks foolish for a man to spend his money for the benefit of the railroads to make a trip to go and look at that land, when we hare such good land In Nebraska; but I believe it Is money well spent; be - cause, after you have seen It, you will go home and feel that you are In the best place on earth, and will put forth such efforts that you will have the largest success you have ever obtained before. Mr. Odell: This gentleman struck the keynote of this whole business. It isn't what the chairman may want or what Mr. James may want. We want to do this for Nebraska. That Is what we are after. I believe we all ought to hold Mr. James, as far as we can, to the genero— promise he has made. A fellow came to the state fair three years ago from some other place with a scheme, something that he conceived was </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRK I I.T1 UK. for exhibitors. We got him to come down to the State Bee Keepers' * ■■delation and tell us how he did it. We aren't going to pay that fellow. He can keep a little bit ahead of us all the time. None of you fellows are going to pay Mr. James or Mr. Grau for this information out of the fund of their experience. Kor the good of this Btate of ours, they ought to be willing, and I believe they are willing, to contribute this information, and let the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture ■ratter it, so that your boys that are coming on will do this same thing, and boost this state of ours. I believe in these things. Mr. Grau: Pardon me for Just another thought that came into my mind, and that is this: It has been thoroughly brought out here to encourage the boys. I don't know as I am a boy, but I am a good deal older man than you think I am, because I was born in the early part of 1860. But in early life I had absolutely no opportunity whatever, be - cauae my father was farming, but he wasn't a farmer; and after he died I simply had to dig out what things I could get by observation and ex - perience; but, anyway, my time started in 1895, and I was working along the line of corn a good many years before ever I became a winner. I was a young man then, of course; and it was just that very same thing, as has been brought out here, I wish to mention. You get the young man started, and be won't stop. Even if he gets old, he won't stop. And be don't get old, because he always feels young. I feel as young at fifty years aa I did when twenty-six. I couldn't stand as much work, but I feel just as young as I did then. It took me a good many years to do that. I was defeated a number of times; but it never discouraged me; I went on and on with the corn just the same as I did with the sheaf stuff. I don't have any experience to give along the line of corn, because I didn't happen to win; yet I exhibited corn last October; but I kept on there until last year I grew the champion corn of Nebraska, produced on the farm that we call our home. And when I learned that, gentlemen, I felt that I had been amply repaid for all the trouble I had ever been to or all the experience I had given for the benefit of others along the line of better agricultural exhibits, also for the benefit of the whole state of Nebraska; not for Douglas county, but for the whole state of Ne- Esast master Hervey: I beg the pardon of this audience for permit this diversion until this motion has been disposed of.

If the members had seen the grief of some of us up there last year, I think they would be heartily in favor of that recommendation. "Second. Embody in contracts with eating houses and lunch stands that no meal served should cost to exceed fifty cents." There were good reasons for that recommendution, also.. "Third. Install cash turn stiles instead of our present system of ticket*." Which we thought was another good one. "Fourth. Light the horse barns." Too much danger of fire with the present lanterns in the horse "Fifth. Improve our streets. Cinder all crossings. Drain the ground so there will be no stagnant water." You all remember how it was last year. "Sixth. Build a levee sufficiently high to protect the low land from overflow on the west side of fair grounds."

Nothing would I rather see charged Pirge admission for these helpers. But I am afraid we are going le our machinery exhibit, and I hardly see how we can do it. • •■ii come here at a big expense. We haven't a building to put . They have to go out and hire tents, and some of them come an expense of probably seven or eight or nine or ten hundred Mme of them one hundred dollars and two or three hundred dol - lars; and I think that we might cripple our machinery exhibit wonder - fully if we made those exhibitors pay for all their helpers. Some of them have as high as twenty to thirty or forty he\ k &gt;v rs. Some of those large exbibiters probably have forty or fifty; I think Mr. Roberts will bear me out on that; like the John Deere people, the International Har - vester Company, and a few others, that have an endless amount of help; and, with the amount and size of the exhibit, they have to have it; and it is a great big show to us, the implement exhibit, to go out and see all those road wagons and road machinery is a great big show; it is a big show in Itself, and it is put there without much expense by the machinery men. So we must and ought to give that some considerable attention and B, 1 think, before we proceed along the lines of several of the Ions or recommendations here In regard to the farm machinery, grave question with me whether we can afford to do it, or not. I like to know what is done, if the committee looked up and saw done at other state fairs? If the other state fairs charge these ery men for their helpers and their assistants In their ex Mr. Mcl.eod: In making as quick a report as we do now we had no opportunity to investigate as to other state fairs, but we believe, your committee believe, that the system of giving so many passes was wrong, and, if we can devise any manner of shutting out these passes, we should do it. We endorsed these iecommendations, and it is up to you to decide as to whether you shall approve, or not. Some of these machinery companies, all of them, try to get enough passes to give to their help or their customers all over the state. They will get, some of them, as high as 150 at a time. How they get them I scarcely know, but they will have a lot of helpers there, and in some manner or other </seg>
            <seg id="p199">199 they will keep trying to get them (or their customers in every 'town in the state. If we give them that space free, it is an advantage to them to show and advertise their machinery. I believe they can afford to pay to get their help and their customers inside, and still make a big thing of it. John Deere has an immense gang of help there. You all know they put up a big exhibit; but why not let them pay their way in, and stop this fraud? as there is more or less fraud with it, in spite of the best efforts of the Board of Managers and superintendents of machinery. In fact, I pity all of them every year, the way they are pestered by that outfit. I believe we should make them pay their way in, if it is possible. If, as Mr. Rudge says, it is impracticable, if it will injure the fair, let them in. That is for you to determine. Mr. Roberts: I heartily endorse what Mr. Rudge said regarding the machinery department. I think Mr. McLeod is misinformed in regard to some of the machinery exhibits getting 150 passes. That is not cor rect. He is mistaken on that. The idea is and has been, and the super - intendent has been so directed, that each department shall be cut down to the actual number of their employes. Now, if this resolution passes, it is undoubtedly going to cripple the machinery department. There are a number of men there, In the harvesting machine department, that I be - lieve put in more hard work and labor with their hands for the days pre - paring for the state fair exhibit and machinery than any other days of the meet. They are such men as Haynes and men who go right up there and put on their overalls and work hard. They have been doing that every year; and these men, their helpers, I have watched them closely; these helpers come there and work from the beginning of the fair to the end; and they have not the advantage of seeing the bene - fits and other exhibits all the time of the fair; they can't leave. I want to say. gentlemen, that the machinery department is the mainspring of our whole fair. There isn't a single exhibit that is put on our fair grounds but that in some manner or other has a touch of the machinery in some of its departments from the time it is put on exhibition here on our fair grounds. I want to say that every effort ought to be made to encourage our machinery department. If we cripple that — just let the wheels of the machinery slop one night on our fair grounds, and I want to tell you that Mr. McLeod would come out of the sheep pens feeling mighty blue. I say, they would make a big mistake in doing it. I move that that part be not endorsed. Mr. Leonard: If it could be so arranged as to put a certain limit, that no exhibitor should receive more than a certain number of tickets, that might be well. I am not qualified to say how many tickets, for instance, the International Harvester Company should have; but, if it is the judgment of the superintendent of that department that they should have forty or fifty or twenty-five there is the recommendation of what should be the limit that any one exhibitor should have. Let that be ruled by the Board that no exhibitor should have more than a certain </seg>

Our Board of Managers and our men who compose it are familiar with these concession tickets, and I fully endorse the full Board that we leave that with our Board of Managers and the President. They are the men who know what is best for the state fair. The reason I endorsed that was so that we could dis - cuss it with our full Board, and draw the best arguments upon it as to our concession tickets; because in our state fair it is the gate receipts that run the fair. I endorse that it should be left with our President and the Board of Managers. Mr. I. W. Haws takes the chair. Plr.

We passed a lutlon some years ago authorizing the concessionaire to sell space for nachlnery department. That matter has never been carried out; that resolution has never been put in force; and I want to correct Mr. Roberts when he says there is no one who has received 150 admissions. I will say there is more than one exhibitor in the past that has received more than 150 admissions — over 200 admissions. That sounds awful big, but it is a fact. A man has to get only forty tickets to have 200 ad - missions to our fair; because it Is a five days' fair; if he gets 30 tickets, tgets 150 admissions; and there have been more than one every year t had 30 admissions. I just want to put that squarely. Mr. Roberts: I will ask you, Mr. President, was that during my time here as superintendent? Mr. Hendershot: 1 did not so state, Mr. Roberts. I said, in the Mr. Roberts: 1 didn't know what it was. If there has been any in the machinery department since I cave been there, it has been quite outside of me. </seg>

While we are crowded for space, there la an on placed upon the Board of Managers to Insure some of the de - partments space, and how to adjust this and adjust it fairly between the exhibitor and the State Board of Managers of the State Fair Association is the case that we want decided today. In making the recommenda - tions. I thought of it seriously, and I thought of no better way than to plare this proposition that we give them space here; since the reso - lution is on our books showing that they were not to pay for the space, and they were not doing it; and the machinery man is going to come here as long as we have a good fair; and as long as we have a good fair we have to pay our premiums; as long as we pay our pre - miums, we are obliged to furnish funds to do it, and we are short of money. The machinery men reap a more direct benefit from the Ne - braska state fair today than any other exhibitors on the state .Air grounds. I see no legitimate reason why they should not contribute their proportion to the advancement of the fair, and to the meeting of an expense that is becoming enormous. People today are not satisfied with a common fair; they demand an exposition; and, in order to get an exposition, we have to pay excessive prices for our attractions. I would do anything to advance the interests of the machinery men, the cattle men, the horse men, and men in every other department of this fair. I would be glad to open our gates and say we shall not charge one cent's adniiFsion to our state fair this year. Then thousands would come that do not come now. They do not look at the railroad fare, and the hotel bills, but they look at the pittance of fifty cents that it costs them to get in. I think seriously of asking the state to make an appropria - tion sufficient to pay Its debts, and to make this fair a publicity propo - sition, so that the people would come free, and not have to have a gatekeeper. Open your .gates, and let them come. But, so long as we are not doing that, we must draw the line. I am not separating the Ehinery men. If a horse man comes here to exhibit his horses and ; them, or his salesman, he would not get admissions. Mr. Ollis. I correct in that? Mr. Ollis: I think so. Mr. Hendershot: If a hog man comes here, and he wants to have a hog stall, his customers are not going to be given any admissions into the fair grounds; and every other department the same. There is just one department that we have got to furnish transportation, and that is the eating houses. There is a proposition where the people come; we in - vite then, here; we must care for them; while we are caring for them, we must look after their wants as we would our own families. And in doing this we must get the best we can get here to feed our people. Our churches arr the most satisfactory people of all our concessionaires; they feed the people, and the people never complain. I never remember a </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 may be, on our fair grounds. We must look after the Interests of the people, and how to look after them we have got to keep in close touch with our exchequer. We are paying fabulous premiums for the number of admissions we have at the stock fair. We have got to get funds. We are like an insurance company — the minute we stop paying our pre - miums we go out of business, we go into the hands of a receiver. I hope this motion will prevail, because it is just and right. If a man comes here to dispose of his wares, he will have a place for them. We are not talking about the space. We are merely talking about the fact that he can bring in ten men, if he wishes. It will let the bars down. There is not an implement exhibit that comes on our grounds that would re - quire more than three men to take care of it after it is placed in the box. Am I correct in that, Mr. Roberts? Mr. Roberts: No. Mr. Hendershot: I am talking about the salesmen he might have to keep it in order, to keep the plant Mr. Roberts: I don't think you are correct. Mr. Hendershot: All right. I am not correct How many would it take? Mr. Roberts: I don't think thirty men would take care of John Deere's exhibit after it is in place. Mr. Hendershot : I was rather asking what they did? Mr. Roberta: They operate the machinery. The machinery is in o|&gt;eration all the time. Mr. Hendershot: They are salesmen? They are their salesmen? Mr. Roberts: They are showing the machinery. When the machinery is going, It shows the operation more fully. Mr. Hendershot: Then, that isn't very much. I want to say to you that they are operating their machinery to sell, and the farmers come here to buy it, and do buy it ; and there's no class of people do the busi - ness on the fair grounds the machinery people do. The farmers come here; they set' the machinery; they buy this or that kind of appliance or machinery; that advertises the machine Interests, and it is a good thing really to have them here, and they are going to come; and they Eit space, and we are always open for them. I know personally many pie that come to our state fair here, and enter the fair grounds on Missions sent to them by their machinery men at home, by the local dealer; the machinery man would get a handful of tickets, and he would send them out to Hebron, to Nelson, to Geneva, and all around, to his turners, to his retailer, and his retailer- would send them to his i-us - ers. I know this to be a fact. Mr. Leonard: When was that? How many years ago? Mr. Hendershot: It has been three years ago.

There is the place for the superintendent protect the business; have the superintendent to see that no exhibitor shall have more than so many coupon passes; and I am opposed to check naif being issued. Mr. Gustafson: When you have machine men to the number of 2,500. I tell you it goes to show that we cannot afford to curtail the machinery exhibits. We have in the state probably 2,500 men; their trade and stork is from the state fair. If you have a good exhibit of machinery, those men are going to get work in the fair. Each man brings with him from eight to ten families; and you can figure out just what it would amount to. If you have a poor display of machinery, we are not going lo get them to go to work in the fair. Therefore, I say, don't curtail your exhibit of machinery under any circumstances. Mr. Dickman, Treasurer: I have been unfortunate enough to be con - nected with the implement business for a good many years. The state - ment that the President makes will hardly be borne out by one of the books In the Treasurer's office. Mr. C. E. Haney, the manager of the International Harvester company, gave me his check for $50 for admis - sion tickets last year, bought and paid for the tickets; that is one of Budge: I want to explain there: The International Harvester 's name has been mentioned here today. The International Mar mpany are people who are not asking for more than they rightly think they are the most conservative people we have on the I want these men to know that, and that the International r Company, for the last four or five years, to my knowledge, have bought hundreds of tickets, and have given them away probably to their customers; but they don't get tickets from our friends, or through our friends, for their customers. - PPritchard: I would like to say with reference to this: At our show a year ago the John Deere Company reserved space and to an expense of $150 to exhibit at our stock show. We never tickets or issue any complimentaries to anybody, and never have since the organization. Every man that goes into those grounds pays for the admission. We furnish free space, free stalls, in the stock yard; but we never furnish any complimentary tickets to anybody except children; they are the only people that have complirnentarlts. And we have those exhibits, and we have a pretty good show; and I don't believe it will make one cent's difference. There isn't a machinery concern in the United States that handles machinery that doesn't want to advertise it. and it won't make one cent's difference, if they get their space free, com ing to this fair— not a cent. Treasurer Dickman: Our Treasurer's report shows this year $880 for exhibitors' tickets— something that never has appeared on the Treasurer's report before. </seg>
            <seg id="p204">W mimillNOB NEBRASKA STATE BOARH OF MBCDUOt of those wbo know. I want to speak from the standpoint of one who does not know. It it a good deal that way with me; I depend entirely on youi judgment whether this is a right proposition, or not. I think I speak the roice of probably two-thirds here that, when we vote it, we judge simply by your speeches as to who had the best of the argument. I do not think we can vote intelligently on that question. Therefore, I suggest that we leave it with the Board of Managers. I believe there was a motion that we leave it with the Board of Managers? Isn't that motion before the house? Secretary Mel lor: That is what the whole debate means here. Mr. von Forell: I am therefore In favor of just that motion, to leave it with the Board of Managers. They can thresh it out better than we Iscretary Mellon There was a time in the history of this organiza that such things did obtain as have been reported on the floor in meeting this morning. In the year 1904 the Board took active meas to stop this leakage; and, if you will look over your records in the 1905, years back, you will find that over 4,800 leas passes were d for the fair of 1904 than were issued for the fair of 1903. That possibly the beginning of the curtailment of the pass evil. Since time every management has endeavored to improve upon that record, but, with a growing fair, it has been a pretty hard matter to do this. 1 know personally that it is a pretty hard proposition to make a machinery exhibit. It depends upon the action of two or three of the leading machine firms. If two or three of those leaders don't come, the rest of them won't come. They are like sheep; they flock together. There was a motion Introduced at their meeting last fall, after the state fair season was over, to prohibit further displays upon state fair grounds, on account of the expense, that it was too expensive, and I was informed that a resolution passed fining every member of their aa sociation $100 that made a display on a state fair grounds this coming year. Now, If this machinery exhibit is so good to the machinery ex - hibitors, I do not think they would pass such a resolution as that. I think that this resolution will be broken over, because some of the stronger fellows will say: "Well, we look for them to be a lot of little boys, but we will go and make a show, and will profit by it" I think possibly that will be the result in the end. But I do not think it is wisdom for this Board to pass a resolution that will prohibit a super - intendent of that department from using his best judgment. We have two men at the head of each department. We ask these men to be con - servative in the issuance of passes. Those men are in close touch with the needs of their departments. Colonel Leonard is superintendent of the hog department. He can tell it isn't necessary for two fellows to come in there to view any particular hog. And so can Mr. Mickey, of the cattle department; he can tell that. They were not giving away psiTti for nothing. Those superintendents have got the welfare of this AssociatioB at heart, just as much as this entire body has. Mr. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">somebody comes and asks for them, to give to their neighbors and friends. And Mr. Roberts doesn't give away passes. I believe that every super - intendent of every department on these state fair grounds is doing his utmost to curtail this pass evil; and I believe that we can safely entrust this matter with the men that are handling the departments. I know in 1904 this is the way we managed. I was acting as President at that time, and I requested each superintendent to issue his- own orders for passes. Prior to that time, the fellow had come up to the office and got passes from the President, and got passes from big superintendent, and got passes from this fellow or that fellow; but, after the order was made to make the issuance of all passes through the superintendent of the department, I don't believe there has been much trouble about those departments; and I am perfectly willing to leave that to the superin - tendents. I have perfect confidence in Mr. Roberts' ability to handle the passes in the machinery department. I have perfect confidence In the ability of every superintendent to handle the passes of any one de- Kiuient. If I did not feel that way, 1 would make a good, big fight inst the men that have the appointing of the superintendents. P Roberts: I dont want to take up any time on this but only a I want to say that there seems to be a disposition amongst some members to think there is quite a graft among the machinery I want to say, last year, in the issuance of passes, there was a time when we ran out of tickets, and we had to issue checks to them, to give to some of the men that were late coming in; I mean the exhibits that were late coming in the machinery department came before 1 could place a badge on them or tag that was ordered me by the officers. There were cases in a number of instances of that kind, in the machinery de - partment, the exhibitors that I gave checks to for the day were men (check passes, you understand; that the superintendent did not let ex - hibit; and they came right back and returned those very checks to me. That showed to me that they had a disposition to be fair with the society. And little things creep in. We know that people will try to get passes, for Instance, in this way: Some men will come to my department with out anyone that I know connected with the exhibit; they will represent to me, perhaps, that they are with the John Deere exhibit, or with some other exhibit. I have made it a point to say: "Before you get them, you bring the head of the management here, or get him to endorse these, and bring them back to me, before I issue anything." I do not think it is a graft among the machinery men. I do not think they in - tend to. ■ Hendershot: I don't like that word that you use, "graft;" I don't that is a proper word. Mr. Roberts: I said, there seemed to be a disposition to think it w art. Mr. Hendershot: I would like to have that expunged from the record; because it don't look good. There is no one accusing the machine men of </seg>

E Machine men are human, and humanity is grasping everything they ran get for nothing; not discrediting anybody else; the ma man is no exception to the rule. Mr. Leonard: It seems to me, from some of the remarks made, when I mentioned the International Harvester Company, that they perhaps thought I meant that they were getting too much. I did not mean that. I mentioned the case of the International Harvester Company; I might have put the John Deere Company in with them, because they make the largest exhibit there; and, if there would be anything to base the amount C transportation on that the machinery company should have, It would based on their exhibit, probably, because theirs is the largest. E:retary Melloi : Didn't we hear in Chicago in reference to that? mention of a resolution ' that the machinery men resolved that entirely boycott the Illinois state fair, on account of something thought touched the machinery men, and they are not going to any machines there at this next year. A member: Yes, sir, that is what it was. Mr. Leonard: I don't know how the language goes: I heard that somewhere that they boycotted the Illinois state fair. I wouldn't want to do anything to boycott any fair. The reason I mentioned this is to place a limit somewhere. That was just the plan I adopted in my own department. I asked the Board of Managers two or three times and the President, "What shall I do? How many passes shall I give these exhibitors?" They said, "You go back and do what you think is for the best interests of your department." Secretary Mellor: Yes, and you did it, too. Mr. Leonard (continuing) : And for the best interests of the fair. I considered it didn't take more than a certain number in taking care of an exhibit that will be on the ground. We only allowed them two for any horse. I knew how many hogs were going to be put in there; and I thought I knew how many men could take care of them. That is what I baaed my estimate on. That is the reason for my asking. I think there should be a certain number, and move you that there be a EHendershot: I move an amendment to the amendment, that I be ed to withdraw that part of my recommendation in reference ging the implement men for their tickets.

Mr. Ollis: There is a matter I would like to have seen mentioned in the report. Let the President and the committee have It referred, and then incorporated in that report. I see they recommend lighting the horse barns, and I think that is a very important matter. They have been lighting the horse barns with lanterns. If a fire should start, I think it would probably put the association to an expense. In regard to the hog department, we recollect that there was quite a little protest among the hog men when the hogs were removed from the fair down to the low ground; it was unpleasant, some of the people that came know, for the water; it was muddy and disagreeable, and perhaps that had some - thing to do with making the hog men feel a little bit dissatisfied. They got those hogs out in the night, and were loading in the cars; I saw them along in the evening; it is generally along about 11 or 12, or 1, 2, or 3 o'clock; they work in the night, and have to carry lanterns around; but it is very disagreeable and almost impossible for them to handle those hogs in the dark there. It is hard to handle hogs in the dark, and in the dark to handle hogs, drive them from the wagons to the cars, or in crates, or anything of that kind. I would like to hear a recommendation made that the grounds around the hog barn be lighted also, if it would be possible to do it. It is a very important matter, and the expense would not be so great, if the Fair men would naturally feel that they might possibly do it, and that it ought to be done. Chairman Haws: Is there a motion to that effect? Mr. Ollis: I would like to make a motion. ■irman Haws: The question before the house is upon the adoption report. What will you do with it, gentlemen? It has been moved •onded, I believe? Has it?

Knowing what I do of certain things that have been brought to bear against me that would have a tendency to discredit me in the minds of the members and delegates here assembled, I believe it is to the interests of the State Board of Agriculture first, and to my interest secondly, to withdraw from the contest at this time. The first reason is this: The State Board or Agriculture is asking for an appropriation, and either way that this vote might be taken — that is, either way it would occur — it might have a ten - dency to injure the interests of the State Board of Agriculture; and. taking that into consideration, and placing the interests of the State Board of Agriculture above my own, I wish to withdraw from the con - test at this time.

HISTORICAL SKETCH Estate Bee Keepers' Association was organized on February 8, king it the third oldest agricutural association in point of con - organization in the state; the older societies being the State ! Agriculture and the State Horticultural Society. The meeting for organization was held at the Omaha Board of Trade rooms and the organization was perfected as "The Eastern Nebraska Bee Keepers' Association" with the following officers: Hiram Craig, president, Fort Calhoun; U U Pollard, vice-president, Bellevue; W. G. I'igman, secretary, and Th. Bruing, treasurer. Three meetings of the association were held that year (1879) and the old minutes show marked interest in the craft and active discussion of many problems which hi ill come up in bee keepers' meetings. The record of the annual meeting of February 13, 14, 1880, which was held at omaha. disc lows that at a prior meeting held May 17, 1879, the name of the association was changed to "the Nebraska State Bee Esepers' Association." At the second day's session of the 1880 meeting committee was appointed to arrange for exhibits at the state fair, an terest which has been kept alive with increasing interest until W aska now has a honey show second to no other among the great fairs. The following names appear on. the record as members at this time: Hiram Craig, W. G. Pigman, T. L Van Dora, A. Gramlish, I. I. MclAin, T. S. Corbett, P. M. Peckham, I. R. Kennedy, D. I. Arnold, Cyrus Latham. Dynes, H. Sprague, H, Munger, James M. Flynn, W B. Allen, G. W. Urewster. It would be interesting to know if any of these pioneers in Nebraska apiculture still survive to see the fruits of their sowing in these early days. A perusal of these old records covering thirty-two years show many names identified with agricultural progress in Nebraska, and it is doubtful if any of the many societies exist among farm avocations can show a more persistent spirit or more honorable record. In the early eighties foul brood gained a foothold in the state, owing to shipment in of diseased bees and a campaign was begun for a law to protect the bee keeper, resulting in the passage of the present law in 1885, at which time the State Bee Keepers' Association was first officially recognized in the statutes. Since that time the association has been chiefly responsible for efforts to protect the innocent bee keeper against injury from the ignorant or careless. For six years last past a deter - mined effort has been made to reinforce this law by introducing a sys- </seg>
            <seg id="p217">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORKTI.Tt RE. _M7 ■ been unanimously recommended for passage by the House com - and will no doubt be passed at the next session. Not the least Interesting thing about the history of this association is that it has never sought or been the recipient of state aid to the extent of a single penny, which fact, in these halcyon days of multiplication of offices and increase of salaries, should entitle it to more than ordinary consideration. The rapid development of general agriculture in Nebraska is bring ing a coincident development of bee keeping. The extension of the alfalfa l&lt;'lt and the discovery that the finest of alfalfa seed can be raised in this state has brought about also the knowledge that the seed crop of this great forage plant Is practically doubled by the agency of the bee in pollination,- leading to speedy extension of apiculture In the alfalfa regions. It is safe to predict that within the next decade western Ne - braska will be found to be a veritable paradise for the bee keeper. For four years past the alfalfa and clover honey from this region has won practically all the prizes at the state fair and eastern Nebraska bee keepers are finding it a hard task to show against the men from the alfalfa belt. The Bee Keepers' Association is a live organization and always ready to respond to calls for help or information. The nominal member - ship is approximately two hundred which should be increased ten-fold, as the dues are but fifty cents annually. The annual meetings of the as - sociation have been for several yea:s held in connection with the meet - ings of organized agriculture at Lincoln in the third week of January and will so continue. The programs here furnished are among the best offered in the feast of good things which is given that week and tin- doors are always open to visitors. By courtesy of the State lloaul of Agriculture s.aee is given for this sketch and the publication of four important papers read at the 1911 rreeting of the a: social irn. Not the least interesting part of these panels is the personnel of their authorship: Mr. John Albert, Jr., of Saundeis county is a graduate of the State Agricultural College and an it bee keeper who is rapidly taking high rank in the profession. He has become a proficient demonstrator with live bees at fairs and is fast gaining an enviable refutation among the expert few who do this difficult and hazardous work. This fives a touch of human interest to his entertaining paper. Thos. Atkinson, of Dawson county, is one of the high-grade honey producers of the alfalfa belt, and his pa;&gt;er discloses the painstaking methods ty which he produces the fancy honey which has been consistently winning at the state fair. C. B. Palmer, of York county, is a hustling merchant with a hobby for bee keeping, and be n akes it pay.

The degree of our success hinges almost iiitiielv upon two thinps: A poc:d location, and our ability to get strong rr the- harvest and keeping the working force together. To ii &gt;Ush these thin', s we nmt-l begin preparations months before the How. planning in advance, the things to be done at the critical moment v hi n conditions are against us. thus turning an otherwise failure to our advantage. For convenience of discussion I have arranged the following subtopics: Fiisl— Style of Hives. Second — Getting a strain of liefs to Produce Fancy Comb Honey Third — Outdoor Wintering. Fourth — Spring Management. Filth-Vanipiilation of Hees and Supers during the Hooey Flow I have in ubc both the eight and ten frame size of hives, but considei the- larger size best for general purposes and the needs of the average My ideal hive is one of the ten-fiarr.e size, with double cover and 4x.'» section sui er. My reasons for adopting the ten-frame size are: The average queen has enough room for egg laying. A larger force of bees IIY TIIOK. ATKI\S(I\, 1IIZM </seg>

Lets feeding and fussing with colonies In ring, and meat important of all is that a colony in the ten-frame ill store a 28-pound super of honey as soon as an eight size ran twenty-four sections. Ke writers have argued that the ten-frame super is too wide for pping of sections, but I' have not found this to be the rase. The ig plan will eliminate this trouble: Drive two double -pointed lacks in one side of the striper, opposite earn &lt;l&lt;at on the fence. Put a fence next these, then your holders and re - n-aining fence; lastly, an inch fill-board, as you will be unable to get in I ut seven holders. This arrangement gives a wall of bees next the sii'kt sides and assures even ca:&gt;i&gt;ins of the sections. Always use full sheets of foundation in the brood frames, well wired. Thus getting straight worker combs, and avoiding a useless horde of drones. I also use full sheets of extra thin foundation in the sections, getting better filled sections, and that is what consumers vant. The honey will also ship with less breakage of combe. I think it is best to use a bottom starter, letting the top piece com 1 within one-eifhth of an inch of the bottom one. The past season I used full sheets waxed to all sides of the section, but there is some objection to this. BvckMag of foundation, and sometimes only one side of the foundation will be drawn out. Tut the foundation with a common bread knife and miter box into the desired lengths. I use the Daisy fastener. nrst putting in the bottom starter thin the to) one. Have the su'iers i by and drop the sections in place as you fill them, first putting two or ih'ec tails in the middle of the &lt;ir&lt; r. I plan to have one such supei for each colony. These baits entice ihe bees into the euners at the be - ginning of the How, keeping the b'ood chan:ber from being crowded with honey, which is one reason of so much swarming of colonies run for comb honey. All su'-ers and hives for increase are made ready before the flow, so the bees tan have my undivided attention during summer months. GETTING TIIK HKST STRAIN OF BEES To PHODll K COMB HONEY Bit the first of June I plan to start queen cells, using a frame or im the best stock. Then five the ripe cells to nuclei made of one e of sealed brood and enough bees to cover. These nuclei are ilt up to full colonies by giving them brood from stocks preparing m.

Bees ■ked in this way wintered perfectly in 1909 and 1910, with only two three |&gt;&lt;-i cent loss-, and that caused by old queens. •niHO MANAGEMENT. Do not be in a hurry to remove the winter packing. If the bees have plenty of stores leave them alone till warm weather comes. gp sometimes get winter weather in Nebraska when we ought to settled warm weather. Last spring was an example of such. These snaps coming as they usually do after a warm period catch the »ith a large amount of brexxi, and if unprotected it will be killed c.lony receives a setback from which they cannot recover. The old having used up their vitality to rear this brood soon die, and then ive a bad case of spring dwindling. - . s should provide a good watering place for the bees, in a inotectid spot, and teed flour if natural pollen Is scarce. KDg the n. c nth of May all stocks are given a general overhauling, ; burr combs, painting hives and doing all needed repairs. At this I colonies are kept well supplied with stores. When the outside combs are empty I replace them with sealed combs uf honey caved for this purpose from the season before. "Millions of Honey at our House" will give more workers for the hai vest than feeding sugar. As it follows the intention of nature for the INI to store enough honey to carry them from one crop until the next. I double tier all colonies in ei?ht-frame hives at this time, or as soon as the bees become crowded. Bin the first of June I equalize the brood, taking sealed combs from ongest and give to those of medium strength. This will check ing of the 11 i sst forward stocks and help the weaker ones. By icthod you will have the maximum number of colonies ready ub hon«y supers when the flow starts. ■ not think it pays to help the very weak colonies, as they will her any surplus. The heney flow would probably be over before [Id build them up. </seg>
            <seg id="p221">61 do not think will give good results in section honey. These ire intended for the spring feed, and I get them on early so as them filled if there is a flow. I cannot depend on the fall flow &gt;artsease, as this plant only grows in wet 'years. I do not put rs on such colonies, hence have no swarming from them. I also give an upper entrance at the back of the hive. I plan to have one or more sealed combs of honey for each colony. For example, If you have fifty stocks you will need about sixty-five combe of honey for feed, as some use more honey during the winder than others. HANDLING THE BEKS A Nil SII'ERB M'UINc; THE HONEY HOW. En the alfalfa begins to show plenty of bloom I put on the supers, b I expect very little honey from the first crop. The main flow two weeks later from sweet clover. Rtting the supers on early helps to hold swarming in check. At the time I put a small block under each corner of the hive raising it If inch from the bottom board, giving the bees plenty of ventilation. LThe critical time in swarm control Is when the bees are apparently ting between two opinions, whether to enter the super and continue the work In the old hive, or abscond to the highest limb of a nearby tree. Pinching the queen cells and taking away sealed brood will usually check swarming. All swarms that issue are hived In a contrasted brood chamber and returned to the old stand, giving the supers from the old hive to the new swarm. Shake the remaining bees in the old hive In 61th the swarm, and give the brood to nuclei, previously started as ex - ained above. When the dark honey flow begins give the remaining frames, with full sheets of foundation, to the swarm. By this plan all swarms will give good results in section honey. When the first super is half full I give an - other on top. Afterwards putting it below, when the bees begin to draw out the foundation. At the time of changing the supers if the flow is heavy, I give a third super on top of all. This plan requires more work than the old method of putting empty supers next to the brood chamber, but I get better filled sections and fewer unfinished ones at the close or the flow. The queen having plenty of room to deposit eggs in a ten-frame hive will not crowd the top bars so closely and travel stained honey will be mostly eliminated. During a hot wave, if the bees should loaf too much on the outside of the hive, I shove the supers forward, making an upper entrance at the top of the brood chamber. This relieves the congestion in the hive and the bees will return to work, also preventing a possible swarm is - suing from the colony. The full supers of honey are removed when most of the sections are capped. The unfinished ones known as "go backs" are returned to be finished by the bees. As the flow draws to a close the number of supers are reduced so as to have the least amount of unfinished sections. You </seg>

Alfalfa being ■t yielder in my locality, I reduce the number of supers to one after the second crop, aiming to have just enough super room ? nectar from the third crop, which is usually much less than w from the second bloom. When the flow is over remove the supers and grade the honey, sav ing the unfinished sections for baits the following season. Ely in September see that all colonies are well supplied with winter If the fall flow has failed, as it usually does with me, all colonies were built up from a nucleus will be short on stores. These are yrup made of equal parts of sugar and water, until they have at renty-five of sealed stores. In conclusion, I must say a few words in regard to marketing the Be honest with yourself and fcllowman when grading the honey. After you have produced a really fine grade of section honey, put it up in first-class packages and ask a good price. Honest grading and a little mixxionarp work with local grocers will build up the honey market on a firm basis. Recently I was in Grand Island soliciting orders for honey. While - I »i nt into a store and asked for the proprietor, showed him my line He immediately began to make the following excuses: "I haven't any call for honey, people will not buy it; they prefer syrup." He then showed me a few sections under his counter which I Judge from their looks, had seen service on a box hive before the war of '61. This same grocer had on display in his window a collection of vegetables of the squash variety. This is only one of many similar incidents I have seen in the past few months. It is the duty of bee keepers to show such grocers how to sell honey, and once converted they make good customers. BKK DEMONSTRATION AT COUNTY FAIRS. BY JOHN ALBEIT, JB., «AII(«l, NUl. Some of you perhaps do not understand just what a bee demonstration is, hence I will proceed to explain it to you. A full colony of bees is placed in a wire cage so constructed for that purpose. They are then handled without any protection whatever. A number of stunts are then i&gt;erfornied with them. This is followed by a. good talk on some part of bee keeping and after the talk a few minutes are devoted to answering questions. I think this will give you an understanding of what the l» • demonstration is. Since I have had a few years' experience giving demonstrations at (ounty fairs, I will tell you briefly about it. I think this is one good way of educating the public along the i </seg>
            <seg id="p223">bee keeping. I found out that almost everybody would come out and see the bee man, and while he Is looking at the demonstrator performing all these stunts, he learns that the honey bee is not so bad after ail lr handled properly, and so he listens attentively to the lecture, and when it is over he will ask questions and will be well pleased and consider his time well spent. He will exert his efforts not to miss a single performance during the fair. By the time the fair is over he will be pretty well posted and will want to know more. So he will continue step by step until he gets to the point when he finds the help of a good bee book and will in time become a good bee-keeper. I have also learned that these demonstrations tend to do away with the idea that some people- have, that bees do not amount to anything, simply because they are provided with stings for defense, and does not this teach some of them a lesson, where they handle them carelessly and get stung a few tinus, they will try a better and more gentle way next time, if told that there is a better way. I haw also learned that the cracker-box bee keapaf soon finds out that the combs tan be kept straight and each handled by itself if the proper methods are used, and likewise he learns that bees are easier manfpulated by one who understands their habits. E first year that I gave demonstrations at our Saunders county was told by several that it would soon get monotonous and the in s would soon tire of it, but to my surprise I found out that I haa r audience the Hist time, a larger the next, and a still larger and expectant audience the next time. Many would leave the race* ne out to see the bee man give his performance. 1 was engagid again the next year by the Saunders county fair rE»n - agemrnt and was then given a place on the program and was well ..d - -ed by the fair management. I demonstrated before much larger minds than I did the first year, although the attendance at the fair was about 60 per cent less than the year pievious, which was due to the rainy weather. The first day that I gave the performance it was raining hard right along, but that did not keep the people away. They just simply hoisted their umbrellas and donned their rain-coats and stayed until I had finished my performance. I myself soaked to the skin, while those in the front were in a similar condition, as they dared not put up i hi ir umbrellas for fear of blockading the way of those in the rear. There is one thing I like especially well about the demonstration and that is I can always hold the audience until I am through. Those of you who have had experience in lecture work or along that line know ho a hard it is to hold an audience at a county fair. I choose a different sub - j&gt;-( t for each demonstration, so that no one needs listen to the same lecture twice. This I find to be of great value as many of the folks make it a point to hear every talk. ■ all this work I enjoy best many of the funny questions that are For instance, one man said that if I had his wild bees there 1 </seg>

I do not know what happened to him but he disappeared quite suddenly. I suppose h&lt;- was looking for a different answer. An - other question by an old gentleman was, that he could not understand why he could handle his bees successfully a number of years ago and that now he can't handle them at all; but what he meant was that he is afraid of them now. I hold him perhaps he was like some of the acrobats.

KY &lt; II. l-AI.MKK, IIIIA1ISI1AW, HEB. ■m asked through the kindness of the Beekeepers' Association to 1 the divisible brood chamber hive as to Its advantages, If any, production of honey. First, all parts are of the same size. The several brood chambers are the same size and shapes as the supers and can be used either for brood or sections or extracting frames by simply removing the brood frames and putting in the sections. These hive bodies are a trifle less than six inches deep, very light, and can be handled by any lady or child with very little lifting, as they tier one top of the other as tall or as shallow aa you want. At any time can be easily moved to any part of the yard by simply one section or body at a time. When one gets used to handling them they can be taken a;&gt;art and built up as easily as a child EIU A B C blocks. Many a time I have wished to move a Lang hive and could not on account of not being able to lift and carry eavy hive. We are told in the present day this: When your bees swarm move the old hive away that has cast the swarm and place the new swarm on the old stand, and this of course the wife has to do because bees seldom •warm until the men are entirely off the place. How many women of today can skip out into bee yard, pick up a deep frame hive, carry it twenty or thirty feet, and have enough of the motor power left to climb </seg>
            <seg id="p225">Thr frames are very shallow, therefore the foundation does not sag Wiring of the foundation is unnecessary. The frames being shallow, do not get out of plumb when being nailed together. They are easy to transfer into from old box hives, as the combs will stay better when tied than In a deep frame, much easier to fit the pieces of brood in and combs or honey being shallow frames (but more of them) only one body of eight frames may be used, or two of sixteen or even three of twenty - four frames. The hive is always the size of your combs and your swarms, whether they be few or many. When through transferring contract the size of your hive to any size you want. EA8Y TO HIVE THE SWARM. If a large swarm, use two or more; if small, use only one body after they are hived; easy to ventilate; simply put small sticks between the bodies after the swarm has commenced work. Look to your hive. If too much room, remove one body; if not room enough, add to it. For late after swarms nothing better, and right here let me say that late queens are of the hustling quality that you do not get at any other time of the year and make the best of queens for the next season. Those small after swarms can be hived in only one body and united at any time. When united put super and excluder on and remove lower body, always keeping brood above, or give frames of honey, (always easy to get). Simply go to any hive, slip the cap to one side, about two inches, and take one of these shallow frames and insert a frame of foundation and give your little swarm as few or many as you like. In the season Just passed I had but one hive swarm; I had left a super on to be finished to sell. These were hived and placed on the old Btand and the old stand broken up and distributed among some weaker hives. This new swarm gave me 189 sections of honey. But one stand of hybrids did equally as well and did not swarm at all. Each turned off seven supers of twenty-seven sections each. One swarm that I bought June 12 and supplied with a few small frames of honey gave me 136 sections, seven of my old stands gave 1,080 sections (one of this seven) 136 sections then broke down with foul brood and I shook them on Saturday one week before the state fair. Entrances can be enlarged by simply sliding the bodies forward or back. The whole hive can be freed from bees by giving the hive body a quick jerk and not remove a frame, or the frames can easily be re - moved one' at a time as they never buckle. At the beginning of the honey flow I always place the frames of brood In the top body and foundation frames or the frames oi honey (always uncapping the honey) and any frames of pollen below (honey in the center) and pollen at sides. Now you have your frames of solid brood at the top of your hive and when the super is put on there is no place to store the surplus honey. Only above in the super, and I never have the least trouble In getting bees started in the super. After super work has commenced you alternate at any time, and this will cause the queen to keep the lower frames flllefl </seg>

This alternating will cause all frames to be built solid with comb leaving no room for queen cells and what few cells there are will nearly always be found at the bottom of the frames between the two top brood bodies and always easy to get at with out moving the framrs. At the time this first super is put on you ran borrow a frame of honey bees and all to be used as bait in the first super. Always at ;his time, if the weather is warm and the bees show signs of clustering out, block the whole hive up from the bottom board with four wedges This will compel them to remain inside and as they pass up into the •■per this relieves the crowded condition of the brood chamber (a very important point) and the desire to swarm seems to have entirely been forgotten. The reason I use wedges is so one can at any time, should flow be cut off from any cause, lower the hive by working the wedges back and forth without disturbing the bees in the least. With a deep frame a quantity of honey is alweys at the ends of the frames and a large crust of honey extends under the lower side of the top of the frame above the brood, and when this solid crest is completed I have had trouble In forcing the bees above this mass of honey, as this seems to art as their surplus for food for their brood, musing the brooa rhnmbi-r to become congested and bees to cluster out and swarming At the close of this article I will explain to you my method of tiering up supers and freeing same from bees. If you wish to find the queen at any time and do not wish to handle the frames, place an empty brood body below any part of the hive with queen excluder on the top and drive the bees down through the excluder. This has been thoroughly explained in Gleanings. Should your bees become too strong before the honey flow you can always borrow a few of these small frames to help to build weaker stands, or should you wish increase at any time, simply split your brood bodies, placing one body on a new stand and adding to from any other strong hive. A small frame of honey can always be taken from the side of the hive body to build nucleus or for the table and the bees never feel as though they had been robbed. In making nuclei, thrse frames being small, one can make them more compact and have less cold space around your brood. For increase, simply take one of your brood bodies with as much brood as possible to a new location. In about ten days cut out all cells, but one; it's the abort cut to shook swarming; or if more than two, bodies take one from each hive having three bodies and make as many new stands as you wish. Should honey flow stop suddenly at this time replace them where they came from, always putting a body of eight frames filled with foundation below. There being a space of fully one-fourth inch between the upper and the lower frames makes this an ideal hive for winter, as bees have free access to all frames at all times without passing around i he ends of cold frames. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">227 In going into winter quarters I have never found the winter nest above but always below, directly under eight frames of solid honey, and heat penetrates these tombs of winter stores. They never select a wide home but always a long narrow space, so the heat goes above and their surplus is always warm from the heat of the swarm below. Consequently brood roaring commences early and they build up rapidly, and as a rule I have to be careful that my bees do not get too strong at the be - ginning of fruit bloom, which is frequently cut short by frost and leaves me with hives full of brcod and bees to be cared for until the white clover bloom comes. But usually at this time dandelions help me out; but should even that fail, 1 always have hives with a surplus, and frames carried over that 1 ran place down by the brood nest. Kve twelve hives with sixteen frames of this surplus above each today. They being clustered on eight frames below, they will least 100 of these frames of honey to spare in the spring. In Heating disease they are very easy to manipulate. • I'MTEU States Depai.tme.nt of Aork ti.ti.'re. "BUHEAl OK ImiNUH. "WAsniMjoy, D. C. June 24, 1909. "Mr. C. B. Palmer, Bradshaw, Nebraska.

In 1904 the same swarm yielded a surplus of 132 pounds, and in the following year 85 pounds.

In her fifth year, in 1907, I saw her swarm out June 14. An eighr - ftame hive with six starters and two partly built white combs was pro - vided for this beautiful swarm. Just three weeks later the colony was inspected and found to be hopelessly queenlcss. There being entirely no brood in any stage of development in the hive it was obvious, that the queen must have perished shortly after the hiving of the swarm. The ptculiar feature about it was, that except a little corner In one of the side-frames, all the newly built comb was worker comb filled throughout with honey, as against the commonly held belief, that queenless colonies will apodictically build drone comb only. I am unable to offer any ex - tion of this, other than that the bees appear to have been so thoroughly intent in h istllng for honey and building-comb during the profuse flow as to scarcely perceive their bereavement. While many advertisers nay lay stress upon the queen's prolificness as the only essential requirement toward securing bounteous crops In favorable locations and seasons, I would differ from them on this par - ticular point. I still have several colonies of the original Pacula strain, with their queens displaying the same prolificness, as in former years, </seg>

I then turned my eyes to the "Goldens." Their pleasing beauty and bright color rendering them attractive objects. This point together with the easiness with whiih their queens can be found, even in populous colonies, in the s a arming period, their alleged gentleness and readiness to enter the sections, and what not, induced me to give them a trial. But because, at my hands, they wintered poorly on the summer stands, the stock having perhaps been wintered indoors for years, and because of their tendency to deteriorate and revert to the original strain, they were discarded. I am inclined to the opinion, that for our climate and the freaks of our flow and for my conditions and methods of manipulation,* the darker shaded three-band Italians are by far the more desirable variety. It must be admitted, however, that some types of the leather-colored Italians surpass others in industry, gentleness and honey-yielding ability. The disposition of some strains to spring dwindling and to untimely (easing brcod rearing, wholly or in part, and to the occasional clogging of the brood-chamber v. ith honey, will often stand in the way of their reaching, in proper trim, the opening of the honey flow. Still other breeds are more or less slow to take to the section supers. Witn Italians, more bo than with other races, I made the observation that, every now and then, daughters of exceptionally good queens will prove worthless. — The Italians were introduced into this country by Richard Colvin, away back in the early '60's. THE GRAY CARNIOI.AN8 This is a race of well established qualities, but it is somewhat diffi - cult to obtain pure stock. It is a native of Carniola, or Kranjsko, a S'avic duchy, traversed by the Julian and Karavanken Alps, and a crown land in the Austrian empire near the Adriatic Sea, formerly the heart of the Illyrian province under Napoleon, its capital then and now being the city of Ljubljana, or Laibach. • Is the second shaking necessary in treating foul brood?

Jones, of Beeton, Canada, brought the first Carniolan queens into this country from their native land in the year 1880. Prompted I y the writings of Frank Bcnton, formerly in charge of apiculture in the Department of Agriculture at Washington, D. C, a staunch advocate of the Carniolan, I placed an order for two Carniolan queens in the spring of MM, the one to be mailed from Ohio, and the other from near the Atlantic coast. Two years later, again several queens from another Ohio breeder were procured. The first queen in 1903 fiom Ohio was introduced to a two-frame nucleus in June and soon found laying from one to five eggs in single cells, for want of room. The nucleus gradually grew stronger in num - bers and brood, and without any special help on my part, save that or adding, from time to time, empty combs, developed into a rousing colony by the approach of fall, giving a little surplus of sixteen sections, notwith standing an attack of the so-called pickle brood in August, and the American foul brood (bacillus larvae. White) In September, the symp tonis of the latter disease not having been detected until next March (1904 1 by the presence in several combs of dark dried-down scales on the aide-walls of the cells. EM realizing in those years of inexperience the seriousness and full it of danger from this formidable foe, especially as the colony ap - ntly did not seem to suffer much from the malady, I postponed treatment to the close of the honey harvest. Seventy-two beautiful sec - tions were the surplus of the season from that infected colony. And now the game was u;&gt;. Meanwhile foul brood had taken such t&gt; strong foothold in my apiary through the interchanging of frames, at - tempts to cure it by a single shaking only, robbing, transmitting it by handling during the day, healthy colonies after those contaminated ones, and I got so overwhelmed by its rapid and sweeping spread, that the leas Infected colonies, among them the Carniolans, could not be attended to during the season, and consequently were allowed to go untreated into winter quarters. But they perished in the middle of February during the Arctic cold wave (— 34°F., February 13, 1905). The other Carniolan colony (queen from New York state) met a similar fate.

            <seg id="p233">I failed to effect permanent cures. I blamed myself for following too blindly the theories of such apircultu-al corphaei, like Hutchison and others, who persist in proclaiming one set of starters or full sheets of foundation to be sufficient to do away with the trouble. In probably all such cases the infection recidivated. No relief, until the McEvoy treat - ment was adopted, and followed up to the letter, and the bees were put on two sets of frames of foundation, and in addition fed afterwards with Cl naphthol-beta solution, as set forth in my article in August, 1907, mbraer of the Beekeepers' Review.* This much about the ravages caused by the malignant foul brood in my apiary. Fully three years of the fiercest fight and untold hardships and slings were required to entirely get rid of this, the bubonic plague of the bee's habitat. In 1907 I finally triumphed over the scourge. Sweet was the triumph, but it was bought dearly. I have paid the price. To the credit of the Carniolan race let it be stated that, owing to their remarkable vitality, they offered a tougher resistance to the developmnt of the pest and held out somewhat longer against its devastations than Italians did, which a good deal sooner fell prey to discouragement and to gradual depopulation. Ea few of my Italian colonies can be found quite a sprinkling or ilan blood, acquired since 1905, and these bees are invariably doing id work in the sections, and winter well. THE CAUCASIANS. Heralded with great applause was the recent introduction Into this country of the so-called "stingless" race of Caucasians. They have stings and can sting. They were originally imported from Caucasus in South - ern Russia, a mountainous country, lying between the Caspian and Black Seas. Not a little has been said in their favor, some authorities, who have lad them on trial for years, ranking them as averaging equal to Italians n honey producing powers, and testimony to their exceeding gentleneaa las been furnished by such prominent experts, as E. L. Pratt, Dr. D. Sverett Lyon, E. A. Morgan and others, still more graphically before our own eyes at the live bee demonstrations in a wire-cloth cage, so ably conducted by our secretary, Frank G. Odell, at the honey house during the Nebraska state fair week of the last few years. I resolved to give them a test side-by-side with my other bees.

A veritable mass of burr and brace-combs was found upon the opening of the hive. I placed the Caucasians again on trial in 19U6 (queen from Tennessee) with anything but satisfactory results. E'houph my hoi&gt;es proved thus to be an illusion in these two instances.

I concluded, however, to steer clear of this attractive •Ity, so long as views regarding it remain so varying and contradlc - , and the relative merits undetermined. ■ tuin, my attention was called to reports announcing the worth of variety again. During the Nebraska state fair in Lincoln in 1907 I found on exhibi THE HANAT1AN BEES, OR RANATS. and for the purpose of study and experiment I invested in two queens of the new strain. They were reared near Lincoln, this state, from mothers imported from their native home, Hanat, a district in the Transylvanian Alps of South Hungary, east of the river Tisza. E? and 1909 were years of failure with us, as far as white clover is aed, and even from Knotweed (Polygonum perticaria) the seere - nectar was short and scant, owing to a continued drouth in the part of August and in September. Many colonies scarcely main their own. Eng those few that were found in prime condition in the fall and I with abundant stores for winter, were the Banatian bees, which ion gave me a surplus of nicely finished sections: 26 in 1908 and 1(19 with no increase.

Eiie Pi'kpcme or State Conservation. — Much has been said during the two or three years concerning federal control, inter-state relations and s' rights. This has, to some extent, drawn the attention of the peo - ple away from the more basic problems in conservation. A few states have been very Insistent upon their right to control national resources within their borders. This has resulted in great injustice to the federal departments, especially so, when Its officers did not show due diligence in the fulfillment of their duties. Those who were prevented from secur - ing valuable timber land, coal land, and power sites at much less than their value have, as a rule, become opponents of Federal Control, vithdrawal and evaluation of certain National coal lands was, some saw it, an act of injustice. The National resources have rapidly passed to private ownership and the control of the various states. No one will doubt the wisdom of this procedure, when it is viewed as a whole, but a little study of the matter will show defects in the plan. The re - sources should have been studied and evaluated preparatory to the pass - ing of title from the public to the individual or company. This would have served to protect the rights of the general public. It would have i dualized matters, and, without doubt, some of the most valuable assets would have been retained by the Government subject to lease for a rental or royalty. Such a plan if adopted soon enough would have as - sisted in preventing monoplistic control. In some cases, the state has been easier to inflrence than the federal government and this may have caused a few opponents of federal control to advocate state rights.

One of the first purposes of conservation in the state is to make an inventory of the resources. This to serve as a basis of development. In iiska we propose to determine the extent of our stone, clay, sand, water power and soils of various types. Following this investigation will come the study of problems connected with the development of than icsotiiMs. Among these studies and developments are those of the dry, ■MMtf, wet and rough lands; also those of forestation, fruit raising, soil ion, crop rotation, etc., all of economic importance. The matter of gathering reliable information relative to the conditions affecting the opeiation of the various industries and the publication of the same through lectures and state reports is no small task. So the subject state conservation starts with the natural resources, sucn as soil and wuter, and extends through the development of these along proper lines to the questions of social and educational matters of the state. It stands for good seeds in cropping, pure breeds of farm animals, and for efficient citizens. To cover this demand the Conservation Com - mission has outlined a large field of inquiry and study. The aim will be to learn the facts of each problem and to make them known without at - tempting to overdraw or misrepresent any of the conditions whether favorable or unfavorable. The natural conditions in our state warrant a fuller development of manufacturing and transportation industries to supplement the agri - culture, however, but few realize this fact. We have been too content with raising wheat and hogs and shipping them to markets in other states, not realizing the importance of developing home markets. The need for closer co-operation between country and town in this all-round development of the state is just beginning to be understood.

Time was when the railroad man didn't think that the farmer ought to live, and the farmers thought thai the railroad man. and the railroads, CHght to do business for nothing. Today we have come to realize that these railroads are absolutely neces - sary to n.aterialy develop this state, and that they are essential to our comforts and luxuries; and the railroads recognize that the more proa l&gt;erous and the more thrifty these farmers the greater will be the dividends. So we each have a mission to perform, and each must per - form it with the help of the other. We have out here a common destiny, and to work out this destiny we must go hand in hand throughout thi» journey of life and either succeed or fall together. In the position which I happen to be occupying at the present time in the state, I am a representative of no special interest. I am here as an advocate of the general development, both from a human and a material standpoint, of all the things that ought to be brought forward at this time in our state. There came up the other day a question which it seems to me is important in the state of Nebraska as well as in every state in this Inion. It is the problem of the conservation of the human rights — that is, that we should look at this conservation problem from a human standpoint. In other words, are the children of the generation now coming up being as properly looked after in this state by the state authorities, by the people in general, as well as they should be? For instan&lt;&lt;\ I had a committee of the legislature on finance and ways and means the other day in my office talking with them on the importance of furnishing a library for the great state institutions. I called the atten tion of that committee to the fact that down at the Girls' Industrial Home at Geneva, where I had been a few days before, I found HO girls that practically without a library; that they have no opportunities for getral reading and information. Contrary to my expectation when 1 went down there, instead of finding these girls looking dissipated, way - ward, uncouth and untractable I found them cheery, happy, cleanly ana well-contented. So far as general appearances were concerned I found them looking like the average high-school girl; that, as a general thing, they were not sent there, for the bad things they had done but to be taken away from bad surroundings; sometimes, vicious parents, de - bauched and demoralized. So the state of Nebraska should to a larger extent help in the solution of this important problem. The proposition will be difficult, for the tendency of every session of the legislature here and in other states is, when it comes to doing everything that will build up and make the highest type of citizenship, to refrain from voting ade - quate funds for this purpose. Isn't that strange? These pirls oupht to have access to the best reading there is to be had anywhere, but they are deprived of it. So we find similar conditions in the Boys' Industrial Home at Kearney. There are 175 boys without </seg>
            <seg id="p240">L'-MI I'KlMKKMN, - NKISIiASKA STATK BOABII OT AliKH I I.TURK. the benefit of a library. If we would look at some of these problems thai confront us from a human standpoint and commence taking care of the embryo citizen from the beginning it seems to me that we would be prac - tically starting at the right source. Now, there never has been so much attention paid to the development of the individual being nor so much recognized of the mission of the individual in the life of this nation as there is at the present time, because, If you notice, every time we have a state or national association of this character, it is for the welfare of the individual and the future of the country. It is because we art builded upon the theory that each Individual citizen of this state and na - tion will be of the style of architecture and quality that the Architect la himself; consequently, it is of vast importance both from a material and spiritual standpoint to see to it that we have young men and youn* women coming on in this state who are receiving the right kind of moral and mental training. So, I say, that down in this penitentiary, the state of Nebraska could do no better thing than to invest several thousand dollars in a library that would give to these people the opportunity to get abreast with the times so that they may know what is going on in the world, that they may be Informed and have opportunity to read these in - dustrial problems that are presented for solution in the state. I hope that this congress will look into this matter. Yon can do a great thing for the state of Nebraska toward passing some resolution in favor of the purchase and use of such books well selected under the super - vision and direction of the Nebraska Public Library Commission. You could do a great work to the state of Nebraska and probably help get through the legislature an appropriation for a library that can be used by the inmates of the penitentiary and other institutions. It is well known that if these boys and girls had the right kind of books put be fore them, selected with the view of their particular tastes and disposi - tions that we know they have, that a good general, moral uplift could be developed in these institutions. I was talking with Doctor Cornell, the health commissioner in Omaha, and he told me that the great percentage of mortality In infantile life wag due to the milk supply that conies largely from the country. Thert 1b another important problem of conservation that presents Itself for solution. This could be prevented in a large measure if we had an appropriation in our legislature large enough to put a force of experts out through the state examining these various conditions and the general milk supply before it came in for consumption. A great work of conser - vation could be done along this line it seems to me, in saving the in - fantile and the future citizen life of this state. These are some of the important propositions which occur to me from a human standpoint that this Congress should take up and resolute upon; discuss and try to build up a public sentiment for the maintenance of the Pure Food Commission. This pure food law has only been in existence since 1907. It seems to me that we would spend at least as much for the promotion of pure food </seg>

We overlook the spiritual things of this life altogether too much. We overlook conditions that dwarf and blight the children of the pres - ent home and the children in these institutions. We are becoming en - tirely too material. We are experimenting upon crops, seeds and the productivity and fertility of the soil. That is a very good thing, but we can and ought to do other things too. I do not wish to be confined to any one-sided proposition. Our state should be developed in an all-round way and In all of its departments. Bii hear it often said in Nebraska that we have nothing but an agrl - al state; that there Is nothing here but agriculture. My friends, anufactured products of this state are nearly equal in value to the productions. We have an agricultural state second to none in the , and these agricultural products are only about equal to the manu - factured products; yet, if we would turn that same indomitable energy, skill and foresight Into certain manufactures in the various towns and cities of the state we would soon have one of the greatest manufacturing ttes in the Union. We should do more than raise wheat, hogs and tie and ship them out of the state. I was in consultation with Mrs. McMurphy, one of the pure food in - spectors, the other day. She read to me an article she had been called upon to write. In the course of the discussion of certain things she mado the statement that of the billion eggs that were marketed, from 30 to 50 per cent of them were destroyed, becoming of no value as a food product. I asked, what is the cause of it? She replied, negligence in taking care of the eggs at the time they are laid; they become filthy and dirty. She went into detail and said: "All of this couid be prevented if we had enough pure food inspectors to get out into the state and Inspect these things and show the people that it is absolutely a matter of dollars and cents to them to keep the nests clean." So here is another problem, and we could go on indefinitely, but I have not the time now to do so, and 1 feel a little diffident about it, because on all of these matters that I have siiggested I know there are eminent authorities and experts right here to talk to you before this congress adjourns. There is one other thing I want to suggest and that is the subject of good roads. It is one of the settled propositions in this state that every - body is for good roads, ready to talk it and help build them. We have the sentiment clearly established in this state for good roads, and before we get through with this proposition there will be developed a central idea, a system for construction and maintenance. The reason we have made slow progress is because everybody had an idea of how a good road ought to be built; there has been no definite system and organization. You cannot carry on any great business without having a scientific or - ganization behind it; without some one central thought in its develop - ment. We have come to the solution of the problem of good roads, but there ought to be a closer and more general relation between the cities </seg>

STEPHENS, KBEMONT, In the fall of imii'.i eastern Nehiaska had the woist roads that the old settleis could icmember in the history of the s'ate. It gave the good road enthusiasts a splendid cpiMirtunity to create sentiment for i&gt;erma - ■eat highways. The lainy wtathcr commenced a'-out the time the corn was ready to market. The bottons went out of the roads and for two months it was practically impossible to move cro;is. As an example of the deficiency of the cio;&gt; movement at that time, the Xye-Schneider Fowler Co., who o.ierate something like two hundred elevators, one day in December received from all their stations only fifteen hundred bushels of grain. This stagnation at a time of year when grain should have been moving by the millions of bushels, affected the whole state. Merchants in the towns were not doing enough business to warrant them to keep their stores open. In fact, the whole commerce of the state suffered tremen - dously during this period of bottomless road t. Farmers were marooned at home in a sea of mud unable to get into the fVlds or onto the public highways. They were so discouraged that even if they could have got - ten to the trading points they were not in a humor to spend their money and all of this stagnation was caused by the want of permanent roads </seg>
            <seg id="p243">neiu roads this condition of the weather would not have affected com - merce because farmers would have moved their grain and done their marketing at a time when they were not able to get into the fields. Thus it would make it possible to do the work of hauling when no other kind of farm work can be done. During the crop growing seasons when thf public roads are usualy in good condition, farmers are busy in the fields and cannot possibly use the roads. It therefore becomes imperative that they have permanent roads that can be used in the fall, winter and spring when work in the fields Is suspended. Good roads are not only a blessing In the matter of utility but in encouraging and stimulating social life as well. The greatest period of social activity in the country is in the winter at a time when the roads are at their worst. Hut the vital arguments that will affect most men are those that show the economic valiu' of permanent roads. Een I was a boy my father secured the construction of a permanent ■ran town to our farm. His tax for this road was $860, to be paid alliui nts of $100 each yrar. Many people objected to building this n account of the expense. They could not see how anyone could foolish as to want to build a road to the market at this great ex- They prophesied ruin to all farmers living along this road, of the neighbors were M angry they would not speak to my father aa a result of it, but the road was built and enough cord wood was hauled over that road the first winter to pay our full $800 and leave us money besides. This was not only true of our farm but all the farms along the road. It is a direct credit to the stone road, because without it we could not have marketed the wood in the winter and in the sum - mer, when the roads v ere passable, we hau to work in the fields. Aside from the advantage to us, the good folk in town got their wood cheaper because there was no wood famine in town on account of impassable roads. These were not all the advantages. Every acre of land along this permanent road increased several times the tax that was assessed against it. This object lesson was so effective that the county commissioners were kept busy for many years afterward building stone roads in every direction from town, some of them reaching out twenty miles. These stone roads really made the county rich, strange as it may seem, since they cost so much money. At this period almost every farmer was poor and the land very cheap. Those same farms today along those stone roads have been built up and are selling at from $100 to $150 per acre. There are ■cores of possibilities of development on a farm that has a permanent road to market where there is one that has a dirt road that is impassable at a time when it is most needed. Land along this road that had been wi i-th anywhere from $10 to $20 per acre jumped to $30 and $40 per acre within two or three years after the read was constructed, and it was poor land tco, and 1 wonder even today at the n arvelous increase of land that .ipparvntly so noil -productive. Kut dairies sprung up along the road. p&lt; ople built houses in the country, truck farms thiivi'd, and in fact vari - ous kinds of agriculture were developed along this road which was Dot </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 thought pasbable. all of which contributed to making this land more valuable and desirable. Practically all of the development within a radius of ten miles of this county seat town was along this road rather than along the clay loads extending out in other directions where the land was even better. There can be no better object lesson of the value of permanent roads than can be traveled every day rain or shine than was this stone road of my boyhood days. It was not to exceed two yearn after this first stone toad was constructed that petitions were filed for more roads leading out from town in other directions and every year aftei that the board of nparvtMH ordered a new macadam road constructed or an extension to an old one made until the county was thoroughly traversed by macadam roads. It is difficult for a farmer along these macadam roads to understand how the people of a community having any business at all will spend the major part of their lives along roads that are unfit to travel from one-third to one-half of the whole year. Dodge county once bonded itself for $100,000, as did many other Ne - braska counties, to encourage building of railroads through it. It was a good thing to do because without the railroads the development of the country was impossible. Today the average cost of moving freight over railroads in the I'nlted States is one cent per ton mile; the average cost today for noving this same freight over dirt roads is twenty cents per ton mile. It would cost approximately seven cents per ton mile over petrolithlc or sand clay roads, such as are within the reach of the people of Nebraska. If it were vise in the old days of poverty to bond the county for $100,000 in order that we might secure a railroad to further agricultural development, then it would seem that it is equally advisable now to s;&gt;e-nd a considerable sum of money toward securing permanent roads uver which perhaps three-fourths of the railroad freight must ■i oner or later move. It is estimated that if roads could be secured ilia would enable the farmer to haul one-third more to the load than they now haul, it would make a saving in the United States on grain and cot - ton alone to the sum of $10,000,000 and this would be only a fraction of the enormous saving that would be made to the entire country if all ibe wagon freight could be moved over permanent highways. The average farm of 160 acres in Dodge county will have in the course of a year sufficient freight to move over the public road to and from the market to amount to 175 tons. The cost according to govern - ment estimate of moving ths freight an average of six miles from the market would be $210 for each quarter section of land. If this labor cost was reduced from t aenty cents per mile to seven cents per mile It would be a saving to every 160 acres of land of practically two-thirds of this $210, or $140. Estimating four farms to the section, there would be a naving of witgnn freight alone, to say nothing of the pleasures of having good reads, of $560 a year, which saving in ten years would build a mile ap - proximately of the best permanent road fronting each of these farms </seg>
            <seg id="p245">Fh are probably or almost the equal of macadam when properly con - rted, these roads could be constructed and maintained for ten years tonsiderably legs than the saving on moving the freight alone. In addition to this, every acre of land fronting on a permanent road would be enhanced in value anywhere from $10 to $25 per acre. SOME EXPERIMENTS. Good roads are as necessary to agricultural prosperity as air is to life. A country cannot prosper without transportation facilities of all kinds adequate to handle its products in a prompt and economical man - ner. This applies to all kinds of transportation. So long as this rule of growth is applied to railroads even the most stupid agree, but when it is applied to wagon roads over which three-fourths of the railroad tonnage moves you will find that many men who are ordinarily shrewd fail to ■M the great need of good permanent wagon roads. Somehow they can t.i t imagine a good road — a road different from those they have always used. Within a few miles of Fremont there was a stretch of one mile of sandy road — so sandy that about one-third of the automobiles would get stuck in the worst place. This piece of road is a part of the famous over - land trail. For sixty years poor dumb beasts .struggled through that tand with heavy loads. For sixty years men lived along this road and 'irev. their crops to market over it. Children were born, lived long lives, ani died alongside of it without ever seeing it worked. Now and then 8 one more public spirited than the average would dump a load of e in the worst sand which was found to do much good. Beyond o one troubled themselves about this famous road that was first i out by great, swaying, creaking teams of oxen bound for the i Gate. Last fall, thanks to our inheritance fund, we spent $1,750 on tile of road and covered it a foot deep with gumbo, which had to be &gt; lees than a quarter of a mile. Now it is a fine hard dirt road witn the surface nicely covered with sand that blew in — just enough to take (he stick out of the gumbo. Now thin'k of the sixty years dead and gone, ana the men and women and the poor beasts of burden that have strug - gled through that sand — all for the want of a bagatelle expense of a few hundred dollars. How can one explain it except on the ground that we didn't know — we didn't understand— we didn't get around to do it? But the road is fixed now, whkh could have been fixed by any of the fifty i'oad supervisors that have come and gone had anyone told them how to do it. Now a -farmer can haul twice as much grain to market as he could before the sand was covered. In other words, the cost of wagon freight passing over that is cut half in two at one stroke. It doesn't require a philosopher to tee this argument. * Nor is this all. For sixty years a great hill obstructed the trade re - lations between Dodge and Saunders county — the l'latte river bluffs; but last fall, thanks to the law that permits a city to levy for road improve - tnens outside its limits, this hill was cut down, the grade greatly reduced </seg>

This road wa» so bad the farmers living near Fit - were turned to other towns that were blessed by nature with better road conditions. The natural obstacles are now nearly removed that the &lt;iossing can be counted only as a trifling barrier to good trade re- Hig north of Fremont is a good grade across thp valley to the Bluffs Fren:ont has kept in shaw with a King drag, but portions of this as of very poor soil — gumbo — which was most difficult to keep in n rainy weather. Last year we built a mile of sand-clay road over mniiest part of this road under the direction of the Government loads Department. This road is now almost as good as a brick ■nt in Fremont, and it will grow better every year as it settles and ik spots are all worked out by securing the correct mixture of sand uibo. Gumbo and sand are ideal materials for a sand-clay road Ese examples are working wonders in converting our people to the if good roads. This, too, in the face of the usual short sighted folk o|'h&lt; sy failure while the work of improvement is in its formative These criticisms are often made by bright men and thru the *&gt; hich leaves many people who do not knew the real facts in is to the value of the improvements. I'., it a farmer with a heavy load struggling through wet and soppy loads is converted as soon as he strikes this sand clay mile that the rain Has not disturbed. There his load rolls over a hard sand clay mixture almo. i equal to a pavement, and since the sand prevents the clay sticking in the wheels, which wculd cause ruts, the road is packed harder every i in:, a wagen passes over it. All that is needed to keep it perfect is a drag t&gt;. keep the surface smooth and rounded so it will pack evenly all leaving no depressions to hold water. It was most startling during the construction of this road to listen to the criticisms of men of good average sound sense. Every man usin^ i his road could remember when the gumbo was rutted half hub dee;&gt; and each wheel of his wagon carrying fifty to one hundred pounds of gumbo b 'tween the smokes. Ytt en these fine summer days when all roa?s were good he could not see the sense of working six inches of sand into the sur - lace of this sticky mile of road. So he would swear and talk about it all day around town telling hew the road was being ruined. Now one would think that a man with any observation at all would have seen the wisdom of mixing sand with gumbo even if he knew nothing or road mak - ing. But it seems that such an assumption is wrong. Nothing but an actual demonstration without cost to the average users of the roads is sufficient to n.ake good roais enthusiasts out of them. It is now a ■ I fact in the minds of many people who have seen with their own &lt; yes these experiments, that all a clay road needs is a little sand, and ail a sand load need is a little clay to make them gcod reads when nni'cily handlid wiih a King drag. Think what it would have meant to them in la!' ir had they known this fifty years aco? </seg>

GOOD ROADS AS A BUSINESS PROPOSITION itV PKOf. HIM K. ( 11 ATBl'HX. Main of the most important things in the world cannot be measured iy (he ordinary medium of exchange. For example, good health, the clr we breathe, the education we get in the common schools, the roads we navel upon. We know and realize that poor health is a direct source of expense and indirectly the cause of great money losses. Men have riven thousands of dollars to preven' the er don of high buildings v bi&lt; h would cut off the supply of sunlight and fresh air. The lack ol an education Is so great a handicap to the individual and so detrimental to the welfare of the nation that we pay our biggest taxes to keep up the school. Bad roads are stagnation and even death to trade and com men e, resulting in large losses of time and money. While we realize all this — the great blessing that comes with the enjoyment of these things ur:d the serious disadvantage their absence means, we are not sufficiently sii&lt;iiiaintt-d with the underlying data and do not well enough understand the Intimate relationships existing between the various interests of life 1 a definite value in dollars and cents upon any one of these useful and ne. essaiy elements. In fact they can not have the same value for all ■ins. Local conditions, individual differences, sentiment and many other t lements must enter into any one's estimate of what a thing is worth, lint notwithstanding this many efforts have been made by roan e&lt; onomists to evalua'e the benefits of good and the losses due to bad loads. For instance, the Tnited States office of Public Roads several ytais ago published a bulletin in which an effort was made to show that the cost of hauling on the country roads was annually about $9oo ihmi.ooo; ana that with uniformly good roads there might be a saving of over StiOO, 000,000. Pi of. Chase, of our own state, makes a very plausible cal - ii laiion to show that the average Nebraska farmer would save each year (147 if all the roads leading fioni his farm to his market were dragged after each lain. He aleo calculates that the average farmer would make a further saving of $30 per year by tiding broad tires upon his wagons. The chief value of good roads is not in the actual saving ever bad icads in dollais and cents, but they are desirable for the same reason that a man buys a carriage or a carpet; that is, they appeal to ones desire for (omfort, for beauty, for pleasure. In an early day Nebraskans lived in so'j houses, they could do so today if they so wished. A man could go to ihurch wearing overalls and jumper but he prefers other styles of clothing. In a great many things economic considerations are of minor imuoitance. But as I am asked to speak upon Good Roads as a Business </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 UNOS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF A&lt;;RK'I I.TIRK. Good roads decrease the cost of transportation by allowing larger loads to be hauled or by a saving in time. It is upon this argument that Professor Chase's calculation mentioned above Is based. Good roads save in the wear and tear of wagons, harness and horse- Good roads and the possibility of daily marketing allow the cultivation ops not otherwise profitable— of intensive farming, if you please. I lave known whole families to support themselves upon small patches of it ten acres by gardening. Other crops would require forty acres and still others one hundred sixty acres. As a rule the smaller the num - &gt;f a. rt-s required to support a family the more perishable the crop ■ aUed and the consequent greater need for good roads and quick market- Ing. The same rule applies in mercantile pursuits. Novelties that are hable or liable to go out of style and left on the merchants' shelves I Tin* the greatest profit, while the staple article that is good year after &gt;iar is handled upon the smallest margin. The safer the investment the smaller the interest charges. Still few large fortunes are made without assuming some risk. We occasionally read of fruit crops bringing $500 per acie; strawberries, water-melons, tomatoes, like high returns. Ordi - narily with such crops the risk is great. Early frosts, insects, drought, glutted markets, and bad roads may cut down the profits. The safer we ■ an make such crops by improved roads and stable markets the more per - sons will M&gt; into this intensive farming. The rural districts due to the iuing of farms brought about by the use of Improved machinery and the prosperity of the farmers, are decreasing in population. Make ii profitable to diversify farming and raise more perishable crops and ln - .-i&lt; ad of farms growing larger and the population smaller, the farms would become smaller and the rural population larger. Good roads give a wider choice in the time of marketing.

REPORT OF DRAINAGE DEPARTMENT. Torre is a great deal of land in the state that should be improved by drainage, both by open ditch and tile. The purposes are: (1) To relieve flood situations; (2) to carry the water off marsh and swamp lands; (3) to lower the water table. Drainage is not confined to bottom lands, nor to any one soil region. It is being installed on the Loess liains and in the Sand hills as well. At present dredges are opening anals on bottom lands along the Missouri, Logan, Klkhorn, Platte, Salt Creek. Little Nemaha and the Big Nemaha. The Conservation Commission is now mapping the wet lands of the state. The Conservation Congress working in conjunction with the •Mission has organized a Drainage Department with J. C. Robinson. president; L. W. Chase, secretary, and the following committeemen: D. ■ vens, R. E. Grinstead, J. B. Weaver, R. B. Snyder, N. B. Randall, K. \V. Badger, Joseph Roberts, A. N. Munn, J. P. I-atta, E. C. Simmons, and H. T. Vauck. BL. W. Chase, secretary, reports the Drainage Department of servation Congress as follows: The drainage section of the con - ■I on the afternoon of the first day's session. The meeting was ended and a great amount of enthusiasm was shown. Mr. L. C. Lawson, president of the Nebraska Farmers' Congress. &lt; ailed the meeting to order and in a very good natured and spirited manner kept the session running along smoothly. Mr. F. H. Allen, ot Kinsman, O., a practical dialnage engineer and farmer as well as extension man for that state, was the principal speaker of the after - noon. Mr. Alien illustrated with some of the most simple and yet plain illustrations how drainage affects the soil during both wet and dry sea - sons. His talk in part was about as follows: "Tile drain the land, thereby getting all surplus moisture out of the ■ oil and at the same time obviate the nuisance of open ditches. It is not essential that land be so wet that water stand upon it, either above the suriace or within the surface, for it to be benefited by tile drainage. l 'he water in tiaveling down through the soil to the tiles leaves paths ant roots and low forms of animal life to work in. The roots dry </seg>

P sects and roots, become filled with air; rain (alls upon the surface ! ground, sealing up the upper pores of the miniature channels, the rain gradually settling through the soil forces the air down ;h and out by means of the tile. After the water has settled ;ain, air enters the pore spaces, more water falls and forces the air ;h the soil again. The operation is continually passing on, thereby aerating the soil. It opens the soil up so that it holds more moisture man previously, it becomes so porous that the roots can work in it far 8 than before drainage. As a proof of this statement that drainage the soil, causing it to expand and become porous, Mr. Allen he, audience to many illustrations of where tiles had been laid bottom of slews for a number of years and that although the one time Just above the tile was lower than that on either side lie aeration incident to tiling caus d the surface to stand from five t inches higher over the tile than on elher side. "It is shown by laboratory experiments that soil finely pulverized or plowed holds more water than packed soil. As a rule, land too wet during part oi the year has a very hard packed soil; consequently it does uot hold very much water during the dry part of the season. When such a soil is drained ii becomes so much more porous that it holds a much greater quantity of water. This is the explanation of why drained land withstands the drouth so much better than that undrained." After Mr. Allen s speech, Mr. Dan V. Stevens produced quite a little enthusiasm by giving his experiences on his land west of Fremont. Mr. Stevens bought a iarm in that part of the state and soon after It arced that it was entirely too wet; having heard of drainage, he inves - tigated the matter and got some drainage men to come up from Mis - touri and put in a drainage system for him. This system was put in with the tiles about 20C feet apart, and they were not well placed, con - sequently the benefits to Mr. Stevens' farm were not great. However, he did not become discouraged, but soon after got an engineer to go over the work, lay out the system again, put in a larger outlet ditch and lay as many more tile. The result is that Mr. Stevens has made one of the best producing farms in the state out of one which was of such a nature that it was nearly impossible to get onto the fields part of the &gt;tar. Mr. Stevens thcught that his home place was one of the best illustrations there ever was, of endeavoring to do drainage without a drainage engineer in charge of the work. Last year wag the first time the land had been cropped to corn since the tile was put in. The yield from 125 acres averaged something over seventy bushels to the acre. ER. E. Grinstead, one of the oldest engineers in the state, and who has absolutely given a great deal of his time for the bene - dralnage, told what had been done in the southeastern part of e along the Nemahas. The work in that section of the state is at different from that referred to heretofore. It is concerned illy in straightening and opening of stream channels and may </seg>

It will prevent overflows and make land, unusually fertile, worth from |125 to $150 an acre. Furthermore, a stream crossing such a farm should traverse it in the very shortest possible path, thereby permitting the farmer to use far more of this valuable land. There is no doubt that there is more of such bottom land in the state to be benefited by the straightening of streams than there is that can be irrigated. The sooner the farmers learn this the sooner the men who own the creek bottom farms will commence to pay Interest on the money they have invested. the close of the session Dr. D. V. Stevens took the chajr and the tte Drainage Association was organized with the following officers: C. Robinson, of Waterloo, president; L. W. Chase, Lincoln, secretary. After the drainage session adjourned, Mr. Allen went out over sev - eral farms in Lancaster County and pointed out several farms, both pmooth and rolling, that might be improved for more than the cost if tile drained. REPORT OX THE SANDHILL REGION. The Soil Survey will finish its preliminary survey in this region within three or four years, mapping the dry valleys, wet lands, lakes and dunesand lands.

KK'l'OKT OP THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON LAND EROSION. 'if the large problems in our state is that of checking the erosion of soil and land by wind and water. A committee, composed of N. A. rteiiKt8on. P. B. Barker, Mr. Filley, L. S. Herron, R. J. Scarborough and ( ' W. Weeks, have begun a careful study of soil wash and land erosion. Their report to the Conservation Congress is condensed thus: TJn - ehecked water erosion is a menace to the continued prosperity of the xnutheastern half of the state, an area of approximately 40,000 square miles, and to a lesser extent in the High Plains section of the West. The muddy streams of eastern Nebraska are notorious, for they have impressed visitors with their lack of beauty. Our own people bars Lecome accustomed to them, have accepted them as a matter of course, and have not studied them from an economic standpoint. Until recently we have not awakened to the fact that every cubic foot of muddy water that empties into the Missouri or its major tributaries represents a loss of part of the very basis of our wealth. Erosion caused by running water may be outlined under three heads: 1. The cutting of the banks by streams. 2. Gullying of uplands and slope lands. 3. Soil wash from slope lands, whether steep or comparatively P,t of erosion by streams cutting their banks is not always elated. Fairly careful studies made of the work of the Missouri at four places along Nebraska — Santee, Decatur. Bellevue, and -■how a loss of at least 5,640 acres since 1880. This land was all grade, ranking with the best in the United Stptes in productivity. Thus a money value of about $600,000 has been suffered In four places along our border. Similar losses are annually occurring at other places tthe Missouri, and along the Republican, the Blues, Nemahas, and Elkhorns. The control of channels is a problem deserving &gt;n.

Thou i of farmers in Richardson, Nemaha, Pawnee, Johnson, Gage, Otoe, r and Douglas counties are being scared by the encroachment illies and ravines. The southern counties have similar conditions, et the relation of soil type to erosion is imperfectly understood, many truths have been worked out. Toward the solution of these problems the committee suggests the need of studying carefully the soil texture that will offer effective resistance, the maintenance of organic matter in the soil, rotation of crops, cultivation of legumes, proper toil tillage, contour cultivation, and the use of cover crops such as grasses, alfalfa, shrubbery, fruit trees, and forest trees, should be E fully studied, for it is known that these are effective weapons nst soil erosion. There should be more effort to check gullying by use of straw, brush, etc. rill wash from steep slopes is another phase of the problem that attention. Outside of the sandhill district there are few counties do not have many steep hillsides under cultivation, where erosion has removed the soil to the extent that common agriculture is unprofit - able. The presence of barren hillsides in Nebraska is generally unnec - essary, even criminal. Where slopes are too steep for retention of soil under intelligent management, the land should be used for grass, fruit or forest trees, according to conditions. Education along these lines should be undertaken by this congress. Wind erosion is active in the areas of lighter soils, particularly in the western part of the Loess region, in the transition zone from Loess to sand hills and high plains, in the Sandhill Region and in many parts of the high plains. As examples of the first class may be mentioned the counties of the southwest extending from Red Willow and Furnas to the east and northeast, including such counties as Clay, Fillmore and York; of the second class, Custer. Greeley, Holt and Antelope; of the third class, the counties In the Sand Hill country; and of the fourth class. Banner, Box Butte and Sheridan. In these regions the same I roblem is presented; i. e., how shall the soil be held in place, resistant tc the shift of the wind? The answers will vary with soil and climatic conditions. Unorganized efforts have given some hints of the solution, in the protection afforded by proper tillage, cover crops, and grasses. E'e have thus but outlined the field. We trust that this statement cause you to realize the need of devoting careful study toward the Ion of the problem of soil erosion. REPORT ON FORESTAT1ON. The I «mf% »— committee includes C. E.

Every farmer should be encouraged to make the planting of for - trees one of his annual duties. 6. Even the owner of a small town lot should be encouraged to plant trees upon his little plot of ground. I In justification and explanation of the foregoing principles we sub - t the following additional statements: A forest area is by no means so much idle land, but is constantly m cumulating values, just as is done by our savings banks. Properly handled, a forest area will maintain itself for centuries, yielding an income in timber and fuel, to say nothing of the protection from heat and cold it affords to man and beast. in nearly all parts of the state, especially in eastern Nebraska, there are many remnants of the natural forests, often near enough consider - able towns, which should be set aside for public parks and playgrounds. Even in the country there is no valid reason why the county or the township should not become the owner of certain forest areas for the use of the public. t\Ve here urge that planted parks be made by every prairie commu - ty, beginning with the school grounds, the church grounds, and the adsides, and eventually including more formal parks for the general « of the whole community. We call attention here to the worthy example of J.

S. Christy, reported the following: 'The experience fruit-growers in general in Nebraska has proven the natural conditions, favorable for fruit production in the state. Pioneers found splendid wild fruits growing along almost every watercourse, extending out into the state where protection from forest fires was Sided. They found wild plums, grapes, crabapples, raspberries, black ies, etc., growing in abundance and their quality being even better i wild fruits of other sections. The varieties were also greater, and *• from the annual prairie fires, conditions seemed ideal for the »th of these wild fruits." Pn. J. C. Fremont, the pathfinder, noticed this indication of natural favorable conditions for fruit development, and wrote: "The best indications of the richness of the Nebraska river (Platte riven country is the luxuriance and prodigality of wild fruits, found growing wherever there is the slightest protection of trees. Our men taihtred and enjoyed more than twenty different varieties of plums and grapes, all very much finer than any we had ever seen before. There were also many varieties of blackberries, raspberries, dewberries, and other kinds of fruit new to us." General Dodge, in one of his reminiscences of the building of the liiion Pacific railroad, said: "We were seldomly without an abundant supply of some sort of wild fruit during the time we were working in Nebraska, throughout the season from June till September, and from the Missouri river to the Kooky mountain foothills. The rich lands produced the finest wild fruits we have ever seen, with the finest flavor and In the greatest varieties." Sice that lime there has been great development in fruit culture I state, and today almost every farm-house has its orchard and garden. Many mistakes have been made and many orchard and fruit plantations have not been profitable to their owners. We aowever, that the natural conditions are not responsible for these ions, but that lack of information as to varieties best adapted, ju, culture, etc., and neglect of these important factors, which are airy to successful fruit culture, are usually responsible for failures. Ethe other hand, we find that in practically all of the states where varieties have been planted on suitable locations, and where tbly good care has been given, that apples, grapes, cherries and fruits grow remarkably well and bear fruit of good size, color lality. Plantations of commercial proportions have been very profitable undertakings for those who have given the business the required atten - tion. We find this true, especially in the older counties along the Mis - souri river. Orchards, vineyards and small fruit plantations are proving </seg>
            <seg id="p259">suited for fruit culture than for any other use. The soil is rich in potash, phosphates and other elements favorable to the best develop - ment of .both wood and fruit. Its texture la such that It readily absorbs the water of heavy rains and melting snows. Then, due to its sponge - like nature, it is able to hold sufficient moisture in reserve. The topog - laphy of the land also provides for good drainage, both soil and air, which are important factors to fruit production. We believe this section of Nebraska Is unexcelled, everything con - sidered, by any and equalled by few of the widely advertised sections of the country for commercial fruit growing; that with the same energy expended in growing apples and some of the small fruits commercially, better returns for the Investment may be secured than Is secured in many of the famous fruit sections of the country. The advantage of being from 800 to 2,000 miles nearer the principal market than western fruit sections, thereby saving the growers much in freight charges and Cfrom the long haul that the western fruits are subjected to, are great advantages to the Nebraska growers. ei a result of the success of a few commercial apple growers in this m who have practiced thorough and up-to-date methods - of hand - their orchards, a revived interest in this business is shown and ations now point to more thorough methods being practiced in handing the old and heretofore neglected orchards and to more plant - ing of orchards for commercial purposes. During the seasons of 1109 and 1910 growers reported returns of from $100 to $1,000 per acre from their orchards. ■pyards and small fruit plantations have also proven very profit- Numerous Instances may be cited where such plantings have re - from $100 to $800 and $1,000 per acre. Ethe natural conditions favorable to fruit growing in this iec - ■owers by observing four important factors; i. e., cultivation, , spraying and heating, can make crop failures very rare and Iness a source of great profit. I recommend that this congress go on record as favoring and iging the development of the fruit industry in eastern Nebraska fullest capacity, and that the attention of the farmers and prow - fruit In general be called to the much neglected condition of the Is and fruit plantations of the state and that they be urged to stter care and culture to their orchards and fruit gardens.

It is probable that scientific improvement of seed can only be under - taken under the direction of scientific experts, but when the stock of this seed is once secured, its dissemination will depend on a large num - ber of pure seed farms to be scattered over the state and be under some form of official inspection board for the benefit of the growers, to enable them to maintain the quality of their seed, and for the benefit of pros - pective buyers. It would also be a great help in carrying on a cam - paign for better seed and grain of better quality if a universal reform could be instituted by the buyer in the custom of paying a fiat price for all grades of grain at the local market. Let the interests give the seed growers and the Experiment Station proper support in this matter and progress will be carried on much more rapidly than it is possible at .present Every man in Nebraska is either directly or indirectly Inter - ested in the problem of seed selection and development, and if proper support be given by all interests, Nebraska not only will have no diffl culty In conserving her present enormous resources in cereal and crop production, but there will be greater production within the next two REPORT ON FARM ANIMALS. The congress committee, consisting of H. R. Smith, J. A. Ollis. Jr.. K. Htickingham, .1. H. Gain and F. C. Crocker, reported the following: Your committee on farm animals deems it wise to make the follow - ing recommendations, all of which are of vital importance to the devel - opment of the state in general and the livestock industry in particular: EThe land in many parts of the state where a continuous crop ng has been practiced now gives evidence of depletion. Methods i be at once adopted to restore such land to its original state of fertility to even make It more productive than it has ever been before. This ran be done by the intelligent rotation of crops and by the feeding of a large part of the material grown to farm animals, thereby return - ing to the land approximately 85 per cent of the plant food removed from the soil. The 15 per cent lost from the farm in the form of meat can be more than replaced by the growing of clover and alfalfa in the rotations. Nebraska needs many more farm animals than are now to be found within its boundaries to consume such hay and a large part of the grain grown on the farms. 2.

To this end we n il the larger use of improved types — animals which through gen - cns of careful breeding possess inherent qualities that make them I their purposes better and more economically than the unimproved, need throughout our state a greater number of pure-bred draft stal - i of good type and more that are sound — that may produce a more efficient class of horses to do our work and to sell to eastern markets. We would produce a better quality of meat in a shorter time if there were in the state a larger number of pure-bred beef sires possessing good size, conformation and quality: more bears capable of transmitting to their offspring size, thrift and quirk-fleshing qualities, and more rams of mutton-producing tendencies. The increase In our butter output could easily be doubled if we could bring to our state more dairy bulls from heavy producing families, 'selecting from the offspring only the really profitable types of cows, which can be done by the use of scales . nd the Babcock tests. t. In feeding our farm animate we could increase the yield of meat or milk from a given weight of food from 25 to 50 per cent by the gen - eral use of well-balanced rations. To this end we would recommend that a greater effort be made to get the information we now have before cur people and to secure new facts, through experimentation, that may be applied with profit to the practice of feeding. 4. In eastern Nebraska the greatest hindrance to an Increase in the number of animals kept on our farms is the lack of pasture. During ihe winter months we waste approximately two million tons of corn - stalks. We could make this waste winter roughage offset entirely our shortage of pasture by preserving it in the silo for summer feeding, and we would recommend the larger use of silos as ronservers of our food supply. A large part of the cornstalks could be preserved for fall feed - ing as shock corn. The complete utilization of this well-known by - product in one or both of these ways would add nearly $4,000,000 annu - ally to our state's wealth. 5. Alfalfa is proving to be wonderfully well adapted to the soil and climate of Nebraska. As a source of protein it is the best of all foods at prevailing prices. It is so valuable for supplementing our great corn crop that we urge strongly the extension of land devoted to this crop. This plant Is capable of making Nebraska one of the wealthiest states in the 1'nion if given the attention it deserves. fYour committee also urges a greater dissemination of inform* - jncernins the proper construction of farm buildings. Tuberculo - uld be less prevalent in our herds of cattle if more attention were to proper methods of ventilation. The sanitation of hog houses be much improved. More attention should be given to the sup - plying of well bedded, comfortable quarters for all classes of farm ani - mals. It will mean a better conservation of our food supply, because animals unduly exposed and compelled to stand in muck most of the time </seg>

Pin the matter of diseases, it may be said that tuberculosis is ■ry prevalent among the cattle and hogs of eastern Nebraska. It I prevalent in dairy herds and breeding stock of the beef breeds, ate Veterinarian reports that 28 per cent of the dairy cows sup - milk to our cities have this disease. In some of our breeding of pure-bred beef cattle as high as T&gt;0 per cent have reacted to :h&lt; tuberculosis test. Ten per cent is nothing uncommon according to the report of the State Veterinarian. . About 3 per cent of the hops which come to our markets have tuberculosis and are condemned as unfit for food. This is approximately true of the cattle which are slaughtered in our packing houses. If cattle were sold subject to in - spection this disease would be greatly lessened. According to our pres - &lt;nt system the packer stands the loss on condemned cattle and hogs, he necessarily spreads this loss over his entire receipts, and the result is the owners of cattle free from the disease pay fqr diseased cattle owned by those who will make no effort to clean up until forced to do go by a system of selling subject to test. If we can lessen the disease among cattle we necessarily lessen it among hogs, for it is transmitted from cattle to hogs. Our loss from swine diseases amounts to from SOO.ftOO to 500,1)00 hops annually, mostly from cholera. By the use of the government serum treatment it has been found in this state that 93 per cent of the hogs which have been exposed to the disease but not yet afflicted with it may be saved. The manufacture of serum should bo greatly increased so that the loss from cholera may be re - duced to a small figure. There are fifteen states that now have laws providing for the issuing ate licenses to those stallions which are properly recorded in certain approved stud books. In fifteen of these states, provision is also made for a veterinarian's examination of the stallion in question. The laws of some of the states, notably that of Wisconsin, are bo formulated that unsound stallions are disqualified. In other states, for example Kansas, unsound stallions are not disqualified, but the diseases are enumerated on the certificate which is posted for public inspection. Our Nebraska law and that of two other states makes no provision for an examina - tion for soundness. Any stallion, therefore properly registered, no matter how unsound he may be. perhaps possessed of diseases which are readily transmitted to offspring, is allowed to stand for public service. ■ this law is amended to require an examination for soundness, aska Is certain to be made a dumping ground for unsound stallions from states where they are disqualified for public service.

Freely interpreted, the field assigned to this committee includes all the native animal resources of the state, and it may be said in regard to these that we know comparatively little about them, and we also know comparatively little as to their utilization. It Is to be regretted that so many animal forms are being exterminated in the I'nlteJ States before any opportunity has been allowed to determine the possi - bilities of their cultivation and development. What has been done has in that the cultivation of certain fur-bearing animals is feasible, carried on under proper conditions by those who are skilled in this is highly remunerative; also that among our wild animals are those h can be regularly marketed and add greatly to our food supplies, I bringing in the aggregate large sums to those engaged in their lion and shipment. A score of years ago none dreamed of ih represented by the shells of our fresh water mussels, bn there has been built up on this a great industry. This committee d urge that this congress, and that the Conservation Commission en ' and assist as far as possible in investigations calculated to develop extent of the native animal resources of the state and to place e the people of the state the possibilities offered by them. It is true that the commercial possibilities presented by these re - sources are not at all comparable with those offered by the major agri cultural industries of the state; but as it is not that which we earn hut that which we save that makes us rich, as it is the by-products which furnish profit to many industries, as it is the extras which bring luxuries within the reach of many families, so it is that in the aggre - gate the development of many lesser resources all add greatly to the wealth of our state. And it is exactly such neglected sources of wealth, pmall though they may be Individually and easily overlooked by those whose eyes are fixed on the larger things, but considerable in the aggre - gate, that conservation work finds its peculiar opportunity. It should also be pointed out that among our native animals are such as are injurious, menacing either our health or our property, and in tlie interest of conserving both it is equally important that these forms be studied and proper means for their control and elimination be dis - led and made known. Our game animals are of great value to the state for the food they lurnish to our people, for the opportunities they give for recreation and healthy exercise, and for their value to the state in attracting to it sportsmen from outside, who leave in the aggregate a considerable sum of money with us. The ideal handling of the game and fish problem is such as tends to maintain the supply at a level, the amount killed being such as to absorb only the increase and not materially cut down the stock. If the stock be depleted, a closed season, systematic supervision, artificial prop - agation, the intelligent introduction of game birds, and the planting of fish, are the remedies. To this end we must have an efficient game and </seg>

Such a commission is already in existence, but its f(n&lt; ii in-.v is greatly reduced by lack of funds. The efforts of the state t.kme and fish couiniiBtioners to secure the necessary support for their work should receive our hearty endorsement, and all those interested in the preservation and development of the game resources of the state should lend their active influence to secure the proper legislation. Ire have in the center of this state in the sandhill region a vast lory which must in the nature of things be for many years to come opulated, and which is capable of being developed as a great ing reserve, a source of large revenue to the people living in that in. In northern Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and other regions aited States noted for the fishing- and hunting which they d, the caring for the visitors who come for these purposes engages attention of the people for a considerable portion of the year, and affords a large increase to their annual income. If the people of the sandhill region of this state could be awakened to the possibilities af - forded by the region, and, in co-operation with the State Game and Fish Wardens, would take steps to conserve and develop these resources in that area, they would lay the foundation of a large and permanent source of revenue which would be bound to increase constantly as our coun - try develops and such areas become less and less numerous. The vast amount of game which these prairies afforded a generation ago is greatly reduced. The time is not far distant when in order to secure any hunt - ing whatever it will be necessary to resort to such areas as the sandhill region of this state, and if the people of that area, by preventing inter - ference with the breeding of the game birds during the breeding season, Dy preventing the shooting of immature birds and allowing no hunting until they are sufficiently strong that there is an even chance for the bira as against the sportsman, and by limiting the bag in such a way as to prevent danger of extermination, will anticipate that time and tpare for it, they will be conserving one of the most important nat - 1 resources with which nature has endowed them. Nebraska is not a Elate in which fish abound. It is one, however, which as we increase the number of artflcial ponds and the area of im- Itounded water for irrigation and other purposes will afford constantly greater and greater possibilities for fish culture. The increasing value of foodstuffs in this country, and especially of meats, warns us that we must conserve every resource tending to increase such products. It is highly desirable that our people be made acquainted with the possibilities in the way of nsh culture afforded by the opportunities referred to above, and that they be encouraged to make the greatest possible use of these opportunities. The value of birds as insect destroyers has been emphasized so often that it seems unnecessary to go into an argument at this time to prove the point. We believe that we are all in hearty sympathy with every effort that may be made to protect our native birds, which are almost without exception beneficial. </seg>

ADDRESS BY HON. HENRY WALLACE. President National Conservation Congress, Editor of Wallaces' Farmer. Mr. President Ladies and Gentlemen, and Farmers of Nebraska: Students of living languages know that there is a perpetual change being made in the meaning and use of words; the more extensive the language the greater the number of changes. The meaning of words is changed, sometimes degraded and sometimes elevated- We drop out some words and introduce others and we give new meaning to old Ces. In the early version of the English Bible in the new testament I find the following expression, "I, Paul, a rascal of Jesus Christ" I suppose it was so written because at that time servants were termed rascals. So we have the word "servant" now, instead of the word "rascal." There is not a person who can not prove everything right by quoting Scripture. "Let everyone speak," not his own but his neighbor's way. Then, we have another word, "weal." When that word was first used in our language it meant "welfare" but in modern times the mean - ing has been changed and the word "weal" has been changed into "wealth." The word "conservation" furnishes the finest example of the change in the meaning of words. You will look in vain in any dictionary for the meaning of "conservation" In the sense in which we conserva- </seg>

The word conservauv.- in politics stands for maintaining the statu quo. Some of them stand for retaining all ibat is good, another for giving another meaning. We have the expression "conservatory of music," the idea being to retain the science and the practice of that noble and beautiful art. Conservationists have put a new meaning in the word ■conservation. They have not eliminated the Idea of saving from waste, but the idea of a wise use. When we talk about conservation of water we don* mean that these streams shall flow on uselessly as they have done for thousands of years, but we mean that they shall be chained and put to work for humanity. We mean they shall not be absorbed by a few and made a mighty engine of a person of the many. [Ap - plause.; When M talk about "conserving our timber" we don't mean that it shall grow on and on as it has been doing for thousands of years, nut being improved, and when we talk about the "conservation of the forest ' we mean treating it as we would a grain crop or as we would a herd of cattle. We mean disposing of the rot, dispose of a portion and keep the rest growing and always keeping the forest full. When Ki about "conservation of coal" we don't mean to retain it in the the_ government, but we mean a division of it in such tracts an be mined economically and that it shall not pass into the corporations who will use it for their sole benefit. We don't ii one-third of it shall be taken and wasted. So, the word ttiou" has a variety of meanings, but they all come to the cen - the wise and economical use of the resources of the govern - .'e mean that the government shall not sell another acre of coal, nor give monopolistic rights on another stream of water; that It shall not allow the timber to be slaughtered and sold for the imme - diate benefit of the man who controls. We mean that ultimately the s of the United States shall be kept for a wise use and not allowed to Oil up with silt nor allow all the mining places to go into the bands of corporations. When President Roosevelt went down the Mississippi river it is stated that his boat was tied to a railroad track while he went ashore, mean - ing thereby, 1 suppose, there was no place where he could land, it hav - ing been given away to coroporations. That is what we mean when we put a meaning into the word "conservation," that it is to make a wise provision for the use of natural resources. When a new idea takes hold of men they must either coin a new word or put a new meaning into an old one, and is just what we have been doing in the use of the word "conservation." That is what we conservationists stand for, meaning on the one hand to avoid the waste, on the other hand to avoid monopoly and that it shall always be used for the future as well as for the present, ui-ill noon get to a point where we will see that conservation does not limit Itself to these resources to which the government has not passed </seg>
            <seg id="p267">When the government has once passed the title the duty of conaer - vation belongs to the states, and the states will discover that they have the i«wer to conserve when the people become filled with the idea. 80 it is that when a man has title to a farm, it is not absolute title — he is a trustee and he must use it for the benefit of his fellows. I do not know how it is here in Nebraska but over in Iowa we don't allow thistles to grow alone the roadside nor in a man's field, for thereby It becomes a menace to the neighborhood. On the same principle they don't allow a man in the city to build a wooden house in the business district. You can not build a wooden sidewalk, you must make it of brick or cement. And they are getting to the point where they don't want a man to spit on the street. I Applause. | Why? Because when consumptives spit on the street more damage is done to the people in the spread of tuber - culosis, except it might be out in the country. So, the state has the power to conserve. It is just and it is right, gentlemen, whether we practice it or not. Every man is his brother's keeper. It is the old story of Cain and Abel. Cain denied that he was his brother's keener. bwill state to you, gentlemen of Nebraska, that Nebraska has two assets, and I will now speak about these tonight, first the fertil - ' the soil, second, the efficiency of your men and women. Farmers complain of the sins of the lumbermen; that they have ■one into the woods and picked out the best timber, took the best part of the best trees and left the rest for the fire. You have done the sain&gt; - thing yourself. Bring no accusation against the lumbermen. You never bought a Btick of lumber in your life in any lumber yard but what you paid far less for it than what it cost to grow it. You never will In all your life buy a stick of lumber hut what you will get it for less than what it costs to grow it. Lumbermen have just gone in and selected the best trees and left the rest to go to waste, which waste is now con - sidered very good lumber. You have done the same thing. Early in the nineteenth century came the soil robber. This land naturally came into the iiossession, first, of the pioneer, then the man who farmed it to make money and to live easy. He built a sod house, let his cattle run on the range. He took hay from the government land, and when the tiller of the soil came along the pioneer moved on farther After that the land fell into the hands of the soil miner, other - wise known as the soil robber, who farmed it for the unearned incre - ment. Most of you made your money, not by farming, but by taking the unearned increment. My dear sir, your grandfather, with his old mold board plow or with his grain cradle, would Have had to live to be as old as Methuselah to be able to do anything like the work on the farm to rob the soil as it is done today. The fertility of the soil has been mined and wasted. The greater the improvement in machinery the more rapidly we can mine the soil. You understand that this min - ing of the soil in the Mississippi valley has had world wide influence. </seg>

Every mother's son of you wanted it. M l.uilt up these great centers to a point where they can not get even room for their business and have to locate their stockyards and car barns from fifteen to twenty miles out In the country. Whenever prt one of your stock cars in those stock yards you may not be able to get it out for a month. The long haul which was all right, enabled you to build up these large centers. The average rate of a common freight car is twenty-five miles a day, little faster than the old canal boat, a little faster than the old Canastota wagon hauling dry goods across the Allegheny mountains to build up these great citier,. We mine the fertility of our soil too much. We will have to quit be'ng miners of the soil, we of the soil robber breed, some of us thorough - breds and some of a lower grade. We must get into our minds the idea that the soil of this great state of Nebraska, is given to us for our children and for our grandchildren down to the remotest generation. Further, that if we are to be a great nation we must be a people of great farmers. There was no nation of fools until the people began to move to town. That was that was the matter with Rome. Virgil himself, with all his poetry, did not succeed in bringing the people back to their estate. Then there began the greatness and decline of Rome, for Rome fell not by the arm of the farmer. must, therefore, conserve our soil fertility as a most priceless possession We are learning to do without timber. We can, in a pinch, get along with less iron and steel. If we don't have stone we can make It almost as good as nature made it — but we can not live without agri - cultural products. We can not live without beef steak and pork. The greatness of our nation depends upon maintaining the fertility of our ■oil. Another thing, and I am done, for I know you want to hear Mr. Hlanchard. You cannot have a great soil without you have great men to tfll it The virgin soil, rich with the fertility of ages, will not make Lgood governor. You must have a good man for governor. When I Ik to men of the city they say the hardest man to get along with is the farmer. He will do such mean things that the merchant and the lawyer would never thing of doing. Farmers do a lot of little mean things. I know of a farmer who would fill his hogs with butter milk before he shipped them. I rejoice in my heart that we don't have to resort to things Hke that. We must seek to be square men, doing bnsi - ness on our honor, doing business in the sight of the Lord and not in the sight of men And you professors in college should teach your students that anything won unfairly Is dishonest; that the aim of life is not to get through it by hook or crook but to do things squarely and honestly. The aim of conservation of the fertility of the soil and the conser - vation of manhood And womanhood are matters, of education, "Just m the </seg>

You know in some respects we are about as mean a people as live on the earth. We starve our preaeh - -;iviiig them a half of what they ought to have; we make martyrs nf their wives. I don't know of any greater martyrdom than going on mtry circuit In the west. We starve our school teachers, we exact nf them the impossible. You cannot build up splendid manhood, you can't build up intelligent farmers without education. We are now be - ginning to understand that education is not the heritage of the few but that it belongs to all men everywhere. Of course, you can't get along without agricultural education, and you must consider the means by which the development of our nation is brought home to the people in the language that they can understand, and the great point that we have now before us is to educate our farmers. You can not restore the wasted fertility of the soil without education. You can't ever build up Nebraska as a great state without educating the farmer. You can't build up the fertility of the soil without brains. Some one asked a painter how he mixed his paints and he replied, "With brains, sir." Not altogether the knowledge of the class room, but with common sense, that power of observation, that ability to turn to account what we see and hear. That is what makes men great farmers. Of course, there are many things to be considered. You can't build up land by selling everything off it and thus retain its fertility. I receive many letters every week in the year asking what they can do to restore wornout soil. I have never yet had one of those letters from a country where they produced dairy products, or where it was a stock farm. Every - thing that tends to build up a large stock interest tends to build up a l&gt;etter soil as well as a better manhood. In this country one of the great branches of farming is dairying. No man can succeed in dairying unless he is a gentleman. It is said that you must speak to a cow as you would speak to a lady, and that means with kindness and sympathy. Our great hopes are first for the boys. There are a lot of old fel - lows too old to learn. "They are joined to their idols; let them alone " You may as well let them alone because you can't pound anything into them for the reason that they know more than you. Our great hope in Nebraska and Iowa, in the matter of conservation, is in the boys and girls. Let us see that the next generation shall be wiser than we, more intelligent than we, more efficient than we. You can't have great boys unless you have great girls. You can't have educated men without educated women no matter what that education costs. There is not a township in Nebraska that cannot afford to spend $200 a year for every quarter section to have the right kind of schools. [Applause.] You will never build up this state until you are willing to put your money into it. The time has gone by for cheap skates.

HV 1 . .1. HUM IIAWI Of THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. Eln his illustrated lecture before the Conservation Congress C. J. nchard of the reclamation service of the United States Department be Interior gave esi&gt;ecial attention to a discussion of the North Platte gation project. Illustrating his lecture with splendid views of the :p dams, reservoirs, and the beautiful country that is to be watered the canal, he spoke as follows: iraska has a profound interest in the North Platte irrigation pro - full development will add to the crop producing acreage of the state and area greater than the total cultivated area of Rhode Island. It insures the permanent settlement and growth of a region heretofore regarded as of little value, and which, by reason of its un - certain rainfall has remained almost undeveloped. A new and brighter era is dawning on this section of the state, an era of assured and abundant crops, of continued and increasing prosperity. "No other river in America, and but few others in the world, Is of more importance in irrigation than the Platte river. Its sources are in northern Colorado where the Rockies attain their highest elevation. It drains an area of 90,000 square miles in three states, and upon Its perennial flow approximately 2,000.000 acres are dependent for crops. It offers insurance against drouth for 14.000 farms, and with 12,000 miles of main canals and ditches it is guaranteeing crops valued at more than ♦80,000,000 annually. A conservative estimate of the total value of the Irrigated farms in this drainage basin is not less than $200,000,000. Without irrigation the value would not exceed 10 per cent of this hln the drainage basin of the Platte is found the largest area </seg>

(All of the natural flow of the Platte. river has long since been ap - liriated. Private capital has overlooked no feasible opportunity for eloping the water supply, and an enormous outlay of money has been made for great reservoirs and many miles of canals. The field remain - ing belongs peculiarly to the government because further extension of irrigation involves enormous expenditure and offers little in the way of ultimate profit to the capitalist. Wanting no profit, and owning large tracts of undeveloped land, the government, which asks no interest, la alone qualified to carry out the broad and expensive plans required for the complete utilization of the floods of this somewhat turbulent stream. "These apparent facts had much to do with the coming of the fed - eral government into the field. The passage of the reclamation law In IM1 found the reclamation service quite well equipped with data relating to the discharge of the Platte river, and also with relation to possible rm- Mti-^. I'lans were quickly prepared, surveys were made, and in as short a .time as possible actual construction was begun. First a contract was let for the Pathfinder dam, the principal and most important engi - neering work connected with the project. This structure, which is one of th&lt;&gt; great dams of the world, is located three miles below the junction of the Sweetwater and North Platte rivers, in a narrow canyon varying in width from 60 to 100 feet on the bottom. The vertical walls of granite S several hundred feet above the river. The site is forty-five miles Casper, the nearest railway station, a fact which naturally added ly to the difflculities of construction and to the cost. All machinery, ies, cement, etc., had to be transported by wagons across a forbid - desert, waterless, dusty and with poor roads. "The contractor's power plant was set up on the cliffs above the dam and the work of exposing the river bed was commenced. Bed rock was found at twelve feet. Cable ways were swung across the canyon. Giant cranes were set up in the bottom and along the sides of th« canyon. A huge tunnel was excavated in the wall around the dam to carry the normal flow of the stream. "By day and by night the desert stillness was broken by the dull roar of dynamite, and huge mases of granite were blasted and fell into the river bed. The heavy cranes lifted and placed them in their beds of cement in the dam. Slowly a beautiful arch of masonry began to rise from the river bed, regular in its courses and graceful in its outlines, as such a monument should be. Floods came, and with mighty force swept over it, but left it unharmed. The contractors simply waited for them to subside, and then took up the work again. On May 2, 1909, the Pathfinder dam was completed. "This structure is 218 feet in height, and 500 feet long on top. Its </seg>

The remarkable features of the structure as a conserver of water will be made clear by comparison with other storage dams of this country. The Pathfinder will control absolutely the greatest flood ever known in the North Matte. Its reservoir capacity is 1,025,000 acre feet, or con - siderably more than enough to cover Rhode Island a foot deep. The new Croton dam of New York, which cost $7,631,000, or nearly six times a* much as the Pathfinder, stores less than one-tenth of the water. The Wachusett, New Croton and Ashokan reservoirs in the east, cost $22,557, - t nearly nineteen times more than the Pathfinder, yet their total capacity is only a trifle more than half of the reservoir on the Platte. Ethe present time the stored water is utilized only on the lower of the project. A comparatively narrow strip of land in eastern ng is served. The area broadens as the canals pass into Ne - braska. Later a very large acreage in Wyoming wiU be supplied. All this region for years has been given over to the cowmen. It is rich in historical incident, occupying as it does more than 250 miles of the old overland trail made by the gold seekers in the mad rush for the gold diggings of California. t "Winds and rains have worked capriciously with the buttes and Kb, carving them into grotesque and freakishly shaped forms. These ural monuments are rich in pioneer associations, and their names interwoven with the early history of the region. "The irrigable lands are typical of the great plains region. Slightly rolling upland and prairie, with long strips of level valley. For a gen - eration this has been the free common for the stockman whose herds and flocks have had access to it and have overgrazed it. Its population was small, the lonely ranch homes isolated and devoid of homelike attractions were always far apart. In those days the stockman wanted no neighbors, and as a rule opposed the cultivation of the land. "To bring the water to the land it was necessary to construct a diversion dam in the river about 150 miles below the Pathfinder. This is known as the Whalen dam, and diverts the stream into a large canal having a total length of nearly 100 miles. For many miles the canal p— ci through difficult country, with shifting sand hills around which canal construction was expensive. In places the canal passes through rock formation, and in others it was necessary to line the canal with cement to avoid loss by seepage. Across the deep couless the water is carried in underground siphon or overhead flumes of concrete. Sub - stantial bridges have been built with concrete abutments. All structures of importance are of concrete to insure permanence and efficiency. From the main canals and laterals the farmers' ditches lead the water to the irrigated lands. A remarkable transformation has taken place in the last three years. In 1904 one could count the houses within the radius of vision on the fingers of two hands. Today this same section looks like an old settled country. More than a thousand homes now </seg>

Here was a picture to content to gratify our pride in the achievements of our fellow man. "The landless man has come into his own, and one of the chief purposes of national reclamation has been accomplished. In this golden harvest which was being garnered there was promise of future comfort and the blessings of contentment. Eor was prosperity alone reflected from the farm. In the numerous and villages in the valley there were numerous evidences of the well being. Artistic and beautiful homes attested the coming of times. Wide streets shaded with fine trees, broad lawns and flow - plants spoke of civic pride and fine ideals. Prhe economic value of a work like this cannot be measured in rs and cents. The desert made fruitful offers a home and inde - ence to the homeless. Our nation's greatness has its foundations in home of the man whose feet are firmly planted on his own land. Creating additional opportunities for our citizens to own their own land is a national duty too obvious to require argument. In every home thus established there will be a yeoman ready to answer his country's call in time of war, or to take his part in the councils of the nation. In these homes there will be born citizens who will constitute a bulwark against oppression, and who will impress upon our national thought the fine sense of personal honor, the higher Ideals, and the lofty purposes which are developed in the land where every man has his heritage, a home and the opportunity to make himself independent. Rsay to you that the day is not far distant when the nation, yea, Sole world, will be glad to listen to the exultant voice that comes out the conquered desert. We have only to mark the trend of ) events during the past ten years to realize that the west is becoming more and more dominant in national affairs. Conservation, the commission form of municipal government, the broad, progressive ticies, the cleansing of political machines, these are all western, and y threaten to sweep the whole country. 'When the vast expanses of our treeless plains and the vacant and voiceless valleys of the mountain region shall have been reclaimed; when ten million families shall have been provided with homes of their own; when blossoming orchards and fields of golden grain replace the wastes ot sand and sage-brush; when the stirring sounds of a thousand Industries break the age-long silence of the desert, who is there here whose vision is so clouded he may not look behind the veil of the future and see a civilization better, higher and nobler than the world has ever known?" </seg>

The department sent two men to California to 3tudy this problem. They looked the situation over and after studying it in detail found how to help in the best possible way Fruit pickers, I think 100 in all. were selected and trained. Then when the picking season began the proper methods were followed. This method was extended through - oat the state by demonstrations.

Then, when a new project was opened for settlers from many states, Mr. Hunter was ready to assist in the solution of their problems. An urgent request came for the de - 1 art men t to help solve these problems. Hunter had found where settlers had made a success and where they had made a failure. He put the facts in the form of a bulletin which cannot be printed fast enough to meet iht present demands. In New York they once had a lot of land that was very unpro - ductive. Those people were in hard luck. They sent an organized effort down to Washington, and made an appeal to the Secretary of Agricul - ture, to send them help to see if something could not be done. The request was granted and Munroe was put in charge of the work. He knew a good farmer as well as a bad one. He was like Hunter of the West, he knew trom long training what the success of farmers wit due to. He also knew why so many failed. In two or three counties he he farmers growing crops according to new methods. He advised in regard to certain rotations. He introduced new seed corn, new pot a - and in three years he had made such a success that last year Colonel Roosevelt went with him and visited those sections and saw what the government was doing to help the farmers of New York. In South Carolina we have a man who is co-operating with the state iie|i;irtment of agriculture. He has an office in the commissioner's office; he is co-ogierating with the state college and the experiment station. He is co-operating with every organization in the state and he is producing results. Last year he went down near the coast where an appeal came for help Their lands were worn out and they could not grow crops. Our man took in the situation and being an Illinois man and familiar with drainage he gave the farmers a practical application of what tile draining would do. and the next year a great crop of cotton was raised on the exj&gt;eriment field. Today hundreds of farmers in that county who have not yet done so. will put in tile drainage. In another county, near Columbia, the same man was sent out to help a farmer who wanted a dairy. The problem was to grow a crop to feed dairy cattle on land that had for a hundred years been cropped to cotton. Our man planned a system to meet the demands of the dairy. I was out there myself three years afterwards and I found alfalfa growing — some - thing that I didn't think could be done. There were fields of oats and wheat. A little further out on the red clay of that state a man asked for help in the matter of producing a crop for hogs. He was a city man and didn't know anything about hogs or a crop system. (Once in a while it is a good thing for a city man to go out into a section of the country where they have lost the art of farming. ) Our man went out </seg>

He found an old worn out peach orchard in which were legumes. This was dug up and spread on a few acres. The city man was M impressed with the proposition that he Bowed forty acres, contrary to Mr. Smith's advice. He carted out five wagon loads of this soil, spread it on every acre that he sowed »," he said, I am going to see whether that soil has anything in it or not " I saw the fai m afterwards, and it proved the theory. It was how is this MTftM of the Agricultural Department secured? Pint the problem for investigation must be one of importance. Next, i. latter hew inimii taut it is. money enters into the proposi - tion — that is why we co-operate with the Experiment Stations. Where the problem is important enough we put up part of the money and you put up part of it. The way the department looks at it is, "here is aomeihing to be done for all farmers and if possible we will do it." The plan calls for a willingness on the part of the co-operators and half of the money. An organized band of farmers can do far more, not .only with your own Experiment Station but with the Department of Agricul - ture, under organization, than you can individually. Consequently, if the farmers organize and make a request for these things, if there is a possible way of putting a man in the field to solve the problem, it will I was in Dr. Bailey's office at Cornell University in conference with him and a representative of the Lackawanna Railroad for the special purpose of devising a plan to put men in the field in the vicinity of ItifiKhamton to help the individual farmers. The railroads were inter - ested, of course, for obvious reasons, in the upbuilding of Binghamton. The university was interested for the state of New York; and we were ■ sted from the standpoint of the nation. During that conference Dr. I'ailey introduced to us a fellowship organization he had worked out in order to get at a certain problem. The organization was com - posed of fruit growers and farmers They came to Dr. Bailey's office and said, we ueed the men for investigation, and so the arrangements were made for co-operation lietween the college and the people. That was only the beginning of what proved to be a good work. Another illustration is one that has interested me during the last year not only because it is rather new but because it has such wide bearing on certain communities. It is in Texas on a section of country known as the Black land. For forty years those farmers have been growing crops on that land, all the time without leguminous crops at all. It is rather unusual to find such a condition where farmers grow cotton, wheat, oats and corn in rotation without legumes. Our man, Mr. Young - blood, went in there. He had been raised on black dirt and did not think it needed any leguminous crop, and it was unusual to think of a </seg>

The black land is naturally alfalfa land, but they could not grow alfalfa for I simple reason that the roots rotted. The Experiment Station had tested out this thing and our own people had not tested it out, but •thing had to be dene. These farmers had paid $150 an acre for the We got the help of the Experiment Station, and they supplied he leguminous crop plants and seeds grown in this country and some irted from other countries. Mr. Youngblood went onto the land, ed out twenty-five of the best and most conscientious farmers in the ion. He spent the summer going among them and watching how the different crops were doing. At the end of the season he was able to report the experiment a great success and a solution of the problem. (Applause. | THE COINTRY LIFE COMMISSION. KV HON. HKNKY KlIIACt. Mr. PTttidrut, Latins and Gentlemen: gill try to condense under two heads what the National Commis - nund. and what your commission of this state should find. Our al Commission did not make any exhaustive investigation, and not do so in three months. We merely looked over the field and, unately, its findings have not yet in any official way been pub- We organized, sent out 500,000 circulars asking information on a a.inilxT of leading subjects such as Sanitation, Education, Transporta - tion, Co-operation, etc. We received about 125,000 replies, some of them rather interesting. We received a vast amount of circular reports covering everything connected with life in the open country. We made a tour of twenty-nine states, and it is the result of this tour alone that has reached the public. We found lack of sanitation everywhere — hook - worm in the South, and one of the best results of this commission has been that we have been able to proceed in reclaiming and cleaning up the South. We found butcher shops in the East; we found men who sold their cows with tuberculosis; we found where hog's entrails were fed to other hogs and where rats frequented and carried the poison to the neighbors' farms. So, don't shake your heads and say that the Southern people are wormy: you have a great problem at home. On the subject of education we found dissatisfaction everywhere. In twenty-nine states the dissatisfatcion was so universal that after visit - ing three states we knew what was coming. The only state in which dissatisfaction was not expressed was Nevada. There were young girls </seg>

We heard hat th.-se girls preferred town life; they did not say a word it but left the impression that town life was better than country Ve found dissatisfaction everywhere with transportation, some - expressed justly and sometimes expressed unjustly. Everybody favor of parcels post. These are some of the things we found. Ps commission, let me say, gave its time free; the expenses were $5,8*0 (» little less than the expenses required to send one man to S. Senate); $5,000 of this was paid by a party who is spending wealth in just such enterprises as this: and the other was paid by the commissioners themselves. It was a bad thing to make people do this work for nothing and board themselves. Roosevelt said: "You can't have any money: your expenses will not even be guaranteed; you most work for nothing." In fact he said that "the greatest amount of work I get done is from men who work for nothing and for the love When the commission made its report Roosevelt sent a message to eongrems asking them to put PMM in the hands of Secretary Wilson he paqpaM of tabulating and digesting the information gathered as '.ad no time to put it in such shape that it might be available for investigators and social life. A suggestion same to me the other day in a most interesting report. and surprising to me because I had not heard of it, from my old county, enterprising president of the Faimers' Alliance and an enter - is superintendent of schools and another party had sent out a tract n&lt; ever;, rural school in that county asking raparta of the number of boys and the number of girls: the number of boys who fed hogs, cattle, or ■keep: the ininilx-r of l&gt;oys that can harness a horse, and the number that can hitch him up; the number of boys that do chores; the mini if Klrls than can wash dishes, can bake a cake, the number that ran cook u meal, number that feed chickens, and M on. In the next the town people took the matter up, and the merchants of the iu»m&gt; not 11 1 1 a report, but it took in everybody, as to the amount of money paid out for necessaries: the amount paid for luxuries by the ay - •race farmer and by the average citizen in the towns; the amount or l&gt;er cent that it costs to distribute farm products in the towns; the num - ber of merchants that sold on tick: the number that required cash; the number that paid interest; the number that received interest, and I don't know what all. It is astonishing to note the difference between the amount cf expense of the farmer and the amount of expense of the townsmen. The townsman spends three times as much in luxury as the farmer: that is what you would naturally expect. It seems to me that the townsmen and the farmers should get together in the matter of ■wlweai interests. I often think of that scrap just outside of the Gar - den of Eden with Adam's dog and Eve's cat — they got Into a fight that </seg>
            <seg id="p279">town and the people of the country. In the town the people don't want any parcels i«ost; the farmers, wherever they have sound judgment, want It. They are all afraid of the big stores, department stores. The merchants complain of the farmer whenever he has rash he sends It to Chicago, hut whenever he wants credit he comes to them. It Is a important matter that you people in Nebraska get together, get ac - quainted, and get in touch with each other, the people of the state, and ■ fellowship. That reminds me of a story that a fellow was telling me the other day — he said for a good many years he was studying the difference between fellowship and acquaintance. He had an acquaint - ance, an uncle, a Scotchman, that he never liked, but as a matter of eaaacientlous duty he went out to see him: it was on a cold, raw day The old man met him by a miserable peat fire: he hardly asked him to sit down. After a while they got out the table, spread the cloth and the old man and his family sat down to their meal but did not ask the visi - tor. To his surprise about ten o'clock the inner doors were opened and there the table was spread for the old man's family and his intimate friends who were in fellowship with them. He said that they were Just acquainted on the outside, but on the inside there was fellowship. e other words, the farmers are not only not acquainted with IMMDple. or city merchants, but are not acquainted with each other no wonder that the boys leave the farms for the town, because the must not be an acquaintance but he must have fellowship, have to stop making boys go to town: you must make farm life All over the country you will find four preachers where one M to be: all looking out for rich, respectable people who come in the neighborhood; the church should be open for everybody: there is more fighting between people of the church than there is fighting the devil Why not make the rural church one of social life? You can if you get the right kind of a preacher. I am spending some money in that direc - tion myself in one of our theological seminaries in trying to turn the attention of our preachers to business life by putting $150 as a first and second prize to the person who can apply the principles of Christianity to actual human conditions. | Applauw. I I am nominating the nu-n who are to be the judges, leaving out all church members and putting In large-headed business men to decide who will get the prize. I am doing it for the simple purpose of eventually getting preachers started off right, to get more practical preachers and less theology, so that when they go to the country they will start in with enough knowledge to ask sensible questions to farmers to lead the farmer to believe they know something about it. and then the farmer can give them credit for all the theology they want to know.

If you do the work as planned you will have next Saturday afternoon to play baseball or football [Applause], and if I were doing it. I would have the preacher there to umpire the game. You can do this best when you get the centralized school, and the farmers instead of moving to town and die from eating too much by not working enough, will find it is just as cheap to build a house on the farm as it is to build it in town — and cheaper, and when you get that idea then we will have the socialization of rural life. You will never do much good until you come to know each other socially. I was reading an article not long ago where it stated how the farm - era took up this subject and settled it fcr their good. They decided they should have a place to meet, and would organize a club. They thought of going to the village but concluded that was not the best place. In casting about they learned there was a vacant church in that neighbor - hood so they rented a room in it and afterwards bought the church. They put in a cooking establishment and then put in a library and then P&gt;cock tester, a seed tester, a microscope tester, and there they met other and discussed matters of interest, both social and business. would develop the rural life and be the means of extending their edge. I would like to speak to you much longer, but will discuss jne thing more. I took dinner the other day with Secretary Wil - nd his friends and the subject of extension came up and during the discussion I said, "You are out of date, you are three thousand years behind the times ' I reached over and took Secretary Wilson's Bible and turned to a chapter in Chronicles where it spoke of extension, and that Jehoshaphat had started a great reform. He tore down the heathen altars and destroyed the pillars built by the heathen and instituted a great re - form. He restored the services of the Lord. That is just what you find iiw today. Some people would not go to church, so Jehoshaphat took the church to blame for it and established an extension department. I can not state the chapter you will find it in, either Chronicles or Kings. This was during the reign of Jehoshaphat. He sent the Levites out to the people. He told them to get out in the country and teach the peo - ple who did not come to town; and the record says that they went out and taught the people and took the book of the law with them. It was the first extension that I know of, something like three thousand </seg>

Unless you get the farmers to understand that knowledge is not alto - gether for the preacher, the lawyer, the doctor, not altogether for the professor in agricultural colleges, not for the students in agricultural colleges, but it is for everybody. There are people who don't know it and you must give them a taste of it and then they will want more. Give the renter on the farm a taste of real practical knowledge; get his mind awake to see what is going on around him; get his mind awake to this continuous miracle of life that is performed before his ayes and that he may become a creator of values. If you get him to see this wonderful mystery, what wonderful things are going on all about him, by teaching him in words that he can understand and by experiments which he can conduct himself, get him to see all this, then, the farmers will draw together as the small dew drops melt into the rain drops. Education is for all, and only by education can we de - velop sterling manhood. The creator is always greater than the crea - ture, and the only foundation of our government is based on splendid farm life. You can't pour knowledge into a man unless he is willing to receive it. He must appropriate it himself. Give these people a taste of knowledge and then you will have to put up three or four times the number of buildings you now have. TUB CONSERVATION MOVEMENT. BY HON. WII.I.IAM JENNINGS BRYAN. Mr. President, Ladies and Oentlemen^ I hope you are all here because of your interest in the subject of conservation, and that none of you will feel you have been disappointed even if I speak for a short time. It is not that I lack interest in this subject, but rather because it is so large a subject that I have yet not been able to get it systematized in my own mind, as to how I should pro - ceed with it. It is rather a recent subject, too, not one of the things to which I have devoted a great deal of time. Yet no one can have this subject brought to his mind without at once realizing that it baa great importance. Not only that, but as you consider it, it grows upon you, and as I have leen revolving the subject in my own mind, it seems to me It is like other great subjects. When one takes up a subject and begins to study it and to follow it out as it connects itself with other sub - jects, he finds tha&gt;. every great subject is really related, more or less intimately, with all the affairs of life, with all the departments of human activity and every line of thought. So, as I have been consid - ering this subject from time to time, I have become amazed at its en- Knts, and I feel that it is fortunate for all of us that our atten - been drawn to a subject bo vital at a period like this. 10 </seg>

It is a thing that does not iussesi itself in the beginning of a nation's development. We think little ol our health until we see signs of disease approaching. We don't plan our eating or our exercise, as a rule, with the purpose of removing these beginnings or preventing the approach of disease. Instead of •-atlng the things we believe will be conducive to health, we generally eat the things that, we like, and not until a pain somewhere takes us to a physician to learn from him that there Is a break-down, or a threatened break-down, not until then do we begin to select our food with real referni" e to our health. So it is in the conservation of the resources of a nation. When our ance» ors tame here they found virgin forests and they went to work supplying themselves with such wood and timber as they needed, with no thought of exhaustion. When mines were discovered they brought lorth the minerals and they had no idea of the size of the mineral de - ixjsit, aud, of course, no thought of ever reaching the end of the supply. We have gone on until our nation has grown from a little band of three million*, wht-u our independence was secured, until now we have ninety millions of people, anu we are just beginning to ask ourselves if we have not been wasteful; have we not consumed more than we need to nave consumed, and what is going to be the result when we have reached i he limit? I believe that the call issued by President Roosevelt for a conserva - tion congress was one of the greatest acts connected with his ad minis i ration. 1 believe he gives the credit to Pinchot for having brought the matter to his attention. I believe in his speech to the Governors at that conference he paid Pinchot the compliment of saying that it was his rea - sons and his insistence that brought the matter actively to the attention of the president. If this be true, then Mr. Pinchot deserves a very im - portant place among those who have conferred a great advantage upon i he country because the country has taken hold of this idea of conserva - tion. And we have already had, in the Federal congress and in the various states, legislation as the result of this first conference, as it was called at the suggestion of Mr. Pinchot, and through the official act of {'resident Roosevelt we already see the people are thinking on this sub - ject and we see how that thought is developing new lines. ghall not attempt to exhaust this subject tonight, nor shall I attempt Into detail in regard to any part of it; for I need to come to these ngs more as a student, as an inquirer, than as an instructor. •r, in the time that I shall occupy, let me call your attention to the itude of this subject and show you how a suggestion is likely to &gt;p until a multitude of people will be turning their thoughts upon a multitude of phases of conservation.

We do not know how near we are to the end of our ore deposits except that we know that we can now calculate how long it will take us to exhaust the coal, and the years are in sight; that is, when we calculate approximately. I believe that in the discussion of the subject in congress there was quite a wide range in its estimate. I recall a little bit of humor like this: One senator presented statistics to show that it would last not more than sixty years. Another man says, "Ye«, that is very well, but another authority has fixed the quantity suf - ficient to last three thousand years." Another senator said: "Gentlemen, the discrepancy is too great. You ought to get together. There is too much discrepancy between 60 years and 3,000 years." Another senator ► aid there was enough to last 1,500 years, and the senator who had called attention to the wide gap, or range of difference, said, "We are making progress, gentlemen; we have got half way back." Well, it is possible that there may yet be a wide difference between tin- estimates of those who have been calculating the quality In sight, still, we have reached the point where we know that unless there are future discoveries upon which we cannot calculate, with certainty, we are approaching the end of the supply. But there Is this that we should lake into consideration, and that is as we approach the end of the sup - ply the price Is likely to rise, and the fear of exhaustion and the in - creased price working together are Mkely to bring out substitutes that v.ere not before known, and thus the end may be, to some extent, dc- I read the other day that the cost on aluminum has been reduced, I think from $20 a pound to something like 20 cents a pound. I remem - ber nearly twenty years ago when a man came before the Ways and Mrans Committee and asked for tariff on aluminum; that he gave the cost of the clay, and it was quite a high cost, and he thought it would be cheaper, but I think he never suggested that it would be as cheap as It is today. Rut what interested me. in his testimony, was that he M&gt;oke of the supply of the metal being practically inexhaustible. That was the first thing that interested mo : because whenever I find anything that Is inexhaustible I feel a much deeper interest In it than in something that can be exhausted. For instance, I have never felt any great en - thusiasm in an oil well or gas well, because experience shows that in the course of time they give out. I have felt much more Interest in agricultural landscapes, when, in looking over the land I could feel that not for a year or ten years, but for thousands of years, people might draw their living from this soil of ours. Then, aside from the cost of any of the minerals, we- come to the supply of timber, which is not like minerals — when it is once exhausted it can be renewed, but it cannot be renewed immediately; that is, it takes time, so that when we waste the timber upon a watershed it means that it is going to take a long while to replace it. Then we come </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 PROCMDING8 NEBRASKA BTATB BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to thoee resources that can be expanded. We cannot expand the min - eral resource* of the country, except we have found beds of the amount of the deposit, but when we come to the other resources there is a likelihood of conservation. I think it properly comes within the definition of conservation — it Is the increase that can come from the expansion of the resources. I Imagine that this part of this subject is going to Plve a very large amount of attention. We shall not only bring &gt;r cultivation areas that have not been cultivated heretofore, but ■hall intensify the cultivation in fields that have long been culti - d. We have today under construction many vast projects that have their object the knowledge of the cultivated area In this country, have almost reached the limit of the amount of land that you can have for the asking. There is quite a large area of swamp and arid land. I have had the opportunity and pleasure of seeing the develop - ment of some of these sections of the country. I spoke yesterday with an official of the ctate of Missouri, who told me how down In Missouri they had a great tract of land that was only worth 50 to 75 rents an acre a few years ago, and now they have commenced to drain It and have formed themselves into corporative bodies and commenced build - ing dykes, and that they have already reclaimed land that is producing as much as seventy-five bushels of corn to the acre. That land is des - tined to become even more valuable than the lands on the uplands that were first taken. I visited a year ago that section of the country known as the Everglades in Florida — I do not know why they call It the Ever - glades, but I remember when I went there I experienced a surprise. I realized that I had had in my mind a picture of a country that was overgrown with semi-tropical vegetation. I had thought of great trees growing in swamps and of underbrush, making a place that would have h wild aspect or look like a wilderness. But when I went there I found that the Everglade country was largely a pine country with only occa - sionally a clump of trees; that it was a Lig saucer, if I may so describe it, a limestone saucer, that had been filled with black dirt to the extent of from 2 to 4 and 10 feet, and that that was covered with water that had been drained over it out of a lake. They are now digging a ditch and draining that water off. When they drain that water off it does not require clearing, but you can go on the land, put a stick down, making a hole, plant a tomato or other plant, and it grows. There Is a large tract of land you will find along the Gulf Coast and along the Atlantic Coast and these drainage systems are being established; and thus an additional area is being brought under cultivation. Then, going out Into the semi-arid country you will find that vast traits are being brought under cultivation by irrigation. A year ago I visited the Roose - velt dam in Arizona, where they are storing water that will make culti - vation for something like — I suppose you can tell more accurately than I — 150,000 to 175,000 acres. As I came in a few days aeo from Arizona I pawed through El Paso. I learned something of the details of the dam that will bring into cultivation a large area along the Rio Grande. </seg>
            <seg id="p285">PKOCnDlNQS NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 285 Down along to Rio Grande and the Gulf you will find development* of land that not many years ago was worth only a few dollars an acre, land that people supposed would never be used for anything except pasture land. There they are drawing water from the Rio Grande and running It back as far as four, five, six, and even eight or nine miles from the river for irrigation in raising large crops on land that they supposed a few years ago would never be valuable for tillage. Now, this way in which we are extending areas and bringing new land under cultivation to my mind Is not the most Important part of this branch of conservation. Nobody can travel In the old world without realizing that we have not yet commenced to farm with economy in the United States. No one can compare the farming In thickly settled countries like Belgium, Austria, Germany, Java, Japan, or China or in India with the farming In this country. No one who has seen their cultivation but what has been imnressed with the thoueht that we are not vet making ruse of the land that has been under cultivation for a long while, that conservation will have as one of its results the better cultiva- tion and better utilization of the land that we have. Then, there is the question of the improvement of the soil and the prevention of waste. At a congress, or rather a conference at the White House, Mr. James Hill pave a very Instructive treatise in regard to the loss that comes to the soil by the failure to preserve Its fertility. I imarine that this will be. possibly, the most Important branch of this work of conservation: to take the soil that we have and build It un and nrevent Its being ruined by the wasteful use of It. Here. It seems to me. Is an opening for the students in agricultural colleges. These young men who are ouallfvlng themselves for farming In agricultural colleges that have multiplied and Increased In attendance, these young men have here an opportunity by which they can render a real service to their fellow men In experimenting and ascertaining what can be (ione to brine thiR soil un to the maximum of Its productiveness and to keen It there. Go throueh some of the countries of the old world and you will find where a few thousand years ago there were fertile fields, that there are now deserts. You will find that where cities once existed are now barren wastes. Tt Is all because no attention was given, or an Insufficient amount of attention, to the protection of those soils, »nd peonle have wasted them until there Is no foundation left to build upon. I repeat that I think we shall find this particular branch of this subject probably the largest one. and that more of our young men will he inspired to search and experiment in this field than in any other: and conservation will have brought a great blessing to this country if It does succeed In turning attention to these things. We now come to conservation on a large scale in a dual form which has already raised some questions as to how best to proceed. T remem - ber not long ago attending a meeting where there was considerable </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OP AGRI' I I.Tl UK. have not spent a great deal of time trying to find out the exact limits between the power of the state and the power of the United States. I have not carefully read the decisions of the courts, and the reason is this, that I have felt that 90,000,000 of people would take care of their own interests, that the first thing to find out was not just what the courts have said, but to find out what is necessary, for if we have any constitutional provisions that prevent the conservation of the resources of this country, it will only be a question of time when those limita - tions will be so changed as to give the people the power to do what they find it will be necessary to do. [Applause.] When I say this I am fcure that you will not think that I am speaking as one who places a small estimate upon the work of the state. I believe that our form of government is good, because it combines the idea of local govern - ment with national authority, and if there were a doubt as to whether a thing could best be done by the state or by the United States, I would be inclined to resolve the doubt in favor of the state. But there are certain things thr.t are fundamental and we must apply fundamental rules to the discussion of a great question. Here is one of the funda - mental rules that I think we ran safely apply and that is that no one man is able to attend to other people's business as well as he can his own, and that no state can attend to the business of people outside of that state, and that wherever you find interest is national in extent you And an Interest that must be protected by national authority; that is, that you can not trust the people of any state to act wisely upon a question where the people of other states are also vitally Interested. This was brought up when I had to consider the question of watersheds in a mountainous state. I traveled across the mountain range some two yean ago and I had an opportunity to see what 1 had not seen before because my attention had not been called to it when I was in the moun - tains before, and I had a chance to see what I had not seen before, the difference between a mountain side covered with timber and a moun - tain side bare. As I crossed over this mountain range I could see open places where timber had been cut oft or burned off and there was no pnow, but immediately adjoining it there would be a tract of timber and there the snow would be to the depth of from ten to twenty feet. I found in June this melting and running down and forming little streams, and it occurred to me why should the general government build great reservoirs at such large expense and at the same time permit God's reservoirs to be destroyed without need. [Applause.] At El Paso they told me that the engineers calculated it would take about eighty years for the great reservoir, some forty miles long — to fill up with silt to such an extent as to really be hurtful. That seems a long time and yet while it is a long time in the life of an individual it is not long in the life of a nation. Eighty years will soon pass, and if at the end of eighty years the waters coming down and being impounded in that reservoir, </seg>
            <seg id="p287">I-IKKKKDIMJS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AUIC1&lt;'I I.TL'RK. 187 a tremendous expense to remove it or to build another reservoir — If another site can be found. These natural reservoirs on the side of the mountains have been there for ages and they are as good today as they were. Why should a lumber company be permitted to take the timber off of these water sheds? Now, if a state will give to a nation a sufficient protection I am willing that the state shall do it but back of it must be the power of the nation to protect itself if there is an in excusable waste on the part of those who are in immediate possession of the country. 1 have thought of these states that are mountain states what would we do if these sources of water supply fail? I have not made a study of the water courses in the ground, or the veins in the earth. To me they are great mysteries. I do not know how inexhaust - ible the quantity is, but 1 do know that when we grow from 90,000,000 to l!*o,000,000 of people, probably within fifty years, there will be a much larger demand upon these undergiound waters than we are making today, .-o why should we take our chances on water exhaustion? Here is a subject upon which our estimate cannot be approximately correct, where annot tell, we cannot see, cannot calculate. Certainly, If it be true that in those mountains we find the storage of this water that comes to us as underdo*, then we, who live even remote from the mountain peaks, have an interest that must be protected by national conservation. Hut, my friends, 1 have a faith in the intelligence and in the patriot - ism of the American people. There is such a sense of justice in the human heart that when this subject reaches a point where it must be settled when the facts have been presented and the people understand, 1 have not the slightest doubt that there will be a way of adjusting every Interest the nation has without injuring a single right that the peo - ple of the state possess. These meetings where both sides are pre - sented are vastly valuable for they will give us a discussion out of which will come that which is best. The same intelligence that leads the people to begin now before the end is reached, will lead them to devise ways and establish means for the protection of every right and the guardian of every interest; and the patriotism that we can rely upon at all times and under all circumstances will not fail us when we come to deal with this question of supreme importance. You see as we go over this sbject it becomes a very large one. I have spoken first of those deposits that are exhaustible and then of those resources that are capable of expansion, of cultivation that can be intensified and of that conservation that looks towards the prevention of the exhaustion and of the restoring of the vitality to the soil, then of that division of government power, a question that confronts us as soon as we enter upon the discussion of the subject. There is another branch of the subject that I desire to mention. It is the matter of monopolizing the resources of the country. I believe it is about as important, not quite, but nearly as important, to prevent the monopolizing of resources as it is to conserve them and perpetuate </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 rSOCKKl&gt;INQ8 NEIIUASKA STATE HOARD OV AOEICULTUEK. them — I say nearly, not quite, because the first thing, ot course, la to keep this wealth, but if we allowed it to get into the hands ot a tew so that it was of much less value to us than it ought to be, at any time when we awake to the necessity, to destroy the monopoly. But, my friends, I think it is just as well to prevent monopoly as it is to destroy it. In fact, 1 think it is in this as it is in everything else, that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I rejoice that we have already commenced to provide against monopolizing of these re - sources. 1 am glad that some of our mineral lands have already been withdrawn bo that they can no longer be bought up like our farming lands were. 1 am glad that we have already commenced to put a limit to the greed thai was attempting to enslave the nation through the possession of these mineral resources. I am glad that a cry was raised in regard to our water power, for the water power of the coun - try was in the very beginning of its development. The use of elec - tricity and the lact that we could carry the electric power many miles has given to water power a value that it did not formerly possess. It was necessary formerly to build the mill by the side of the dam; now the current tan be generated at the stream and the factory may be erected a long distance away; and these companies seeing the possi - bility of its development were reaching out and taking possession of these streams so that the water as it tumbled down the mountain side should be to them the means of becoming landlords of the whole peo - ple. 1 rejoice that we have already done something in this connec - tion. I hope that there will be no meeting of a conservation congress In any state, or in the nation, that does not have as part of its program the study and discussion of the efforts that are being made to monopo - lize the resources that remain. My friends, this subject is larger still. 1 have gone briefly over sev - eral phases of it. When we get into this subject we find it opens out. There is another part of this conservation subject and that is the con - servation of the strength of those who are to convert these resources into material wealth. As we study It we find that this is the largest part of the subject, for the conservation of the health and strength of those who are to Inhabit this country is of far more importance than the mere conservation of the resources of the nation. So this conser - vation movement is connected with our institutions for the preservation of health. We will find people quickened in their search for a remedy that will stay the hand of disease. 1 have reached the point where I believe the government should encourage in every possible way the re - search Into the causes of diseases that afDict mankind, a search for remedies that may relieve. But, my friends, we don't consider this ncj much or very long until we think also of that voluntary waste of human strength. Then we wonder if mankind can be so foolish while stimulating the investigation into diseases that have not been prevented and yet be so indifferent to that wasting of the body that comes from dissipation and from the destruction of man's vital forces. [Applause.] </seg>
            <seg id="p289">PBOCBBDlNOS NEBRASKA Hi ATE BOARD OF AOkIOULTUKB* 289 So, before we get very far we are going to consider questions that might be regarded as debatable questions, and ret I am not willing to concede that this question is debatable. I think we will see that nobody appears before an intelligence audience to debate the proposi - tion that society is entitled to the services of the whole man and not the services of a half a man as a citizen. [Applause.] That anything that has for its object the destruction of the vitality of man; anything that has for Its object the wasting of man's strength or the destruction of that impulse that gives mentality to his strength, anything that Impair* man as an asset of value to his country— that that thing deserves the attention of those interested in the conservation of the nation's re - sources. Who will say that this man of flesh and blood, this man of brain and muscle, this man of heart and spirit Is not infinitely more valuable that inanimate matter; and if we are going to try to find remedies for the diseases that attack us against our will, ought we not to find some way of preventing the diseases that can only enter the body when the will invites It and can only stay as long as the will per - mits* So we will turn our attention to the prevention of disease and waste, and the conservation of the strength, vitality and the productive power of the American citizen. This will bring us to the subject of educa tlon, for It makes a great deal of difference whether our citizens are sluggish in mind or quick and active. Thus, those thct are Interested tn conservation, in the expansion of our resources, In the multiplying of our products, will be Interested In establishing that Idea of education towards which the world Is moving; that Idea that every child born is entitled to the advantages of mental Instruction. Then, we will not go very far In the consideration of the mind as a national asset before we find out that morals are more Important than vice, for when we have trained a man and made his mind alert we are then more Interested Is his not using his mind against us than when it was a mind of less strength. We cannot Justify the expenditure of money raised by taxation for the education of all the neonle unless there goes with It the education and moral develop - ment that will compel the citizen to use his education for the benefit of others and not for the overreaching of others. We started out with the preservation of a niece of timber, but the protection of the wasting mind becomes at last a subiect so laree that It embraces every form of in - dustrial development and every phase of human life. Then as we proceed we find that rovemmrnt becomes an Important factor In conservation. If vou visit the Valley of Jordan von will be told that It is as fertile m the Valley of the Nile. If you ask why that country is a waste, why that land Is not cultivated, thev will tell you that it Is because under the Sultan there is no protection, for the man who tills the soil. They will tell yon that those lands lie Idle because If a man dares to cultivate the soil by £tlme his crop Is ready to harvest the Bedouins sweep down from the ntalns nnd take what he hai raised. So we see that one of the ele - ts In conservation is a government that will protect each citizen from </seg>

After we have studied the subject of ation a while we find that, like other subjects, it touches every 1 with which we can deal. It is only another one of those inspiring causes that will result in a larger intelligence and therefore in the application of a larger patriotism to the solution of the problems of our country. We find after we have discussed all these questions that they bring us all together, make us interested In each other, and I am glad that as the world moves for - ward we are coming to understand more and more our relations with each other; we are coming to understand more and more, whether we like It or not, that we are indissolubly linkpd each one to every other and that we must all rise or fall together. Conservation is a very large subject: the more we study It the bigger It becomes and that at last we see that it touches us and all others every - where, and then It becomes a part of our lives, and we are ready to do our nart to conserve the resources of this nation. Its material resources, its human resources and the government under whese beneficence and the beneficence of Ood the human being develops.

SMITH, raORHM O¥ AM UAL BU8BANDBT, IMNLKBITY OF NEBUASKA From the fact that a large number ot horses, more particularly stal - lions, are imported in the United States annually from France, Germany, Belgium, England and Scotland, it is to be inferred that those countries have made greater advancement in horse breeding and that we are de - sirous of using some of their best types as a means of improving the common stock of this country. While we are willing to admit that we have been backward in the adoption of methods that will bring about the greatest improvement in our horses, there seems now to be a disposition to inaugurate a campaign of education and legislation which it is to be hoped will result in much greater progress than has been made in the past. We have in many parts of America a soil and climate extremely favorable for the breeding of horses and it would seem like an unneces - sary extravagance for us to continue to spend vast sums of money for equine stock bred and developed in foreign countries. While the im - portation of good blood is not to be discouraged — in fact, it is to our ad - vantage to procure horses from across the water if we can find better types there — at the same time it would seem that if a systematic effort is made to breed the best and in larger numbers than formerly, we can in a few years put our country in a class with those countries in Europe which have been furnishing us for years with high priced individuals. The European countries, to which reference has already been made, have been especially successful in the breeding of horses because pop - ular sentiment has been favorable for the best development ot the in - dustry. This has made it possible to enact legislation that would dis - courage the use of inferior sires. Furthermore the people that have been engaged in this work in these several sections of Europe have shown a disposition to study the business with care and perseverence, and to cooperate with their respective governments for the enforcement of laws that have been enacted in the interests of horse breeding. It is difficult to understand why in America we have neglected to provide such laws. It would seem that in our commercial activity, in our haste to get wealth from the soil, we have been unmindful of even the Im - mediate future. The first legislation in the United States having In view the improve - ment of horses was enacted in the state of Wisconsin, April 22, 1906. This law which went into effect June 1, 1906, provided for the issuing of state licenses to all stallions in Wisconsin which upon examination were found free from "hereditary, contagious or transmissable unsound - ness, or disease." This law further provided that all stallions not of pare breeding should be advertised as grades or crossbreds. Soon after - wards similar laws were passed by Minnesota, Iowa, Pennsylvania, New Tin ■&lt;&gt; I't&amp;h Illinois Tf smas Nebraska. North Dakota, South Dakota, </seg>
            <seg id="p293">293 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AfiRI Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Iowa, Colorado and Nebraska were the only states which did not provide for an examination for sound - mm. Most of the states passed such laws as would disqualify from pub - lic service stallions of hereditary unsoundness. Kansas has been issuing licenses to unsound stallions, but their law provided that the diseases which a stallion may have should be enumerated on the certificate so that the public would have knowledge as to the degree of unsoundness. Iowa and Nebraska have recently passed laws to provide for an examination for soundness and other states not named above have during the past winter passed similar laws. From present indications it seems probable that every state in the Union will in a few years have statutes that will put a stop to the practice of using for public service stallions having hereditary unsoundness and such that will discourage the use of sires of mixed and mongrel stock which produces offispring, variable in type, conformation and quality with inferior offspring usually predominating. There are a number of so-called stud book companies in the United States which are willing to accept for entry, horses which are not of pure breeding, the only requirement being the payment of a good sized entry fee. These companies have circulated pretentious certificates and the possessor of one of these naturally feels that his horse is a pure bred unless he knows the facts concerning the breeding. A few years ago the 1'nited States Department of Agriculture made an investigation of these various record associations and prepared a list of approved stud books. While It has recently developed that the United States Department of Agriculture has no legal authority to recognize certain associations, the states have been glad to adopt the list prepared by the National govern - ment and this list is now being Incorporated in the various state laws. It is hoped that the legalizing of certain standard record associations in this manner will put a stop to the organization of companies which make a practice of Issuing certificates for mixed-bred horses. The first stallion law passed in Nebraska was what Is known as the West bill, which became a law April, 1909. This law provides only for the examination of pedigrees. A new law which further provides for an examination for soundness has recently been enacted but will not go into effect until July 7, 1911. The present law will therefore be oper - ative until that time. It reads as follows: THE 1909 STALLION LAW. Section I. Any owner or keeper of any stallion kept for public service, or any owner or keeper of any stallion kept for sale, exchange or transfer, who represents such animal to be pure bred, shall cause the same to be registered in some stud book recognized by the Department of Agricul - ture at Washington, D. C, for the registration of pedigrees, and obtain a certificate of registration of such animal. He shall then forward the same to the Professor of Animal Husbandry of the University of Ne - braska, whose duty it shall be to examine and pass upon the genuineness of such certificate filed for enrollment. In making such examination, said Professor of Animal Husbandry shall use as his standard, the stud books </seg>

And such registration is found to be correct and genuine, he shall issue a -tificate . under the seal of the Department of Animal Husbandry, of the University of Nebraska, which certificate shall set forth the name, ■ex, age, and color of the animal, also the volume and page of the stud book in which said animal Is registered. For each enrollment and cJ - tincate he shall receive the sum of one dollar ($1) which shall accom - pany the certificate of registration when forwarded for enrollment. Bl. Any owner or kee|«er of a stallion for public service who rep or holds such animal as pure bred, shall place a copy of the e of the Department of Animal Husbandry, of the University iska, on the door of the stall of the stable where such animal is kept. Sec. 3. Any owner or keeper of a stallion kept for public service, for whkh a certificate from the Department of Animal Husbandry, of the University of Nebraska has not been issued, shall have printed in all hand-bills, posters, advertising cards, or in any newspaper advertisement calling the attention of the public to said stallion or stallions, the words "grade stallion" in black faced type of the same size as that used in the name of said stallion or stallions, immediately preceding or above the name of said stallion or stallions, and must have printed hand-bills or posters, not less than five by seven inches in size, and said handbills or posters must have printed thereon immediately above or preceding the name of the stallion or stallions, in type not smaller than one inch in height the words "grade stallion," said hand-bills or posters to be kept posted over the main entrance to all places where said stallion or stai - lions are kept for public service. Sac 4. If the owner of any registered stallion shall sell, exchange, or transfer the same, and file said certificate, accompanying the same with a fee of fifty cents with the i'rofessor of Animal Husbandry of the Uni - versity of Nebraska, he shall upon receipt of the original certificate prop - erly transferred, and the required fee, issue a new certificate to the new owner of the animal. Ail tees provided by this act shall go into the treasury of the University ol Nebraska. Sec. 5. Any person who shall fraudulently represent any horse, to be pure bred, or any person who shall post or publish or cause to be posted or published any false pedigree or certificate, or shall use any stallion for public service, or sell, exchange or transfer any stallion, representing said animal to be pure bred, without first having such animal registered and obtaining the certificate of the Department of Animal Husbandry of the University of Nebraska as hereinbefore provided, or who shall violate any of the provisions of this act, shall be guilty of a misde - meanor, and be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), or imprisoned in the county jail not exceeding thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Under this law there have been a large number of registrations. In the main there has been a disposition to comply with its provisions, as It is generally recognized that some legislation along this line has been urgent- On the other hand, there are a number of owners of grille Bullions who have not complied with the law, and there are doubtless some persons in the state who own pure-bred stallions that have not made applications for state licenses.

W« have' in this state a soil, climate and foodstuffs which specially favorablp for the breeding of horses. There is no forage plain which is capable of producing better bono than alfalfa when prop - erly used. It is especially desirable for brood mares and growing colts It has been demonstrated that this state is particularly well adapted to the &lt;ulture of alfalfa. We also have here cheaper corn than can be found in any other state of the union, a grain which can be used to innt advantage in connection with alfalfa. There is no reason why the horse industry should not prove as profitable in Nebraska as it has proven to be in some of the older countries of Euroiie.

            <seg id="p320">320 [NO&gt; NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTUBB. HARRKN MARKS. Lecture Delivered by G. L. Carlson at the Nebraska Live Stock Improv - er*' Annual Meeting, University Farm, Lincoln, January 17, 1911. The greatest leak in American agriculture is that of barren mares. That the horse breeding industry can stand such a waste of energy, money and time is quite positive proof that the industry can be made one of the most lucrative of any carried on in connection with the work of the farm. The loss in Nebraska resulting from mares that do not reproduce themselves exceeds $25,000,000 every year. In all of the United States the loss from this source will exceed $350,000,000, and in all of the horse breeding district of the world it reaches the enormous sum of $l,5i&gt;0,000,000 annually. Belgium suffers less from Darren mares than any otuer country in the world, about 85 per cent of all mares brad producing foals. France suffers more from this loss than any other country interested in the production of pure bred horses, rather less than 40 per cent of the registered mares in the district of le Perche producing foals. In all of the United States slightly less than 40 foals are produced from every 100 mares bred. A small fraction less than 23 foals are produced by every stallion owned in this country and It requires nearly four services of a stallion for every live foal added to the horse population of this country. These are facts startling in their proportions, and they are small credit to the breeding intelligence of Barrenness is either congenital or temporary in its nature. It is congenital when it is caused by some rudimentary or undeveloped gen - ital organ of the mare. In such cases mares are wholly and permanently barren and nothing can be done to make them fecund. Barrenness is temporary when it is caused by some local condition over which we have more or less control. Only seven or eight per cent of all mares barren are barren because of congenital causes, and these must neces sarily remain barren. The larger part of those mares which are barren because of some local condition over which we have more or less control can be restored to fecundity. One of the causes of barrenness in mares is sterility in stallions Fortunately, this is but a minor cause, only about seven per cent of barrenness in mares being traceable to this cause. Even such a small number makes it worth while to investigate the causes of sterility in stallions. Occasionally a stallion proves virile for two or three years and then becomes sterile all at once. In such cases we know only too well that the trouble is in the handling, and not because of a want of virility in the stallion. Of 568 stallions that had proved themselves virile for </seg>
            <seg id="p321">IING8 NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AORKII.T! RK careful Investigation It was found that about one-half of them bee— sterile because of excessive use In the stud. It Is quite the rule In this country to make two, three or even several services with a stallion every day during the season. If that amount or business can be secured It never occurs to these people that It Is the number of live foals rather than the number of services that make the profit Neither do these peo pie stop to consider that they are always running the risk of doing the stallion a permanent Injury by sucn excessive service. Many stallloners would be surprised if they were told that one service a day would result In more live foals, than If two or more services were made with the same stallion, but it is true just the same. Warm bred stallions are capable of making more frequent service than those of draft blood, but investigations covering a period of three years dis - closed the fact that it required from ten and one-half to thirteen hours for pure-bred draft stallions to secrete semen containing fully developed spermatozoa, provided the stallion was making regular daily service. Spermatozoa are stored in the seminal vesicles for long periods of time, so that a stallion who has made no service for several days, or even for one day, may be capable of making several services the next day, and spermatozoa found in the fluid discharged at every service. No in - telligent reason can be given for using a stallion when he is in a con - dition making the impregnation of a mare impossible, yet this Is done thousands of times every day during the breeding season in all parts of the country. This practice not only results in a few foals and many disappointments, but it is a positive injury to the stallion and his future usefulness. It is such excessive use of our stallions that gives a dis - couraging outlook in foal production. One-half of all the stallions in this country which have become sterile ran trace their sterility back to excesaive service. The use of breeding bags Is responsible for much sterility among both stallions and jacks. Copulation Is made possible by the interchange of sexual magnetism (electricity), the male being positive, the female negative. Any barrier or obstruction which cuts off this supply of mag - netism must result in permanent Injury to the stallion. These breeding bags are made of rubber, they could be made of nothing else, and rubber is a non-conductor of electricity. Such devices have much the same tendency to permanent injury as masturbation, which in turn is the cause of some sterility among stallions. Fevers, colds, influenza and other maladies produce some sterility among stallions. This is especially true of influenza. When this disease Is present in a district, there is always much difficulty in impregnating mares, because of its effect upon both mares and stallions.

Breed is also one cause of a sterile tendency in stallions. A record kept of many imported stallions covering a period of many years gave (be following results. The Suffolk stallions left 69 per cent of foals. Belgians 61, Percherons Si, Clydesdales 54, and the Shires 49 per cent. Feed is an Important factor in the case of stallions. Data gathered in several states, and covering a period of several years gave results a* follows Kind of Feed. No. of Mares. Her Cent of Foals. The above table teaches us that a corn diet does not produce a very high per cent of foals. Oats mixed with corn increased the foal crop oy 6 per cent. Oats gave an increase of 14 per cent as compared with corn. Wheat bran added to the oats ration resulted in 7 per cent more foals, while grass or alfalfa with no grain gave IS per cent of foals. Here we can learn thai the nearer we get to a corn ration the smaller the numlKT of foals produce* 1 , while the nearer we get to a grass ration with no grain the larger the number of foals produced. In other words, the nearer we get to nature, that is to say, the nearer we approach natural conditions the more foals we will have. Data along then lines secured from a different angle show quite as conclusively that corn is not good for breeding stallions. The foal crop in Missouri from the lest stallions is but 41 per cent of the mares bred and corn is the chief ration. In Kansas it is 44, Illinois 46, Iowa 47. Nebraska 4», Minnesota 61. Ontario 71, Montana 72. Wyoming 72. and Idaho 7::. Here again we notice that the foal crop is small in the corn states as compared with the states producing no corn, and the large foal crop is in those states known as grazing states. Overfeeding is bad, too, regardless of what the grain is. It is muscle. rather than tallow that ig wanted in reproduction. Tallow is degener - ating, impairing the vitality of all cells, glsnds and nerves around which it is deposited. Everything fed a stallion should be clean and wholesome Oats that have been wet before threshing and musty or hay should never be fed a stallion. Vigor tablets, tonics or stimulants should never be given a stallion. E.e are the cause of sterility in many cases. There is no tonic or ulant so good for a stallion in service as work in the harness. This increase the circulation of the blood, and increase all of the vital processes at the same time.

In form they appear round, under slight magnifi - cation, but more in the form of a triangle as the magnification is In - creased. We next find them in the vasa efferentia, and their form has changed to a more oblong one. In the epididymls they have still further progressed in their development, appearing more nearly in the form to (he mature spermatozoa, and possessing a tail and capable of slight serpentine motion. In the vas defcrens they appear much as do the mature spermatozoa, but they are as yet incapable of fertilizing the egg of the iuaro. Not, however, until they reach the seminal vesicles are the spermatozoa capable of fertilizing the °gg of the mare, full maturity not having been reached before they reach this point. The cells, glands and nerves concerned in this development of the spermatozoa are very delicate iu their structure, so delicate in fact that their functions can be studied only with the aid of high magnifi - cation. This makes plain to us how easy this process of development may be arrested by a cold, a fever, excessive service, or any one of the many things I have already mentioned. It also makes plain to us the BSSji of good care and good handling, if we are to expect our stallions to remain in a virile condition, and capable of siring foals endowed with a vitality of a high degree. Returning to barrenm ss in mares, we find more forces at work cau» ing barrenness in mares than sterility in stallions. Many things induc - ing a shy breeding tendency in stallions induce the same tendency in mares. The question ot breed is one of them and in the same ratio as to both mares and stallions. In quite a large number of pure bred mares it was found that the Suffolks produced 82 per cent of foals the Belgians 71, the l'er&lt; herons 68, the Clydesdales 65, and the Shires 59 per cent. breeds occupy the same position with reference to the virility of Im manner of feeding our mares has much to do with foal produc The following includes a large list of mares kept on different and the per cent of foals produced by them. The range kept mares ced II per cent of foals; those fed grass in summer and alfalfa in r SI; hay, oats and bran 68; corn, alfalfa or clover 58; corn, bran lay II : hay and corn 49 per cent. Here, again, the nearer we get corn ration, the smaller the foal crop and the nearer we get to a ration without any grain the larger the number of foals. Another thing inducing a shy breeding tendency in mares is a want of salt in the body fluids of the mare. The normal salt solution of the fluids of the mare is about seven-tenths of one per cent. The more salt we find the more fecund the mare, and the less salt the more likeli - hood of the mare being barren. This is an inherited characteristic, but it can be overcome in a measure, by feeding an abundance of salt. It should be kept within easy reach of all brood mares at all times. The occupation of mares has much to do with their being fecund </seg>

If we will divide all the mares of the country into those that do ro work; those that do farm work only, and those used for both farm work and driving: those used for driving, and those used for saddle purpoaea, we will find them producing as follows: Those doing no work will produce about 82 per cent of foals; farm work, 68; farm work and driving. 54; driving, 41, and those used for saddle' work, 29 per cent. Prom these figures we learn that If a mare must work it had better be something she can do at a slow and steady pace. Mares doing farm work only produce ti8 per cent of foals while those used for driving produce 41 per cent only. The occupation of mare owners has quite as much to do with foal production as does the occupation of the mare. I have for many years classified my patrons into breeders, grain farmers and hay farmers. The breeders were those who were engaged in the brewing of some kind of lire stock to the exclusion of grain growing. The grain farmers made the growing and marketing of grain their chief business, while the hay farmers grew and marketed hay for a living. The breeders have produced 67 foals from every 100 mares bred; the grain farmers S3, and the hay farmers only 39. It is a long way from 67 down to 39. but the marketing of hay makes it necessary for the mares to stand upon the streets for hours at a time. This sudden chilling induces a con - gested or catarrhal condition of the mucus niembrances of the mare, a condition opposed to reproduction. It is this catarrhal condition of mares that is causing breeders so much trouble. A very large majority of mares that do not breed will be found with the mucus membranes in an inflamed condition. Age has more to do with foal production than most people are willing to admit. Two-year-old fillies if we'l matured and developed breed as readily as mares of any age. Mares three and four years of age are not sure breeders and the number of foals produced by mares of such ages is very small. This is because of the trouble with their teeth, which induces an inflamed condition of the mucus membranes. The larger number of foals are produced by mares that are between seven and eleven years of age. Few foals are out of mares fourteen or more years of age, and these few are out of mares that have been producing every year. If we keep an old mare producing she is likely to remain a breeder for many years, but if she is allowed to remain open for a year it will be difficult to start her breeding again, yet many farmers imagine that a mare should breed until she dies of old age. The manner of handling mares, and the manner in which they are taken to the stallion has much to do with the number of foals produced. Draft bred farm mares led in by the halter produce 69 per cent of foals; those driven double to farm wagon, 64; those driven to buggy, 58, while the same kind of mares ridden into be served produce 41 per cent only. Mares that are hurried to the stallion, and driven rapidly borne again, seldom become pregnant as a result of service under those conditions. When a man starts home after having his mare bred as </seg>
            <seg id="p325">if he had but a few minutes in which to reach his house, I expect to see that mare returned for service in twenty-one days. All excitement and all hurying should be avoided if it is foals that are wanted. Some mares are barren because of some malposition of the cervix. The cervix or neck of the uterus sometimes turns back upon itself, or to side, thereby making it impossible for spermatozoa to enter the uterus. This condition can be corrected by gentle manipulation of the parts, and by using the capsule instead of the horse in making the service. At other times we find the cervix constricted and closed so tightly that no fluid can enter the uterus. This condition can also be relieved by gentle manipulation until one finger can be introduced into the uterus. Mures are often barren because of tumors. These are either fibroid or i am t-rous. Fibroid tumors do not necessarily make a mare barren unless the tumor is so large as to fill the cavity, but if cancer is present anywhere in the genital tract, a mare will not breed. One tumorous con dition which it is impossible to diagnose is that of tumors in the fallo - pian tube. In dissecting barren mares we quite frequently find small tumors in one or both of the falopian tubes, completely closing the tube. If such tumors are present in both tubes, the mare is barren and noth ing can be done to relieve this condition. This closing of the tubes makes It impossible for the egg and spermatozoa to come in contact with each other, this making the fertilization of the egg impossible. The probable cause of these tumors is the stopping of ah egg in the narrow portion of the tube, and the inability of that organ either to pass It on into the horn of the uterus or to dispose of it by the process of absorption. Another condition which we often find present, and which is . re - sponsible for a barren condition is that of abscess formation in the uterus. It is mares in their third aud fourth year that are most likely to be troubled with this condition. This Is because of the fact that dentition induces an inflamed condition of the mucus membrances. It is influenza more than all other conditions combined which is responsible for these uterine abscesses. Influenza generally localizes itself about the glands or mucus membranes of the head. While it is not essential thai this disease should localize Itself about the head, yet it will be well to remember that it never localizes itself anywhere but on a mucus mem - brane, and as these young mares such as I have mentioned are usually found with more or less uterine congestion, the abscess is just as likely to locate itself in the uterus as about the head. Mares in this condition cannot be impregnated, and unless the uterus is kept open and well irrigated so as to free it of all pus the mare Is likely to die because of pus absorption. Elan troubles are responsible for much barrenness in mares. The we most frequently meet with is an abscess or cystic condition. edition always leaves a marc barren. After the rupture of a &gt; follicle and the discharge of an egg the follicide tills with blood ils, the blood and remaining liquor folliculi forming a dense </seg>
            <seg id="p326">£body known as corpus luteum. Occasionally the ovaries are in i condition as a result of a cold or other cause, and they fail to this carpus luteum, and an abscess forms, ending in the cystic Ion of which I si»ak. We find old mares in this condition more than we do young mares, but it matters not about the age, for in this condition are necessarily barren. In many mares we find the cervix or neck of the uterus in a very lax and o|x?n condition, and these mares are always impregnated with difficulty. Complaints reach me from every part of the United States and Canada about the trouble these men have with mares having large, open wombs. Such mares are generally found In a state of low vitality, and with the mucus membranes in an inflamed condition. That such mares are impregnated with the greatest difficulty is well known to | stallion owner. If we make an examination of the uterus of such mares, that organ will be found in an inflamed condition and it is this diseased condition that causes all the trouble. Lrf-ucoi rhea Is a cause of much trouble to mare owners, and it is becoming more troublesome every year. The beginning of leucorrhea is a catarrhal condition of the subject. A little later we find the mare discharging a slimy, viscid substance from the vulva, and try as much as we may, she obstintely refuses to breed. If permitted to run Its courst this disease will become chronic in a year or so, when the chances of restoring her to a breeding condition are very much against ua; but if taken in time most of these mares can be made to breed. There is an infectious form of leucorrhea that is very dangerous to horse breeding interests, and which has already made horse breeding very unprofitable in many parts of the country. This is a mixed infection, two specific germs always being found present in this disease. It not only makes a mare barren, but it is highly infectious, and if a stallion la permitted to serve such a mare he will infect every mare he serves duiing the next three or four weeks. Barrenness in mares is increasing at an alurming rate because of this disease. In one breeding district I know of about fifty-four mares made barren in this manner, because - ■ mining a stallion to serve a mare thus infected. The only possi - bility of overcoming this form of barrenness is the education of our stallion owners. In no way can the problem of barren mares be solved so well as by the education of both mare and stallion owners. Erne mares do not breed readilv after suffering an abortion. An ion is likely to leave the muscular walls and glands of the uterus condition of low vitality. Such a condition is not only working si the processes of fertilization, but should fertilization take place I very likely induce a subsequent abortion. It Is very well known nares which have aborted give the breeder much trouble. Eeria from filthy surroundings are responsible for many barren Go where we may, bacteria are present everywhere. Some are helpful, to the breeder, that is creative or other species which either helpful, or necessary, or both. Other species are the of these, in that they are destructive of other forms of life, in- </seg>

So far as regards the most of these bacteria, ire not supposed to know anything concerning them, and we can afford to take any chances in having our efforts prove abortive because of carelessness in being cleanly. Mares kept in dark, lily ven - tilated and filthy stables do not breed with as much certainty as do those kept in sanitary barns, or in the open air These are things to be remembered if we wish to meet with any marked degree of success in our horse breeding operations. The secondary condition responsible for nearly all barrenness in mares is the failure of the ovaries to discharge a mature egg. With normal mares and under normal conditions the ovaries alternately de veiop and discharge a mature egg every twenty-one days. If we examine the egg of the mare under high magnification it will be observed that the egg membrane contains many small pore canals. These canals, or at least of many of them, are penetrated by small follicular cells of the Graaflan during their growth and development, and it is by this means that the egg is nourished. When we stop and consider how delicate are all the parts concerned in the development and maturation of an egg, it will be easy for us to understand why the mare is likely to discharge so many immature eggs. If we examine the egg of the mare a few days before its discharge from the Graaflan, a large germinative vesicle will be noticed occupying about one-fourth of the egg space, and which will be located very nearly in the exact center. Assuming this to be a normal egg, if we had let it remain in the ovary a few days longer, this germinative vesicle would have disappeared, and in its place would be noticed a small egg-nucleus, occupying a position to one side of the center, and only about one one-hundredth part of the entire egg. Such an egg is a mature egg, capable of being fertilized by a spermatozoon of the stallion, and It is only mares capable of developing and maturing such eggs that can be made to breed. It matters not what it may be, but any force or condition such as colds, fevers, excitement, a low physical condition, infection or any one of many things, which will arrest the development and maturation of the egg of the mare must necessarily give us a barren mare. In conclusion, then, it is well for us to remember that if it is foals we want, and especially if it is is foals of the most pronounced vitality, those maturing into horses capable of performing our heavy work, and with such powers of resistance that disease will not attack them, we in u.^t have stallions and mares that are physically and sexually vigorous and normal. Even if we have such mares and stallions it is only by good care and the best of handling that will enable us to keep them in the best breeding condition. But this done, and educating the owners - of both mares and stallions to the need of wholesome food, pure water, the strictest cleanliness, kindness in the handling of all our horses, and the use of stallions of the best conformation, not only sound, but of a conformation that will remain sound when put to severe tests, and the breeding of draft horses will prove more lucrative than any of </seg>

E breeding of draft horses In the United States may be said to have nth the importation of Louis Napoleon, the first Percheron stallion fd to the United States in the early '50s. Draft stock was known toiintrv prior to that time, but it was of more or less doubtful and not pure in breeding. Prhls first Pen-heron importation was made by Pullerton £ Martin, )hio. and it is related that this three-year-old which they imported ridiculed the first year, patronized some the second and praised by during the third year of his servicp in this country. He was of good •Ue, closely ribbed and very blocky and compact, but was not of the Emit type, as he weighed in full Posh a little over sixteen hundred nds. His colts, however, were a most effective argument in his »lf. for they were wonderfully uniform and showed unusual develop. it. even as yearlings. The blood "nicked" well with the native American stock and an Illinois breeder was so favorably impressed with the get of this stallion that he purchased him for 11500 and took him to DeWitt county, in Illinois, in 1855, where he gave excellent satisfaction, and was shown through the latter '50s and '60s at all leadine fairs with his get. He died in 1871. The excellency of Louis Napoleon's colts may be said to have started •Ton importations to this country, and a number of importations were made made during the latter '50s and -'ven through the '60s, al - though not so many at this time. Beginning again in the '70s, importa - tions were quite general and between 1876 and 1893 a very large number of I'ercheron horses were imported to this country. The first Shires imported in 1862, the first Clydesdales were also Imported about this time, but importations of Shires and Clydesdales were not at all general until after 1872. Belgians were first imported in 1866, but the importation of this breed were slight until after 1888. From a practical standpoint, therefore, the chief progress in the breeding or pure bred draft horses in the United States has dated since VALUATION OF HORSKS BUM there were 11,201,800 horses in the United States, with an e valuation of $54.75 per head, or a total valuation of $613,296,611. on January 1, 1910, the horses in the United States numbered Kid. with an -average of $108 per head, or a total valuation of (63,000. </seg>

The total valuation of the live stork Included under the head of cattle, sheep, swine, nor— and mules runs into such staggering totals as to be beyond compre - hension. The total valuation of the classes of stork named, January 1. 1910, amounted to $5,138,486,000, and of this amount $2,368,028,000 rep - resents the total valuation of the cattle, sheep and swine, while mules represent $494,095,000 and horses alone amount in valuation to $2,276. - 363,000. In other words, horses and mules represent more than one - half the total valuation of the live rtock In the United States and the valuation is on a very conservative estimate, the average valuation on mules being placed at $119 per head and the average valuation on horses at $1*8. Figures of this kind necessarily are difficult to keep in mind and may not mean a great deal to the vast majority of you, but it may be somewhat easier to remember, that of the total live stork in the United States, horses alone represent almost one-half the total valuation of live stork, while horses and mules together exceed in valuation all of the rattle, sheep and swine. LIVE STOCK INDEX TO A NATIONS WEALTH Eatlon in the world ranks so high in live stock production and tion of live stock as the United States, and Nebraska is one of est ranking states in Us live stock production. There is a very close connection between live stock raising and the prosperity of a nation, for we find in a study of the nations of the world that those which are most wealthy, most prosperous and which have the highest order of Intelligence are those which are abundantly supplied with domestic animals for purposes of food and draft. We have been termed a nation of meat eaters, and it is generally admitted that the intelligence and physical vigor which characterise t American people is in no small degree due to the fact that they nore liberally nourished, on a better diet, than any other people. •*» DRAFT HORSE MAKES LABOR-SAVING POSSIBLE The draft horse has done more to make possible the thorough culti - vation of our farms and to permit of farming on a labor saving basis than any other animal which we possess. He has made possible a high standard of life on our farms. Pr. Knapp, the special agent of the Department of Agriculture, who made extended investigations into southern agriculture, has pointed out very clearly that the one great weakness in southern agricultural conditions, lies in the low proportion of team force used, per man. In many large districts through the south one man uses but one mule, whereas, in such districts as Iowa, Nebraska and other prosperous northern states, practically four horses are used per man. The efficiency of the human worker is thus greatly multiplied and the heavier tools </seg>
            <seg id="p330">and more modern machinery makes possible much more thorough culti - vation, with its corresponding results in larger crops and greater pros - perity for the man who tills the soil. CITY DEMAND— EFFECT OF AUTO TRUCK There has been in the past a great market in our large cities for heavy draft horses and good prices have for many years been realized for horses of substantial weight and good draft qualities. This market still exists. It is possible that it may be in some degree curtailed by the development of the motor truck, although I have but recently read the frank admission of some of the most noted authorities in the auto world, to the effect that the auto truck cannot expect to compete with draft horses, save where the hauls are exceptionally heavy, of greater length than is usual, and where but little delay is connected with loading and unloading. In such work as freight hauling from the warehouses and large job - bing establishments to the freight depots, where the distance is rela - tively short and where teams must frequently stand for an hour or two, waiting an opportunity to unload, the high cost of the auto truck pre - cludes its economical use; and as hauling of this and similar kinds makes up a large part of the draft horse work in the cities, I do not look for as serious a curtailment In city demand for draft horses in the future as many alarmists are expecting. GREATEST MARKET IN THE FUTURE E believe, however, that the greatest market for the draft horses of future will be found on the farms. As the prices of farm products Inue to advance land values will inevitably advance and, to be sue - tal, we must so till the soil as to secure more abundant crops than High production on our farms comes only with thorough tilling of the soil. Plowing must be thoroughly done and every furrow turned to as great a depth as the conditions of the soil and the crop to be grown renders advisable. The plowed land must be disked and this must be well and frequently done, especially during the spring months when land not so handled tends to lose a large share of Its stored up moisture, particularly during the dry springs which we so frequently Btnost fertile fields are those which receive most liberal dressings i yard manure and our modern machinery which renders this &gt; easy requires an abundance of power in the way of horse flesh. Jon. it is true, does not require such extremely heavy horses as er work of the farm, yet animals must be of good weight and abundant strength to handle a riding cultivator for ten hours' work in the field, particularly where the work is well done.

In fact, throughout all the farm operations, we find urgent need for draft animals of the best conformation and with weight exceeding six - teen hundred pounds, even in working condition. In many of the farm operations animals weighing in excess of eighteen hundred pounds can be more efficiently used than those of the lighter weight. OBJECTIONS SLIGHT. I It is true that there are many farmers who cannot see the advantage using draft horses for farm work, but their number is steadily grow - ing less. One of the arguments most frequently advanced is that draft horses are slower in field work and do more injury to the crops in turning than lighter horses weighing eleven and twelve hundred pounds, but the charge of slowness is unfounded, for the long swinging stride of the good drafter carries him over vastly more ground In a day than the shorter, fussier, but apparently more rapid step of his light weight brother. So far as the crop damage In turning is concerned, practically all up-to-date farmers are now adopting the plan of leaving a twelve - foot hear, land in hay, which gives a much neater appearance to tbe fields, makes it possible to keep the fence rows clean from weeds and also permits of turning without damaging the field crops. The head lands produce practically as much hay as any of the meadow lands and it is a simple matter to adopt this plan. ECONOMIC WASTE NOT TO USE MARES. fside from the fact that the farm work can be more efficiently and omically done by the use of heavy draft horses, we find that where ligent methods prevail, the farm work is being done by mares and of their colts as are not yet of marketable age, which means that work is being done by animals that are of productive value aside their labor. !he man who keeps geldings or mules for his farm work secures their labor in return, while the man who keeps draft mares, re - ■8 not only their labor but, in addition to this, their colts. It is true somewhat more team force must be kept where the work is done aares than where the work is done entirely by geldings, but when consider that three mares can be counted upon to do as much as team of geldings of an equal weight and strength, that the difference in feed cost will not exceed $60 per year, and that the three mares can be counted upon to produce in addition to their labor at least two colts that are worth $100 each as yearlings, it is apparent that the mares are the most profitable. The comparison just made is on the basis of grade mares, but where pure-bred mares are kept the returns will be </seg>

Good pure-bred colts are worth at a very conservative estimate at least $200 per head as yearlings. The cost of raising them is but little greater than that of raising good grade colts, aside from the greaiei initial cost of the mares, and when we take into consideration the fact that pure-bred mares are sold at from $500 to $800 per head, while good grade mares are worth from $250 to $350 per head, it may be readily seen that the mature mares will sell much closer to grade mares than pure-bred colts will to grade colts, particularly when we take into con - sideration that pure-bred yearlings that are brought along in tirst-class shape very frequently sell at from $300 to $350 per head. TWO-THIRDS OF SIRES NOW IN USE UNFIT The reports of the various state stallion boards in the states that have such boards established show by actual statistics that from 45 per cent to 65 per cent of the sires in use are grades and as it is admit - tedly true that a considerable number of pure-bred sires now in use are too inferior to be long continued in service, it seems safe to say that not to exceed one-third of the draft stallions in service are pure - bred horses of such conformation, size and quality as to warrant their continuance in the stud. In other words, in spite of forty odd years of trtation and upward of the same length of time in breeding, we are lacking very decidedly in a sufficient number of pure-bred sire* of lent individuality for our breeding purposes. It appears safe to say that when more than two score years of work has produced not to exceed one-third the number of pure-bred sire* needed, tor American horse breeders, that the next fifty years will not see an oversupply of pure-bred draft stallions of the right stamp. There may be an oversupply of the inferior and scrubby pure-bred kind, for it is a lamentable fact that there are pure-bred horses that are not worthy of the name. The same thing prevails in other classes of live stock and the same conditions must be met by all breeders. The man who is producing really meritorious horses, however, need have no fear, in my judgment, of the supply of such horses exceeding the demand, at least not within the next forty or fifty years. PURE-BRED VS. GRADE SIRE E radically every one recognizes nowadays that pure-bred animals more valuable from the utility standpoint than grades. They are the very nature of the case, superior in individuality, on the aver - age, to the grades, and In addition to this are much more prepotent in breeding. You all recognize this, so it is not necessary for me to dwell on this point, although it is a fact that there are men who do not realize </seg>
            <seg id="p333">unto himself, than a grade sire. Because of this very fact they do not properly discriminate between the grade sire and a pure-bred sire stand - ing in their community. I am convinced that we can raise as good draft horses here in the central west as in any place in the world. Soil conditions, water, cli - mate and food supplies are all equal to the best to be found in any country in the world. We need good dams and we need good sires, but we must learn, as the French Percheron breeders have already learned, that feeding is fully as important as breeding. We must learn to supply the very best of pastures for the mares and colts, and to refrain from overstocking our blue-grass pastures early in the season, in order that we may bave abundance of grass during July and August, when pastures are so frequently dry and bare. We must learn to feed our colts grain while on pasture and to feed them on such foods as will build up bone and muscle. The man who furnishes an abundance of good water, shaded pasture land, thickly set in rich blue-grass, and who feeds his suckers, weanlings and yearlings on such mixtures as alfalfa-meal, corn, bran and oats need have no fear that his colts will not develop to the fullest extent. Their size and strength will be limited only by the inherited tendencies trans - mitted from their ancestors. MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. R actual statistics covering the importation of horses imported for ig purposes reveal the fact that we have the past nine years ed more than one million dollars per year in foreign countries e purchase of breeding horses; and inasmuch as most of the imported to this country are Percherons, it necessarily follows e larger proportion of this million dollars has gone to enrich the i of France and particularly those of La Perche. In other words, we in America, who pride ourselves upon the produc - tion of our farms and fields, have been sending money abroad which might just as well be expended for the enrichment of American farmers if we would but exert the same degree of effort and intelligence in the production of good horses that we do in the production of good cattle There is no question but that we can produce as good horses in this country as can be produced abroad. For more than forty years we have been importing the best that can be found abroad, and during the last ten years particularly American buyers have selected the very horses that could be found in Europe. We have, therefore, as good stock on which to base our breeding operations as can be found in the old country, and I am satisfied that we can produce as good stock if we adopt thoroughly Intelligent methods in the breeding and rearing of our draft </seg>

IX 1N\ ESTIXG Caution must be used in investing in any class of pure-bred stock and this Is even more true with horses than with other classes of live stock because of the greater financial stake involved. At the same time any Nebraska farmer who has been successful in breeding and rearing grade draft colts can well afford to gradually displace his grade mares with at. good Percheron mares as he can secure, for they will do the work even better because of their greater size and strength and will produce decid - edly more to add to the credit side of the balance sheet at the end of 6 year's business. The choice of breed is like the choice of a wife, i man must select for himself, and early training and familial it. v a breed are all powerful factors in shaping a man's choice. COMM1N1TY 1NTKRKST IN HREEDiNG. The first step in making definite progress in breeding better draft hor— in any community is to secure a first-class stallion, and while there are many communities where some individual breeder owns a sufficient number of pure-bred mares to warrant the purchase of a first - class stallion, there are .ar more communities when- individuals who are willing and able to secure a first-class stallion are not to be found. To expend between $1..".OO and $2,000 in the purchase of a draft sire ■ a heavy burden on an individual and the financial returns in standing a stallion are not sufficient to lead a conservative business man to invest money in this way. in the hope of securing satisfactory financial returns, 'he risk is great and with ih&gt; pMM0i of stallion laws many horses that re sound when purchased are later disqualified, and this of course means a serious loss to ihe individual who has invested his money in a first-class horse. 1 am not in favor of the company plan of selling stallions, as it is generally practiced in the United States, but I am in favor of community ownership of a good sire. The financial returns from a stallion in most communities must come chiefly from the increased value of his colts, rather than from any profits accruing from service fees. With this in mind, it is clear that the ex - penae of securing and keeping a good stallion in many communities should be borne by all those receiving benefits thereby. A company of from four to ten farmers can well afford to make their own organization and pay out from $1,500 to $2,000 for a first-class horse. Such a horse can be secured for the price named where the parties interested organize their own company and go direct to the barns for their purchase. I am positive ihat a stallion fit to stand for service in almost any community In America can be secured for the price named. The excellency of the bone will of course depend largely upon the judgment o" the men chosen to make the purchase and upon their ability as buyers. I have seen </seg>
            <seg id="p335">I community plan of ownership gives excellent results where a of men go together and secure a good horse, but it should by all originate from the farmers' side, for where a horse is sent to a nity and sold there by an expert salesman, the results are not us they should be and the price paid must necessarily be much itian is necessary on account of the expense involved and the paid the salesman. SECURE PIREHRE1) MARES. When a really good draft stallion has been permanently located in a community men will be justified in securing pure-bred draft mares, and while, as mentioned before, caution must be used in investing, men who have been successful with their grade mares can well afford to dispose of these and invest in some pure-bred mares, for the work can be as well or better done, and the results obtained financially will be much more satisfactory. The ownership of pure-bred draft mares of any given breed within a community benefits every man there located, for it con - centrates interest in better horses, does much to insure better sires, and by drawing buyers from all parts of the country, results in materi - ally higher prices for all animals produced in such districts. EXPERIENCE THE MASTER OF TEACHERS— A SAFEGUARD. Men who are experienced in experimental work concede that when any particular method is followed by a vast majority of farmers and feeders, it usually has a sound scientific basis, and in countless experi - ments those things which have been already established by farmers and Eliave been found to be correct. The vast majority of American have tried draft horse breeding and have found it profitable, e found the Percheron horse to be best suited to American agri - conditions. </seg>

There Is plenty of room for them and that without In the lea«t antagonizing any special purpose breed of cattle. There is a place for the special dairy cow, principally In dairy dis - tricts near th« city. There Is a place for the special beef animals, prin - cipally on tracts of land used for grazing and where no special atten - tion is piven to individual animals; any place in fact where beef is a paramount consideration. Ewell we have these different advantages In the cattle industry splendidly meet our various conditions and environments, and discussion of this subject, we wish to say that no one is any than is the writer of the splendid diary and beef herds of We have spoken In a general way of the place for the special dairy cow. She may also have a place as a town cow where usually but one is kept. The beef animal may also be kept in a profitable way on small farms where bred in his purity and recorded, he may be used and sold for breeding purposes. The dual-purpose cow has her place with the average farmer the man who never as yet and possibly never will make a specialty of any breed of cattle. He is a sort of all-purpose fellow and live* in an all - purpose state, Nebraska. Not a manufacturing or mineral producing state, but a state in which mixed husbandry and diversified farming flour - ishes in the fullest sense. The all-purpose farmer grows various kinds of farm products, as well as different kinds of live stock. In point of numbers he is away in the majority and will be for some time to come. Ehe cow best suited to his purpose Is the dual-purpose cow. She is at the pail, produces a good calf, that in turn is a fairly good er or is a good feeding steer, always in demand at a good figure growing better each year. She herself when no longer useful as a urer furnishes a reasonably good carcass for the butcher's block. The question of where we are to get our feeding steers is becoming an important one. In years gone by when corn dropped in price, as this year, stock cattle were usually low; not so now. The reason is their scarcity. They are scarce from the fact of the breaking up of the range country. South of us in Oklahoma and the great state of Texas the cattle country is sold for agricultural purposes. The same is true of Colorado, Montana, and other western and northwestern states. The homesteader has even invaded the sandhills country which a few years ago we thought would always be a cattle grazing country. All this sim - ply means that the steer must largely be grown by the average farmer. </seg>

It has been said that we cannot grow our steers in the eastern half of Nebraska only at a loss, as the land is too high in price. We believe that they can be grown at the present price of feeders and land, and at a good profit; be grown largely at this season of the year upon what today is waste. There are thousands of acres of stalk-fields standing today that might have been utilized if they had been harvested in some way; a part put in silos, perhaps, which would have grown hundreds of steers through the winter. It would not only have grown them in a profitable way, but also is an assurance against the commonly known stalk-field disease. While at our home town of Fairfield, Neb., I recently saw at the freight house two men with three hides each that were taken from i attic lost in the stalk-fields. One of these men said this made nine head that he had lost. My son also related a loss of cattle by another party from whom he was buying some steers. The party in question lost three of the six head of steers which he was, holding for the purpose of utiliz - ing his stalk-field. In Clay county alone enough cattle have died this win - ter to build a good many silos ana harvest a good many acres of corn. Further than this, cattle which are wintered in the stalk-fields often come through the winter in such bad shape that it takes half of the fol - lowing summer to regain what they lost during the winter. Bl steer of today must be grown for the early market the same as g. He can no longer be kept until three or four years old. The champion steer at the International this year was a yearling as was te case two years ago. Eis having spoken of the dual-parpose cow as to her practicability, ght say as to her conformation, that while she is not as slim h the neck and narrow through the front parts as the dairy cow, ■ does she have the width of front and the thickness of the beef She is reasonably smooth and bears ample evidence of being a lilker. The average dual-purpose cows of today as you find them scattered throughout the entire country, and upon the average farms, is the re - sult of grades and cross-breeds only. It has been said that the dual - purpose cow cannot be bred with any degree of certainty. This we deny and if time would permit we could furnish abundance of evidence to the contrary. Of course, purity and certainty in their breeding can be established only by the same method used by the special dairy and beef breeds. We might call your attention to certain families of the Shorthorns as representatives of the dual-purpose animals, and while somewhat rough in their make-up as a rule they can be depended upon as milkers and reasonably good beef cattle. There is, however, but one breed which to our knowledge is almost universally a dual-purpose breed, this being the Red Polls, a cattle bred </seg>
            <seg id="p338">338 gardless of horns or color, 90 per cent ot the get from a Red Poll sire will be red and without horns. Two very desirable features along with milk and beef. This establishes the fact that the Red Polls are as in tensely bred in their purity as any other beef or dairy breed. In our experience with these cattle, reaching over a period of some sixteen years in which we have been directly interested in buying and selling, dur - ing which time we raised W'lvveen five and six hundred head, we have never had a cow in the herd but what was fairly good for milk, would at least raise her calf, and but few that were not good feeders. They are docile by nature and respond most readily to good feed and good care. Their milk is not only of good quality but the cows are persistent milkers. Ordinarily they are of good size, the males weighing around a ton and often larger We weighed a two years and three months old male recently that weighed 1700 pounds. The cows vary in weight from l.ion to 1,600 pounds. This wide margin in difference in weight in the cows la regulated for the most part by the breeders who own the herd, be - cause if the cows are made to produce calves when too young, their growth is invariably checked. Pl8 to the individual record milk lest of these cattle in this country, most noted is that of the Pan-American Show at Buffalo, N. Y., where dairy breeds entered the test. This show being held in the densely populated districts of the Kast where dairying is the great specialty, an enthusiasm was manifest which resulted in one of the grandest shows of dairy cows ever brought together. The show consisted of five cows from each breed the test reaching over a period of six months time. During this time feed consumed 1 y each cow. as well as the milk and the butter - fat produced, was taken into consideration. The Red Polls in this test were all from one herd in charge of a man who never compounded a balanced ration for a cow. while the other breeds were cared for by men of experience and owned by men worth lots of money. In production of butter fat and churned butter, cost of feed considered and butter at 25 cents per pound, on a basis of K per &lt; ent butt»r-fat, the five cows in each breed stood as follows: Guernsey, .Jersey, A&gt; shire, Holstein. Red Polls. In the tin dairy breeds, Red Polls stood fifth, beaten in production of churned butter for the entire six months by the Holsteins to the amount of $1.05.

We do not have many large herd tests as ye' in this country but in England a great many. In 1909 the Jean Duluth farm, of Duluth, Minn., made a est of their entire herd of cows and heifers the sixteen cows showing an average per cow of 5,786 pounds of milk, and 257.84 pounds of butter-fat iix heifers showed an average of 5,567 pounds of milk and 243.04 pounds of butter-fat. In the herd of Mr. Garrett Taylor, of England, a test of five years, where the entire herd numbered from eighty-five to ninety-eight head, the average annual yield of milk per cow was from 5,116 to 5,877 pounds; the average fat was from 3.75 to 4 per cent. In Mr. A. J. Smith's herd twenty-two head pave an average of 6.374 pounds. The herd of Lord Roth - childs. of Tring-Park, that were selected with the view to milk, thirty - seven cows gave an average of 6,937 pounds and a year later twenty-two head gave an average of 7.744 pounds. In 1896 the cows from twelve herds numbering 253 head gave an average of 5,786.49 pounds. The above citations are pretty conclusive evidence of the dairy qualities of the Red Polls. It is likely from our drier climate that production of milk here is not quite so ?reat as in Kngland. but the quality is believed to be i nough better to balance. In 1902 the International added ;&gt; m class to their premium list called, "The Farmers' Cow Claps." Good money prizes were offered and the consideration in this class were Individual merit. 25 per cent butter record of each cow during the iierioil of lactation. 3.". per cent and the calf she produced, 40 per cent. Four Red Polled breeders from Wiscon - sin and Ohio made entries. The Iowa Aeric-ultural College made one nntry of a Shorthorn cow. The result was that even showing against a public institution, with Professor Carlisle, of Wisconsin College and Professor Day 6f the Ontario Agricultural College, as judges, a Red Polled cow won first and the Shorthcn second. First in yield of butter for 330 days was 327.8 pounds; the second in SSI days was 315.1 pounds. As an individual the Shorthorn cow had the advantage of 6 per cent in the calf produced, the Red Poll cow an advantage of 8 per cent. The next year there were only Red Polls entered and after that for want of com - lietition, the Farmers' Cow Class was abandoned. The Red Polled cattle club now have a standing offer of $500 to reinstate this class, providing any other breed will put a like sum. These cattle have also been making a 'very creditable showing in the carcass contest each year. While on root they have not been fed to the i ipe finish the other breeds have, this has been the fault of the exhibitor and not the cattle. I know that they do finish nicely both steers ana heifers. A two-year-old barren heifer shown by us at the International in 1906 won second in the steer class of the Red Polls where she had to be shown on foot. Her live weight was 1,125 pounds and dressed weight 760 rounds, showing a per cent yield in dressed weight of 67.5 per cent, while the best carcass in the show was an Angus steer showing a dressed weight yield of ■ nt, making only a net dressed weight of </seg>

I will just say she dressed more than the Red Poll steer that stood above her on foot by 1 per cent and sold for two cents more per pound. He was ted on milk and the flesh was soft, would not harden in the cooler. She was fed equal parts cob-meal, oats and bran and alfalfa hay. We find the Red Polls each year about fourth i fifth In the carcass contest In 1907 a two-year-old Red Polled steer was rd in point of yield dressed weight. We do not claim for them that they are the best for either beef or milk, but have only given these records of test to show that they can be depended upon to a marked degree of certainty as a dual-purpose cattle. We also claim as set forth above that there is a profitable place for them on Nebraska farms and no cattle will more readily respond to good care and rood feed than will the Red Polls. While this is true, we are also, as I have previously stated, proud of the excellent beef and dairy herds of our state, and especially proud of the dairy records made on this experiment farm, which are almost.

Breeding of stock affords opportunities for productive advertising, equal of that of the average commercial commodity, and there is no better means of attracting attention than through the advertising columns of farm and stock publications whose subscriber-readers are farmers, stock - men and breeders. It is a well known fact that in times of depression that the best ad - vertised breeders suffer the least, and statistics will prove that the pro - gressive successful advertiser of pure-bred stock is the breeder who not only produces the best, but if a gooi 1 . advertiser, no matter what condi - tions may prevail, he is not discouraged but keeps up the good work.

Selling by mall by the use of personal follow-up from personal letters we know has been the means of celling our pure-bredi to breeders from the Mississippi to I'tah and from Texas to Canada. Too many breeders think that the insertion of an advertisement wi'l sell their stock, and their lack of ability to convince or interest a buyer in the first letter is no good cause for the breeder to quit writing. We find the form letter method of selling pure-bred cattle and hogs by mail order Is the very best and roost successful plan and by far the cheapest and to prove this we call attention to the fact that although we have two large sepa - rate herds of Aberdeen-Angus and three separate herds of Poland-China in all our years of breeding we have never yet had a public sale of stock, preferring our plan as being the most satisfactory, not only to ourselves, hut to the purchaser who saves expense of a trip, does not have to leave home, but can buy through the mail lust what he Is looking for and wants a reasonable price under u guarantee that protects him.

MAJORITY OF BREEDERS BARELY HOLDING THEIR OWN WHILE ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR ARE RAISING THE STANDARD OF TYPE AND QUALITY. "Breeding Up the Herd" was the subject of an address by Robert D. Mousel, the Hereford cattle breeder at Cambridge, Neb., delivered at the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders' meeting at Lincoln. "This sub - ject," he said, "should be conservatively considered. As the p*oint of profit or loss depends entirely upon the method of breeding up and maintaining a pure bred herd, making them a source of profit should be our chief pur - suit. In order to be successful it will be necessary to properly breed up the herd to the highest degree possible. "One of the first problems to be considered is determining the breed beat suited to your location, conditions and liking. Any of the beef breeds, if properly cared for, will bring profitable returns. If you are breeding beef cattle, be sure you have the beef-type and stay with it We are now in an age of specialties. The American meat eaters today de - mand the rib roast or porter house steak from a prime well finished bullock of an animal of proper conformation which none other can amply furnish but a beef type; while, on the other hand, the butcher demands one of the same type and wants him to furnish in abundance meat trom the most valuable cuts. This point should be kept well in mind by the breeders and producers of beef. i 'lit notable fact I have learned in attendance at some of the largest stock shows and expositions, especially in the feeders' department in such shows as the International and the Denver shows, is the grouping of corn belt feeders. Discussing the sort of feeders for which they were looking, one will say 'I am going to have the type and quality I am look - ing for even if I am compelled to pay a premium of fifty cents or a dollar a hundred.' Another will say 'there is a load of large rough feeders 1 would hardly take home as a gift. We used to think they were O. K., but things are different now. We have plenty of cribs for corn." Yes, things have changed. New conditions and new methods have come to take the place of old ones, and in order to be successful we must submit to them. "In breeding up the herd we should endeavor to improve our cattle and our methods of caring for them each year. This point seems in - variably to be abused. I have come to the conclusion that only about 25 per cent of all the breeders of pure l.red stock are really improving the breed; they are raising the standard, while the other 75 per cent are barely holding their own, or probably are deteriorating. More than likely the latter. I wonder how many at this meeting are following the </seg>
            <seg id="p345">be a tall-ender any longer. Following such methods Is apt to make the pure bred breeding business a drudgery. If you are a breeder of pure bred stock, do not be satisfied with the ordinary sort, but make your herd a source of pleasure as well as profit. Keep the best possible. Keep a high-class herd bull that has the prepotency to transmit his character- 6 to his progeny, assisted by a herd of good matronly large growthy with plenty of scale and bone of uniform smooth thick-flesh beef With such a herd you will be able to compete with your fellow 'Bach year's calf crop should be rigidly sorted Inferior bull calves should be converted into steers. The females should be dealt with ac - cordingly; while those selected for breeding purposes should have good treatment with plenty of good feed to keep them growing. I find that a great amount of time and attention should be given the calf, especially after weaning. I find that what is usually lost in growth is scarcely ever regained. They should have plenty of roughness of good quality with some grain, such as oats or barley, with a mixture of bran and corn chop. But by all means, do not crowd them on grain, especially corn. Calves to be properly developed should have plenty of exercise. This makes them very rugged and hardy. Experience has taught me that the best feeders are calves that have the run of the pasture with their dams with but little or no grain whatever, until they reach the age of about four months. Even if you expect to develop show animals of them I find this is the best method. With plenty of grass or hay with their mother's milk, they develop strong digestive organs in proper shape t respond to feed. I find more bloom on calves cared for and finished ler this kind of treatment than any other method. "As a rule, bull calves can be put on a grain ration at a younger age than heifers as they usually take more exercise than heifers. If cared for in this way, the bulls will weigh from 900 to 1,100 pounds at one year and be ready for market. Calves pushed for show purposes should prob - ably weigh from 1,000 to 1,200 pounds at one year. The females should be kept growing, as a breeding herd of large thick smooth cows is very essential. But do not breed females too young. They should not bring a calf under twenty-eight months. Some register association will not record a calf from a dam under twenty-seven months. This rule appeals to me as a Just one. "Keep your herd in bloom. Do not keep more cattle than you can take care of well and keep them in fine condition. Then they will give your customers a good impression. They will start to advertise you on the spot. They should be kept in an attractive condition at all times. Usually your customer's first remark is that he would like to see your herd bull, and if he is a good individual and has the proper breeding, your customer is anxious to select a good bull calf or a few females by him or something bred to him. If your bull is worthy of being called one - half of the herd, you yill find him the greatest salesman on the farm. He has his owner beaten a city block. 12 </seg>

As a rule, they are ready for grass when spring comes and the dams give an abundance of milk, and by July 1, just before flies be - come bad, wean them. This gives the mother ample time to get into good flesh before cold weather sets in. ThU leaves her In fine condition for her next calf. Once every twelve months is often enough for a cow to pro - duce a calf. She cannot do justice to herself and calf without a reason - able amount of rest. Having your calves come in January or February, you can usually get your cows bred again before you turn them out in pasture. This saves a great amount of time and labor and you are less ipt to have any miss getting In calf. THE SELECTION OF A HERD BULL. Ee selection of the herd bull is one of the difficulties a breeder has tend with. Breeders differ In their opinion as to what really con ■s a typical herd bull. Some will select a bull because he has an head, others because he has a certain sire or pedigree; while still will choose one because he has great length or bone. 'Select an animal that suits. Then, if his pedigree is right, buy him He should possess an ideal beef type with great, strong bone, thick flesh and smoothness, with a feeder's head, a masculine character, with a good wide deep body and two good ends. You can get them too long, but I have failed to get them too wide. "Has it ever occurred to you that a large percentage of those unusually long bodied bulls are very short in quarters? I prefer a bull with length, but he must possess thickness and he must possess length and be deep in quarters as well as in body. A long body with short quarters does not set well up in the shoulders. You will invariably find a well sprung rib in a thick beef type animal. Avoid patchlness. Get them as smooth as possible and covered with a heavy soft coat of hair. It will depend largely upon his condition as to the extent o. his advertising possibilities. Eword as to the breeder's character. He should be strictly honest right, represent his stock exactly as they are, be friendly to his ' breeders, whether or not he breeds the same breed of cattle, and If your friends go to the fairs and win, boost, and then each ime to these annual meetings with your brother breeders, get your * to the wheel, and then we will all boost." </seg>

Rtlve to the cost of producing wool In the United States, It is hard to estimate the cost of game, since there are no figures con - the cost of wool alone. The cost of keeping individual sheep a approximated by various men as from $2 to $2.50. The relative re - turns from wool as compared with the returns from the lambs is usually about half as much for the wool as for the lambs. Now If it costs $2 tc $2.50 to keep a sheep and the returns from It are credited one-third to the wool, the cost of production should also be credited one-third to the wool, the figuring on this basis, it would cost from sixty-six cents to eighty-five cents per head. Figuring from this basis, of course the cost of wool per pound would depend on the number of pounds the sheep would shear. The average clip per head In Nebraska is about seven pounds, which would throw the cost per pound at something like ten to twelve cents for production. I notice a statement In a recent issue of the Sheen Breeder, in which a man from Nebraska figures out that it costs him seventeen and a half cents per pound to produce wool, but It seems to me that possibly his figures are a little exorbitant. The items which would be taken Into consideration In the production of wool would be the In - terest on the money Invested in the sheep, the feed, the shearing, and also the dipping of the sheep and the labor incidental to their care. The Interest would amount to about lu per cent of the cost, the feed about 84 per cent, the shearing approximately 10 per cent, while the remainder would be charged up to the dipping and additional labor. The average life of a sheep as a wool producer varies so much with the different breeds that it is hard to approximate an average for all sheep. The fine wool sheep live approximately ten years, possibly longer, while the mutton breeds do not live more than two-thirds as long. The great majority of the sheep in the United States are either Merino or of Merino extraction, and therefore I presume the average life of sheep in this country is probably eight years. Aa to the effect on land value and fertilization of sheep ranging thereon sheep add materially to the value of the land each year, because they graze very evenly over the entire area and the manure resulting is distributed in the best possible manner. Sheep manure is especially high in nitrogen and is quite equal in other necessary elements to almost any other form of animal manure, so that on the whole sheep manure Is more valuable than that produced by any other of our domestic ani mals. I do not know the exact value of It, but comparatively speaking, the value returned to the land would be greater than that of any other of our grazing animals. Sheep ordinarily dress 60 per cent on the average. The average clip </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE. of wool is seven pounds, which would take 7 per cent more, while the green hide without the wool would probably weigh about 7 to 10 per cent of the carcass. The amount of glue and similar by-products I have no conception of at all, but the remainder of the carcass aside from the mutton, the wool, and the green hide, would go to make up the green fertilizer and the glue, etc. I am sorry I cannot answer this question a Figuring the shrinkage in wool from the unscoured to the scoured con - dition, depends very much upon the quality of wool to start with. Fine wools shrink much more than coarser wools and we have a wide range of variation in the shrinkage of various sorts of wool. The Government duties on wool that is imported are based on the assumption that wool shrinks two-thirds its weight, but this Is rather high for a great many sorts of wool. It Is probably approximately true of the wools that are lm- Ed but these are mostly on the heavy or fine wool kind. The terrl - wools which come from our range country shrink heavily, possibly i amount of 60 per cent or more, but there are many classes of wools grown In the United States which do not shrink much more than half this. The average clip of wool for 1905 and the average shrink of the same was estimated by the government as amounting in total to 57 per cent only, that is, that the amount of wool produced after it was scoured ready for the mills to use, had shrunk 57 per cent, which would be con - siderably less than 66 2-3 per cent. Manufacturers figure on 25 per cent loss from the scoured wools until the time it goes into cloth. That Is, four pounds of scoured wool would make only three pounds of clothing. </seg>

Experiments have been carried on by the United States Department of Agriculture as well as other investigators, showing that the bovine type of the tubercle bacilli taken from a cow affected with generalized tuberculosis, has been changed to the human type by growing it on solidi - fied human blood serum. The tubercle bacilli of human type originally obtained from human sputum, after passing them through cattle were changed to the bovine type. The tubercle bacilli originally obtained from a man after being passed through a sheep was also changed to the bovine type of tubercle bacilli, which Indicates that the human being can be - come affected from the bovine type of tuberculosis. Experiments have also been carried on showing that the tubercle bacilli will live In butter for eight months or longer without losing its vitality, which clearly demonstrated the possibility of transmitting the disease from all dairy products obtained from cattle affected with tuberculosis, and also rrom the cattle which are exposed to the affected cattle, as animals are very likely to carry some of the infection upon the surface of their skin, and when being milked small particles of the infection may be dropped off into the milk pail and in this manner the germ be introduced into the milk from animals which are perfectly free from tuberculosis. Regardless of the question of the communicability of tuberculosis from animal to man and the bearing of animal tuberculosis on public health, it is a well known fact that this disease causes heavy financial losses to the live stock industry of this state; and while the saving of human life affords the highest motive for combating tuberculosis, the prevention of financial loss, is alone sufficient reason for undertaking the eradication of the disease from our farm animals. The loss per annum through tuberculosis from farm animals and their products, in the United States, Is estimated at twenty-three mlllon dollars. </seg>

Tuberculosis has progressed to an alarming extent In our state and is undoubtedly on an Increase, as no measures had been taken against it in Nebraska until a short time ago and then the measures were entirely inadequate to cope with the conditions. The animals principally affected are cattle and hogs. The disease spreads very rapidly among cattle bat come in close contact with each other as in dairy cattle and pure - bred herds. Experiments made by the Bureau of Animal Industry, as »tll as other experiment stations, have proven that one cow affected tuberculosis will infect a number of healthy animals, when ex - posed to the diseased one, in a very short time. It has also been proven that the disease is easily communicated from cattle to hogs by the com - mon practice of giving hogs skimmed milk and allowing them to feed on excrements.

As a rule it is Insidious, chronic, and slowly progressive, and the bodies of its victims are able to adapt or adjust themselves to the gradually increasing destructive changes that it causes, quite extensive harm has been done or vitally important organ* have become seriously involved. The result is that the disease may be present in the body a long time without external manifestations of Its existence It may attack any part of the body singly or several organs at the same time. economic advantages of eradicating tuberculosis from farm ani mats are too apparent to require extended discussion. They will come to the individual stock raiser and dairyman as well as to the public and to the nation. Breeders are beginning to understand that it is unprofit - able to go on raising cattle while tuberculosis exists in their herds. The practice is becoming more general for buyers of breeding and dairy cattle to have such animals tested before placing them in their herds, and the breeder who can give assurance that his herd is free from tu - berculosis has a decided advantage in making sales. With the agitation in favor of a more wholesome milk supply there is a growing demand for milk from healthy herds at higher prices, and as this demand in - creases the dairyman who cannot show a clean bill of health for his cows will find it more difficult to market his products. To overcome the great losses before mentioned is worth considerable effort and expense. The benefits to follow from the eradication of tu - berculosis from farm animals are so great and so obvious that the neces - sary expenditures, even though they must be heavy, may be regarded as a highly profitable investment. All cattle in the state which are to be used for dairy or breeding pur - poses should be tested with tuberculin and tagged or branded so they may be identified for future reference.

The premises should be thoroughly disinfected and in herds where the disease is found, the tuberculin test should be repeated at intervals of six months, and after the disease has apparently been wiped out, the test should still be applied once a year, until it is known beyond doubt that infection does not remain and has not been re-introduced. Investigations of tuberculosis in this State for the past two years has demonstrated that the disease is quite prevalent in catle and hogs.

The principle of the silo has been in operation for over a hundred yean, first being used in the beet sugar works in Germany, where pits and trenches were dug in the ground for the preservation of roots. From this crude beginning the wood silo was developed and during the last twenty years great strides have been made in its construction. At first practically all of the wood silos were built after what is known as "Wis - conain Plan," that is, by setting up studding in a circle. About twenty years ago the stave silo made its first appearance. It was built on the MM principle as the water tank with the staves running up and down. These staves were tongued, grooved and beveled to the circle and held in place by steel hoops, and had many advantages over the Wisconsin Plan." This form of construction is much cheaper, more easily erected, pre - serves the silage perfectly and has proven so satisfactory that it has al - most entirely supplanted every other style of construction. Construction is an important element in the preservation of silage. There are three vital factors in the keeping of silage, viz., pressure, heat, and add. The pressure packs the silage and excludes the air. The heat pasteurizes the silage and kills many of the mould spores. The acid is also detrimental to many of the spoiling moulds. Wood being a non - conductor of heat and cold, all parts of the silage, even the very outside, reach the- highest degree of temperature and therefore keep well, where cement, brick or stone is used, the heat is drawn from the silage, because they are good conductors of heat and for this reason more silage Bpoils around the edge of such a silo. A cement or brick silo cost considerable more than a wood silo. It must be built by someone who knows how to construct such a building, for if it cracks it is a total loss. COST OF SILAGE. Ei the dairy districts of New York, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan the has been in use for twenty years and has become such an important of the equipment of the dairy farmer that many have declared they d have to quit dairying if they had to dispense with the silo. Its general use has been delayed in Nebraska on account of an abundance of cheap roughage. The stock farmers, however, are learn - ing of the valuable qualities of silage in addition to its cheapness and, as a result, more interest has been aroused in this important subject this year than any time in the history of the state. The two questions which ■aamlly confront the farmer with stock in considering this subject are: What is the cost of prodcing silage, and what is its feeding value.

For instance, while an analysis will show probably no more food units than many other feeds, silage has succulency, giving It much of the properties of grass. This means that the stock will eat </seg>

It takes far less storage space than hay or other feeds, pound for pound, a savins in the cost of buildings and their maintenance. Large herds can be fed in a short time with a little labor, clearly a daring Another and far greater consideration to the dairy farmer it increased production of milk from the feeding of silage. It has been proven beyond controversy that cows may be made to produce milk in a constant quantity the year around by the feeding of silage. Yet many of the creamery men will tell yon that they are receiving more than half of their butter-fat in three months of the year. By the nse of the silo the farmer is enabled to put butter-fat on the market when it to worth the most. 8It,OS FOR THE CATTLE FKFDER. The value of silage as part of the ration for the dairy cow has long been established bnt Its value for feeding fattening cattle has not been to universally recognized. Still the silo is ranidly coming Into favor in sections of the country where beef production is made an important In - dustry A number cf state experiment stations have conducted tests in which corn silage has been compared with field cured fodder and other farm foodstuffs. Tn practically all of these experiments, silage has had !h-» effect of cheapening the ration and Increasing the profits from feed - tag. Tn a Kansas test It was found that one lot of ten steers fed silage in connection with alfalfa nay. Kafir corn, corn chop and cottonseed - meal produced gains at a cost of $4.91 per hundred pounds, while the lot fed on corn rations without silage produced gains at a cost of $5.95 per hundred. In computing the profits and losses of this feeding, it was round that there was an average profit of $4.10 per head made on the silage steers and an average loss of $1.47 per head on the steers which were fed without silage. A part of this larger profit was due to the fact that the silage fed steers sold for $4.95, while the steers which were given nothing but dry feed sold for twenty-five cents per hundred less. The higher selling price of the silage fed steers was caused by the fact that they made larger gains and were in somewhat higher condition at the time marketed. The Missouri station found in a steer feeding experiment where corn silage was compared with hay $1.07 for every hundred pounds of beef was saved by the use of silage. Not only are the Experiment stations ng satisfactory results in feeding silage, but practical feeders in the corn-belt are reducing the cost of production by the use of the silo.

It was an eloquent, though severe, plea for the suni - silo. The drought cut down the milk flow in most of the herds r 50 per cent Not one farmer in a hunded had provided for this (ency by a good simply of succulent food that would make milk. In all sections of the corn-belt where pasture grass is not abundant, the silo will be of particular value. Here in Nebraska we have a relatively small acreage In pasture and in consequence there is a marked shortage of grass in this state. On the other hand, we produce in Nebraska annually approximately five million tons of corn stover, of which about four-fifths is wasted. The more general introduction of the silo would make it possible to have a large part of this winter surplus offset the deficiency of summer feed and the capacity of our farms for keeping live stock would be Increased enormously. It is to be hoped that our stock farmers will make use of the entire corn plant in this way at we have now reached a stage in our development which makes it necessary to utilize everything that is grown to the very best advantage. THE SILO COMING IN NEBRASKA. Previous to the year 1909 there were about fifty silos in the state. A careful canvass made by our State Experiment Station gives 480 at the end of 1910. After visiting all the factories which are selling silos in this state, I am convinced that 2,000 is a conservative estimate of the silos for 1911. This gives a fairly accurate idea of the way the silo is being adopted in the state, and the day is not far distant when every up-to-date farmer will have one or more silos as part of his farm equip- </seg>

We find a man in whatever line of work he cares to take up, must compete with a great many others in the same line, and in order to make a name for himself, or in order to draw recognition from the world, he must be competent. well-qualified, and also up-to-date. Are men meeting this demand? Let We note that physicians all over the world find it necessary to take literature, magazines, journals, etc., from which they can glean helps, from observations and experiences of other men, who are also interested in the very same problems that they themselves are constantly confront - ing.

He has his conventions and institutes, where various means and plans are discussed, for the better - ing of his farm animals and farm crops. We find that different parts of the state contains different qaulities of soil, and have varied amounts ot rainfall, and that certain men make a study of these things, and experi - ment with all varieties, of seeds, plants, etc., and by practical observa - tions, learn what is best suited for each particular section of country. The results of these experiments are placed in magazines and journals, and the farmer has the same helping hand held out to him, in the way of up-to-date literature, as does the physician. The old world is just the same size it has always been, but the population is growing larger, so the man in the agricultural districts, have the great problem to meet. "How to produce more from the same piece of soil next year than they have this." Now, we have taken a hurried look into the problems the men are constantly meeting, and have seen in a slight way how they are trying to fit themselves to conquer the same. Would a woman be less pro - ressive? What is being demanded of us, what has always been de - manded of us? That we try to compete with the men in their various rofessional undertakings? No, Indeed. The demand is the same that t has always been, that we make homes, good homes. No matter whether a woman lives in Alaaira in a little hut made of ice and snow, or whether she lives in a palm-shaded home in Florida, whether she lives in a shack on the plains, or a brown-stone front in a city, her aim and purpose in life, is to make as happy and comfortable a home as possible with what she has to do with, for those whose pleasure it is, for her to care for. Is it not a noble calling, and should we not take as much pride in our part as the men do in theirs? This class ot womanly women is found in every station in lite. kWhat makes a good home? A competent leader, and who is that ier but the mother. You can think of two women in your own ex - ience, and give each of them the same materials to work with, scant though they be, and one will make a comfortable clean, wholesome place to dwell, a place you would love to call your home, and the other will take of the same, and by careless, uncleanly housekeeping, establish' an abode that is positively repulsive. What is the cause? One is quali - fied and the other is not, one has ambition and the other has not. More is demanded of a woman in a way than of a man; she must know how to cook, to prepare wholesome food for her family, with what she has to provide with, often though it be scant. She must know how to sew, how to mend and make last that which she already has, and how to prepare new materials in such a way, that they will be a comfort, and must know how to use money In a Judicious manner. Nearly every woman is called upon sometime in her life to care for the sick, to do more or less nursing, and so she needs to know as much as possible along this line.

PEE8IDENT OK THE NE8BARKA OOOD BOAKH ASSOCIATION Delivered January 20, 1911 To build and maintain good roads without competent and systematic supervision is as impossible as for a lack carpenter to economically con - struct a sky-scraper. Every successful business must have skilled, ex - perienced and trained management. It would be foolish to place the affairs of a department store in the hands of an inexperienced person, no matter how honest he might be. It requires long years of hard labor to "work up" to the management of any large commercial, manufacturing, or even educational concern. We members of this convention realize the importance to the state of its highways; that they are the arteries and veins through which the life blood of internal trade and commerce pulsates; that without them our whole social organism could not exist. The country could better dispense with its railroads than with its waeon roads. Indeed, had the railroads not been invented, the settled parts of our country would now be covered with vast systems of toll roads managed with skill and kept in the pink of perfection. But the rail- Eds came and replaced the toll roads that were creeping out into the ntry; the wagon roads were neglected, each community maintaining own road in • barely passable state. By such Inefficient and inade - quate maintenance the flow of the life blood of commerce and society has been retarded, happiness hindered and civilization curtailed. Mean- Cile the great railroads, which replaced and to which the interests of people turned, to the great detriment of the toll roads, have thriven mightily. Their enormous growth and success has been largely because the owners and directors have realized the importance of thoroughly systematizing the management, of employing the most skilled persons available for the several parts of the work, of paying salaries commen - surate with the importance of the position filled, and of centralizing authority. THE STATE AID PRINCIPLE. Less than a quarter of a century ago (1887) the first practical effort within the boundaries of the United States for systematic road adminis - tration was inaugurated. However, such administration of road affairs has been in vogue in Europe for more than a century. At a mass meeting of farmers and others interested in the betterment of roads, called by the state board of agriculture of New Jersey, a committee was appointed to examine the laws of their own state, of other states and foreign countries, and report such amendments as in their judgment would best ■ore the interests of the commonwealth. This committee held meetings </seg>
            <seg id="p361">PROCEEDINGS NEBRA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRKTI.TI RK. ."Mil and studied many laws, but after careful consideration they recommended the abolishment of the office of road overseer; as a result the board of agriculture had a bill prepared and presented in the state legislature of 1888 to that effect. Through the influence of the overseers this bill was defeated; was again introduced in 1889. and again failed; and met with a similar fate in 1890. But in 1891 they succeeded in securing its passage. The plan of placing the roadways under the township com - mittees proved so successful that the opposition were not only unable to effect its repeal, although a trial was made, but the state went farther in the line of centralization by entering upon an entirely new departure. This new law, passed in 1891, and made operative in 1892, Is what is commonly called the State-Aid I&gt;aw. a law which has influenced legisla- tion in nearly three-fourths of all the states of the Union. The following quotation from this first state-aid law gives the salient features: "That whenever there shall be presented to the board of chosen free- holders of any county a petition signed by the owners of at least two- thirds of the land • • * fronting on any public road • • • pray- ing the board to cause such to be improved, and setting forth that they are willing the peculiar benefits conferred • • • shall be assessed thereon in proportion to the benefits conferred to an amount not exceed- ing ten per centum of the entire cost of Improvement • • • It shall be the duty of the board to cause such Improvements to be made That one-third of the cost of all roads constructed under this act shall be paid for out of the state treasury." It will be seen that under this act the abutting property holders pay one-tenth of the cost of improvement, the state one-third and the county the remaining 56 2-3 per cent. The friends of the law demanded Its enforcement, the opponents as strenuously objected, and carried the matter into the courts, but the law was upheld, and ever since there has been an increasing desire for these state-aid funds. A few changes only have been made in the law, these tending to Its more efficient administra - tion, the most Important being the authorization of the annointment of a state highway commissioner, who should be a practical road eneineer. to superintend under the law the distribution of state-aid to the several counties and give general supervision to Its use in construction. In 1893 Massachusetts adopted a similar law. Under this law the Pe bears 75 per cent and the county 25 per cent, no part being borne abutting property owners. In 1895 Connecticut adopted the state-aid principle, and New York in 1898. Without mentioning further dates it may be stated that at the present time the state-aid principle is in opera - tion In some one of its various forms (according to Good Roads of July, 1910, from which the map herewith submitted is taken) in thirty-three out of the forty-eight states. On the map all those states which furnish cash for the improvement of roads, or give it to the counties and town- ships for that purpose, are represented by horizontal line shading.

STATE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT. While the details of carrying out state-aid differ with the different states, all have state highway departments. Some consist of a single salaried commissioner, or engineer, appointed by the governor or elected by the people; others an unsalaried commission either appointed or ex ufficto heads of departments of state or state educational institutions; and in others a salaried commission of three persons appointed or elected. But no matter what the form, those states in which the state administra - tion is most highly organized and most fully centralized are doing the most and best work for better roads. As soon as there is a centralized and systematized administrative authority the responsibility for "doing things" is placed upon one, or at the most a few persons, and things begin to be done. If a person knows that the tenure of his office depends upon the quality and quantity of the work accomplished he "sits up and takes notice," he 'gets busy." Let there be a recognized head and the efficiency of supervision and labor will immediately improve. Every under officer down to the road overseer should know exactly what is expected of him, how far his authority extends, and be given to under - stand that to that extent it is "up to him to make good." Again, by a centralized authority the boundaries of the various soil areas of the state could be mapped, and the character of the soils for road purposes studied, plans and methods devised or adapted for their best treatment in the construction and maintenance of natural roads, and these transmitted to the proper county, township or district officials. It has also been suggested that if uniform plans were used a comparison of unit costs between the various counties would do much toward pre - venting bridge scandal. With proper instruction and a tenure of office Kding on results accomplished, road overseers would cease to be uninspired laborers but would become road builders, a spirit of and emulation would be engendered, each overseer vying with his tor to produce the best road. While there are many laws, and changes in the present laws, that might be made to better the administration of road affairs in Nebraska, some of which I will briefly mention later, I am of the opinion that the moat efficacious for good roads would be the creation of a state highway department and the adoption of the state-aid principle. I put the two ideas together because I think it not best to take the county road work from the county boards. I believe the state depart - ment should be chiefly advisory, the initiative for road improvement, and the actual construction can best be performed by the county boards and the officers under them. These boards will listen to advice relative to road betterment if the obtaining of rash to assist in such betterment </seg>
            <seg id="p364">364 HSO8 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRIfTLTfRE. Bis upon their listening, otherwise such advice will be treated like of that excellent advice which now comes from the United States if public roads, adopted or not, and most generally not, according to tim of each road officer. In 1905 the writer, with the help of a few other good road enthusiasts, drafted and had presented a bill for the purpose of creating a state highway department and another to provide for state aid, but both bills were lost at at the end of the session. The state constitution will not allow the creation of new state officers by the legislature, and amending the constitution we have found by experience to be a serious undertaking, so it appeared to the writer at that time best to form a commission like the irrigation board, formed a few years previous. In short, since irrigation and road making are both branches of civil engineering, why not combine the two under one board? In the bills referred to that idea was carried out. Since then it has been suggested that the engineering and agricultural colleges of the State University be made to comprise such commission, with certain professors therein to be designated by the board of regents to act as directors. This Is similar to the system in vogue in Iowa. But I am still of the opinion that better results will obtain if the commission is retained at the state house. To be sure certain professors could be appointed as scientists under the state board, just as professors are now appointed as scientists under the Board of Agriculture, and I have no doubt they would give their best endeavors toward a solution of the road problems of the state. I would even go farther and transform the State Board of Irrigation into a Board of Engineering Affairs, and place under iU Jurisdiction all state engineering work, such as Irrigation, state-aid roads, large bridges— for example, those over the Platte river — drainage, etc All this work would make it requisite that the board have for its secretary an engineer of considerable ability with liberal remuneration. LThe bills mentioned were redrafted, remodeled and improved by the ate committee on highways and introduced in the 1U09 session. They passed the senate with fair winds and fine sailing, but failed to obtain free passage through the reefs and rocks surrounding the house. I be - lieve the present legislature has enough members interested in good roads to pass tSfae or some other comprehensive road measures, embodying the principles of state supervision and state aid. senate committee bills contemplated the creation of a state board highway commissioners, a state engineer, and carried an appropria - tion for state aid. They provided for a fair distribution of the funds among the several counties so that no county could gobble up more than iu just proportion of the entire amount appropriated. State-aid roads were to be built under the direction and immediate supervision of county boards, the state engineer acting only in the capacity of consulting engineer. Provision was made for assessing 15 per cent to abutting property holders, the remaining cost being paid, 50 per cent by the state and 35 per cent by the county, a very fair and equitable distribution. </seg>
            <seg id="p365">PaOCEKI'INtiS NKRRAHKA STATE BOARD OF AGRKTI.TrRK. .1f»T&gt; COUNTY ENGINEERS. One paragraph of the I-averty. or senate committee bill, placed some authority for the construction and maintenance of state-aid roads in the hands of the county engineers. And why shouldn't the county engineer be made a more important officer and given considerable authority in the road and bridge work of the county? I have heard it said that such legislation would be opposed by some of the county commissioners be - cause they think they would thereby lose some of their prestige. It ■eomp to me a county board should act as a board of directors, outlining large plans and broad policies for progress, but leaving the details to the other county officers who should be made subservient to them so far as general conduct is concerned, and be obliged periodically to make complete reports to the board for publication. It is even possible that it would conduce to a better and more economical administration of county affairs if the county board could be the only elective county officers, all others being appointed by them, as Is done under the commission system of city government. But be that as it may, in those states which seem at present to be making the most progress in road improvement, the ten - dency is toward the concentration of road administration in the hands of fewer individuals, selecting only tnose who are skilled and competent, enlarging the scope of their authority and holding them responsible for NEEDED LEGISLATION. At the risk of infringing on the territory of Senator Banning, who will later discuss the subject of Needed Legislation, I will very briefly outline a few things that I think the present legislature might do to better our road administration. First, create a state highway department. Second, provide for state-aid for the improvement of main traveled Third, make it possible for counties, townships and road districts to vote and issue bonds for road improvements. Emrth, to allow and make provision for the use of state, county and iirisoners in the preparation of road materials, and possibly also in onstruction of roads. Pifth, to place the construction of roads and bridges under the lm - ite charge of the county engineers. In counties having a county eer, or a county road superintendent in other counties, who should slf act under the direction of the county board as a city engineer under a city council.

Ninth, to place the automobile license, if it be wisdom to make it </seg>
            <seg id="p366">366 temm u STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. BOND8 FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENT. I haven't time to expand upon this needed legislation, but our laws are very weak in not making provision for the bonding of counties, town - ships or districts for constructing roads. The people may raise money by bonding to build jails for the prevention of free social intercourse, but they can't bond for building roads to permit of free social Intercourse; they may bond themselves to build railroads upon which to ship their products by an additional payment of freight rates, but they can't bond themselves to build wagon roads for the free transportation of products. It would seem as though our road laws are made to keep us in darkness and despair, to stifle trade and commerce, instead of leading us into the pure sunlight of liberty, and encouraging Industry, development and USE OF CONVICTS ON ROAD WORK. In several states, notably the south, convicts have been used in the actual construction of roads. This has proved not only to be more eco - ■omiral than free labor and nearly as efficient, but has been a blessing to the convict himself. Outdoor labor, fresh, pure air, and change of scenery has made a better convict, if you will allow the expression. The state of Georgia keeps about 4,500 of its convicts at work upon the public highways. The states of Virginia and West Virginia furnish con - vict aid and also money aid. In Illinois a large plant has been estab - lished for breaking stone; this is operated by convict labor and the stone i« furnished to the several counties free of all charge except for freight. Nebraska will in the next few years need a lot of broken stone for cul - verts and bridges. Arrangements might be made to obtain it in this way. COMPULSORY DRAGGING OF EARTH ROADS France, which is said to have the most superb system of roads in the world, as well as the best systematized scheme of road administra - tion, maintains its roads by means of patrols. Every mile of road is patrolled every day. Repairs are made as soon as needed. If something of that sort could be applied to our earth roads they would, at small cost, make moat magnificient thoroughfares nine or ten months out of every year. Make It someone's business to drag every earth road after every rain, to keep the side drains open and free to carry off the surplus water and Nebraska would have earth roads, not the equal of the best mar«i1f"' but something of which to be very proud. Many farmers are voluntarily taking care of a mile or so of roads adjacent to their farms. Of these we expect to hear interesting reports later during this meeting. But it seems hardly fair that these few farmers, In addition to paying (heir taxes, should find It necessary in order to have passable roads, to keep op these highways at their own expense when they are used and of benefit to the entire community at large. Still the city In which I live </seg>
            <seg id="p367">from snow. No one complains of injustice in such a measure, and pos - sibly, if all landowners were required to drag the roads abutting their land, it might in a few years be taken as a matter of course and one of the duties incident to the owning of land. Yet, on the other hand, such a law might be more honored in the breach, as is the law requiring the i utting of weeds along the roadside. Better make the dragging of roads the duty of the overseer, and his tenure of office and pay dependent upon the quality of his work. But time and your patience compel me to stop. If the present legis - lature will only pass three laws, namely, create a state highway depart - ment, establish the state-aid principle in some form or other, and pro - vide a method whereby counties may raise money for road improvement, other matters relating to road administration would eventually work themselves out in a systematic manner. If these three laws could be passed I would, for the time being, be content and feel that great prog rras had been made and that Nebraski was at last emerging from the dark ages and beginning to appreciate the beatific influences of civiliza- </seg>

BBB8KT Although Nebraska was largely treeless when white men came across tbe river, there are now more than a hundred different kinds of trees that one may see in almost any place in the eastern part of tbe state, and it adds much to one's pleasure to be able to tell what they are. I have often wondered how it would seem if I were to find myself unable to recognize the trees in our forests and parks. I am sure that half of my enjoyment of out-of-door life would be taken away if I did not have a "speaking acquaintance" with the trees. It would be like being in a company of pleasant people, all of them strangers, instead of familiar acquaintances. Therefore, if you will, I shall be glad to introduce, you to some of our more common trees. Of course in a short article like this 1 cannot mention all of our trees. K*M8. — Every park and almost every door-yard if large enough trees that retain their leaves throughout the year. They are lie summer, of course, but when the fall comes they do not let their leaves fall (tbe falling leaves give name to the season), but retain them all winter: so such trees are always green; hence, "evergreen." In the north, the only trees that are evergreen are the pines, spruces, flrs and cedars, and these may be told from one anther very easily. Go to any evergreen tree in one of our parks and you will find it possible to tell at a glance to which of these it belongs. If it has long, very narrow ■tiff ieaves that look like needles, it is a pinr. In all of our pines the leaves are two in a place, or three, or five If the tree you find has. short leaves that are needle shaped, 4-angled and always one in a place, it is a »pru&lt; i While if the leaves are short and flattish. but still one in a place, it is a fir. Lastly, if the leaves are very small and like little green scales crowded and overlapping one anther, it is some kind of a cedar. These facts may be shown as follows: A. Leaves narrow, needle shaped If now we look at the pines we shall find that it is not difficult to distinguish several kinds as follows: I Leaves (needles) 2, 3 or 5 in a place Pines Leaves one in a place, a. Leaves 4 angled Spruces 6. Leaves flattish Firs Leaves very small, scale-like Cedars </seg>

Leaves long, needle-shaped, slender, in fives White Pine Try this little key on the pines you find in the Omaha parks, and you will soon have no difficulty in telling what kind you have before you. Now try the spruces, in which the leaves stand one in a place, and are short and needle-shaped. In most of our spruces the leaves stand out all around the twig, and are about half an inch long. In most cases they are very sharp pointed. If you have sharp enough eyes you can easily make out that every little leaf is not round like a needle, but four cornered, which Is the final test for the spruces. You may find the following spruces in the parks: A. Leaves blunt 1. Foliage green, cones large, 4 to 6 inches long Norway Spruce B. Leaves sharp pointed. 2. Foliage green, cones small, 2 inches or less long White Spruce 3. Foliage blue green, cones medium, 3 inches long Blue Spruce The fir trees have leaves that resemble those of the spruces, but instead of being four-cornered they are flat, and I do not recall any of our cultivated firs with sharp-pointed leaves. Another thing that young folks with sharp eyes will notice is that while the fir leaves when old break off from the twig right at the surface of the twig, in the spruces they break off a little above the surface. So a fir twig after its leaves fall is smooth, while a spruce twig is rough with the stumps of the leaf bases. There is still another peculiarity of the fir trees in the fact that they are very "pitchy," having little sacks of clear pitch in the bark of their young branches. Just look over the next fir tree you find and when you see a puffed-out spot on the smooth bark run a pin into it and you « ill see the pitch gush out. So you should have no trouble in recogniz- ing the fir trees. In fact, you should be able to distinguish the two kinds of firs that are rather commonly grown, as follows; 1. Leaves narrow, r inch or less long, foliage green Balsam Fir 2. Leaves broader, 2 or more inches long, foliage blue green. . .White Fir In a few places in Nebraska the hemlock is grown.

Many people who look at the &lt;-edars do not look closely enough to see the myriads of minute leaves that completely cover the twigs, and it will surprise many a reader of this article when he takes his first close look at these trees. There are two principal kinds of cedars in Nebraska, and popularly distinguished as White and Red Cedars. 1. Leaves in four rows, flat: cones oblong and woody, nearly half an Inch long - Arbor Vltae or White Cedar S. Leaves in three rows, rounded dorsally; cones round, berry like, fleshy, about one-fourth of an inch in diameter . . Red Cedar Here I may put a couple of relatives of the foregoing evergreens that drop their leaves in the fall, and so are not "evergreen" in the strict sense of the term. In a few places In the state people have been able 10 grow larch (often called tamarack). All summer long it looks much like a cross between a pine and a spruce, and has needle-shaped leaves an inch or so long, but when fall comes all drop off and leave the twigs bare. If you look closely you will find that on the new shoots the leaves stand one In a place, as they do in spruces, while on older shoots they are in clusters of a dozen or two, as though trying to imitate the pines. If you can find the cones you may be able to distinguish two kinds of larches, as follows Cones small, less than an inch long American Larch Combs larger, more than an inch long European Larch Have you ever seen the Ginkgo Tree? It is a distant relative of the pines that has been brought from Japan, and Is grown successfully in some places in eastern Nebraska. Its leaves are shaped like a three cor sored fan, and are a couple of inches broad at the widest part. The veins run from the bottom up to the wide margin. It will interest you to know that ginkgo trees were once abundant in many places in the world. but in geologic times all perished except this species that grows in Japan so that now we are restocking the world from this Japanese remnant.

            <seg id="p373">THE PROBLEM OF AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS. BT CHARLES E. 8E88ET. I In the Nebraska Rural Life Commission one important line of work t has been assigned to one of the sections is that pertaining to agrl - tural schools; that is, the schools that are in the country as dis - tinguished from the schools in the towns and cities. As I am the chair - man of this section, I wish here to call the attention of the readers of this report to the problem as it is now outlined. In printing this pre - liminary statement of the problem in this form it must be understood that my purpose is to call attention to it, and to invite suggestions and friendly criticisms. The bulk of what is here printed has been presented to a full public meeting of the commission, and again to an educational conference in connection with the commencement exercises of the Vni - versity of Nebraska, 1911. The Committee on Agricultural Schools of the Nebraska Rural Life Commission will have to consider the whole subject of agricultural edu - cation; that is, education for the rural community, but it will give more attention to the second group of schools as outlined below: I. Elemen - tary. II. Intermediate (or secondary). III. Advanced (colleges). We propose to make an extended investigation as to the present efficiency of the schools; their deficiencies; the condition of buildings and surround - ings; their appliances; the subject matter taught; attendance; quality of teachers; school terms, etc. We propose to suggest such modifications of the foregoing as will in our opinion improve the work and the re - sults of the rural schools and to submit these suggestions to a large number of thoughtful men and women in the country; that is, on the farms or who are in touch with farm life. From the foregoing we hope to be able to make suggestions to country school boards that will enable them to improve the efficiency of the schools in their charge. The general outline of the subject may be presented in tabular form, as follows: A. Elementary Country Schools. 1. The districts. How large are they? How large should they be? Are present conditions favorable or unfavorable? 2. The buildings — present and future. The question of efficiency. The question of cost. The question of use. 3. The surroundings (groves, gardens, etc.): There should be no more bare buildings. Need of attractive surroundings, so aa to compete with town schools. 4. The appliances — present and future: Must not be meagre and nig - gardly. The best is not too good. </seg>

We must take up anew the question of the proper course of study. 6. The attendance: Should it be adjusted to the parents' needs? Should it be made flexible? How can it be done without in- Jury to the pupil? 7. The school terms (time of year): Is the present practice the best? Theoretically, the school should bf&gt; open all the year.

I Buildings: Must be for greatest efficiency. Mere sheds or barns will not do. Must be well planned for the special work. (Grounds (farm, gardens, groves, etc.): These must be different from those of ordinary high schools. There must be land enough for the out-of-door practice In the growing of plants. K Illustrations (crops, stock, machinery, etc.): These must be avail - able. How can this be done most efficiently? I Subject matter taught: Here we must have Culture as well as Agriculture. We must not omit either one. I The school terms (time of year): Is the six-month plan (Novem - ber to April) the best? It has been found to be so for our Agricultural School at Lincoln. Will it prove so elsewhere? I The quality of teachers: The need of great breadth is far greater here than in the ordinary high school. C. Advanced Schools (Including ."Colleges of Aqbiculture"). 1. Relation of the schools of agriculture: There must be entrance I through the latter as well as through ordinary high schools. Subject matter taught: We must have the sciences and the other subjects in which agriculture rests. I The time of the year occupied: In my opinion, these colleges should be open all the year, so that a pupil may enter at any time. To the Reader. — You can help in this investigation. Do not think present conditions perfect Do not be afraid of making changes. I shall welcome your suggestions which are based upon experience, however radical they may be.

The salient cultural features in the development of Nebraska are at Bment began in the eastern part of the state (then a territory), roded west, first along valleys, and later onto the Intervening inds. 2. Development, though rapid as a whole, has been by periods of progress and depression, especially in the western part. Blopment has been largely agricultural, varying considerably In h of the well-defined regions. 4. The state is very unevenly developed. he state has one small coal mine, several sand dredges, brick yards, and quarries, but no gold, silver, or iron mines. K state ranks high in the production of corn, oats, wheat, alfalfa, ilrle hay, horses, cattle, butter, and meats. 7. Most of the people and the largest cities are in the eastern and south - ern counties. v The smallest counties are In the eastern part and the largest In the northwest. I. The southeast half of the state is well supplied with local-use railroads. There are four trans-continental railroads in Nebraska. B politics the state often separates into north and south divisions, d there is more or less misunderstanding between the eastern and stern parts. How are the above facts explained? To use a common expression in geography, how are they accounted for? Do they have any definite rela - tion to physical features? If so, what are the geographic influence* In Nebraska? I will briefly describe the position, climate, topography, and soils as the influencing conditions and point out a few of their conae- POSITION OF THE STATE. Nebraska is centrally located in the mainland of the United States, being a part of the long slope of the High Plains Regions, slanting east - ward from the Rocky Mountains. It Is alongside the Missouri-Mississippi highway, and in the path of the well-known overland routes. Such a position and the advantages coming from it have advertised the state and made its products readily accessible to eastern, southern, and foreign markets. The position with respect to boundaries, climatic belts, etc., need not be recited in this connection. </seg>
            <seg id="p376">Ml PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. EARLY DEVELOPMENT. Tbe state was occupied by Indians before whites. The Indians are ■aid to have entered from the east, by way of the water courses at various periods, beginning about the time of the discovery of America by Colum - bus. They lived mostly in the eastern part of the state, their crude homes being in valleys, near trees and water. They cultivated small fields, and made regular pilgrimages to unoccupied valleys, upland plains, and table lands to hunt elk, bison, and antelopes, which were their princi - pal sources of food and clothing. Certain nomadic tribes finally occupied the open plains nearly exclusively, and warred against those who came to this country only for hunting. Indians did not strongly resist the advent of whites. The first white people to reach Nebraska were trappers and traders. They entered from the southeast, by way of the Missouri river. Next came a few "squatters," or settlers, lrom the same direction, and across Iowa. By this time navigation on the Missouri had grown to considerable importance. At this stage of Nebraska's development came the discovery of gold in California. The Missouri was navigable to the Nebraska border; be - yond was the shallow Platte. Prospectors were here forced to seek freight and stage routes across the land, leading westward from the Missouri-Mississippi gateway up and over the Great Plains to low divides in the Rocky Mountains and beyond. The line of easiest access in the north was, in general, along the Platte Valley. So this natural feature had a marked influence in the movement of early freight, emigrants, and finally in locating the Union Pacific. Upon the completion of the first trans-continental railroad, freight and travel shifted to an east-west route, in favor of Chicago and New York City. This was away from and greatly to the disadvantage of Missouri River transportation and South - ern cities along its course. The overland freighters of the Oregon Route were now driven out of business, and stage coaches were forced to routes that supplemented the railroad. The influence of the Platte Valley in locating the Union Pacific is often overlooked, and the im - portance of that railroad as a political and industrial factor since 1867 is newly always under-emphasized by geography teachers. Later, three other trans-i ontintntal railroads selected routes across the state. Before the Union Pacific was completed many disappointed gold seekers, remembering the broad prairies of Nebraska, returned to them to make homes. Settlement now became more rapid though confined for a while to land near the Missouri River because of transportation facili - ties which it afforded. Settlements extended westward in valleys near water, stone, trees, and protection from winds. About the time the I nion Pacific was completed settlement had reached the uplands, where the soil proved much more fertile than the home-seekers had expected. The western part of the state was then a cattle country, with unlimited </seg>
            <seg id="p377">CLIMATE AND ITS INFLUENCES. The relative position and relief of Nebraska influences the climate. The climatic elements form the geographic control of first Importance. The state slopes eastward from an elevation averaging about 500 feel along the western border to less than 1000 feet at the Missouri River. The relation of this slope and its relief to climate is very definite. The mean annual temperature of the state is 48.5 degrees, being 5? degrees in the southeast and 45 degrees in the northwest, decreasing with latitude and altitude. The diurnal and annual range Is quite marked, with very cold weather at times in winter and frequent high temperature in glimmer. The average coldest month is January and the warmest July. Spring weather approaches from the southeast, and fall from the north - west. The average date of the last killing frost of spring is April 25th in the southeast and May 15th in the northwest. The first frost of fall comes about September 20th in the northwest and October 1st or later in the southeast. The growing season is therefore 25 to 30 days longer in the southeast counties than in the northwest. The length of growing season affects the distribution of crops, especially the corn, which, except the quick-maturing varieties, requires a Ions growing period. The alfalfa produces one more crop each year where the season Is long than where it is short. The principal effects of altitude are indi - rect so far as agriculture is concerned, i. e., through temperature, as Indicated above. People show direct response to elevation in their ability or failure to stand altitude, of which there is a range of about 4500 feet The humidity is comparatively low in western counties but higher in the east, especially in the late spring and early summer. The mean annual rainfall is 23.8 Inches, being about 33.5 inches in the southeast and 15 inches at the western border. The amount of rainfall is one of Nebraska's greatest controls. The fact that it is about half as much in the west as in the eastern part has been learned by farmers at great cost, for many of them have attempted to do, under this low rainfall, what has been accomplished in eastern Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois. The low humidity and scant rainfall of the western counties, together with clear weather, make that an inviting place for people with weak lungs. The state's rainfall comes mostly in the growing season, June leading in amount. The snowfall is light, averaging about 20 Inches annually, and making sleighing uncertain. Another feature of rainfall, with an important bearing, especially in the western counties, is that the amount fluctuates between wet and dry years and periods. During wet periods, when the precipitation was temporarily above the average, crops were grown quite generally in western Nebraska by the so-called dry farming methods. During the dry periods the grazing industry thrived and farm - ing went back, except on the drouth-resistant soils. The wet and dry Knave affected all of Nebraska and adjacent states, but most notice sub-humid belts, which, as a rule, are too dry for the production 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 UNO* NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AKEUI I.TCK. of craps without irrigation. With these fluctuations in rainfall in the dry country came three or four periods of settlement and abandonment, the bostiliiiex between farmers and free rangers, the growth and shrink age of towns, and the general ups and downs In industry. With experience in cultivation, and especially by the introduction of drouth-resistant and quick-maturing crops, farmers have become more able to compete with the high dry country and its periods of low rainfall. The belief In a prrmam nt increase in rainfall grew during wet periods, partly because of its advantage to land agents, but it ceased to have virtue through drouths. The fallacy of permanently increasing rainfall has been used to the detriment of western Nebraska and similar land in the Great Plains generally. The central thoughts in the foregoing discussion of precipitation are, first, that the amount decreases from east to west, giving opportunity for a varied vegetation and agriculture; second, that the rainfall comes In the growing season, when needed, decreasing at harvest time; third, that there is enough fluctuation between years and periods to keep all of the people alert and guessing, especially during the growing season. TOPOGRAPHIC AND SOIL REGIONS The state varies considerably in its surface configuration, having four regions, each with distinct features of topography, drainage, soil, water supply, vegetation, and industrial development. These are the 1 nrw. Sandhill. High Plains, and Bad Land regions. The Loesx Rbbio.v— This region, so named because of the prevalent surface deposit, constitutes most of the southeastern half of the state, occupying about 40,000 square miles. Its features are smooth loess plains, broad alluvial plains, hilly land, and small areas modified by bluffs and canyons. The soils are unusually fertile and easily tilled, except where the land is rough. The sub-soil is deep. The eastern part of the region is mantled by a glacial sub-soil. It consists of three fairly distinct drift sheets: (1) bluish clay, overlaid by (2) sand and gravel, and that by (3) yellowish clay, which is brownish at the surface. Boulders occur in each drift sheet, but in relatively small numbers. The drift forms the hilly land of eastern Nebraska, on which corn is the leading crop. The roughest of this land is devoted to grazing and tree At various places in the Loess Regions, as at York, Fairmont, Hast - ings, and Holdrege, the land is a smooth plain. It appears to have been formed by the accumulation of dust, which was blown principally from the sandhills and the bars and beds of rivers. This deposit (loess) cap* a part of the glacial area. It is deep, and forms a soil usually fertile and easily tilled. Such land is more valuable than that of glacial origin. It contains lime enough to make it sweet, and in other respects is well suited for alfalfa. It grows alfalfa, wheat, corn, oats, etc., throughout; but in the middle part of the region its leading crop is wheat, because: </seg>
            <seg id="p379">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Of AGRHTLTIRK. first, the smooth topography makes harvesting easy, and second, the precipitation, 20 to 25 inches annually, is right for wheat but a little light for corn. There is less farming in the western part of the Loess Region except in the valleys. This finds an explanation in the amount of rainfall and evaporation. Here the grazing Industry hap more relative Importance than on the smooth land farther east. We should remember, however, that fully 90% of the 20 inches of rainfall received in this and other sub-humid belts of Nebraska soaks into the ground. It is equal, therefore, to a larger precipitation where much of its runs off Immediately. So the rainfall does its duty most effectively where the amount of soak-in is relatively large in proportion to the amount of run-off. Phe broad alluvial plains of the Platte is a feature in the Loess on. It has an Interesting physiographic history which is too com - ted to recite in this paper. In brief, it may be said that the river partly filled its valley. It began its aggradation at a much lower level than the present plain. As the plain elevated and widened, the valley changed in depth and form, making it an open and easily traversed roadway. The up-building made the river unfit for navigation, yet it did tething of importance in developing a large tract of bottom land of it value, except where it is too sandy, marshy, or alkalied. erne Loess Region is the rich agricultural district of Nebraska. It wa most of the state's corn, wheat, oats, and alfalfa, on land valued $100.00 or more per acre. It is quite thickly settled and well im - re&amp;, having good wagon roads, numerous towns, and railroads. Sandhill Region. — The Sandhill Region, in the north central counties, has an area of about 20,000 square miles. It is mostly a region of dunesand, shaped by wind which acted upon loose Tertiary and alluvial deposits. Here dunes, ridges, basins, and valleys are the prevailing land forms. There are few rivers, but several groups of small lakes. Drainage is principally underground, coming to the streams through springs. The soil is weak, except on the firm land of the larger valleys. It supports a thin growth of hard-stemmed grasses and low shrubs. These form the basis of the leading industry, cattle grazing. It requires several acres of land to pasture a single animal, making the ranches large, usually with thousands of acres each. Stock yards are the most noticeable thing in the small railroad towns. The agricultual land is in isolated places, cut off from market by heavy roads leading across the dunesands. The Sandhill Region is sparsely settled. Just what the devel - opment here may be in the future is not known. It remains a problem, for the region has both favorable and unfavorable conditions. It is very evident that the lack of development in this region is due to the quality of soil and not to the quantity of precipitation. An attempt is being made to forest the dunes with pines. Much of the land has been filed upon by Kincaid homesteaders in 640-acre tracts. Tki High Plains Region. — The western part of Nebraska is very </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 raocnDiNG8 Nebraska state board op ageicultuke. rse. It has several small provinces known collectively as the High Plains Region. The principal topographic features are tablelands, buttes, and canyons. The region is capped by Tertiary deposits — clayey below and sandy to pebbly above. The original surface is in process of destruction l.y rivers and wind. The North Platte eroded a large valley several miles wide, but is now aggrading its bed at a depth of about 600 to 800 feet below the bordering high plains. Between these upland and bottom - land plains are steep valley slopes in process of dissection. Pe smooth uplands present a broad open view floored with a carpet Falo or gramma grasses. They are a part of the short grass country, rater supply, though deep, is of especially good quality. The soils, ig from line to coarse in texture, produce grazing, but are not, as a sufficiently drouth-resistant for farming. Small areas, where the soil is close-textured and deep, grow good crops. This shows that the amount of rainfall Is not a sure control. Soil type is equally important, there one sees success and failure in agriculture side by side, and only apparent difference Is in soil texture. Most of the steep valley-sides are bare. In -some places they support thin stands of pines and cedars. The more gradual slopes grow bunch grass, prairie grass, blue stem, and sagebrush, In formations quite unlike those of the tablelands. This is given over nearly exclusively to grazing. The alluvial and other smooth lands along the valleys produce crops of native hay. Much of the bottom and bench land, especially along the North Platte, is farmed under sucessful irrigation. These irrigated zones of the valleys, with their thick settlements and towns, are a distinct contrast to the retarded cultural development of the other zones of this ton. The farming area is being extended by the use of impounded I water. Bad Lamis— In the northwestern part of the state is a small bad - land area at the edge of a large region in South Dakota and Wyoming. It was formed principally by river erosion of the High Plains, in which thick surface beds of sand and gravel were removed from above clayey formations, after which the latter were carved into typical bad-lands. It is nearly bare because of rapid erosion, and supports only a scanty growth of vegetation. The water supply here is bad, and few people occupy the land, which is used mostly for grazing. RAILROADS Railroads were built in Nebraska for two leading purposes: first, to reach points beyond its borders, as In California, Colorado, and the Black Hills, and second, for local service. The Union Pacific followed the Platte and Lodgepole Valleys to near Cheyenne, beyond which is a low divide across the Rockies. Later, it extend pd a line up the South Platte to Denver and another up the North Platte to Bridgeport. The Burlington, between Omaha, Lincoln, and </seg>

The Black Hills branch of the Burlington, built -incoln along Oak Creek, across the Blue, and over the smooth Loess Plains and broad Platte bottom, striking the Middle Loup north of Grand Island. The route in the Sandhills is through the Loup and other valleys. The North Western line to the Black Hills occupies the Klkhorn Valley. The natural route between St. Joseph and Lincoln is by the Burlington, which connected also between Table Rock and Oxford, following tributaries of the Nemaha and Blue River Valleys most of the way to Republican. A very noticeable feature in the distribution of railroads in Nebraska is the absence of continuous lines along the right bank of the Missouri. This is not because they are not needed, but on account of cut-banks and bluffs, which force the railroads to the Iowa and Missouri side, where the river plain is continuous. The river cuts its right bank harder than the left. CITIES AND TOWNS. With Tew exceptions. Nebraska's permanent towns were located alouj railroads. The location of county seats, state institutions, and railroad division points have operated to the advantage of many places. There are evidences of control, however, for the railroads have followed natural ■ ,s, and thereby have determined in a general way the positions of towns A town has sprung up wherever a railroad crossed a large valley. I'latte Valley cities art at or near the mouths of tributary valleys. This .-anif control is observed in the Loup system, where towns grew up on railroads at the junction of tributary and trunk valleys. Ktsmouth, though well named, is cot the industrial gateway to the Omaha is directly in line with that, and from the standpoint of •ce is the key to Nebraska, being only a few miles from the L courses of the Platte and Salt Creek Valleys. . Omaha is at the I ot water and land routes.

The high-priced agricultural lands require careful management to insure the maintenance of their productive capacity. In consequence of this, emphasis is placed upon seed selection, cultivation, crop rotation, etc The importance of Nebraska's rich soils may be realized when it Is known that the agricultural products coming therefrom have an annual value of more than $300,000,000. It is only natural for the people to show an unusual interest in matters which pertain to their industrial life. This is plainly reflected in the educational development in which state geography, domestic science, and agriculture have considerable prominence in the common schools. In the experiment stations and agri - cultural college of the University more than usual attention is given to problems which confront rural people. REFERKNCES. 'it a.

Members of the Nebraska Conservation Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen: The United States is thinking conservation, countless people are talk - ing conservation, and some people are doing conservation. To preserve what is good, to reclaim what was injured or lost, to utilize, intensify and waste not are cardinal doctrines of conservation. The phase of the subject which I present is somewhat hackneyed, but, as I have used it for more than a year and have Insisted that the return be to the "soil," rather than the "land," I may win your indulgence. Land represents the location, while soil is the active basis principle, the alembic out of which so much is to come. A new commandment Is given unto us — "utilize, and waste not." As I left my home county-seat this morning, a young man and woman entered the train amid a shower of rice. Prom what occurred the passengers debated whether they were going on a honey - moon or were headed to the Nebraska Conservation Congress. The reason for this was. he was taking such active care of the waist. The United States has within its borders three cities containing collec - tively seven million people. It has six cities, each containing more than half a million. It has nineteen cities, each containing more than a quarter million. It has fifty cities, each containing more than one hundred thousand each. It has ninety containing more than fifty thousand each, totaling nearly 25,000,000. Broad and inviting as are the villages,' fields, praries. and forests, the current of human life in America is drifting toward the cities. When this country took its first census, only thirty - four out of every thousand people lived in cities or towns. Thirty years later that number increased to forty-iflne out of every thousand; sixty years later it had increased to one hundred and twenty-five. In 1900 it reached three hundred and eleven, nearly ten times what it was at the time of the establishment of our government. Our urban population now is nearly five hundred out of every thousand, or 50 per cent. And this despite the fact that creative genius made the country, clothed it with beauty, and filled it with fatness; while the city was man-made to pollute the air, befoul the crystal rivers, deforest the hills, rob and impoverish the soil. Yet paths to the city from every compass point are worn deep by the feet of farmes' boys and girls leaving staid and comfortable farm life for the doubtful lure of the city's uncertainties. Were this drift new and without historical precedent, no great concern might be excited, but the tidal drift of humanity into the cities from the beginning of recorded history has led to anything but desirable national results. Carlyle has said: "A great city is a great evil," and few will question that statement. True, there is wealth gathered, culture abounds, religion </seg>

I recall the survivors of the flood and the great tower which was the crowning glory of their city, out of which was wrought the confusion of tongues which drove the inhabitants back to the country 10 their fields and vineyards, their flocks and herds. Sodom and Gomorrah, with their many people, wealth and municipal wickedness, were destroyed, while the people of the lx&gt;rd were selected from the dmcllers in tents. That chosen people with varying fortunes pleased and displeased the Father of us all. but constantly waxed stronger and grew in divine favor, wealth and power until the great city of Jerusalem was built and the crowning accomplishment, Solomon's temple, was completed. Then there was the inventive to rebellion from within and the invitation 10 invasion from without. Both followed, Judea ceased to be an important militaiy i&gt;ower until the Maccabees in their hundred years of rule found their safety, not in walled cities, but in the hill country, with their fields and flocks; there they successfully defended their ancient heritage. Their strength was in the deep-rooted attachment to the soil, out of which they saw their safety and sustenance come. A later poet well described the reason for their loyalty and valor: "Why cling to our mountain home With more than filial feeling? °Tis here that freedom's altars rise And freedom's sons are kneeling. 'Why sigh we not for softer climes; Why cling to that which bore us? Tis here that freedom's temples rise With freedom's sunshine o'er us." </seg>

The denuded forests tell a sad tale, the barren fields are still more pathetic, but most to be deplored is the vanished energy, fire and patriotism of peoples once noted for culture, industry, and valor, but who now bow to the rule of petty tyrants and lead lives far in the rear of the world's progress. Their history is preserved only by their enemies, and no worthy heritage is provided for the generations to come. And northern China, whose massive and historic wall bordered upon and closed fertile plains and great forests. They have been exploited by the commercial despoiler. 6 Chinese, having slept for centuries, were aroused by their Japanese ,t. They find on the rebuilding of their nation that they may support hair billion people, waste stretches of desert where rich soil and forests once abounded. Today her people, awake to her unsanitary conditions, and her students seek to throw off that fatalism which looks complacently upon her multi - plied infant deaths, are endeavoring to save her starving millions. To do this she must extend her hands for alms, instead of going to the lands, once rich, but now abandoned and despoiled. Life and movement in the Orient, never so swift in recurring cause and effect, allowed to take place in two thousand years what may require but a few hundred in America. European navigators discovered a con - tinent of forestry sufficient in profusion of materials, should the great terrestrial fires again be lighted and the earth's surface again be moved by the shifting process, to make another layer of coal with its wealth of oil deposits as was produced in the carboniferous age. If we visit the east - ern part of our own country, we find stunted pines and scrub oaks clothing the Alleghany and Blue Ridge Mountain backs. The pine swamps of the south, once almost impenetrable, are now marked by charred stumps and meagre undergrowth. Back again to the Rocky Range, where forests apparently inexhaustible stood, yet stand no longer. The greed of man to construct and repair his metropolis, as well as the ax of the vandal and the match of the careless, have destroyed thousands of splendid spec - tacles which once seemed vast emerald clouds, poised in mid-heaven to beautify the earth and add their potent influence to modify weather and season. Their living roots, which held the soil and the snow in their places, dying lost their grip, and the rich and fertile soil swept by moun - tain torrent and flood, carried that fertility down to the rivers and thence </seg>
            <seg id="p386">lii i his discussion I refer to cities of 2. r .,oO0 or upward. The towns of lesser size are renters of foci of argirultural activities, and usually carry not the evils of the larger places. Our people have too long been looking to the city to live; looking unto the country to stay until prepared lu live. Neglect and impoverishment of the soil have been the curse of the American husbandry. I'nder the role of "take all and return nothing" until the impoverishment has so far advanced that some local treatment is imperatively demanded. This they give from year to year, or away to the virgin plains of the west, where the work of despoiling the soil may be repeated. A few years ago I sailed up Narragansett Bay, between Providence, the southern metropolis of New England, and Newport, its great society re - sort. I asked a fellow passenger what the land along the shore was uaed for, and he said "agriculture." "What is it worth per acre?" nty-flvp to thirty dollars." "Why in this land of factories and indus - tries of all kinds is it so cheap?" "Well, each year the ground is so impoverished that if your annual yield would be $10 per acre you must put at least $3 in fertilizer. " Where once the cornfields of Roger Williams produced in abundance a spare and reluctant crop is grudgingly yielded by a soil polluted and robbed. The story is told of an old farmer who, however abundant the crops might be generally, would always find some ground for complaint. Something short. One year all the crops were good. The neighbors were anxious to know what the complaint was he would make. "Well," he said, "I have always noticed that these all around •ops are pesky hard on the sile." The old man was probably an intentional crank and an unintentional philosopher. Drain and drain year alter year and not even observe the Mosaic custom to rest the land, letting it run fallow once every seven years. Is it any wonder that New England's fertile lands failed in one - &gt;nth of the time that they did in Palestine or China? Ee not drawn this picture to ask the youth of the land to stay urn to the soil as a matter of duty. I am aware that from their l\&gt; ever recruited the defenders of the flag, the captains of in - ind the far-seeing men of the state. Duty is a potent call, but it hanges a home or occupation. There is this more effective one: nty It may be the duty of the young man in other communities than this to appropriate the unappropriated blessing, past the age of thirty, though plain of feature, dowerless and not an accomplished cook. The competition in following such duties though is not usually strenuous or crowded ; but beautify those features, supply the liberal dowry, and add a course in domestic science, and the young men will hear oppor - tunity s call instead of duty's plea, and many will compete for the prize. Eir civilization has been denned to be merely an enlightened selfish The young man or woman has but one life to live. It. within the of right living, should be driven to its maximum of effectiveness. contemplating the future for twenty years, that period within which Urea will be proved a success or failure, that collective opportunity </seg>

Manufacturing opportunities will not be so effective as heretofore, the people so employed are being ground, polished, and reduced into insignificant and automatic units, so as to destroy all individuality and foreclose many advancements. Go to the cities. The merchant princes and their combinations control the trade. lx&gt;cal transportation is incorporated. Restaurants, stenography, and other lines of business are largely syndicated, and the two large considerations become the salary check and the meal ticket In health, the one barely leads; in sickness, the latter forges to the front. The professions never were so poorly paid. The average farmer is earning more than the average lawyer, physician, or preacher. Theodore Roosevelt, America's idol, said: "I warn my country, that the great recent progress made in city life Is not a full measure of our civilization; for our civilization rests at the bottom of wholesomeness, attractiveness, and completeness, as well as prosperity, of life in the country. The men and women on the farms stand for what is funda - mentally best and most needed in our American life. "Upon the development of country life rests ultimately our ability, by methods of farming requiring the highest intelligence to continue to feed and clothe the hungry nations; to supply the city with fresh blood, clean bodies, and clear brains that can endure the terrific strain of modern life; we need the development of men in the open country, who will be in future as in the past, the stay of strength of the nation in time of war and its building and controlling spirit in time of peace." President Taft, a student of American life in all its phases, latitudes longitudes, said: "If I were advising young men as to their future •ssion, I would say there arc greater opportunities in agriculture than ly other profession in our county. The farmer's life takes him away the nervous exhaustion, that gambling propensity, and that bustle rapidity that hurries men to their graves." Secretary Wilson says our crop production for 1910 is over nine billion. An increase in two years of enough to pay the national debt; one year's increase enough to pay the expense of the Panama Canal; one year's increase enough to make our rivers navigable for thousands of miles. Pe have in Nebraska produced in crops in 1910, $220,000,000; in live $155,000,000. I have always favored the United States feeding its people and using largely the results of our own sons' and daugh - ters' handicraft. The far-off markets have had little charm for me. But should we meet the demand, ii will be necessary to have two stalks of S where there was but one; sixty bushels of corn where only thirty gathered; 1,500-pound beeves where 1,000-pounders roamed before, set this demand the best blood, strongest muscle and most active must be set and kept in operation.

It requires the genius of the invenler, the skill of the mechanic, the investigation of the scientist, the forecast of the financier, and the play of all the subtle I of brain and brawn which dignify labor and make the laborer intel - ligent, independent, and free. residents of the city grapple with the immediate problems of today. The farmer will determine his own, and forge and mold the destiny of himself and the country in the years to come. Why, selfishly, should the youth respond to this demand? First, country life is safe. There was a time in America when purse, limb and lite were in danger beyond the confines and proximity of a city, it was in a day when savages weie in the forests and robbers lurked in the recesses of the mountain. Now danger and death are within the city gates, and comparative safety lies along the country highway and in the country home. Eecond, it is healthful. The air is pure, the water uncontaminated, iage is usually easy, and plumbing may be sanitary and cheap. Com - nt isolation largely precludes infection and contagion. Tuberculosis pellagra will have little encouragement in a modern up-to-date farm f, while constructive or actual hook worm will never secure a place te northern farm. Third, comfort. The farm comforts are many. Pure food, fresh fruit *ud vegetables. Then, too, there is modern light and heat. You live in B &gt; man's back yard, and no man lives in yours. Your neighbor may not i upon you noise under the brand of music and deny you both flight . ad self-defense. Uncle Sam deposits your mail earlier at your door than he does for the dwellers in the city suburb, thus bringing you in early touch with the doings of the world. The telephone has shortened the distance to the physician by one-half, and the automobile has cut that other half into three, leaving the distance between the physician's' home and the bedside of pain just one-sixth what it was formerly. If it was iwo hours heretofore, it is twenty minutes now; one hour heretofore, ten minutes now. The automobile is probably a luxury now and a mortgage - §but if we will have it, it should be made a bearer of burdens as a vehicle of pleasure. As to air ships, the best I can see in are those rich heirehips that Nebraska pioneers who clung to mes will leave to their children. Those children will be able to Wright and Curtiss kind. Fourth, social advantages. The entertainments most sought for and appreciated are those in the country home. The men of great wealth all have their country seats, which are more sought for by their society friends than the mansions of Capitol Hill and Fifth Avenue. Farmers are building their homes in this day of their prosperity, not for the mere purpose of housing their families, but to be able on suitable occasions to properly entertain their friends. Speaking frankly to you who have lived in the city, have you ever had such delightful times as when you attended country party, summer or winter? </seg>
            <seg id="p389">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE. o8i* Fifth, education. Years ago, when a young man was about to go to college, he was asked whether he expected to become a teacher, lawyer, physician, or preacher. He would have had nerve, indeed, if he answered that he would be a farmer. Pardon the personal allusion, but twenty-nine years ago, when 1 was starting to the Iowa State Agricultural College at Ames, and it was understood that 1 expected ultimately to be a lawyer, it was suggested that I would better stay in the high school and study geography. 1 might then find where I should go. I have no regrets. Successful law business now means, as it always should have meant, the prudent solution of clients' important interests, and in the large part of the United States, and especially so in the west, that involves largely questions of lands, crops, and domestic animals. Engineering, especially applied to land drainage, irrigation and soil reclamation is not only working marvelous results in national wealth, but it furnishes honorable and lucrative employment for thousands of young men who might have, had they spent their time down among the dead men's bones of Greek and Latin, wearied many a jury or put their congregations into many a tiUul sleep. As evidence of a proper growth of agricultural sentiment is the fact that many colleges and universities in the United States, and numerous high schools as well, teach the elements and practice of ad - vanced agriculture. And they will continue to do more so as men recog - nise the true educational results from the mingling of thought with the movement of the land. Fut the crowning branch of modern education is domestic science. It tirst taught in agricultural schools. It related to and points toward farm more closely, because the farm is farther from the bakery, larther from the original package of sawdust labeled breakfast food, and those other multitudinous boxes whose contents are only eatable on account of our ignorance of the time, place, and manner of their prepara- P'here have been in times past vast sums spent in schools to train to fight, schools to prepare them for business, schools to fit them leaching, preaching, thinking, and alleviation of suffering and the saving of life. But for the establishment and care of that bit of heaven here on earth, the home, where women and children's time are mostly spent, and more of the husband's and father's time should be, has been left to guess and haphazard. It was allowed to be wrought out from the doubtful experiences of too often antagonistic mothers-in-law, who would fain perpetuate their own peculiar system of disorder upon the family constituted by the son of one and the daughter of the other. The young woman on the farm, coming from the sources of food - stuffs and textile materials, has a better opportunity in our colleges and public schools where domestic science is taught to develop into intelli - gent and educational conductors or superintendents of homes than are those reared in city life or factory shadow. As such, in the years to come, there will be a demand at an increased scale of salary. All repu- </seg>
            <seg id="p390">table labor Is honorable, but It seems to me that to supervise and conduct a home as wife or employe would be more desirable than toiling in fac - tory, wearying at bargain counters, patiently withstanding without re - buke the sneers of haggling customers, or even enduring the strains incident to the teacher's life. And where the best of women are there Eire usually found to linger, and many arrange to stay for life, the poultry and dairy, the best two money-making departments of rni. women are scoring financial success. As time goes on woman's activities in other farm departments will, with improved facilities, take the lead and reap the benefits of farming finan - cial opportunities. Parlors and drawing-rooms are negligible apartments. Comfort and happiness lie in the sanitary kitchen, orderly dining-room and well ventilated bed-chamber. These there can always be had in the ountry. They constitute the best balm for family friction and the most potent antidote for divorce. Sixth, politically. The farm has always been and will be the recruit - ing station for officers and rulers of the republic, as well as captains of industry. Prom the farm has come 92 per cent of our presidents, 91 per cent of our governors, 84 per cent of our cabinet officers, 70 per cent of our senators, 64 per cent of our congressmen, and 55 per cent of our railroad magnates. Fathers, should you not favor giving your boys this start? Sons, would you not better stand in with the old man in his attempt to realize upon the investment which you personally represent? In the decade to come, with agriculture and attendant industries domi - nant in this section, the farmer will demand of his public representatives an acquaintance with and a mastery of agricultural problems. Young man, keep in touch, that you may fill the demand. ■enth, wealth. This is the argument addressed to human selfish Yet that is the dominant factor which feeds and controls our national and Individual. The clink of coin is the subtle voice through all ages, listened to now intelligently by the ears of the civilized world. Its best and most winning notes will be found arising in the years to come. Some years ago an American orator said: "The hand that holds Aladdin's lamp must be the hand of toll." Let me add: "that toiler's feet must press the American soil." We own the pole at the north, we own the canal at the south, and all that we want be- The clamoring hungry of Europe and Asia will demand our products soon to be sent down hill to the Gulf, thence by the sea west and east. The price to be paid is, or ought to be, our prerogative. We read much of the "big stick." I like the German pronunciation, the "pig stick," which, translated, means 8 to 9 cents for live pork and multiplied millions to the farmers. In childhood we read of the goose that laid the golden egg. That would not be unusual now. Every old ben in Nebraska barn - yards can lay golden eggs now, at least 18 karats fine. In the same old book I read of a cow jumping over the moon. Why, Nebraska dead </seg>

Hereafter our building material will be gotten from rirer banks and beds, and the forestry we plant for our children's hewing. Light, heat and power will be obtained from farm products heretofore wasted, and with our conservation of water power and captured sun - beams, within our immediate reach, will gather great factories for our toilers who will need and pay for our precious products. I have lived in my county for a quarter of a century, and yet I have not seen more than a score of merchants, bankers and professional men who have made marked financial successes, while in the same period I have seen more than a score of scores gathering from their farms a competence of from 125,000 to $150,000. Young men, if coin you will have, go to the earth's fertile covering, bathed by the rain and the dews and warmed by the sunlight of heaven, seeded, cultivated and harvested by your intelligent toil, and your dreams of avarice will be approximately realized. Do not understand the land - owners alone may prosper. The lessee and employe will prosper with them. The latter, if well equipped and industrious, as foreman and superintendent, will find his services in as much demand as a competent bank cashier; and the farm employe, as he grows to appreciate and observe the obligations of his contract, and by diligence makes him - self useful to his employer, will find his salary based upon his actual worth, rather than what neighbor Jones pays his "hand." Back to the soil for race development. It was asked in olden times: "Who by taking thought can add to his stature?" We know that by taking thought we may, against the pressing ravages of time, preserve our stature. We know that by taking thought and care the generations to come may increase in stature. Men and women are becoming better. Men and women are living longer than heretofore. We want to do for the race what Luther Burbank is doing with plant life; what our boys are doing in selection of grain seed, adding annually multiplied millions to the value of our cereal products; what Willet M. Hayes proposes to do with the live stock of the country. We want to improve the human breed. For the scene of development, the American farm. The factors — farmers' boys and girls from strong and intelligent ancestry. We want no weaklings from tenements of the great cities; we want no cigarette fiends of the ultra rich. We will tolerate neither diseased dukes nor cancerous counts from beyond the seas. There will, in those days, that is the generations to come, be giants, morally, intellectually, and physi - cally. A race proud, progressive, independent, free. A race through whose veins will course the liquid iron of American manhood and womanhood, coming as it must from the best strains of Europe, im- </seg>

Then to be an American will be a prouder fact than to be able to trace one's ancestry from a t-astilian dynasty or a line of Hapsburg kings. Young men and women, in the light of all these facts, if you are tnere now, stay. If you have left the farm, I beg of you "go back to the ■oil —there to live in comfort and independence; "wear your righU as royal robes, your manhood and womanhood as crowns." </seg>
