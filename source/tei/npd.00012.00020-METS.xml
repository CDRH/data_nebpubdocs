huge quantities of hifili grade grains and corn were als« 
secured for use at St. Louis. Two warehouses were rented ii

agricultural exhibit, ami the installation of this material be 
gau Hurly in the year. The commission having decided to erect 
no state building, but to establish its headquarters in connec 
tiou with its agricultural exhibit, the installation of these agri 
cultural products was made to add beaut}" to the handsome 
pavilion erected upon the space assigned to the state. Hundreds 
of sheaves of small grains of all varieties, and countless bundles 
of grasses, were placed alntut this pavillion in the most attrac 
live form, while the entire decoration of artistic garlands and 
wreaths was composed of grasses and other products. 

Opposite the Nebraska pavilion, in the central space set aside 
by the exposition authorities for special exhibits of the leading 
products of the United States. Nebraska made its corn display. 
A huge tower, completely covered with ears of corn and sur 
mounted by a great ball and eagle, was erected. Four large 
pyramids of solid corn flanked the tower, and the entire space 
was enclosed with long tables where was shown the very best 
corn of the state. Here over eighty two varieties of corn were 
shown, Nebraska exhibiting more distinct varieties of corn 
than all other corn states showing at the exposition. Here also 
-himn a collection of twenty six bottles of products from 
corn. 

The agricultural display of sheaf grains of all varieties, of 
seeds, of vegetables, and of honey, was one of the largest and 
lines! exhibits in the entire Agricultural building. Not only 
the great number of prizes won upon these exhibits, but the 
ever increasing interest manifested by the public to the very 
close of the exposition, attest the wonderful display made in 
this exhibit of Xebraskas great agricultural resources. 

1&gt;aiky. The states dairy exhibit was also located in the 
Agricultural building. It consisted of the usual space as 
signed each state in the refrigeration section devoted entire 1 ' 
to the greatest display of butter and cheese ever made in e 

world. Nebraska's display in reality consisted of two exhil.its 
installed at different times during the season. The first was

growth and development of the dairy industry of Nebraska 
during the last five years. A map showing tlu&gt; position of the 
L'0.000 hand separators in the state that made a part of this 
exhibit attracted great attention. Later in the season a cornu 
copia modeled of butter, from which flowed a stream of yellow 
butter, was substituted, with the legend "Nebraska's liquid 
gold, f20.000.000.00 annually." 

In the installation of this dairy exhibit the Nebraska coin 
mission was assisted by the payment of $."&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; I &lt;&gt;u the part of the 
Beatrice Creamery Company of Lincoln, the Hygeia Creamer \ 
Company of Omaha, and the Fairmont Creamery Company of 
Fairmont. This money wag subscrilted with the understanding 
that it should be used only to pay the cost of refrigeration dining 
the season. 

HoKTK-t -litre. — Notwithstanding the extremely {&gt;oor fruit 
i-rop in Nebraska in 1903. Etaperinteadeat I'ollard succeeded 
in gathering a fine collection of apples, peaches and other 
fruits, which were at once shipped to St. Louis and placed 
in cold storage waiting the opening of the exposition. The 
amount of fruit thus collected was so large that it easily tilled 
Nebraska's assigned space in the Palace of Horticulture during 
all the Bummer and until the apple crop of 1004 could be picked 
and its best specimens shipped to the exhibit. During the sum 
nier of 11)04 a continuous exhibit of Nebraska grown small 
fruits was made upon the tables. The number of plates shown 
daily throughout the season ran from 300 to 400. The fruit as 
rapidly as placed upon the tables was judged by the "working 
jury" of the exposition, with the result that a large iiuiiiImt of 
high awards were received, and in the total scoring on the fruit 
Nebraska, in proportion to the quantity shown, ranked highest 
of all states except Colorado. 

The installation of the horticultural exhibit was novel and 
attractive. The tables were surrounded by a rustic fence and 
at one side was a rustic bower with a large tree through which 
an old grapevine with huge clusters of grapes, twined itself. 
This bower, together with the magnificent display of Nebraska </seg>

fruit, made the Nchnakl space the ccniral nit'ft inj; point for 
thousands of viaiton io the horticultural building. 

&lt;!reat assistance ra rendered the conimiaakM aud the super 
intendent of the hort icultural exhibit In the int( rest shown on 
the part of the members of the State Horticultural Societ.v. 
nearlv all of whom sent their lM'st fruit for exhibition on the 
Nebraska tables. A numlter of these gent lenien spent from one 
to two weeks at the exhibit in the interest of Nebraska at a 
small coni|&gt;eiisat ion. During the season hundreds of bushels of 
apples were given away. This was notably so upon Apple Da,\ 
and Nebraska Day. when the fruit was most ragrilj sought by 
World's Fair visitors. 

Educational.- The preparation of the educational exhibit 
begaa earl; in the summer of i!ti&gt;."{. and became especially 
active after the I'nivei-sitv and schools of the state had opened 
in the following September. Circulars and letters were sen! 
to all of the schools and colleges, with the result that the educational 
exhibit when installed at St. Louis made a complete 
showing of the work of the Nebraska schools in all hraiicho 
from the kindergarten through the colleges and the Cniversitv 
It included complete exhibits of the state institutions of learn 
ing. such as the State Normal at I'eru. the State Sclufol foi 
the Deaf and Dumb at Omaha, and the State School for th&lt; 
Mind at Nebraska City. Prof. A. B. Pope, of the State Dea 
and Dumb School, having Ix-en appointed superintendent o 
social science in the exposition educational depart nienl. con 
ceived the idea of illuslrat ing the methods of teaching deaf 
and dumb children bv means of a live exhibit, and through 
his effort! the State School for Deaf and Dumb at Omaha was 
induced to send a class of students to the exposition for this 
purpose. The school paid one-half of the expense and the com 
mission the remainder. This exhibit proved a great attraction. 

An unique exhibit was that of the traveling library depart 
¦Mat of the State Library. The State Historical Society also 
contributed a splendid exhibit of forty cases of relics from the 
stale of Nebraska and the Missouri Vallev. These relics illus </seg>

(rated the history of the state from the earliest times of the 
Indian through the Spanish explorations and the territorial 
settlement of the state, to the glorious dt'velopmeiit of the 
present time. Another striking exhibit was that showing the 
work of the Federation of Women's Clubs in the state, which 
attracted great attention from the visitors to the Kducational 
Palace. Throughout the educational exhibit the fart that Nebraska 
ranks first in the small percentage of illiteracy was 
constant Iv emphasized. The Nebraska space in the Kdin-a 
lional l'aiaee was altogether too small for the immense amount 
of material shown, but Prof. Barhew'i installation brought 
innumerable visitors from much larger and more expensive 
exhibits to the Nebraska educational booth. This hooth itself 
was a remarkably lieautiful structure, consisting of a hand 
some facade built on classic lines, with the exhibits grouped 
within on long, olive lined tahl. 

Mi.NKit.vi.. Perhaps in no other way did Nebraska so astonis 
the world as by installing an exihibit in the department &lt; 
.Mines and Metallurgy. Notwithstanding the fact that ther 
is not a mine in the state in the strict sense of the word, am 
thai Nebraska is generally looked upon as a purely agricu 
tural community, the commission installed an unusually a 
tractive exhibit showing the l&gt;est samples of Nebraska's buil&lt; 
ing stones, bricks, cements and similar products. A complet 
collection of soils from different parti of the state was showi 
&lt;'nses of fossils from the State Museum, specimens from th 
geological department of the Iniversity. anil typical photo 
graphs of Nebraska, added attractiveness. A imiiiiIhm* of gla» 
glol&gt;es in this mineral exhibit, containing yellow corn, tore tl 
inscription "The (Jold of Nebraska." 

Livk STOCK anb IVh:.try. The commission earh decided to 
make a proper exhibit of Nebraska's great live stock and poul 
try interests at the exposition live stock and poultry shows 
held during the autumn of lfW(4. Meetings were held with the 
officers and representatives of the Nebraska State Live Stock </seg>

Association and the Nebraska State Poultry Association look 
ing to such an exhibit, with the result that ample funds were 
set aside and the commission agreed to transport from Nebraska 
to St. Louis and return all the live stock and poultry 
winning first and second prizes at the state fair of 1904. This 
plan met with the hearty approval of the officers of these as 
sociations. aud the leading stockmen and poultry raisers of the 
state, inasmuch as ii was readily seen that by this plan the 
tincsi ;ind most representative live stock and poultry in the 
state would l»e entered at the exposition stock shows, luder 
the direction of (). 1'. Hendersliot. superintendent of live stock 
and T. L. Norval. superintendent of poultry, several car 
loads of stock and poultry were shipped to St. Louis immediately 
after the state fair, and entered for premiums. All of 
these exhibitors were uniformly successful, winning many 
prizes. This was particularly true in the classes devoted to 
swine, sheep and poultry. The officers of the Poultry Association 
state that never before were Nebraska exhibits so successful 
in competing with the birds of eastern and well-known 
i&gt;reede»"«. 

MOVING PICTURE EXHIBITIONS 

In addition to the above exhibits in the regular departments 
of the exposition, the Nebraska Commission also erected and 
maintained a small theatre in the Nebraska pavilion, for the 
purpose of illustrating the daily life of the principal business 
enterprises of the state. The unique idea of doing this by mm 
ing pictures and stereopticon views was hit uj»on by the -presi 
dent of the commission. This plan was early adopted by the 
commission, and during all of the summer of l!)0:{ and in the 
spring of ll&gt;04 an expert photographer, under the direction of 
the secretary of the commission and the various superintend 
ents. was engaged in taking suitable pictures for this exhibi 
tion. Nearly ten Thousand feet of moving picture film was 
secured, this film illustrating in its entirely almost every phase 
of agricultural and industrial life in the state. These pictures 
were taken in all parts of Nebraska, so as to present to the </seg>

public ¦ complete picture of Hw life, the business, and the 
general conditions in tlie state. When finally grouped for ex 
hibition purposes, these moving pk'tuw numlx»red nine com 
plete series. One of these illustrated the seenes common to 
early spring planting and the harvest in early summer. An 
other showed the farm life in times of haying, orcharding, and 
corn picking. One was devoted to dairying, illustrating the 
modern commercial dairy industry in Nebraska by the milking 
of cows, the separating, shipping and handling of cream in 
the central creameries. Other series illustrated the poultry, 
sheep and swine industries, the raising of alfalfa, and the culti 
vation and marketing of sugar beets, with the processes of ex 
tracting the sugar from the same. A series devoted to the live 
stock showed the industry through all its familiar phases from 
the feed lot to the packing house. Another pictured the open 
life of the range, presenting scenes illustrating the rounding 
up and branding of cattle, and the lassoing and riding of un 
broken western ponies. A panorama made from a moving train 
passing through ISO miles of the best farm land in Nebraska 
was shown, as well as a panorama taken from a street-car 
showing a principal street in Omaha. Similar panoramas de 
picting familiar scenes at the State I'niversity. the State Fair 
and the Ak sar-ben festivities in Omaha were given. 

One of the most attractive moving pictures shown was that of 
the late President William MoKinley. at the Trans-Mississippi 
Exposition in Omaha. The film of this picture, which is one 
of the very few moving pictures of the late president in ex 
istence. was kindly loaned to the Nebraska Commission b\ 
Frank A. Rinehart. of Omaha. Hundreds of colored stereopti 
con views of fine farm houses and typical farm scenes, and the 
best municipal and public buildings of the state, rounded out 
this exhibition. Many of these views were furnished by the 
railroads of the state, the \cbnixkn h'annn- and the Twentieth 
Cnitttnt Farmer. With this immense amount of illus 
trative material, it was possible to give an entire change of 
program at each of the twelve to fifteen shows given daily in </seg>

the Nebraska theatre. Before the o|&gt;ening of the exposition, 
the commission |»lanne»l to give two shows a day. especially 
during the early part of the exposition, but the very first exhibition 
demonstrated the popularity of Nebraska's unique 
method of advertising the state with the visiting public, so 
that it was soon necessary to make the exhibitions and the ac 
conipanying lectures a regular hourly feature. Lecturers were 
engaged from among the advanced I'niversity students and the 
young instructors of that institution, each lecturer being 
secured from one to two months. The young men who performed 
this service for the commission were A. S. Kcnsoner. of 
Shelton : Frank L. Kain. of Fairbury : E. H. I'lark. (Jeorge ('. 
Shedd. \Y. C. Mercer and Buell Chessington. all of Lincoln. 
The lectures given by these young men told in a brief and en 
tertaining way the story of Nebraska's rapid development and 
growth, and the wonderful resources it possesses for the future. 
Between the exhibitions the lecturers mingled with the 
spectators explaining the pictures more in detail, and in every 
way promoting the interest of the visiting public 

Owing to the increased demand for the pictures and the 
rapidly growing attendance at the Nebraska pavilion, the mov 
ing picture exhibition in the theatre grew from an hourly fea 
ture to an almost continuous performance. From .Tuly to the 
end of the exposition half hourly shows were given from 10 
to &lt;&gt; o'clock, and early in the autumn the crowds grew to such 
proportions that the commission enlarged the theatre by re 
moving a j&gt;ortion of the inner corridor so as to accommodate at 
least 100 more persons at each exhibition. The following table 
tells the story of the remarkable attendance at the Nebraska 
theatre during the exposition season: </seg>

            <seg id="p023">
It nmst be remembered that these igurea represent the 
actual number of pcrsoM who witnessed the exhibition* in 1 
little theatre with 1 seating capacity of loo and standing room 
for 100 more. There were thousands &lt;if |htkous who witnessed 
the pictures for a few minutts froni the doorways, and then 
passed on because tliev could not enter the theatre for the 
crowd, while there were other thousands who visited the Ne 
braskfl pavilion during the intervals that the pictures were not 
lK'injr thrown upon the screen. Without hesitancy, it can be 
stated on a conserva five estimate that at least otic million 
people visited the Nebraska pavilion during the exposition 
season, over a third of whom aetuallv witnessed a series of 
these moving pictures, and a second third of whom witBM 
some portion of a complete series. 

The record of attendance which was kept throughout these 
moving picture exhibitions shows some remarkable facts in 
addition to those stated above. It naturallv shows that the 
greatest crowds were entertained on the national and other 
holidays at the fair. The attendance on July 4, for instance, 
was 2,615; on SeptemlK-r •". Labor Day. 2.."&lt;S."&gt; : on September 
28, Agricultural Day, 2,535; on November 24. Thanksgivin&lt;; 
Day. 3.440: and on September 15. St. Louis I&gt;ay. reached the 
tremendous total of 8,930. During the entire season, when 
nearly 2.000 exhibitions were given, the performances were 
hindered by unavoidable causes but nine different times. On 
two occasions the electric current was cut off by the ezposi-

awards; on another day the performances were hindered for 
two hours hv the enlarging of the theatre, and on President's 
Day. November 26. the entire building was cleared in the afternoon 
during the official visit of the president of the Fnited 
States. On this afternoon, however, one exhibition was given 
at which the president of the Fnited States stopped a brief 
moment. The records also show that the Nebraska theatre 
was also visited by scores of notable persons, including the 
leading exposition officials, the various commissioners from 
foreign governments to the exposition, the secretary of the 
navy, prominent newspaper men of the world during the In 
ternational Press Parliament, noted scientists and men of 
letters during the International Congress of Arts and Sciences, 
and thousands of visitors from all parts of the world. Numer 
ons special exhibitions were given for various organizations at 
the exposition and from Nebraska, the National Bee Keepers' 
Association and other national organizations, and for bodies 
of natives from the Philippine reservation, the Tndian reservation, 
and the anthropological exhibit. The courtesy of the 
Nebraska theatre was extended to various organizations in 
the Agricultural building, notably the Agricultural Club, which 
held its weekly meetings there during the entire season : also 
to numerous men of prominence connected with the varions 
exhibits at the exposition, for special courses of lectures along 
educational and scientific lines. Tn a word, it may be said 
that no other state's exhibit at the exposition attracted so much 
attention as this Nebraska theatre and its moving pictures. 
The exposition management, at the very outset, recognized the 
merit of this exhibit by advertising the Nebraska biograph 
pictures on their official daily program as one of the features of 
the exposition. The newspapers of St. Louis early favored it 
with their generous approval, and before the summer was well 
advanced many of the leading magazines of the country such 
as the Cosmopolitan Magazine, the World's Work, and Print- </seg>

TO I.O 

ISIANA PI RCHASE EXPOSITION. 

•rs' Ink, favorably commented «&gt;n this entt rtainment pan of 
lie Nebraska exhibit. That the moving picture exhibition, as 
well as the other features of the Nebraska exhibit, have met 
with the approval of the great mass of visitors from Nebraska 
s attested by the scores of complimentary letters that have 
&gt;een received and are now in the commissions files. In this 
connection it may further l&gt;e said that this moving picture 
feature has established a new idea in the matter of advertising 
a state's resources and advancement at an exposition. Shortly 
after the Nebraska moving pictures were installed and pre 
sented to the public, the idea was copied bv other states and 
bv various large manufacturing corporations and put into execution 
at the exposition. None, however, were so popular as 
Nebraska's, which enjoyed the exclusive privilege in the Agri 
cultural Palace. Moriag picture experts also declare that the 
Nebraska pictures have created a demand of a new kind for 
work in their line. Since the Nebraska &lt; 'ommission began 
showing its picture*, an entirely new idea has t&gt;een evolved. 
The moving picture, from a purely entertaining feature, has 
advanced into the educational and scientific field. Official •- 
from various state's and the government of the T'nited States, 
as well as representatives from the Japanese. Austrian. Kelgian 
and other governments, visited the Nebraska exhibitions with a 
view of introducing a similar use of the moving picture machine 
into the agricultural departments of their countrii 
number of these representatives of foreign countries have made 
full reports of Nebraska's mine— fill method to their govern 
nients. 

AWARDS AMI PRIZES. 

That the state of Nebraska should be highly successful in 
winning many premiums and prizes on the general installation 
of its exhibits as described above, was to be expected, but that 
a grand total of over Mi medals and prizes upon collective and 
individual exhibits should be awarded to the state, demon 
strates fullv the high rank taken by Nebraska at the i 
Exposition. These awards by departments are given below: </seg>

grains, tkmm to grasses and forage crops, twenty seven tt&gt; 
seeds, six to honey, and three to general exhibit. The awards 
in corn covered all varieties, including sweet, tield. flint, pop, 
and blue and white flour corn. Sixteen awards were made 
upon popcorn alone, a total, it is l&gt;elieved. greater than tha' 
of any other state upon the same variety. The highest award 
in the department upon sweet corn w;is likewise made to 
Nebraska. The exhibits in grains included all the st;md:ird 
varieties of oats. rye. millet, barley, and timothy. l&gt;oth in sheaf 
and in grain; while there were awards made upon fine samples 
of speltz. milo maize, buckwheat and sorghum. In vegetables. 
Nebraska received a gold medal for its collective exhibit, and 
the Douglas County Agricultural Society a silver medal. The 
entire twenty-one entries in vegetables received awards, two 
being gold medals, eighteen silver medals, and one bronze. 
While no authorized announcement is as yet obtainable, as far 
as can be ascertained from careful inquiry. Nebraska received 
more awards in the agricultural department than any other 
state exhibiting. 

In the dairy department the state received ¦ gold medal for 
its collective exhibit. No individual awards were made, as 
the dairy exhibit was in cold storage and represented only the 
wonderful growth of the dairy industry in Nebraska during the 
last few years. 

Tn horticulture, a grand prize was awarded the Nebraska 
exhibit. Pass. Lancaster and Neinaha counties received gold 
medals on collective exhibits of fruit, while Pawnee. Lincoln. 
Richardson. Saline. Valley and Washington counties received 
silver medals, and Douglas county a bronze medal. During the 
summer there were forty nine entries of various kinds of frnit 
from individual growers in the state. Eleven of these exhibi 
tors showed collective exhibits of different kinds of fruit, while 
there were eleven entries of apples alone. The other entries 
included apricots, plums, cherries, grapes, peaches, strnwber 
ries. blackberries and raspberries. The high awards received </seg>

In the department of education. Nebraska received one gram! 
prize, nine gold medals, four silver medals and five bronze 
medals. Inasmuch as each medal was awarded to a collective 
exhibit, this number shows a much larger representation than 
would appear on the face. For instance, a gold medal was 
awarded to the State Federation of Women's Clubs, which ex 
hibit contained fhe work of hundreds of individuals. In the 
same manner gold medals were awarded to the State Inhere 
ity. the State School for the Deaf, the State School for the 
Blind, and to various boards of education. Few medals were 
awarded in this department to individual exhibitors. 

In the department of mines and metallurgy, where Nebrask;i 
for the first time in its history made an exhibit of soils and 
building material*, a silver medal was awarded to the slate for 
its collective exhibit: a bronze medal to tin- state upon its soils 
and minerals shown, and to the State University upon a collec 
tion of photographs illustrating Nebraska's mineral resources. 

In live stock and poultry. Nebraska captured many pre 
niinms. Although the entries in horses and cattle were no 
large, in the classes pertaining to swine and sheep the wii

strong showing, individual exhibitors winning more premium 
in proportion to number of birds entered and shown, than ex 
hibitors from any other state in the Union. In some classes o

NO STATE Bni.I'IV; NEBRASKA PAVILION. 

The success of the moving picture exhibitions and the ex 
libits in the various departments as outlined above has demon 
Hated clearly to the members of the commission, the wisdom 
&gt;f not attempting to erect and maintain a state building upon 
he exposition grounds with the limited means at the coimnis 
**ion's disposal. Other western states having appropriations of 
#100.1 MM to 9960,006, erected state buildings of magnitude and 
iM'auty. and any building that Nebraska could have erected 
would have compared unfavorably with those of surrounding 
states. In view of this fact, and the further l&gt;elief that the 
Nebraska appropriation was made more for advertising in the 
Itest possible manner the resources of the state, than for the 
purpose of affording entertainment and social features such 
as a state building would necessitate, the commission almost 
immediately after its organization decided that it would be 
unwise to attempt the construction and maintenance of such 
a state building. A plan was devised for establishing head 
quarters in connection with Ihe state's agricultural exhibit in 
the Agricultural TCuilding. and after consultation with V. 
W. Taylor, chief of the Agricultural Department, with other 
exposition officials, with your Excellency, and with other lead 
ing persons in the state, this was done. A 1 SB the </seg>

center aisle of the Palace of Agriculture was assigned to Ne 
braska. and here a state pavilion, WxB2 feet in extent. was 
erected. The plans for this pavilion were furnished l&gt;y Aivhi 
tect Thomas R. Kimball, of Omaha, and the beauty and utilitx 
of his design added much to the general attractiveness of tin 
exhibit. These plans wero furnished by him gratuitously, in m 
far ;is his work was concerned, the commission only paying tin 
actual cost of the work of his employees. Not only was tin 
principal agricultural exhibit installed in this pa ilion and th&lt; 
Nebraska theatre erected, but a large reception room was pro 
vided as a meeting place for Nebraskans. where mail could 1m 
received, the leading Nebraska journals found, and facilities 
for letter writing and checking panels obtained. Cloak rooms 
and lavatories were provided, and in every way convenient ¦• ¦» 
afforded for the comfort of visiting Nebraskans. A register o 
Nebraskans visiting the pavilion was kept throughout the ex 
position, which has been turned over to the State Historical 
Society, to be placed with similar registers from other ex 
position* where Nebraska has been represented. Here. too. th&lt; 
headquarters of the Nebraska Commission were established, ii 
charge of the secretary. As the summer advanced Mrs. Mar.\ 
L. F.astman, of Omaha, was appointed as hostess, and remaine&lt; 
until the close of the exposition to greet visiting Nebraskan 
and make them feel at home. 

While to many Nebraskans there was a feeling of disappoint 
meiit. -before visiting the exposition, that Nebraska had n 
state building for social gatherings and entertainment fe. 1 
tures. this feeling gave way to one of approval of the connnis 
sion's plans after these Nebraskans had visited the expositioi 
iliscovered the homelike ami social atmosphere pervading tli 
Nebraska pavilion, and witnessed the earnest endeavors of th 
commission to further Nebraska's opportunities in the best pos 
sible manner. The commission has in its tiles several hundre&lt; 
letters from prominent Nebraskans. as well as many di 
tinguished citizens of the United States and other countrie 
heartily commending the states showing at the expos </seg>

1 ion. From these letters the commission believe* that it is the 
consensus of opinion, among Nebraskans ;it least, that the 
state commission, in view of its limited mnaraea, acted wisely 
in not attempting to erect and maintain a state building, and 
that its moving picture exhibition and its regular exhibits, 
advertised the state in a manner that no state building eould 
have done. 

APVKRTISIM 

MATKKIAI . 

At the state pavilion in the agricultural building, as well as 
at all the Nebraska exhibits in other exhibit palaces, a larg&lt; 
amount of advertising matter in convenient form, giving dat;i 
regarding the wealth, resources and advantages of the state 
was provided. One hundred thousand small vest pocket nieiiioranduni 
books containing striking statistics in regard to the 
state and having a rover as shown on following page were dis 
tributed. 

Maps of Nebraska showing the location of lands that may Inentered 
in fUH acre tracts under the Kinkaid Homestead Ad 
were also distributed in great numlters. The publications 
issued by the State Experiment Station at Lincoln, the land 
departments of the various railroads in Nebraska, ami the 
farm journals of the state, all exploiting the resources of Ne 
braska, were also presented to visitors. Five thousand copies 
of a very complete short history of the state of Nebraska, 
issued by the V &lt; hiosl.a I'uriiur. were generously donated to 
the commission for free distribution, by tin- proprietor! of that 
journal. These histories were much sought after by visitors, 
and by special resolution the thanks of the commission were 
tendered to the publishers for their donation. 

At all of the exhibit booth* maintained by the commission, 
the utmost courtesy was shown to visitors, and a constant 
desire on the part of those in charge exhibited, to explain fulh 
and truly the advantages ottered by our state to prospective 
settlers and investors. 

From scores of letters received by the commission it is known 
that this advertising matter, as well as the exhibit maintained </seg>

ennine and hearty hospitality on every foot of space where 
Nebraska was represented. Besides welcoming all individuals. 
t may be stated that a reveption and special moving picture 
xhibition was given in May to the Nebraska Press Association, 
lumbering nearly one hundred editors of the leading papers in 
he state, and their families: and a similar reception was also 
'iven to the special excursion of several hundred teachers from

After t lu* exercises at Festival Hall, a reception to the official

of the exhil&gt;it booths were appropriately decorated, and special 
souvenirs presented to visitors. At the horticultural exhibit 
several hundred liushels of apples were distributed. 

FINANCES. 

Immediately after organisation, realizing the inadequacy of 
the amount appropriated by the legislature to fitly prepare and 
install a representative exhibit of the state, the commission 
earnestly solicited citizens and corporations to increase tin 
appropriation by donations. The result of these solicitation 
was the donation for the use of the commission of the sum o 
$25,000 by the following railway corporations: 1'nion 1'aciti 
Railway Co.,f9,060; Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railway Co 
19.000; Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Co.. f 7.000. Tl 
amounts were paid into the treasury of the commission by th 
donors, and were used in payment of the expenses incidental t 
collecting, preparing and installing the various exhibits an&lt; 
the moving picture exhibition. This amount paid all the ex 
jienses of the commission until about the middle of the i 
summer, when the tirst requisition was made upon the state 
treasurer for $20,000. The commission estimated thai this 
amount would pay all its expenses for the remainder of the exposition. 
A warrant was drawn and then turned over by the 
state auditor to the commission, with the understanding that 
snbvonchers for the individual amounts s|&gt;ent were to be fur 
nished later. This the commission has done, fur the amounts </seg>

of money siKMit out of this f 20.000. namely. |1!&gt;.SO9.7O and the 
balance of (190.30 has beea turned over to tin- state treasurer. 

In addition to the above amount, the commission also re 
ci'ived $2"i0 from the Beatrice Creamery Co.. flSB from the 
Hygeia Creamery Ool, of Omaha, aud fl2."&gt; from the Fairmont 
("reamers Co., of Fairmont, making a total of $~»00. This sum 
was paid to the commission with the express understanding 
I hat it was to 1h» used only to pay for the charge of that 
amount made by the Louisiana Purchase Kx|x&gt;sitiou Compam 
for the necessary refrigeration in connection with the state's 
dairy exhibit. 

It will thus be seen that f60.o00 was placed at the disposal 
of the Nebraska Conmiission. () f which $45,309.70 has been ex 
pended in collecting, installing and maintaining the various 
exhibits at St. Louis. 

The secretary of the commission was authorized to sell nek 
of the exhibits and installation as could Ir» disposed of. and 
from such sales he realized the sum of |Mt.7B which was 
turned over to the commissioner of public lands and build 
ings as provided by the act clearing the commission. 

It will thus be seen that out of the sum of 935,000, appro 
priated by the state, only 119,809.70 has been used, and the bal 

anee of tl5.190.3fl remains in the hands of the state treasurer. 

The moving picture films and negatives, together with tiiin-h 
valuable exhibit material, have been turned over to the coin 
missioner of public lands and buildings, for such future 
the state may desire. 

That such a showing could be made is due to the fact that 
the commission has exercised the utmost care in managing its 
affairs. All unnecessary expense in the matter of attendants 
and in the collection of exhibits, was avoided. The commission 
was fortunate in securing a number of highly coni|»etent men 
;is superintendents, who gave their services to the state without 
compensation. M well as a number of assistants and at 
tendants who served for a reasonable compensation. The com 

mission was also fortunate in the selection of its secretarv </seg>

CONGRATULATORY LETTERS. 

I ilesire to congratulate the Nebraska State Cominis&gt;*i &gt;n for 
the success that has attended their effort to pttmtmi Nebraska 
in acceptable form at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The 
appropriation obtained for this purpose was so meagre when 
compared with the large appropriations made bj other states 
that I was fearful that the state would suffer by the contrast. 
Except for social purposes and for the accommodation of a 
few favored ones the erection and maintenance of state build 

iiiys at these great expositions is not desirable. 

With the limited means at the disposal of the commission. 
Nebraska made a unique exhibition. Her great products were 
well exhibited in the agricultural building and the little 
theatre with its exhibition of moving pictures, expressive of 
life in Nebraska, was a very captivating affair, satisfactorily 
evidenced by the fact that every seat was filled and there was 
standing room only at each one of the numerous performances 
during each day. 

It is also a most satisfactory result that so many awards 
were given to Nebraska and the fact that the commission has 
kept itself strictly within the proper lines and has wasted no 
money and will have no deficiency to be accounted for is also a 
subject matter for congratulation. 

Truly yours.

I n my opinion the state &lt;&gt;\ Nebraska owes the commission .1 
debt of gratitude for the magnificent display yon nicceeded in 
making at the exposition with the meagre appropriation ai 
your disposal. I speak with reference to the agricultural exhibit 
only since I did not see the other exhibits. The imageiiient 
of the agricultural display was artistic and tasteful. 
The hearty and cordial welcome that visitors received is of 

itself worthy of especial mention and the moving picture 
theatre was the keystone of the arch. Whoever originated that 
idea is entitled to special mention. Tt was the best drawing 
card in the agricultural building and did more to show the 
people of otli' - the actual conditions und surroundings 
of farming in Nebraska than anything else that could have 
been devised. While Nebraska had no state building, in m,\ 
judgment the small amount of money as handled by the Oosi 
mission was a better advertisement to the state than if four 
times as much had been spent in^a state building.

While the Nebraska exhibits were not as elaborate or pretentious 
as those of many other states they were, in m\ opinion, 
most effective, and have stimulated much interest on the 
part of visitors to the fair in the resources of our state. The 
moving picture feature of the Nebraska exhibit was notably 
interesting, and on eaeh of the several occasion* when 1

When I was in St. Louis, I was very much pleased with the 
exhibit of Nebraska products at the World's fair. 

It is certainly a very creditable exhibit of the resources of 
the state, and was installed in a manner that attracted much 
attention. 

I desire to particularly commend the exhibition of moving 
pictures, and I believe that there was more comment made by 
visitors on the Nebraska exhibit, than the exhibit of any other 
state made in the agricultural building. This favorable com 
inent was largely due to the moving pictures. 

The exhibit as a whole is very satisfactory and the Ota 
mission is entitled to great credit for their work.

REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE COMMISSION 

It lias beeu my privilege to visit the exhibits of Nebraska a 
the Louisiana Parckaae Exposition. The educational exhibi 
was comprehensive, interesting and instructive. When 
learned the small amount of money expended upon it. i 
seemed to me the best exhibit, on the relative basis of expend 
ture, at the Exposition. 

The agricultural exhibit was si t-iking and true to the prill 
ciple of the exposition, to show processes and life. My friends 
from my present state were telling how attractive the N&lt; 
braska exhibit was M contrasted with that of our and othe 
states. It seems to me that great credit is to be given to th 
commissioners and persons in charge of the Nebraska exhibit 
for bringing out so fully the merits of the state. 

I cannot conclude without saying that the personnel of thf 
attendants and their skill and hospitality, are no small taetoi 
in the success of the enterprises.

I want to say that I was specially interested in our exhibit 
at the fair, and after visiting the exhibits of the various states. 
I was very much impressed with the superior exhibit from 
Nebraska. It was the universal opinion, I think, of the average 
visitor to the fair that Nebraska excelled all other states 
in her exhibit and method of presenting the advantages of 
this state to the people. The idea of throwing upon the screen 
or canvas the moving pictures illustrating the development 
and growth of the Nebraska farms and their products, and the 
illustration of the industry of cattle and horse raising in this 
state was unique as well as a most attractive and impressive 
method of presenting Nebraska's advantages. In my judgment, 
Nebraska never had so attractive and satisfactory an 
exhibit in any of the preceding fairs as the one presented at </seg>

the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. It was to me a great 
personal pride to visit our exhibit and to direct strangers to it. 
as one of the attractive and impressive features of the fair. 
I overheard many strangers, as they thronged the agricultural 
building, in discussing the exhibits of the various stat&lt; 
press their satisfaction in visiting our exhibit and in declaring 
it to be the best exhibit in the building. Much of the attractiveness 
of this exhibit and its usefulness is due to the genial 
and courteous gentlemen who had charge of it on the grounds, 
and their painstaking and complete analysis and explanation 
of the moving pictures as they were thrown upon tlu&gt; &gt;

In my opinion, the money appropriated by the legislature 
for an exhibit of the resources of Nebraska at the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition has been most judiciously and profitably 
spent. From a comparatively small appropriation the 
seems to have secured a greater amount of profitable adver 
tising than any state in the Union. The moving picture device 
for illustrating the industrial life of the state was a very 
happy idea. Both from observation and report, I am led to 
believe that the Nebraska exhibit drew greater crowds and 
aroused more interest than any other exhibit in the great 
agricultural hall. In my opinion, the commissioners are entitled 
to unstinted commendation for the very satisfactory 

and successful showing they have made in behalf of the state.

As one of the exhibitors at the Worlds fair 1 want to write 
and tell you that I believe the Nebraska exhibits at the World's 
fair were the most effective of any state's exhibits. The ex 
hibiting at any fair is simply a form of advertising, and 1 believe 
that Nebraska's novel way of impressing on the minds of 
those who saw the exhibit, was not excelled by any other exhibitor, 
and T hope that the people of Nebraska appreciate 
what was done for their state in its success. ;is shown bj the

I take pleasure in assuring you of my appreciation and 
hearty approval of the Nebraska exhibits at the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition. I consider them severally and jointly 
excellent and a great credit to our state. The exhibits of our 
agricultural products compare most favorably with those of 
other states, while the special features of our section, such as 
the moving picture exhibition and the "mounted skin of the 
Chancellor'' — as one newspaper reported it — attract universal 
attention. After spending two weeks inspecting the fair quite 
thoroughly. ] left well satisfied that the Nebraska Commission </seg>

had acted most wisely in devoting the funds at their command 
to a splendid exhibition of the products of our state, rather 
than to the erection and maintenance of a showy state build

states have done. 

It was plain that Messrs. Shedd and Walsh and their corps

it seems to me that great care has been taken to reach the 
people with this exhibit, and much discrimination shown, as 
to what to leave out. and what to put in to the exhibit. Th;-moving 
pictures, and the little theatre devoted to them are 
very popular and a delightful treat; while the easy chairs and

public, help to advertise our state.

The displays of corn, and other farm products, together with 
the moving pictures, formed a most attractive feature of the 
irreat agricultural building, and it seemed to me that they 
drew more attention from people from all parts of the coun 
try than most any other single exhibit. 

In m\ opinion the Nebraska Commission acted wisely in the 
use of the funds placed at its disposal in connection with the 
work at the fair, and the expenditure has undoubtedly accomplished 
more for the good of the state than could have resulted 
from any other plan that might have been adopted.

When I looked over the exposition grounds and saw the

I hesitated to jjo and see the Nebraska exhibit becaoae 1 ha&lt;l 
been disgusted with the showing made by our state at previous 
expositions, and for the further reason that The small appro 
priation at the disposal of our Commissioners this time offered 
bo hope that we would be able to do any better at St. Louis 
But I met some friends at St. Louis who had been much ini 
pressed with the Nebraska exhibit. They told me it was the 
best on the grounds. So I went out there. I not only took 
in the Nebraska showing but T compared it carefully with thai 
&lt;&gt;f other states, and I tell you. sir. I was delighted. 

With the single exception of Missouri it is my judgment 
that Nebraska has the best agricultural exhibit at St. Louis 
of any state in the Fnion. And T found everybody else think 
ing so too. People spent much time and made a careful in 
spcction of the Nebraska showing. Everything was exactly as 
calculated to produce an impression. The moving pictures 
are wonderfully popular and effective. They mean more than 
the spoken or written word. They show the eye what N»-hrnska 
inn do and is doing. 

And so I say that Nehraskans have every reason to feel 
proud and be abundantly satisfied with the work of their 
Ooniniissioners at St. Louis.

NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE COMMENT 

In the Nebraska agricultural exhibit there is a small hall 
titted up with a hiograph, which at all times entertains a large 
srathering in displaying the qualities of Nebraska soil. 

Chapter one of this biograph story opens &lt;mi a prairie farm. 
You see the farmer come out of liis comfortable home in the 
early morning, take his team from the stable and proceed to 
the field. The plow stands ready in the furrow. Two strong 
horses are attached, and off they go. the veins standing out on 
their necks, strength in their limbs, spirit in their movement. 
The rich black soil is turned up in a furrow that is irresistably 
convincing to the practised eye. There can be no question 
whatever about the quality of the soil. Its richness is before 
your eyes, and I do not believe that there was a single person 
in that room who did not wish he owned a far mill such a land 
of natural wealth. But I wish the biograph had also carried 
one into the sitting room of that farmhouse in the evening, 
and had shown around the lamp on the book table, the family 
circle, each member with a book or periodical, at the pianola 
the farmer himself, enjoying his new toy. which enables him 
to give his family the latest topical songs of the far-off great 
cities. — Cosmopolitan Magazine. September. 1904. 

•What we need is something that moves," said the secretary 
of a costly state display of agricultural protects. This dis 
play is virtually a history of his state and a catalogue of its 
resources. It was installed with no other pur|(ose than to 
attract home-seekers. But the crowd pass, s it by. and tlx 
exhibits of forty other states equally complete and costly to 
hurry up to the least expensive state exhibit in the agricul 
tural building. This is the exhibit of Nebraska. It has some 
thing that moves— a moving picture entertainment showing </seg>

REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE COMMISSION 

views of Nebraska's wheat fields, dairy herds, beet-sugar in 
dustry, etc. The Nebraska state appropriation was only f35. 
000. No state building could be erected for this sum. But the 
appropriation fell into the hands of a commission that not only 
werveR without salary, but has the advertising instinct. The 
moving picture entertainments are visited by fully 3,000 per 
sons daily, and are the means of interesting desirable home 
seekers in the state's free land and industries. In a little 
theatre seating something over 100 people a different set of 
views is shown every half-hour. When spectators come out of 
this theatre the advertising booklets of Nebraska have some 
meaning for them. Yet the whole show will cost not more 
than $5,000 during the fair, and thus the state that had least 
to spend is getting the best advertising results. — Printers' Ink. 
August 24. 1904. 

There is no Nebraska state building, but one need not leave 
the fair ignorant of the details of Nebraska life. Nebraska 
concentrates itself on agriculture. In the Palace of Mines it 
exploits its corn as gold-nuggets from its many kinds of prairie 
soils. A pleasant rest-room, in lieu of a state building occupies 
one part of the Nebraska section on the main aisle of the Palace 
of Agriculture. Once there, you are in Nebraska. For when 
you have looked at the Rtuffed form of the largest steer ever 
raised, and have understood why corn, running forty bushels 
to the acre, at forty cents a bushel, is being replaced in parts 
of Nebraska with sugar-beets, running ten and a half tons to 
the acre, at four and one-half dollars a ton, a bell rings, and 
you step inside a little theatre. A biograph begins to whir. 
Before you, on a screen, the scenes of Nebraska life rty by. The 
corn is planted and harvested. The sleek cattle jog by to mar 
ket. A street parade passes in Lincoln. A county fair is 
reproduced. Meanwhile, a courteous lecturer explains the 
rapid progress of the state.— World's Work. August, 1904.

countries have exhibits, but the most immediately striking displays 
are made by the states. Even Iowa, which evcr.\ IhkIv 
thinks of as a prairie state, comes forward with products from 
its 300 coal mines and alluvial Nebraska makes aa interesting 
exhibit, the basis of which is a joke. Nebr;isk;i shows the soils 
in which are grown its corn crops. Above some of the tall 
glass jars of prairie earth arc two glM s tilled with 
ijilded and silvered cars of corn. The legend rends. "GoM and 
silver nuggets extracted from the agricultural soil of Nebraska 
to the amount of $200,000.1111(1 a year. It is the surest of all 
mining, and the wealth is distributed among a greater number 
of people." — World's Work. August. IfM.

picture exhibitions of its magnificent industries and marvelous 
agricultural resources." l.a De|&gt;eche Tunisienne. Algiers. 
Pecciaer M, ii&gt;04. 

Other states have exhausted their appropriations in building 
state buildings, but Nebraska lias wisely spent her appropria 
tion in exhibiting her natural resources. As a result Nebraska 
is getting more advertising than any other state exhibiting.

as the plan adopted by tlte state commission has so thoroughly 
Inought In the front the resources and products of the state 
iliat no advantage could possibly arise from the existence of h 
state building. 

Another feature of tlie Nebraska exhibit which is unique and 
most successful in its application, is the theatre, where moving 
picture exhibitions are given, as many as ten presentations n 
day. Here farm scenes taken from life are shown. Ererj 
phase of farm work, the plowing, the planting, the cultivating, 
the harvesting and the threshing, all art projected from .1 
kinetosco]&gt;e. and make a great illustration of the actual con 
ditions of out-door life in the state. The cattle industry is 
portrayed, and the railroads and other means of transporta 
tion are given proper place. School scenes, the great University 
of Nebraska football team in operation, and many other 
selected views, showing in detail tin social life of the people, 
are exhibited. This show is accompanied by appropriate lee 
hires, and the visitors to the Nebraska theatre go away with a 
most vivid and realistic picture of the state, its industries ami 
advantages. Other lectures have been given in the theatre

September 1. 1904. 

The Nebraska exhibit attracts more attention than am 
other state exhibit. The little theatre where moving pictures 
of Nebraska farmers plowing, seeding, and harvesting their 
crops are exhibited is always crowded and everywhere in the 
vicinity of "Nebraska" pedestrains are asking I heir way to 
the place where they are welcome to sit down in rocking chairs, 
free access to ice-water and where "Challenger" the 
champion steer of the world, is mounted. In The theatre the 
Nebraska wind waves and almost rustles the big fields of corn, 
the big horses pull the latest improved listers and hay rakes 
right up to the front row.

conception of fertility and a favoring climate. This impression 
is deepened by the sixty-one varieties of field corn, specimens 
of which they are allowed to handle. Other states have 
spent three dollars where we have spent one. But every dollar 
of Nebraska's appropriation has been wisely spent. There 
has been no doubling of useless functionaries, no squabbling 
for places, nor scrambling for the lion's share of the appro 
priation. It was too small to attract the place-seekers or the 
boodlers.— Nebraska State Journal, August 28, 1904. 

The Japanese have shown much interest in the moving picture 
plan of illustrations, and recently one of the commissioners 
obtained much data to be sent to his country. It is proposed 
to prepare films of farming scenes in the Mikado's coun 
try and send them back to St. Louis for display at the World's 
fair, in connection with many of the country's exhibits. — St. 
Louis Republic, August 12, 1904. 

The state of Nebraska has adopted a somewhat novel and 
unique way of bringing its resources to the attention of the 
public at the St. Louis Exposition. Instead of expending a 
large sum of money for a state building, it has erected a very 
handsome pavilion in the Palace of Agriculture. In this pavilion 
is a theatre with a capacity of some 250 people. Throughout 
the day at short intervals are given lectures upon Nebraska's 
wonderful agricultural resources, illustrated by moving 
ictures. The little theatre is crowded at every lecture, 
and Nebraska's strong points are brought before the people in 
a way they will remember. — Schenectady, N. Y., August 1. 
1904. 

The Nebraska State Commission of the St. Louis Exposition 
has issued a neat little book, showing the standing and resources 
of Nebraska in a nut-shell. The book is circulated 
widely by the Commission at St. Louis, and its benefit to the 
state is sure to have a manifold effect. </seg>

REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE COMMISSION 

The Commission has supplemented it with the moving pictures 
of life on the farms and ranches of Nebraska. These are 
exhibited free in a cosy theatre in the Agricultural Palace in 
connection with the headquarters of the Commission several 
times a day, and the theatre is always crowded. Here the 
Nebraskan can feel the utmost pride in the excellence of his 
great commonwealth, and these excellent features are zealously 
promoted and looked after by Secretary Shedd and his assistants.—Editorial, 
World-Herald, July 25, 1904. 

It is one of the most attractive and popular exhibits of the 
exposition. The moving picture theatre is one of the chief 
show attractions of the exposition and shows a living, breathing, 
active Nebraska. The commission has provided a vast 
amount of Nebraska literature that is being readily tind eagerly 
sought for. It gives a concise and complete history of the 
resources of the state, and with the fine agricultural, dairy, 
horticultural and forage exhibits, which are all attractively 
displayed, Nebraska is receiving the best kind of an advertisement 
that is bound to bring substantial returns. July 4th 
over 3,500 people visited the Nebraska headquarters and all 
seemed interested in the state and its capabilities. — District 
Attorney Baxter, in Omaha Bee, July 13, 1904. 

It would hardly do for a Nebraskan to visit the fair without 
seeing the Nebraska exhibit at the agricultural building. It 
is to be regretted that the appropriation prevented the erection 
of a Nebraska building, as was done by all the other 
states, yet our commission has made a splendid showing, not 
the least of which is the moving pictures of farm scenes, stock 
yards and Ak-Sar-Ben parades. — Omaha Evening News, August 
8, 1904.

moving pictures. These are novel ind attractive. No other </seg>

state has anything like them. The fact that they are free to 
see, every half hour, is appreciated. That gives the Nebraska 
display the largest crowds at all times. 

There are several series of pictures, as have been well known 
in the state. I saw but one. This was views of the Pollard 
farm. The fruit pickers at work, the mowing and threshing 
machines in motion, the teams plowing in the cornfields, the 
views of the plains and the farm yards and all those things 
make genuinely realistic advertising — the best idea for the 
purpose in the entire building. — S. L. Geisthardt, in Lincoln 
Daily Star, September 23, 1904. 

Nebraska has no special building, but it has an interesting 
display, portraying the state's principal resources and activities. 
While the display extends into all of the exposition 
palaces, the best exhibits are in the Palaces of Agriculture 
and Horticulture, and these two exhibits ought to be seen by 
every visitor. An exceptionally interesting; display is the 
biograph demonstration in the Agricultural Palace, illustrating 
life and industry in Nebraska. — Editorial. St. Louis Re 
public, October 18. 1904. 

Nebraska Day at the fair has been celebrated with befitting 
credit to Nebraska. Nebraska, moreover, has always

Nebraska's exhibit has one distinctive feature that has made 
it the center of attraction and drawn crowds day after day. 
They have no state building, the appropriation not justifying 
the expenditure, but a little theatre seating about 300 people, 
in which are displayed moving pictures of Nebraska farm Hfe 
has proven an immense attraction, and the entertainments 
made more interesting by the short explanatory lecture have 
crowded the theatre every half hour of each day. — Kate Thyson

REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE COMMISSION 

Nebraska is just about the liveliest state on the grounds 
here. You buy the daily program and find that the biograph 
views of Nebraska life and farm scenes are given prominent 
mention and detailed description as one of the big attractions. 
The little theatre holds about one hundred and fifty besides 
affording some standing space and the crowd fills it every half 
hour. The total attendance is now about two thousand a day. 
Big clock dials are at all corners of the space announcing the 
next performance, and there are signs a plenty. The moving 
pictures are especially fine, showing plowing, harrowing, cultivating, 
threshing, cattle roundups, horse breaking (broncho 
busting, I suppose is better vernacular), rain storms (for the 
drouth talkers), and so on. Recently added panoramas of the 
country from Lincoln out to Aurora and back by the cut-off 
and main line, about a thousand feet of films, will be a great 
card. There is such a variety that one can go again and again 
and see something new each time. 

Nebraskans and others are attracted to the space by conveniences 
afforded. Ice-water, a scarce thing in the Agricultural 
Palace, is furnished as well as check room, reading room 
and other accommodations. Thus the whole twenty-acre tract 
that is roofed by Professor Taylor's building looks towards 
the Nebraska people as the right sort. As the list of names 
shows, the Nebraska people are finding the spot, and probably 
a good many more do so than if there were a state palace a 
mile and a half away. The exhibit space answers every purpose 
and concentrates Nebraskans better. 

The exhibit itself is fine though not nearly so much stuff 
ig shown as many states have crowded in. The big steer, Challenger, 
occupies the center of the exhibit side of the space and 
in the corners and on the open colonnade are all the principal 
products of the state. 

Just opposite, on block 58, close neighbors to the colossal 
cotton statue of King Cotton, the Nebraska corn pyramid now 
rears its gold-starred blue globe, with surmounting eagle 
still higher than the King's crown.— Ernest R. Holmes of Success 
Pub. Co., New York, in Nebraska State Journal, June 19, 
1904. </seg>
