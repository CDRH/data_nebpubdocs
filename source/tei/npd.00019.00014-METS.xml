IMPROVEMENTS The work of alterations, repair and construction has Keen care - fully carried on. We have spent a busy term in continually im - proving conditions of the "Home." Sanitation has received care - ful, special and proper attention. New cess-pools were dui entire new system of plumbing, bath-room fixtures, toilets and lava - tories installed. An elegant new veranda replaces the old shabby porch, the campus surrounded by a cement curbing hedged with gives to the grounds a neat, orderly and picturesque tone. Minor repairs and improvements have been carried on in every de - partment, substantial storm-sheds built on both north entrances, bath-rooms added to inmates' departments and private lockei accommodation of their personal lielongings supplied for each. The improved condition of buildings and equipment has made it possible for us to do much better work in all departments.
