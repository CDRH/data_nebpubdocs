Army Regulations, will be followed, except that the proceedings will be forwarded to the adjutant general of the State for the action of the governor, instead of to The Adjutant General of the Army for the action of the Secretary of War. If at the time when the law contemplates the commencement of a soldier's period of service in the National Guard Reserve he be of such character M to render his re-enlist or his further active service under current enlistment not in the interest of the State or of the I'nited States, it is the policy of the War Department not to furlough him to the National Guar^ Reserve, but to discontinue his connection with the National Guard through discharge. 77. A soldier sentenced by court-martial to confinement without dis uonorable discharge for a period extending beyond the time at which he would otherwise be furloughed to the National Guard Reserve will be held to serve out his sentence, at the expiration of which he will be furloughed to the National Guard Reserve or discharged, as his case may require. A soldier awaiting trial or seuienee at the time he would otherwise bf furloughed to the National Guard Reserve will not be furloughei: thereto pending the disposition of his case. If sentenced to dishonorable discharge, he will be so discharged upon the date of the receipt of the order publishing the sentence. If the sentence involve neither dishonor - able discharge nor confinement, he will be furloughed to the National Guard Reserve or discharged, as his case may require, on the date of the receipt of the order publishing the result of trial, or as soon thereafter as practicable. If sentenced to confinement without dishonorable dis - chafge, he will be furloughed to the National Guard Reserve or dis - charged, as his case may require, upon the expiration of his term of confinement. The provisions of paragraph 76 of these regulations will be observed in determining whether or not discharge should replace a furlough in such cases. The descriptive card, or discharge certificate, will be delivered to the man on his release from confinement, and not until then. If in con - finement on the date of the furlough or discharge, personal notice there - of will be given to the soldier by an officer, and the fact that such notice was given will be entered on the guard report and the morning report, and will be endorsed upon the descriptive card or discharge cer - tificate. 78. In the case of the death of a reservist a note of this fact will be made on the copy of the reservist's descriptive card by the adjutant general of the State.

Reports have been received, however, from a large number which have been equipped by their counties or by individual effort with uniforms and guns of various makes. A large number of the companies ha\ purchased Winchester rifles, model 1894, 30 calibre. Others are equipped with Springfield 45-70 rifles and a few have secured military rifles of other types. These Home Guard organizations have exerted consider - able moral effort in the communities where they have been raised and in a number of instances have been active in assisting the civil au - thorities in preserving order. Other official reports have been received from a large number of them which indicate that the military training received therein has been of great value to those men drawn from th - company under the operation of the Selective Service Law. One com - pany rporting that of eight men called to mobilization camps from the company six were appointed acting non-commissioned officers within h week. Similar reports have been received from nearly every company in which this matter has been discussed. </seg>
